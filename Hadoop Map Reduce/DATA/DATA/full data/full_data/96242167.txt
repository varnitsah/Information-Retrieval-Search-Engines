made in the cause of education with special regard to its moral and religious aspects that i have been indebted for the opportunity to test by experiment under the most pleasant and favorable circumstances the principles which form the basis of this work to you therefore it is respectfully inscribed as one of the indirect results of your own exertions to promote the best interests of the young  i am very sincerely and respectfully yours                                                             the author     preface   this book is intended to detail in a familiar and practical manner a system of arrangements for the organization and management of a school based on the employment so far as is practicable of moral influences as a means of effecting the objects in view its design is not to bring forward new theories or new plans but to develope and explain and to carry out to their practical applications such principles as among all skilful and experienced teachers are generally admitted and acted upon of course it is not designed for the skilful and the experienced themselves but it is intended to embody what they already know and to present it in a practical form for the use of those who are beginning the work and who wish to avail themselves of the experience which others have acquired  although moral influences are the chief foundations on which the power of the teacher over the minds and hearts of his pupils is according to this treatise to rest still it must not be imagined that the system here recommended is one of persuasion it is a system of authoritysupreme and unlimited authority a point essential in all plans for the supervision of the young but it is authority secured and maintained as far as possible by moral measures there will be no dispute about the propriety of making the most of this class of means whatever difference of opinion there may be on the question whether physical force is necessary at all every one will agree that if ever employed it must be only as a last resort and that no teacher ought to make war upon the body unless it is proved that he cannot conquer through the medium of the mind  in regard to the anecdotes and narratives which are very freely introduced to illustrate principles in this work the writer ought to state that though they are all substantially true that is all except those which are expressly introduced as mere suppositions he has not hesitated to alter very freely for obvious reasons the unimportant circumstances connected with them he has endeavored thus to destroy the personality of the narratives without injuring or altering their moral effect  from the very nature of our employment and of the circumstances under which the preparation for it must be made it is plain that of the many thousands who are in the united states annually entering the work a very large majority must depend for all their knowledge of the art except what they acquire from their own observation and experience on what they can obtain from books it is desirable that the class of works from which such knowledge can be obtained should be increased some excellent and highly useful specimens have already appeared and very many more would be eagerly read by teachers if properly prepared it is essential however that they should be written by experienced teachers who have for some years been actively engaged and specially interested in the workthat they should be written in a very practical and familiar styleand that they should exhibit principles which are unquestionably true and generally admitted by good teachers and not the new theories peculiar to the writer himself in a word utility and practical effect should be the only aim       boston june 20 1833     contents

teaching   there is a most singular contrariety of opinion prevailing in the community in regard to the pleasantness of the business of teaching some teachers go to their daily task merely upon compulsion they regard it as intolerable drudgery others love the work they hover around the schoolroom as long as they can and never cease to think and seldom to talk of their delightful labors  unfortunately there are too many of the former class and the first object which in this work i shall attempt to accomplish is to show my readers especially those who have been accustomed to look upon the business of teaching as a weary and heartless toil how it happens that it is in any case so pleasant the human mind is always essentially the same that which is tedious and joyless to one will be so to another if pursued in the same way and under the same circumstances and teaching if it is pleasant animating and exciting to one may be so to all  i am met however at the outset in my effort to show why it is that teaching is ever a pleasant work by the want of a name for a certain faculty or capacity of the human mind through which most of the enjoyment of teaching finds its avenue every mind is so constituted as to take a positive pleasure in the exercise of ingenuity in adapting means to an end and in watching their operationin accomplishing by the intervention of instruments what we could not accomplish withoutin devising when we see an object to be effected which is too great for our direct and immediate power and setting at work some instrumentality which may be sufficient to accomplish it  it is said that when the steam engine was first put into operation such was the imperfection of the machinery that a boy was necessarily stationed at it to open and shut alternately the cock by which the steam was now admitted and now shut out from the cylinder one such boy after patiently doing his work for many days contrived to connect this stopcock with some of the moving parts of the engine by a wire in such a manner that the engine itself did the work which had been entrusted to him and after seeing that the whole business would go regularly forward he left the wire in charge and went away to play  such is the story now if it is true how much pleasure the boy must have experienced in devising and witnessing the successful operation of his scheme i do not mean the pleasure of relieving himself from a dull and wearisome duty i do not mean the pleasure of anticipated play but i mean the strong interest he must have taken in contriving and executing his plan when wearied out with his dull monotonous work he first noticed those movements of the machinery which he thought adapted to his purpose and the plan flashed into his mind how must his eye have brightened and how quick must the weary listlessness of his employment have vanished while he was maturing his plan and carrying it into executionwhile adjusting his wires fitting them to the exact length and to the exact positionand especially when at last he watches the first successful operation of his contrivancehe must have enjoyed a pleasure which very few even of the joyous sports of childhood could have supplied  it is not however exactly the pleasure of exercising ingenuity in contrivance that i refer to here for the teacher has not after all a great deal of absolute contriving to door rather his principal business is not contriving the greatest and most permanent source of pleasure to the boy in such a case as i have described is his feeling that he is accomplishing a great effect by a slight effort of his own the feeling of power acting through the intervention of instrumentality so as to multiply his power so great would be this satisfaction that he would almost wish to have some other similar work assigned him that he might have another opportunity to contrive some plan for its easy accomplishment  looking at an object to be accomplished or an evil to be remedied then studying its nature and extent and devising and executing some means for effecting the purpose desired is in all cases a source of pleasure especially when by the process we bring to view or to operation new powers or powers heretofore hidden whether they are our own powers or those of objects upon which we act experimenting has a sort of magical fascination for all some do not like the trouble of making preparations but all are eager to see the results contrive a new machine and every body will be interested to witness or to hear of its operationdevelope any heretofore unknown properties of matter or secure some new useful effect from laws which men have not hitherto employed for their purposes and the interest of all around you will be excited to observe your resultsand especially you will yourself take a deep and permanent pleasure in guiding and controlling the power you have thus obtained  this is peculiarly the case with experiments upon mind or experiments for producing effects through the medium of voluntary acts of the human mind so that the contriver must take into consideration the laws of mind in forming his plans to illustrate this by rather a childish case i once knew a boy who was employed by his father to remove all the loose small stones which from the peculiar nature of the ground had accumulated in the road before the house he was to take them up and throw them over into the pasture across the way he soon got tired of picking them up one by one and sat down upon the bank to try to devise some better means of accomplishing his work he at length conceived and adopted the following plan he set up in the pasture a narrow board for a target or as boys would call it a markand then collecting all the boys of the neighborhood he proposed to them an amusement which boys are always ready forfiring at a mark i need not say that the stores of ammunition in the street were soon exhausted the boys working for their leader when they supposed they were only finding amusement for themselves  here now is experimenting upon the mindthe production of useful effect with rapidity and ease by the intervention of proper instrumentalitythe conversion by means of a little knowledge of human nature of that which would have otherwise been dull and fatiguing labor into a most animating sport giving pleasure to twenty instead of tedious labor to one now the contrivance and execution of such plans is a source of positive pleasure it is always pleasant to bring the properties and powers of matter into requisition to promote our designsbut there is a far higher pleasure in controlling and guiding and moulding to our purpose the movements of mind  it is this which gives interest to the plans and operation of human governments they can do little by actual force nearly all the power that is held even by the most despotic executive must be based on an adroit management of the principles of human nature so as to lead men voluntarily to cooperate with the ruler in his plans even an army could not be got into battle in many cases without a most ingenious arrangement by means of which half a dozen men can drive literally drive as many thousands into the very face of danger and death the difficulty of leading men to battle must have been for a long time a very perplexing one to generals it was at last removed by the very simple expedient of creating a greater danger behind than there is before without ingenuity of contrivance like thisturning one principle of human nature against another and making it for the momentary interest of men to act in a given way no government could stand a year  i know of nothing which illustrates more perfectly the way by which a knowledge of human nature is to be turned to account in managing human minds than a plan which was adopted for clearing the galleries of the british house of commons as it was described to me by a gentleman who had visited london it is well known that the gallery is appropriated to spectators and that it sometimes becomes necessary to order them to retire when a vote is to be taken or private business is to be transacted when the officer in attendance was ordered to clear the gallery it was sometimes found to be a very troublesome and slow operation for those who first went out remained obstinately as close to the doors as possible so as to secure the opportunity to come in again first when the doors should be reopened the consequence was there was so great an accumulation around the doors outside that it was almost impossible for the crowd to get out the whole difficulty arose from the eager desire of every one to remain as near as possible to the door through which they were to come back again i have been told that notwithstanding the utmost efforts of the officers fifteen minutes were sometimes consumed in effecting the object when the order was given that the spectators should retire  the whole difficulty was removed by a very simple plan one door only was opened when the crowd was to retire and they were then admitted through the other the consequence was that as soon as the order was given to clear the galleries every one fled as fast as possible through the open door around to the one which was closed so as to be ready to enter first when that in its turn should be opened this was usually in a few minutes as the purpose for which the spectators were ordered to retire was usually simply to allow time for taking a vote here it will be seen that by the operation of a very simple plan the very eagerness of the crowd to get back as soon as possible which had been the sole cause of the difficulty was turned to account most effectually to remove it before they were so eager to return that they crowded around the door so as to prevent others going out but by this simple plan of ejecting them by one door and admitting them by another that very circumstance made them clear the passage at once and hurried every one away into the lobby the moment the command was given  the planner of this scheme must have taken great pleasure in seeing its successful operation though the officer who should go steadily on endeavoring to remove the reluctant throng by dint of mere driving might well have found his task unpleasant but the exercise of ingenuity in studying the nature of the difficulty with which a man has to contend and bringing in some antagonist principle of human nature to remove it or if not an antagonist principle a similar principle operating by a peculiar arrangement of circumstances in an antagonist manner is always pleasant from this source a large share of the enjoyment which men find in the active pursuits of life has its origin  the teacher has the whole field which this subject opens fully before him he has human nature to deal with most directly his whole work is experimenting upon mind and the mind which is before him to be the subject of his operation is exactly in the state to be most easily and pleasantly operated upon the reason now why some teachers find their work delightful and some find it wearisomeness and tedium itself is that some do and some do not take this view of their work one instructer is like the engineboy turning without cessation or change his everlasting stopcock in the same ceaseless mechanical and monotonous routine another is like the little workman in his brighter moments fixing his invention and watching with delight its successful and easy accomplishment of his wishes one is like the officer driving by vociferations and threats and demonstrations of violence the spectators from the galleries the other like the shrewd contriver who converts the very cause which was the whole ground of the difficulty to a most successful and efficient means of its removal  these principles show how teaching may in some cases be a delightful employment while in others its tasteless dulness is interrupted by nothing but its perplexities and cares the schoolroom is in reality a little empire of mind if the one who presides in it sees it in its true light studies the nature and tendency of the minds which he has to control adapts his plans and his measures to the laws of human nature and endeavors to accomplish his purposes for them not by mere labor and force but by ingenuity and enterprise he will take pleasure in administering his little government he will watch with care and interest the operation of the moral and intellectual causes which he sets in operation and find as he accomplishes his various objects with increasing facility and power that he will derive a greater and greater pleasure from his work  now when a teacher thus looks upon his school as a field in which he is to exercise skill and ingenuity and enterprise when he studies the laws of human nature and the character of those minds upon which he has to act when he explores deliberately the nature of the field which he has to cultivate and of the objects which he wishes to accomplish and applies means judiciously and skilfully adapted to the object he must necessarily take a strong interest in his work but when on the other hand he goes to his employment only to perform a certain regular round of daily work undertaking nothing and anticipating nothing but this dull and unchangeable routine and when he looks upon his pupils merely as passive objects of his labors whom he is to treat with simple indifference while they obey his commands and to whom he is only to apply reproaches and punishment when they disobey such a teacher never can take pleasure in the school weariness and dulness must reign in both master and scholars when things as he imagines are going right and mutual anger and crimination when they go wrong  scholars never can be instructed by the power of any dull mechanical routine nor can they be governed by the blind naked strength of the master such means must fail of the accomplishment of the purposes designed and consequently the teacher who tries such a course must have constantly upon his mind the discouraging disheartening burden of unsuccessful and almost useless labor he is continually uneasy dissatisfied and filled with anxious cares and sources of vexation and perplexity continually arise he attempts to remove evils by waging against them a useless and most vexatious warfare of threatening and punishment and he is trying continually to drive when he might know that neither the intellect nor the heart are capable of being driven  i will simply state one case to illustrate what i mean by the difference between blind force and active ingenuity and enterprise in the management of school i once knew the teacher of a school who made it his custom to have writing attended to in the afternoon the boys were accustomed to take their places at the appointed hour and each one would stick up his pen in the front of his desk for the teacher to pass around and mend them the teacher would accordingly pass around mending the pens from desk to desk thus enabling the boys in succession to begin their task of course each boy before he came to his desk was necessarily idle and almost necessarily in mischief day after day the teacher went through this regular routine he sauntered slowly and listlessly through the aisles and among the benches of the room wherever he saw the signal of a pen he paid of course very little attention to the writing now and then reproving with an impatient tone some extraordinary instance of carelessness or leaving his work to suppress some rising disorder ordinarily however he seemed to be lost in vacancy of thoughtdreaming perhaps of other scenes or inwardly repining at the eternal monotony and tedium of a teachers life his boys took no interest in their work and of course made no progress they were sometimes unnecessarily idle and sometimes mischievous but never usefully or pleasantly employed for the whole hour was past before the pens could all be brought down wasted time blotted books and fretted tempers were all the results which the system produced  the same teacher afterwards acted on a very different principle he looked over the field and said to himself what are the objects i wish to accomplish in this writing exercise and how can i best accomplish them i wish to obtain the greatest possible amount of industrious and careful practice in writing the first thing evidently is to save the wasted time he accordingly made preparation for mending the pens at a previous hour so that all should be ready at the appointed time to commence the work together this could be done quite as conveniently when the boys were engaged in studying by requesting them to put out their pens at an appointed and previous time he sat at his table and the pens of a whole bench were brought to him and after being carefully mended were returned to be in readiness for the writing hour thus the first difficulty the loss of time was obviated  i must make them industrious while they write was his next thought after thinking of a variety of methods he determined to try the following he required all to begin together at the top of the page and write the same line in a hand of the same size they were all required to begin together he himself beginning at the same time and writing about as fast as he thought they ought to write in order to secure the highest improvement when he had finished his line he ascertained how many had preceded him and how many were behind he requested the first to write slower and the others faster and by this means after a few trials he secured uniform regular systematic and industrious employment throughout the school probably there were at first difficulties in the operation of the plan which he had to devise ways and means to surmount but what i mean to present particularly to the reader is that he was interested in his experiments while sitting in his desk giving his command to begin line after line and noticing the unbroken silence and attention and interest which prevailed for each boy was interested to see how nearly with the master he could finish his work while presiding over such a scene he must have been interested he must have been pleased with the exercise of his almost military command and to witness how effectually order and industry and excited and pleased attention had taken the place of listless idleness and mutual dissatisfaction  after a few days he appointed one of the older and more judicious scholars to give the word for beginning and ending the lines and he sat surveying the scene or walking from desk to desk noticing faults and considering what plans he could form for securing more and more fully the end he had in view he found that the great object of interest and attention among the boys was to come out right and that less pains were taken with the formation of the letters than there ought to be to secure the most rapid improvement  but how shall he secure greater pains by stern commands and threats by going from desk to desk scolding one rapping the knuckles of another and holding up to ridicule a third making examples of such individuals as may chance to attract his special attention no he has learned that he is operating upon a little empire of mind and that he is not to endeavor to drive them as a man drives a herd by mere peremptory command or half angry blows he must study the nature of the effect he is to produce and of the materials upon which he is to work and adopt after mature deliberation a plan to accomplish his purpose founded upon the principles which ought always to regulate the action of mind upon mind and adapted to produce the intellectual effect which he wishes to accomplish  in the case supposed the teacher concluded to appeal to emulation while i describe the measure he adopted let it be remembered that i am now only approving of the resort to ingenuity and invention and the employment of moral and intellectual means for the accomplishment of his purposes and not of the measures themselves i do not think the plan i am going to describe a wise one but i do think that the teacher while trying it must have been interested in his intellectual experiment his business while pursued in such a way could not have been a mere dull and uninteresting routine  he purchased for three cents apiece two long leadpencils an article of great value in the opinion of the boys of country schools and he offered them as prizes to the boy who would write most carefully not to the one who should write best but to the one whose book should exhibit most appearance of effort and care for a week after announcing his plan he watched with strong interest its operation he walked round the room while the writing was in progress to observe the effect of his measure he did not reprove those who were writing carelessly he simply noticed who and how many they were he did not commend those who were evidently making effort he noticed who and how many they were that he might understand how far and upon what sort of minds his experiment was successful and where it failed he was taking a lesson in human naturehuman nature as it exhibits itself in boys and was preparing to operate more and more powerfully by future plans  the lesson which he learned by the experiment was this that one or two prizes will not influence the majority of a large school a few seemed to think that the pencils were possibly within their reach and they made vigorous efforts to secure them but the rest wrote on as before thinking it certain that they should be surpassed by the others they gave up the contest at once in despair  the obvious remedy was to multiply his prizes so as to bring one within the reach of all he reflected too that the real prize in such a case is not the value of the pencil but the honor of the victory and as the honor of the victory might as well be coupled with an object of less as well as with one of greater value the next week he divided his two pencils into quarters and offered to his pupils eight prizes instead of two he offered one to every five scholars as they sat on their benches and every boy then saw that a reward would certainly come within five of him his chance accordingly instead of being one in twenty became one in five  now is it possible for a teacher after having philosophized upon the nature of the minds upon which he is operating and surveyed the field and ingeniously formed a plan which plan he hopes will through his own intrinsic power produce certain effectsis it possible for him when he comes for the first day to witness its operations to come without feeling a strong interest in the result it is impossible after having formed such a plan and made such arrangements he will look forward almost with impatience to the next writing hour he wishes to see whether he has estimated the mental capacities and tendencies of his little community aright and when the time comes and he surveys the scene and observes the operation of his measure and sees many more are reached by it than were influenced before he feels a strong gratification and it is a gratification which is founded upon the noblest principles of our nature he is tracing on a most interesting field the operation of cause and effect from being the mere drudge who drives without intellect or thought a score or two of boys to their daily tasks he rises to the rank of an intellectual philosopher exploring the laws and successfully controlling the tendencies of mind  it will be observed too that all the time this teacher was performing these experiments and watching with intense interest the results his pupils were going on undisturbed in their pursuits the exercises in writing were not interrupted or deranged this is a point of fundamental importance for if what i should say on the subject of exercising ingenuity and contrivance in teaching should be the means in any case of leading a teacher to break in upon the regular duties of his school and destroy the steady uniformity with which the great objects of such an institution should be pursued my remarks had better never have been written there may be variety in methods and plan but through all this variety the school and every individual pupil of it must go steadily forward in the acquisition of that knowledge which is of greatest importance in the business of future life in other words the variations and changes admitted by the teacher ought to be mainly confined to the modes of accomplishing those permanent objects to which all the exercises and arrangements of the school ought steadily to aim more on this subject however in another chapter  i will mention one other circumstance which will help to explain the difference in interest and pleasure with which teachers engage in their work i mean the different views they take of the offences of their pupils one class of teachers seem never to make it a part of their calculation that their pupils will do wrong and when any misconduct occurs they are disconcerted and irritated and look and act as if some unexpected occurrence had broken in upon their plans others understand and consider all this beforehand they seem to think a little before they go into their school what sort of beings boys and girls are and any ordinary case of youthful delinquency or dulness does not surprise them i do not mean that they treat such cases with indifference or neglect but that they expect them and are prepared for them such a teacher knows that boys and girls are the materials he has to work upon and he takes care to make himself acquainted with these materials just as they are the other class however do not seem to know at all what sort of beings they have to deal with or if they know do not consider they expect from them what is not to be obtained and then are disappointed and vexed at the failure it is as if a carpenter should attempt to support an entablature by pillars of wood too small and weak for the weight and then go on from week to week suffering anxiety and irritation as he sees them swelling and splitting under the burden and finding fault with the wood instead of taking it to himself  it is of course one essential part of a mans duty in engaging in any undertaking whether it will lead him to act upon matter or upon mind to become first well acquainted with the circumstances of the casethe materials he is to act upon and the means which he may reasonably expect to have at his command if he underrates his difficulties or overrates the power of his means of overcoming them it is his mistake a mistake for which he is fully responsible whatever may be the nature of the effect which he aims at accomplishing he ought fully to understand it and to appreciate justly the difficulties which lie in the way  teachers however very often overlook this a man comes home from his school at night perplexed and irritated by the petty misconduct which he has witnessed and been trying to check he does not however look forward and try to prevent the occasions of it adapting his measures to the nature of the material upon which he has to operate but he stands like the carpenter at his columns making himself miserable in looking at it after it occurs and wondering what to do  sir we might say to him what is the matter  why i have such boys i can do nothing with them were it not for their misconduct i might have a very good school  were it not for the boys why is there any peculiar depravity in them which you could not have foreseen  no i suppose they are pretty much like all other boys he replies despairingly they are all hairbrained and unmanageable the plans i have formed for my school would be excellent if my boys would only behave properly  excellent plans might we not reply and yet not adapted to the materials upon which they are to operate no it is your business to know what sort of beings boys are and to make your calculations accordingly                                       two teachers may therefore manage their schools in totally different ways so that one of them may necessarily find the business a dull mechanical routine except as it is occasionally varied by perplexity and irritation and the other a prosperous and happy employment the one goes on mechanically the same and depends for his power on violence or on threats and demonstrations of violence the other brings all his ingenuity and enterprise into the field to accomplish a steady purpose by means ever varying and depends for his power on his knowledge of human nature and on the adroit adaptation of plans to her fixed and uniform tendencies  i am very sorry however to be obliged to say that probably the latter class of teachers are decidedly in the minority to practice the art in such a way as to make it an agreeable employment is difficult and it requires much knowledge of human nature much attention and skill and after all there are some circumstances necessarily attending the work which constitute a heavy drawback on the pleasures which it might otherwise afford the almost universal impression that the business of teaching is attended with peculiar trials and difficulties proves this  there must be some cause for an impression so general it is not right to call it a prejudice for although a single individual may conceive a prejudice whole communities very seldom do unless in some case which is presented at once to the whole so that looking at it through a common medium all judge wrong together but the general opinion in regard to teaching is composed of a vast number of separate and independent judgments and there must be some good ground for the universal result  it is best therefore if there are any real and peculiar sources of trial and difficulty in this pursuit that they should be distinctly known and acknowledged at the outset count the cost before going to war it is even better policy to overrate than to underrate it let us see then what the real difficulties of teaching are  it is not however as is generally supposed the confinement a teacher is confined it is true but not more than men of other professions and employments not more than a merchant and probably not as much a physician is confined in a different way but more closely than a teacher he can never leave home he knows generally no vacation and nothing but accidental rest  the lawyer is confined as much it is true there are not throughout the year exact hours which he must keep but considering the imperious demands of his business his personal liberty is probably restrained as much by it as that of the teacher so with all the other professions although the nature of the confinement may vary it amounts to about the same in all on the other hand the teacher enjoys in reference to this subject of confinement an advantage which scarcely any other class of men does or can enjoy i mean vacations a man in any other business may force himself away from it for a time but the cares and anxieties of his business will follow him wherever he goes and it seems to be reserved for the teacher to enjoy alone the periodical luxury of a real and entire release from business and care on the whole as to confinement it seems to me that the teacher has but little ground of complaint  there are however some real and serious difficulties which always have and it is to be feared always will cluster around this employment and which must for a long time at least lead most men to desire some other employment for the business of life there may perhaps be some who by their peculiar skill can overcome or avoid them and perhaps the science may at some future day be so far improved that all may avoid them as i describe them however now most of the teachers into whose hands this treatise may fall will probably find that their own experience corresponds in this respect with mine  1 the first great difficulty which the teacher feels is a sort of moral responsibility for the conduct of others if his pupils do wrong he feels almost personal responsibility for it as he walks out some afternoon weary with his labors and endeavoring to forget for a little time all his cares he comes upon a group of boys in rude and noisy quarrels or engaged in mischief of some sort and his heart sinks within him it is hard enough for any one to witness their bad conduct with a spirit unruffled and undisturbed but for their teacher it is perhaps impossible he feels responsible in fact he is responsible if his scholars are disorderly or negligent or idle or quarrelsome he feels condemned himself almost as if he were himself the actual transgressor  this difficulty is in a great degree peculiar to a teacher a physician is called upon to prescribe for a patient he examines the case and writes his prescription when this is done his duty is ended and whether the patient obeys the prescription and lives or neglects it and dies the physician feels exonerated from all responsibility he may and in some cases does feel anxious concern and may regret the infatuation by which in some unhappy case a valuable life may be hazarded or destroyed but he feels no moral responsibility for anothers guilt  it is so with all the other employments in life they do indeed often bring men into collision with other men but though sometimes vexed and irritated by the conduct of a neighbor a client or a patient they feel not half the bitterness of the solicitude and anxiety which come to the teacher through the criminality of his pupil in ordinary cases he not only feels responsible for efforts but for their results and when notwithstanding all his efforts his pupils will do wrong his spirit sinks with an intensity of anxious despondency which none but a teacher can understand  this feeling of almost moral accountability for the guilt of other persons is a continual burden the teacher in the presence of the pupil never is free from it it links him to them by a bond which perhaps he ought not to sunder and which he cannot sunder if he would and sometimes when those committed to his charge are idle or faithless or unprincipled it wears away his spirits and his health together i think there is nothing analogous to this moral connexion between teacher and pupil unless it be in the case of a parent and child and here on account of the comparative smallness of the number under the parents care the evil is so much diminished that it is easily borne  2 the second great difficulty of the teachers employments is the immense multiplicity of the objects of his attention and care during the time he is employed in his business his scholars are individuals and notwithstanding all that the most systematic can do in the way of classification they must be attended to in a great measure as individuals a merchant keeps his commodities together and looks upon a cargo composed of ten thousand articles and worth 100000 dollars as one he speaks of it as one and there is in many cases no more perplexity in planning its destination than if it were a single box of raisins a lawyer may have a great many important cases but he has only one at a time that is he attends to but one at a time that one may be intricateinvolving many facts and requiring to be examined in many aspects and relations but he looks at but few of these facts and regards but few of these relations at a time the points which demand his attention come one after another in regular succession his mind may thus be kept calm he avoids confusion and perplexity but no skill or classification will turn the poor teachers hundred scholars into one or enable him except to a very limited extent and for a very limited purpose to regard them as one he has a distinct and in many respects a different work to do for every one of the crowd before him difficulties must be explained in detail questions must be answered one by one and each scholars own conduct and character must be considered by itself his work is thus made up of a thousand minute particulars which are all crowding upon his attention at once and which he cannot group together or combine or simplify he must by some means or other attend to them in all their distracting individuality and in a large and complicated school the endless multiplicity and variety of objects of attention and care impose a task under which few intellects can long stand  i have said that this endless multiplicity and variety cannot be reduced and simplified by classification i mean of course that this can be done only to a very limited extent compared with what may be effected in the other pursuits of mankind were it not for the art of classification and system no school could have more than ten scholars as i intend hereafter to show the great reliance of the teacher is upon this art to reduce to some tolerable order what would otherwise be the inextricable confusion of his business he must be systematic he must classify and arrange but after he has done all that he can he must still expect that his daily business will continue to consist of a vast multitude of minute particulars from one to another of which the mind must turn with a rapidity which few of the other employments of life ever demand  these are the essential sources of difficulty with which the teacher has to contend but as i shall endeavor to show in succeeding chapters though they cannot be entirely removed they can be so far mitigated by the appropriate means as to render the employment a happy one i have thought it best however as this work will doubtless be read by many who when they read it are yet to begin their labors to describe frankly and fully to them the difficulties which beset the path they are about to enter the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way it is often wisdom to understand it beforehand     chapter ii  general arrangements   the distraction and perplexity of the teachers life are as was explained in the last chapter almost proverbial there are other pressing and exhausting pursuits which wear away the spirit by the ceaseless care which they impose or perplex and bewilder the intellect by the multiplicity and intricacy of their details but the business of teaching by a preeminence not very enviable stands almost by common consent at the head of the catalogue  i have already alluded to this subject in the preceding chapter and probably the greater majority of actual teachers will admit the truth of the view there presented some will however doubtless say that they do not find the business of teaching so perplexing and exhausting an employment they take things calmly they do one thing at a time and that without useless solicitude and anxiety so that teaching with them though it has indeed its solicitudes and cares as every other responsible employment must necessarily have is after all a calm and quiet pursuit which they follow from month to month and from year to year without any extraordinary agitations or any unusual burdens of anxiety and care  there are indeed such cases but they are exceptions and unquestionably an immense majority especially of those who are beginners in the work find it such as i have described i think it need not be so or rather i think the evil may be avoided to a very great degree in this chapter i shall endeavor to show how order may be produced out of that almost inextricable mass of confusion into which so many teachers on commencing their labors find themselves plunged  the objects then to be aimed at in the general arrangements of schools are twofold  1 that the teacher may be left uninterrupted to attend to one thing at a time  2 that the individual scholars may have constant employment and such an amount and such kinds of study as shall be suited to the circumstances and capacities of each  i shall examine each in their order  1 the following are the principal things which in a vast number of schools are all the time pressing upon the teacher or rather they are the things which must every where press upon the teacher except so far as by the skill of his arrangements he contrives to remove them  1 giving leave to whisper or to leave seats  2 mending pens  3 answering questions in regard to studies  4 hearing recitations  5 watching the behavior of the scholars  6 administering reproof and punishment for offences as they occur  a pretty large number of objects of attention and care one would say to be pressing upon the mind of the teacher at one and the same timeand all the time too hundreds and hundreds of teachers in every part of our country there is no doubt have all these crowding upon them from morning to night with no cessation except perhaps some accidental and momentary respite during the winter months while the principal common schools in our country are in operation it is sad to reflect how many teachers come home every evening with bewildered and aching heads having been vainly trying all the day to do six things at a time while he who made the human mind has determined that it shall do but one how many become discouraged and disheartened by what they consider the unavoidable trials of a teachers life and give up in despair just because their faculties will not sustain a sixfold task there are multitudes who in early life attempted teaching and after having been worried almost to distraction by the simultaneous pressure of these multifarious cares gave up the employment in disgust and forever afterwards wonder how any body can like teaching i know multitudes of persons to whom the above description will exactly apply  i once heard a teacher who had been very successful even in large schools say that he could hear two classes recite mend pens and watch his school all at the same time and that without any distraction of mind or any unusual fatigue of course the recitations in such a case must be memoriter there are very few minds however which can thus perform triple or quadruple work and probably none which can safely be tasked so severely for my part i can do but one thing at a time and i have no question that the true policy for all is to learn not to do every thing at once but so to classify and arrange their work that they shall have but one thing to do instead of vainly attempting to attend simultaneously to a dozen things they should so plan their work that only one will demand attention  let us then examine the various particulars above mentioned in succession and see how each can be disposed of so as not to be a constant source of interruption and derangement  1 whispering and leaving seats in regard to this subject there are very different methods now in practice in different schools in some especially in very small schools the teacher allows the pupils to act according to their own discretion they whisper and leave their seats whenever they think it necessary this plan may possibly be admissible in a very small school that is in one of ten or twelve pupils i am convinced however that it is very bad here no vigilant watch which it is possible for any teacher to exert will prevent a vast amount of mere talk entirely foreign to the business of the school i tried this plan very thoroughly with high ideas of the dependence which might be placed upon conscience and a sense of duty if these principles are properly brought out to action in an effort to sustain the system i was told by distinguished teachers that it would not be found to answer but predictions of failure in such cases only prompt to greater exertions and i persevered but i was forced at last to give up the point and adopt another plan my pupils would make resolutions enough they understood their duty well enough they were allowed to leave their seats and whisper to their companions whenever in their honest judgment it was necessary for the prosecution of their studies i knew that it sometimes would be necessary and i was desirous to adopt this plan to save myself the constant interruption of hearing and replying to requests but it would not do whenever from time to time i called them to account i found that a large majority according to their own confession were in the habit of holding daily and deliberate communication with each other on subjects entirely foreign to the business of the school a more experienced teacher would have predicted this result but i had very high ideas of the power of cultivated conscience and in fact still have but then like most other persons who become possessed of a good idea i could not be satisfied without carrying it to an extreme  still it is necessary to give pupils sometimes the opportunity to whisper and leave seats cases occur where this is unavoidable it cannot therefore be forbidden altogether how then you will ask can the teacher regulate this practice so as to prevent the evils which will otherwise flow from it without being continually interrupted by the request for permission  by a very simple method appropriate particular times at which all this business is to be done and forbid it altogether at every other time it is well on other accounts to give the pupils of a school a little respite at least every hour and if this is done an intermission of study for two minutes each time will be sufficient during this time general permission should be given to speak or to leave seats provided they do nothing at such a time to disturb the studies of others this has been my plan for two or three years and no arrangement which i have ever made has operated for so long a time so uninterruptedly and so entirely to my satisfaction as this it of course will require some little time and no little firmness to establish the new order of things where a school has been accustomed to another course but where this is once done i know no one plan so simple and so easily put into execution which will do so much towards relieving the teacher of the distraction and perplexity of his pursuits  in making the change however it is of fundamental importance that the pupils should themselves be interested in it their cooperation or rather the cooperation of the majority which it is very easy to obtain is absolutely essential to success i say this is very easily obtained let us suppose that some teacher who has been accustomed to require his pupils to ask and obtain permission every time they wish to speak to a companion is induced by these remarks to introduce this plan he says accordingly to his school  you know that you are now accustomed to ask me whenever you wish to obtain permission to whisper to a companion or to leave your seats now i have been thinking of a plan which will be better for both you and me by our present plan you are sometimes obliged to wait before i can attend to your request sometimes i think it is unnecessary and deny you when perhaps i was mistaken and it was really necessary at other times i think it very probable that when it is quite desirable for you to leave your seat you do not ask because you think you may not obtain permission and you do not wish to ask and be refused do you or not experience these inconveniences from our present plans  the boys would undoubtedly answer in the affirmative  i experience great inconvenience too i am very frequently interrupted when busily engaged and it also occupies a great portion of my time and attention it requires as much mental effort to consider and decide sometimes whether i ought to allow a pupil to leave his seat as it would to decide a much more important question therefore i do not like our plan and i have another to propose  the boys are all attention to know what the new plan is it will always be of great advantage to the school for the teacher to propose his new plans from time to time to his pupils in such a way as this it interests them in the improvement of the school exercises their judgment establishes a common feeling between teacher and pupil and in many other ways will assist very much in promoting the welfare of the school  my plan continues the teacher is thisto allow you all besides the recess a short time two or three minutes perhaps every hour or every half hour according to the character of the school the age of the pupils or other circumstances to be judged of by the teacher during which you may all whisper or leave your seats without asking permission  instead of deciding the question of the frequency of this general permission the teacher may if he pleases leave it to the pupils to decide it is often useful to leave the decision of such a question to them on this subject however i shall speak in another place it is only necessary here to say that this point may be safely left to them since the time is so small which is to be thus appropriated even if they vote to have the general permission to whisper every half hour it will make but eight minutes in the forenoon there being six half hours in the forenoon and one of them ending at the close of school and another at the recess only four of these rests as a military man would call them would be necessary and four of two minutes each would make eight minutes if the teacher thinks that evil would result from the interruption of the studies so often he may offer the pupils three minutes rest every hour instead of two minutes every half hour and let them take their choice or he may decide the case altogether himself  such a change from particular permission on individual requests to general permission at stated times would unquestionably be popular in every school if the teacher managed the business properly and by presenting it as an object of common interestan arrangement proposed for the common convenience of teacher and pupils the latter may be much interested in carrying the plan into effect we must not rely however entirely upon their interest in it all that we can expect from such an effort to interest them as i have described and recommended is to get a majority on our side so that we may have only a small minority to deal with by other measures still we must calculate on having this minority and form our plans accordingly or we shall be sadly disappointed i shall however in another place speak of this principle of interesting the pupils in our plans for the purpose of securing a majority in our favor and explain the methods by which the minority is then to be governed i only mean here to say that by such means the teacher may easily interest a large proportion of the scholars in carrying his plans into effect and that he must expect to be prepared with other measures for those who will not be governed by these  you cannot reasonably expect however that immediately after having explained your plan it will at once go into full and complete operation even those who are firmly determined to keep the rule will from inadvertence for a day or two make communication with each other they must be trained not by threatening and punishment but by your goodhumored assistance to their new duties when i first adopted this plan in my school something like the following proceedings took place  do you suppose that you will perfectly keep this rule from this time  no sir was the answer  i suppose you will not some i am afraid may not really be determined to keep it and others will forget now i wish every one would keep an exact account to day of all the instances of speaking and leaving seats out of the regular times and be prepared to report them at the close of the school of course i shall have no punishment for it but it will very much assist you to watch yourselves if you expect to make a report at the end of the forenoon do you like this plan  yes sir was the answer and all seemed to enter into it with spirit  in order to mark more definitely the times for communication i wrote in large letters on a piece of pasteboard study hours and making a hole over the centre of it i hung it upon a nail over my desk at the close of each half hour a little bell was to be struck and this card was to be taken down when it was up they were on no occasion whatever except some such extraordinary occurrence as sickness or my sending one of them on a message to another or something clearly out of the common course to speak to each other but were to wait whatever they wanted until the study card as they called it was taken down  suppose now said i that a young lady has come into school and has accidentally left her book in the entrythe book from which she is to study during the first half hour of the school she sits near the door and she might in a moment slip out and obtain it if she does not she must spend the half hour in idleness and be unprepared in her lesson what is it her duty to do  to go not to go answered the scholars simultaneously  it would be her duty not to go but i suppose it will be very difficult for me to convince you of it  the reason is this i continued if the one case i have supposed were the only one which would be likely to occur it would undoubtedly be better for her to go but if it is understood that in such cases the rule may be dispensed with there will be many others where it will be equally necessary to lay it aside scholars will differ in regard to the degree of inconvenience which they must submit to rather than break the rule they will gradually do it on slighter and slighter occasions until at last the rule will be disregarded entirely we must therefore draw a precise line and individuals must submit to a little inconvenience sometimes to promote the general good  at the close of the day i requested all in the school to rise while they were standing i called them to account in the following manner  now it is very probable that some have from inadvertence or from design omitted to keep an account of the number of transgressions of the rule which they have committed during the day others perhaps do not wish to make a report of themselves now as this is a common and voluntary effort i wish to have none render assistance who do not of their own accord desire to do so all those therefore who are not able to make a report from not having been correct in keeping it and all those who are unwilling to report themselves may sit  a very small number hesitatingly took their seats  i am afraid that all do not sit who really wish not to report themselves now i am honest in saying i wish you to do just as you please if a great majority of the school really wish to assist me in accomplishing the object why of course i am glad still i shall not call upon any for such assistance unless it is freely and voluntarily rendered  one or two more took their seats while these things were saying among such there would generally be some who would refuse to have any thing to do with the measure just from a desire to thwart and impede the plans of the teacher if so it is best to take no notice of them if the teacher can contrive to obtain a great majority upon his side so as to let them see that any opposition which they can raise is of no consequence and is not even noticed they will soon be ashamed of it  the reports then of those who remained standing were called for first those who had whispered only once were requested to sit then those who had whispered more than once and less than five times c c until at last all were down in such a case the pupils might if thought expedient again be requested to rise for the purpose of asking some other questions with reference to ascertaining whether they had spoken most in the former or latter part of the forenoon the number who had spoken inadvertently and the number who had done it by design might be ascertained these inquiries accustom the pupils to render honest and faithful accounts of themselves they become by such means familiarized to the practice and by means of it the teacher can many times receive most important assistance  all however should be done in a pleasant tone and with a pleasant and cheerful air it should be considered by the pupils not a reluctant confession of guilt for which they are to be rebuked or punished but the voluntary and free report of the result of an experiment in which all are interested  some will have been dishonest in their reports to diminish the number of these the teacher may say after the report is concluded  we will drop the subject here today tomorrow we will make another effort when we shall be more successful i have taken your reports as you have offered them without any inquiry because i had no doubt that a great majority of this school would be honest at all hazards they would not i am confident make a false report even if by a true one they were to bring upon themselves punishment so that i think i may have confidence that nearly all these reports have been faithful still it is very probable that among so large a number some may have made a report which they are now aware was not perfectly fair and honest i do not wish to know who they are if there are any such cases i only wish to say to the rest how much pleasanter it is for you that you have been honest and open the business is now all ended you have done your duty and though you reported a little larger number than you would if you had been disposed to conceal yet you go away from school with a quiet conscience on the other hand how miserable must any boy feel if he has any nobleness of mind whatever to go away from school today thinking that he has not been honest that he has been trying to conceal his faults and thus to obtain a credit which he did not justly deserve always be honest let the consequence be what it may  the reader will understand that the object of such measures is simply to secure as large a majority as possible to make voluntary efforts to observe the rule i do not expect that by such measures universal obedience can be exacted the teacher must follow up the plan after a few days by other measures for those who will not yield to such inducements as these upon this subject however i shall speak more particularly at a future time  in my own school it required two or three weeks to exclude whispering and communication by signs the period necessary to effect the revolution will be longer or shorter according to the circumstances of the school and the dexterity of the teacher and after all the teacher must not hope entirely to exclude it approximation to excellence is all that we can expect for unprincipled and deceiving characters will perhaps always be found and no system whatever can prevent their existence proper treatment may indeed be the means of their reformation but before this process has arrived at a successful result others similar in character will have entered so that the teacher can never expect perfection in the operation of any of his plans  i found so much relief from the change which this plan introduced that i soon took measures for rendering it permanent and though i am not much in favor of efforts to bring all teachers and all schools to the same plans this principle of whispering at limited and prescribed times alone seems to me well suited to universal adoption  the following simple apparatus has been used in several schools where this principle has been adopted a drawing and description of it is inserted here as by this means some teachers who may like to try the course here recommended may be saved the time and trouble of contriving something of the kind themselves  the figure a a a a is a board about 18 inches by 12 to which the parts are to be attached and which is to be nailed against the wall at the height of about 8 feet b c d c is a plate of tin or brass 8 inches by 12 of the form represented in the drawing at c c the lower extremities of the parts at the sides the metal is bent round so as to clasp a wire which runs from c to c the ends of which wire are bent at right angles and run into the board the plate will consequently turn on this axis as on a hinge at the top of the plate d a small projection of the tin turns inwards and to this one end of the cord m m is attached this cord passes back from d to a small pulley at the upper part of the board and at the tower end of it a tassel loaded so as to be an exact counterpoise to the card is attached by raising the tassel the plate will of course fall over forward till it is stopped by the part b striking the board when it will be in a horizontal position on the other hand by pulling down the tassel the plate will be raised and drawn upwards against the board so as to present its convex surface with the words study hours upon it distinctly to the school in the drawing it is represented in an inclined position being not quite drawn up that the parts might more easily be seen at d there is a small projection of the tin upwards which touches the clapper of the bell suspended above every time the plate passes up or down and thus give notice of its motions  illustration  of course the construction may be varied very much and it may be more or less expensive according to the wishes of the teacher in the first apparatus of this kind which i used the plate was simply a card of pasteboard from which the machine took its name this was cut out with a penknife and after being covered with marble paper a strip of white paper was pasted along the middle with the inscription upon it the wire c c and a similar one at the top of the plate were passed through a perforation in the pasteboard and then passed into the board instead of a pulley the cord which was a piece of twine was passed through a little staple made of wire and driven into the board the whole was made in one or two recesses in school with such tools and materials as i could then command the bell was a common table bell with a wire passing through the handle the whole was attached to such a piece of pine board as i could get on the occasion this coarse contrivance was for more than a year the grand regulator of all the movements of the school  i afterwards had one made in a better manner the plate is of tin gilded the border and the letters of the inscription being black a parlor bell rope passes over a brass pulley and then runs downward in a groove made in the mahogany board to which the card is attached  a little reflection will however show the teacher that the form and construction of the apparatus for marking the times of study and of rest may be greatly varied the chief point is simply to secure the principle of whispering at definite and limited times and at those alone if such an arrangement is adopted and carried faithfully into effect it will be found to relieve the teacher of more than half of the confusion and perplexity which would otherwise be his hourly lot i have detailed thus particularly the method to be pursued in carrying this principle into effect because i am convinced of its importance and the incalculable assistance which such an arrangement will afford to the teacher in all his plans of course i would not be understood to recommend its adoption in those cases where teachers from their own experience have devised and adopted other plans which accomplish as effectually the same purpose all that i mean is to insist upon the absolute necessity of some plan to remove this very common source of interruption and confusion and i recommend this mode where a better is not known  2 the second of the sources of interruption as i have enumerated them is mending pens this business ought if possible to have a specific time assigned to it scholars are in general far too particular in regard to their pens the teacher ought to explain to them that in the transaction of the ordinary business of life they cannot always have exactly such a pen as they would like they must learn to write with various kinds of pens and when furnished with one that the teacher himself would consider suitable to write a letter to a friend with he must be content they should understand that the form of the letters is what is important in learning to write not the smoothness and clearness of the hair lines and that though writing looks better when executed with a perfect pen a person may learn to write nearly as well with one which is not absolutely perfect so certain is this though often overlooked that a person would perhaps learn faster with chalk upon a black board than with the best goosequill ever sharpened  i do not make these remarks to show that it is of no consequence whether scholars have good or bad pens but only that this subject deserves very much less of the time and attention of the teacher than it usually receives when the scholars are allowed as they very generally are to come when they please to present their pens some four five or six times in a daybreaking in upon any businessinterrupting any classesperplexing and embarrassing the teacher however he may be employedthere is a very serious obstruction to the progress of the scholars which is by no means repaid by the improvement in this branch  there are several ways by which this evil may be remedied or at least be very effectually curtailed some teachers take their pens with them and mend them in the evening at home for various reasons this cannot always be practised there may however be a time set apart in the school specially for this purpose but the best plan is for the teacher not to mend the pens himself  let him choose from among the older and more intelligent of his scholars four or five whom he will teach they will be very glad to learn and to mend every day twentyfive or fifty pens each very little ingenuity will be necessary to devise some plan by which the scholars may be apportioned among these so that each shall supply a given number and the teacher be relieved entirely  3 answering questions about studies a teacher who does not adopt some system in regard to this subject will be always at the mercy of his scholars one boy will want to know how to parse a word another where the lesson is another to have a sum explained and a fourth will wish to show his work to see if it is right the teacher does not like to discourage such inquiries each one as it comes up seems necessary each one too is answered in a moment but the endless number and the continual repetition of them consume his time and exhaust his patience  there is another view of the subject which ought to be taken perhaps it would not be far from the truth to estimate the average number of scholars in the schools in our country at fifty at any rate this will be near enough for our present purpose there are three hours in each session making one hundred and eighty minutes which divided among fifty give about three minutes and a half to each individual if the reader has in his own school a greater or a less number he can easily correct the above so as to adapt it to his own case and ascertain the portion which may justly be appropriated to each pupil it will probably vary from two to four minutes now a period of four minutes slips away very fast while a man is looking over perplexing problems and if he exceeds that time at all he is doing injustice to his other pupils i do not mean that a man is to confine himself rigidly to the principle suggested by this calculation of cautiously appropriating no more time to any one of his pupils than such a calculation would assign to each but simply that this is a point which should be kept in view and have a very strong influence in deciding how far it is right to devote attention exclusively to individuals it seems to me that it shows very clearly that one ought to teach his pupils as much as possible in masses and as little as possible by private attention to individual cases  the following directions will help the teacher to carry these principles into effect when you assign a lesson glance over it yourself and consider what difficulties are likely to arise you know the progress which your pupils have made and can easily anticipate their difficulties tell them all together in the class what their difficulties will be and how they may surmount them give them directions how they are to act in the emergencies which will be likely to occur this simple step will remove a vast number of the questions which would otherwise become occasions for interrupting you with regard to other difficulties which cannot be foreseen and guarded against tell them to bring them to the class the next recitation half a dozen might and very probably would meet with the same difficulty if they bring it to you one by one you have to answer it over and over again whereas when it is brought to the class one explanation answers for all  as to all questions about the lessonwhere it is and what it is and how long it isnever answer them require each pupil to remember for himself and if he was absent when the lesson was assigned let him ask his class mate in a recess  you may refuse to give particular individuals the private assistance they ask for in such a way as to discourage and irritate them but it is not necessary it can be done in such a manner that the pupil will see the propriety of it and acquiesce pleasantly in it  a child comes to you for example and says  will you tell me sir where the next lesson is  were you not in the class at the time  yes sir but i have forgotten  well i have forgotten too i have a great many classes to hear and of course a great many lessons to assign and i never remember them it is not necessary far me to remember  may i speak to one of the class to ask about it  you cannot speak you know till the study card is down you may then  but i want to get my lesson now  i dont know what you will do then i am sorry you dont remember  besides continues the teacher looking pleasantly however while he says it if i knew i think i ought not to tell you  why sir  because you know i have said i wish the scholars to remember where the lessons are and not come to me you know it would be very unwise for me after assigning a lesson in the class to spend my time in telling the individuals over again here now if i should tell you i should have to tell others and thus adopt a practice which i have condemned  take another case you assign to a class of little girls a subject of composition requesting them to copy their writing upon a sheet of paper leaving a margin an inch wide at the top and one of half an inch at the sides and bottom the class take their seats and after a short time one of them comes to you saying she does not know how long an inch is  dont you know any thing about it  no sir not much  should you think that is more or less than an inch pointing to a space on a piece of paper much too large  more  then you know something about it now i did not tell you to make the margins exactly an inch and half an inch but only as near as you could tell  would that be about right asks the girl showing a distance  i must not tell you because you know i never in such cases help individuals if that is as near as you can get it you may make it so  it may be well after assigning a lesson to a class to say that all those who do not distinctly understand what they have to do may remain after the class have taken their seats and ask the task may then be distinctly assigned again and the difficulties so far as they can be foreseen explained  by such means these sources of interruption and difficulty may like the others be almost entirely removed perhaps not altogether for many cases may occur where the teacher may choose to give a particular class permission to come to him for help such permission however ought never to be given unless it is absolutely necessary and should never be allowed to be taken unless it is distinctly given  4 hearing recitations i am aware that many attempt to do something else at the same time that they are hearing a recitation and there may perhaps be some individuals who can succeed in this if the exercise to which the teacher is attending consists merely in listening to the reciting from memory some passage committed it can perhaps be done i hope however to show in a future chapter that there are other and far higher objects which every teacher ought to have in view and he who understands these objects and aims at accomplishing themwho endeavors to instruct his class to enlarge and elevate their ideas to awaken a deep and paramount interest in the subject which they are examining will find that his time must be his own and his attention uninterrupted while he is presiding at a class all the other exercises and arrangements of the school are in fact preparatory and subsidiary to this here that is in the classes the real business of teaching is to be done here the teacher comes in contact with his scholars mind with mind and here consequently he must be uninterrupted and undisturbed i shall speak more particularly on this subject hereafter under the head of instruction all i wish to secure in this place is that the teacher should make such arrangements that he can devote his exclusive attention to his classes while he is actually engaged with them  each recitation too should have its specified time which should be adhered to with rigid accuracy if any thing like the plan i have suggested for allowing rests of a minute or two every half hour should be adopted it will mark off the forenoon into parts which ought to be precisely and carefully observed i was formerly accustomed to think that i could not limit the time for my recitations without great inconvenience and occasionally allowed one exercise to encroach upon the succeeding and this upon the next and thus sometimes the last was excluded altogether but such a lax and irregular method of procedure is ruinous to the discipline of a school on perceiving it at last i put the bell into the hands of a pupil commissioning her to ring regularly having myself fixed the times saying that i would show my pupils that i could be confined myself to system as well as they at first i experienced a little inconvenience but this soon disappeared and at last the hours and half hours of our artificial division entirely superseded in the schoolroom the divisions of the clock face  but in order that i may be specific and definite i will draw up a plan for the regular division of time for a common school not to be adopted but to be imitated i e i do not recommend exactly this plan but that some plan precise and specific should be determined upon and exhibited to the school by a diagram like the following                     forenoon ix            x                   xi               xii     reading     writing r g      arithmetic                                                                                                                                                                                                                       afternoon ii           iii                  iv                 v     grammar     writing r g      geography                                                                                                                                                                                                    a drawing on a large sheet made by some of the older scholars for a teacher should never do any thing of this kind which his scholars can do for him should be made and pasted up to view the names of the classes being inserted in the columns under their respective heads at the double lines at ten and three there might be a rest of two minutes an officer appointed for the purpose ringing a bell at each of the parts marked on the plan and making the signal for the rest whatever signal might be determined upon it is a good plan to have a bell rung five minutes before each half hour expires and then exactly at its close the first one would be to notify the teacher or teachers if there are more than one in the school that the time for their respective recitations is drawing to a close at the second bell the new classes should take their places without waiting to be called for the scholars will thus see that the arrangements of the school are based upon system to which the teacher himself conforms and not subjected to his own varying will they will thus not only go on more regularly but they will yield more easily and pleasantly to the necessary arrangements  the fact is children love system and regularity each one is sometimes a little uneasy under the restraint which it imposes upon him individually but they all love to see its operation upon others and they are generally very willing to submit to its laws if the rest of the community are required to submit too they show this in their love of military parade what allures them is chiefly the order of it and even a little child creeping upon the floor will be pleased when he gets his playthings in a row a teacher may turn this principle to most useful account in forming his plans for his school  it will be seen by reference to the foregoing plan that i have marked the time for the recesses by the letter r at the top immediately after them both in the forenoon and in the afternoon twenty minutes are left marked g the initial standing for general exercise they are intended to denote periods during which all the scholars are in their seats with their work laid aside ready to attend to what the teacher has to bring before the whole there are so many occasions on which it is necessary to address the whole school that it is very desirable to appropriate a particular time for it in most of the best schools i believe this plan is adopted i will mention some of the subjects which would come up at such a time  1 there are some studies which can be advantageously attended to by the whole school together such as punctuation and to some extent spelling  2 cases of discipline which it is necessary to bring before the whole school ought to come up at a regularly appointed time by attending to them here there will be a greater importance attached to them whatever the teacher does will seem to be more deliberate and in fact will be more deliberate  3 general remarks bringing up classes of faults which prevail also general directions which may at any time be needed and in fact any business relating to the general arrangements of the school  4 familiar lectures from the teacher on various subjectsvery familiar in their form and perhaps accompanied by questions addressed to the whole the design of such lectures should be to extend the general knowledge of the pupils in regard to those subjects on which they will need information in their progress through life in regard to each of these particulars i shall speak more particularly hereafter in the chapters to which they respectively belong my only object here is to show in the general arrangements of the school how a place is to be found for them my practice has been to have two periods of short duration each day appropriated to these objects the first to the business of the school and the second to such studies or lectures as could be most profitably attended to at such a time                                       we come now to one of the most important subjects which present themselves to the teachers attention in settling the principles upon which he shall govern his school i mean the degree of influence which the boys themselves shall have in the management of its affairs shall the government of school be a monarchy or a republic to this question after much inquiry and many experiments i answer a monarchy an absolute unlimited monarchy the teacher possessing exclusive power as far as the pupils are concerned though strictly responsible to the committee or to the trustees under whom he holds his office  while however it is thus distinctly understood that the power of the teacher is supreme that all the power rests in him and that he alone is responsible for its exercise there ought to be a very free and continual delegation of power to the pupils as much business as is possible should be committed to them they should be interested as much as possible in the affairs of the school and led to take an active part in carrying them forward though they should all the time distinctly understand that it is only delegated power which they exercise and that the teacher can at any time revoke what he has granted and alter or annul at pleasure any of their decisions by this plan we have the responsibility resting where it ought to rest and yet the boys are trained to business and led to take an active interest in the welfare of the school trust is reposed in them which may be greater or less as they are able to bear all the good effects of reposing trust and confidence and committing the management of important business to the pupils will be secured without the dangers which would result from the entire surrender of the management of the institution into their hands  there have been in several cases experiments made with reference to ascertaining how far a government strictly republican would be admissible in a school a very fair experiment of this kind was made at the gardiner lyceum in maine at the time of its establishment nothing was said of the mode of government which it was intended to adopt for some time the attention of the instructers was occupied in arranging the course of study and attending to the other concerns of the institution and in the infant state of the lyceum few cases of discipline occurred and no regular system of government was necessary  before long however complaints were made that the students at the lyceum were guilty of breaking windows in an old building used as a townhouse the principal called the students together mentioned the reports and said that he did not know and did not wish to know who were the guilty individuals it was necessary however that the thing should be examined and that restitution should be made and relying on their faithfulness and ability he should leave them to manage the business alone for this purpose he nominated one of the students as judge some others as jurymen and appointed the other officers necessary in the same manner he told them that in order to give them time to make a thorough investigation they were excused from farther exercises during the day  the principal then left them and they entered on the trial the result was that they discovered the guilty individuals ascertained the amount of mischief done by each and sent to the selectmen a message by which they agreed to pay a sum equal to three times the value of the injury sustained  the students were soon after informed that this mode of bringing offenders to justice would hereafter be always pursued and arrangements were made for organizing a regular republican government among the young men by this government all laws which related to the internal police of the institution were to be made all officers were appointed and all criminal cases were to be tried the students finding the part of a judge too difficult for them to sustain one of the professors was appointed to hold that office and for similar reasons another of the professors was made president of the legislative assembly the principal was the executive with power to pardon but not to sentence or even accuse  some time after this a student was indicted for profane swearing he was tried convicted and punished after this he evinced a strong hostility to the government he made great exertions to bring it into contempt and when the next trial came on he endeavored to persuade the witnesses that giving evidence was dishonorable and he so far succeeded that the defendant was acquitted for want of evidence when it was generally understood that there was proof of his guilt which would have been satisfactory if it could have been brought forward for some time after this the prospect was rather unfavorable though many of the students themselves opposed with great earnestness these efforts and were much alarmed lest they should lose their free government through the perverseness of one of their number the attorney general at this juncture conceived the idea of indicting the individual alluded to for an attempt to overturn the government he obtained the approbation of the principal and the grand jury found a bill the court as the case was so important invited some of the trustees of the lyceum who were in town to attend the trial the parent of the defendant was also informed of the circumstances and requested to be present and he accordingly attended the prisoner was tried found guilty and sentenced if i mistake not to an expulsion at his earnest request however to be permitted to remain in the lyceum and redeem his character he was pardoned and restored and became perfectly exemplary in his conduct and character after this occurrence the system went on in successful operation for some time  the legislative power was vested in the hands of a general committee consisting of eight or ten chosen by the students from their own number they met about once a week to transact such business as appointing officers making and repealing regulations and inquiring into the state of the lyceum the instructers had a negative upon all their proceedings but no direct and positive power they could pardon but they could assign no punishments nor make laws inflicting any  now such a plan as this may succeed for a short time and under very favorable circumstances and the circumstance which it is chiefly important should be favorable is that the man who is called to preside over such an association should possess such a share of generalship that he can really manage the institution himself while the power is nominally and apparently in the hands of the boys should this not be the case or should the teacher from any cause lose his personal influence in the school so that the institution should really be surrendered into the hands of the pupils things must be on a very unstable footing and accordingly where such a plan has been adopted it has i believe in every instance been ultimately abandoned  real selfgovernment is an experiment sufficiently hazardous among men though providence in making a daily supply of food necessary for every human being has imposed a mostpowerful check upon the tendency to anarchy and confusion let the populace of london materially interrupt the order and break in upon the arrangements of the community and in eight and forty hours nearly the whole of the mighty mass will be in the hands of the devourer hunger and they will be soon brought to submission on the other hand a months anarchy and confusion in a college or an academy would be delight to half the students or else times have greatly changed since i was within college walls  although it is thus evident that the important concerns of a literary institution cannot be safely committed into the hands of the students very great benefits will result from calling upon them to act upon and to decide questions relative to the school within such limits and under such restrictions as may appear best such a practice will assist the teacher very much if he manages it with any degree of dexterity for it will interest his pupils in the success of the school and secure to a very considerable extent their cooperation it will teach them selfcontrol and selfgovernment and will accustom them to submit to the majoritythat lesson which of all others it is important for a republican to learn  in endeavoring to interest the pupils of a school in the work of cooperating with the teacher in its administration no little dexterity will be necessary at the outset in all probability the formal announcement of this principle and the endeavor to introduce it by a sudden revolution would totally fail boys like men must be gradually prepared for power and they must exercise it only so far as they are prepared this however can very easily be done the teacher should say nothing of his general design but when some suitable opportunity presents he should endeavor to lead his pupils to cooperate with him in some particular instance  for example let us suppose that he has been accustomed to distribute the writingbooks with his own hand when the writing hour arrives and that he concludes to delegate this simple business first to his scholars he accordingly states to them just before the writing exercise of the day on which he proposes the experiment as follows  i have thought that time will be saved if you will help me distribute the books and i will accordingly appoint four distributors one for each division of the seats who may come to me and receive the books and distribute them each to his own division are you willing to adopt this plan  the boys answer yes sir and the teacher then looks carefully around the room and selects four pleasant and popular boysboys who he knows would gladly assist him and who would at the same time be agreeable to their school mates this latter point is necessary in order to secure the popularity and success of the plan  unless the boys are very different from any i have ever met with they will be pleased with the duty thus assigned them they will learn system and regularity by being taught to perform this simple duty in a proper manner after a week the teacher may consider their term of service as having expired and thanking them in public for the assistance they have rendered him he may ask the scholars if they are willing to continue the plan and if the vote is in favor of it as it unquestionably would be each boy probably hoping that he should be appointed to the office the teacher may nominate four others including perhaps upon the list some boy popular among his companions but whom he has suspected to be not very friendly to himself or the school i think the most scrupulous politician would not object to securing influence by conferring office in such a case if any difficulties arise from the operation of such a measure it can easily be dropped or modified if it is successful it may be continued and the principle extended till it very considerably modifies all the arrangements and the whole management of the school  or let us imagine the following scene to have been the commencement of the introduction of the principle of limited selfgovernment into a school  the preceptor of an academy was sitting at his desk at the close of school while the pupils were putting up their books and leaving the room a boy came in with angry looks and with his hat in his hands bruised and dusty advanced to the masters desk and complained that one of his companions had thrown down his hat upon the floor and had almost spoilt it  the teacher looked calmly at the mischief and then asked how it happened  i dont know sir i hung it up on my nail and he pulled it down  i wish you would ask him to come here said the teacher ask him pleasantly  the accused soon came in and the two boys stood together before the master  there seems to be some difficulty between you boys about a nail to hang your hats upon i suppose each of you think it is your own nail  yes sir said both the boys  it will be more convenient for me to talk with you about this tomorrow than tonight if you are willing to wait besides we can examine it more calmly then but if we put it off till then you must not talk about it in the meantime blaming one another and keeping up the irritation that you feel are you both willing to leave it just where it is till tomorrow and try to forget all about it till then i expect i shall find you both a little to blame  the boys rather reluctantly consented the next day the master heard the case and settled it so far as it related to the two boys it was easily settled in the morning for they had had time to get calm and were after sleeping away their anger rather ashamed of the whole affair and very desirous to have it forgotten  that day when the hour for the transaction of business came the teacher stated to the school that it was necessary to take some measures to provide each boy with a nail for his hat in order to show that it was necessary he related the circumstances of the quarrel which had occurred the day before he did this not with such an air and manner as to convey the impression that his object was to find fault with the boys or to expose their misconduct but to show the necessity of doing something to remedy the evil which had been the cause of so unpleasant an occurrence still though he said nothing in the way of reproach or reprehension and did not name the boys but merely gave a cool and impartial narrative of the factsthe effect very evidently was to bring such quarrels into discredit a calm review of misconduct after the excitement has gone by will do more to bring it into disgrace than the most violent invectives and reproaches directed against the individuals guilty of it  now boys continued the master will you assist me in making arrangements to prevent the recurrence of all temptations of this kind hereafter it is plain that every boy ought to have a nail appropriated expressly to his use the first thing to be done is to ascertain whether there are enough for all i should like therefore to have two committees appointed one to count and report the number of nails in the entry and also how much room there is for more the other to ascertain the number of scholars in school they can count all who are here and by observing the vacant desks they can ascertain the number absent when this investigation is made i will tell you what to do next  the boys seemed pleased with the plan and the committees were appointed two members on each the master took care to give the quarrellers some share in the work apparently forgetting from this time the unpleasant occurrence which had brought up the subject  when the boys came to tell him their results he asked them to make a little memorandum in writing as he might forget before the time came for reading them they brought him presently a rough scrap of paper with the figures marked upon it he told them he should forget which was the number of nails and which the number of scholars unless they wrote it down  it is the custom among men said he to make out their report in such a case fully so that it would explain itself and i should like to have you if you are willing to make out yours a little more distinctly  accordingly after a little additional explanation the boys made another attempt and presently returned with something like the following       the committee for counting the nails report as follows                          number of nails  35                          room for         15  the other report was very similar though somewhat rudely written and expressed and both were perfectly satisfactory to the preceptor as he plainly showed by the manner in which he received them  i need not finish the description of this case by narrating particularly the reading of the reports the appointment of a committee to assign the nails and to paste up the names of the scholars one to each the work in such a case might be done in recesses and out of school hours and though at first the teacher will find that it is as much trouble to accomplish business in this way as it would be to attend to it directly himselfyet after a very little experience he will find that his pupils will acquire dexterity and readiness and will be able to render him very material assistance in the accomplishment of his plans  this however the assistance rendered to the teacher is not the object the main design is to interest the pupils in the management and the welfare of the schoolto identify them as it were with it it will accomplish this object and every teacher who will try the experiment and carry it into effect with any tolerable degree of skill will find that it will in a short time change the whole aspect of the school in regard to the feelings subsisting between himself and his pupils  each teacher who tries such an experiment will find himself insensibly repeating it and after a time he may have quite a number of officers and committees who are entrusted with various departments of business he will have a secretary chosen by ballot by the scholars to keep a record of all the important transactions in the school for each day at first he will dictate to the secretary telling him precisely what to say or even writing it for him and merely requiring him to copy it into the book provided for the purpose afterwards he will give him less and less assistance till he can keep the record properly himself the record of each day will be read on the succeeding at the hour for business he will have a committee of one or two to take care of the fire and another to see that the room is constantly in good order he will have distributors for each division of seats to distribute books and compositions and pens and to collect votes and thus in a short time his school will become regularly organized as a society or legislative assembly the boys will learn submission to the majority in such unimportant things as may be committed to them they will learn system and regularity and every thing else that belongs to the science of political self government  there are dangers however what useful practice has not its dangers one of these is that the teacher will allow these arrangements to take up too much time he must guard against this i have found from experience that fifteen minutes each day with a school of 135 is enough this ought never to be exceeded  another danger is that the boys will be so engaged in the duties of their offices as to neglect their studies this would be and ought to be fatal to the whole plan avoid it in this manner state publicly that you will not appoint any to office who are not good scholars always punctual and always prepared and when any boy who holds an office is going behind hand in his studies say to him kindly you have not time to get your lessons and i am afraid it is owing to the time you spend in helping me now if you wish to resign your office so as to have a little more time for your lessons you can in fact i think you ought to do it you may try it for a day or two and i will notice how you recite and then we can decide  such a communication will generally be found to have a powerful effect if it does not remedy the evil the resignation must be insisted on a few decided cases of this kind will effectually remove the evil i am considering                                       another difficulty which is likely to attend the plan of allowing the pupils of the school to decide some of the cases which occur is that it may tend to make them insubordinate so that they will in many instances submit with less good humor to such decisions as you may consider necessary i do not mean that this will be the case with all but that there will be a few who will be ungenerous enough if you allow them to decide sometimes to endeavor to make trouble or at least to show symptoms of impatience and vexation because you do not allow them to decide always  sometimes this feeling may show itself by the discontented looks or gestures or even words with which some unwelcome decision will be received such a spirit should be immediately and decidedly checked it will not be difficult to check and even entirely to remove it on one occasion when after learning the wishes of the scholars on some subject which had been brought before them i decided contrary to it there arose a murmur of discontent all over the room this was the more distinct because i have always accustomed my pupils to answer questions asked and to express their wishes and feelings on any subject i may present to them with great freedom  i asked all those who had expressed their dissatisfaction to rise  about one third of the scholars arose  perhaps you understood that when i put the question to vote i meant to abide by your decision and that consequently i ought not to have reversed it as i did afterwards  yes sir yes sir they replied  do you suppose it would be safe to leave the decision of important questions to the scholars in this school  yes sir no sir the majority were however in the affirmative  thus far only those who were standing had answered i told them that as they were divided in opinion they might sit and i would put the question to the whole school  you know i continued addressing the whole what sort of persons the girls who compose this school are you know about how many are governed habitually by steady principle and how many by impulse and feeling you know too what proportion have judgment and foresight necessary to consider and decide independently such questions as continually arise in the management of a school now suppose i should resign the school into your own hands as to its management and only come in to give instruction to the classes leaving all general control of its arrangements with you would it go on safely or not  as might have been foreseen there was when the question was fairly proposed scarcely a solitary vote in favor of government by scholars they seemed to see clearly the absurdity of such a scheme  besides i continued the trustees of this school have committed it to my charge they hold me responsible the public hold me responsible not you now if i should surrender it into your hands and you from any cause should manage the trust unfaithfully or unskilfully i should necessarily be held accountable i could never shift the responsibility upon you now it plainly is not just or right that one party should hold the power and another be held accountable for its exercise it is clear therefore in every view of the subject that i should retain the management of this school in my own hands are you not satisfied that it is  the scholars universally answered yes sir they seemed satisfied and doubtless were  it was then stated to them that the object in asking them to vote was in some cases to obtain an expression of their opinion or their wishes in order to help me decide and only in those cases where it was expressly stated did i mean to give the final decision to them  still however if cases are often referred to them the feeling will gradually creep in that the school is managed on republican principles as they call it and they will unless this point is specially guarded gradually lose that spirit of entire and cordial subordination so necessary for the success of any school it should often be distinctly explained to them that a republican government is one where the power essentially resides in the community and is exercised by a ruler only so far as the community delegates it to him whereas in the school the government is based on the principle that the power primarily and essentially resides in the teacher the scholars exercising only such as he may delegate to them  with these limitations and restrictions and with this express understanding in regard to what is in all cases the ultimate authority i think there will be no danger in throwing a very large share of the business which will from time to time come up in the school upon the scholars for decision in my own experience this plan has been adopted with the happiest results a small red morocco wrapper lies constantly on a little shelf accessible to all by its side is a little pile of papers about one inch by six on which any one may write her motion or her proposition as they call it whatever it may be and when written it is enclosed in the wrapper to be brought to me at the appointed time for attending to the general business of the school through this wrapper all questions are asked all complaints entered all proposals made is there discontent in the school it shows itself by propositions in the wrapper is any body aggrieved or injured i learn it through the wrapper in fact it is a little safety valve which lets off what if confined might threaten explosionan indexa thermometer which reveals to me from day to day more of the state of public opinion in the little community than any thing beside  these propositions are generally read aloud some cases are referred to the scholars for decision some i decide myself others are laid aside without notice of any kind others still merely suggest remarks on the subjects to which they allude  the principles then which this chapter has been intended to establish are simply these in making your general arrangements look carefully over your ground consider all the objects which you have to accomplish and the proper degree of time and attention which each deserves then act upon system let the mass of particulars which would otherwise crowd upon you in promiscuous confusion be arranged and classified let each be assigned to its proper time and place that your time may be your ownunder your own commandand not as is too often the case at the mercy of the thousand accidental circumstances which may occur  in government be yourself supreme and let your supremacy be that of authority but delegate power as freely as possible to those under your care show them that you are desirous of reposing trust in them just so far as they show themselves capable of exercising it thus interest them in your plans and make them feel that they participate in the honor or the disgrace of success or failure  i have gone much into detail in this chapter proposing definite measures by which the principles i have recommended may be carried into effect i wish however that it may be distinctly understood that all i contend for is the principles themselves no matter what the particular measures are by which they are secured every good school must be systematic but they need not all be on precisely the same system as this work is intended almost exclusively for beginners much detail has been admitted and many of the specific measures here proposed may perhaps be safely adopted where no others are established there may also perhaps be cases where teachers whose schools are already in successful operation may engraft upon their own plans some things which are here proposed if they should attempt it it must be done cautiously and gradually there is no other way by which they can be safely introduced or even introduced at all this is a point of so much importance that i must devote a paragraph to it before closing the chapter  let a teacher propose to his pupils formally from his desk the plan of writing propositions for example and procure his wrapper and put it in its placeand what would be the result why not a single paper probably could he get from one end of the week to the other but let him on the other hand when a boy comes to him to ask some question the answer to which many in the school would equally wish to hear say to the inquirer  will you be so good as to write that question and put it on my desk and then at the regular time i will answer it to all the school  when he reads it let him state that it was written at his request and give the other boys permission to leave their proposals or questions on his desk in the same way in a few days he will have another and thus the plan may be gently and gradually introduced  so with officers they should be appointed among the scholars only as fast as they are actually needed and the plan should thus be cautiously carried only so far as it proves good on trial be always cautious about innovations and changes make no rash experiments on a large scale but always test your principle in the small way and then if it proves good gradually extend its operation as circumstances seem to require  by thus cautiously and slowly introducing plans founded on the systematic principles here brought to view a very considerable degree of quiet and order and regularity may be introduced into the largest and most miscellaneous schools and this order and quiet are absolutely necessary to enable the teacher to find that interest and enjoyment in his work which were exhibited in the last chapter the pleasure of directing and controlling mind and doing it not by useless and anxious complaints or stern threats and painful punishments but by regarding the scene of labor in its true light as a community of intellectual and moral beings and governing it by moral and intellectual power it is in fact the pleasure of exercising power i do not mean arbitrary personal authority but the power to produce by successful but quiet contrivance extensive and happy resultsthe pleasure of calmly considering every difficulty and without irritation or anger devising the proper moral means to remedy the moral evil and then the interest and pleasure of witnessing its effects     chapter iii  instruction   there are three kinds of human knowledge which stand strikingly distinct from all the rest they lie at the foundation they constitute the roots of the tree in other words they are the means by which all other knowledge is acquired i need not say that i mean reading writing and calculation  teachers do not perhaps always consider how entirely and essentially distinct these three are from all the rest they are arts the acquisition of them is not to be considered as knowledge so much as the means by which knowledge may be obtained a child who is studying geography or history or natural science is learning factsgaining information on the other hand the one who is learning to write or to read or to calculate may be adding little or nothing to his stock of knowledge he is acquiring skill which at some future time he may make the means of increasing his knowledge to any extent  this distinction ought to be kept constantly in view and the teacher should feel that these three fundamental branches stand by themselves and stand first in importance i do not mean to undervalue the others but only to insist upon the superior value and importance of these teaching a pupil to read before he enters upon the active business of life is like giving a new settler an axe as he goes to seek his new home in the forest teaching him a lesson in history is on the other hand only cutting down a tree or two for him a knowledge of natural history is like a few bushels of grain gratuitously placed in his barn but the art of ready reckoning is the plough which will remain by him for years and help him to draw out from the soil an annual treasure  the great object then of the common schools in our country is to teach the whole population to read to write and to calculate in fact so essential is it that the accomplishment of these objects should be secured that it is even a question whether common schools should not be confined to them i say it is a question for it is sometimes made so though public opinion has decided that some portion of attention at least should be paid to the acquisition of additional knowledge but after all the amount of knowledge which is actually acquired at schools is very small it must be very small the true policy is to aim at making all good readers writers and calculators and to consider the other studies of the school important chiefly as practice in turning these arts to useful account in other words the scholars should be taught these arts thoroughly first of all and in the other studies the main design should be to show them how to use and interest them in using the arts they have thus acquired  a great many teachers feel a much stronger interest in the one or two scholars they may have in surveying or in latin than they do in the large classes in the elementary branches which fill the school but a moments reflection will show that such a preference is founded on a very mistaken view leading forward one or two minds from step to step in an advanced study is certainly far inferior in real dignity and importance to opening all the stores of written knowledge to fifty or a hundred the man who neglects the interests of his school in these great branches to devote his time to two or three or half a dozen older scholars is unjust both to his employers and to himself  it is the duty therefore of every teacher who commences a common district school for a single season to make when he commences an estimate of the state of his pupils in reference to these three branches how do they all write how do they all read how do they calculate it would be well if he would make a careful examination of the school in this respect let them all write a specimen let all read and let him make a memorandum of the manner noticing how many read fluently how many with difficulty how many know only their letters and how many are to be taught these let him ascertain also what progress they have made in arithmetichow many can readily perform the elementary processes and what number need instruction in these after thus surveying the ground let him form his plan and lay out his whole strength in carrying forward as rapidly as possible the whole school in these studies by this means he is acting most directly and powerfully on the intelligence of the whole future community in that place he is opening to fifty or a hundred minds stores of knowledge which they will go on exploring for years to come what a descent now from such a work as this to the mere hearing of the recitation of half a dozen boys in surveying  i repeat it that a thorough and enlightened survey of the whole school should be taken and plans formed for elevating the whole mass in those great branches of knowledge which are to be of immediate practical use to them in future life  if the school is of higher order the teacher should in the same manner before he forms his plans consider well what are the great objects which he has to accomplish he should ascertain what is the existing state of his school both as to knowledge and characterhow long generally his pupils are to remain under his carewhat are to be their future stations and conditions in life and what objects he can reasonably hope to effect for them while they remain under his influence by means of this forethought and consideration he will be enabled to work understandingly  it is desirable too that what i have recommended in reference to the whole school should be done with each individual ascertain by other means however than formal examination to what stage his education has advanced and deliberately consider what objects you can reasonably expect to effect for him while he remains under your care you cannot indeed always form your plans to suit so exactly your general views in regard to the school and to individuals as you could wish but these general views will in a thousand cases modify your plans or affect in a greater or less degree all your arrangements they will keep you to a steady purpose and your work will go on far more systematically and regularly than it would if as in fact many teachers do you were to come headlong into your school take things just as you find them and carry them forward at random without end or aim  this survey of your field being made you are prepared to commence definite operations and the great difficulty in carrying your plans into effect is how to act more efficiently on the greatest numbers at a time the whole business of public instruction if it goes on at all must go on by the teachers skill in multiplying his power by acting on numbers at once in most books on education we are taught almost exclusively how to operate on the individual it is the error into which theoretic writers almost always fall we meet in every periodical and in every treatise and in fact in almost every conversation on the subject with remarks which sound very well by the fireside but they are totally inefficient and useless in school from their being apparently based upon the supposition that the teacher has but one pupil to attend to at a time the great question in the management of schools is not how you can take one scholar and lead him forward most rapidly in a prescribed course but how you can classify and arrange numbers comprising every possible variety both as to knowledge and capacity so as to carry them all forward effectually together  the extent to which a teacher may multiply his power by acting on numbers at a time is very great in order to estimate it we must consider carefully what it is when carried to the greatest extent to which it is capable of being carried under the most favorable circumstances now it is possible for a teacher to speak so as to be easily heard by three hundred persons and three hundred pupils can be easily so seated as to see his illustrations or diagrams now suppose that three hundred pupils all ignorant of the method of reducing fractions to a common denominator and yet all old enough to learn are collected in one room suppose they are all attentive and desirous of learning it is very plain that the process may be explained to the whole at once so that half an hour spent in that exercise would enable a very large proportion of them to understand the subject so if a teacher is explaining to a class in grammar the difference between a noun and verb the explanation would do as well for several hundred as for the dozen who constitute the class if arrangements could only be made to have the hundreds hear it but there are perhaps only a hundred in the school and of these a large part understand already the point to be explained and another large part are too young to attend to it i wish the object of these remarks not to be misunderstood i do not recommend the attempt to teach on so extensive a scale i admit that it is impracticable i only mean to show in what the impracticability consists namely in the difficulty of making such arrangements as to derive the full benefit from the instructions rendered they are in the nature of things available to the extent i have represented but in actual practice the full benefit cannot be derived now so far as we thus fall short of this full benefit so far there is of course waste and it is difficult or impossible to make such arrangements as will avoid the waste in this manner of a large portion of every effort which the teacher makes  a very small class instructed by an able teacher is like a factory of a hundred spindles with a waterwheel of power sufficient for a thousand in such a case even if the owner from want of capital or any other cause cannot add the other nine hundred he ought to know how much of his power is in fact unemployed and make arrangements to bring it into useful exercise as soon as he can the teacher in the same manner should understand what is the full beneficial effect which it is possible in theory to derive from his instructions he should understand too that just so far as he falls short of this full effect there is waste it may be unavoidable part of it unquestionably is like the friction of machinery unavoidable still it is waste and it ought to be so understood that by the gradual perfection of the machinery it may be more and more fully prevented  always bear in mind then when you are devoting your time to two or three individuals in a class that you are losing a very large part of your labor your instructions are conducive to good effect only to the one tenth or one twentieth of the extent to which under more favorable circumstances they might be made available and though you cannot always avoid this loss you ought always to be aware of it and so to shape your measures as to diminish it as much as possible                                       we come now to consider the particular measures to be adopted in giving instruction                                       the objects which are to be secured in the management of classes are twofold  1 recitation  2 instruction  these two objects are it is plain entirely distinct under the latter is included all the explanation and assistance and additional information which the teacher may give his pupils and under the former such an examination of individuals as is necessary to secure their careful attention to their lessons it is unsafe to neglect either of these points if the class meetings are mere recitations they soon become dull and mechanical the pupils generally take little interest in their studies and imbibe no literary spirit their intellectual progress will accordingly suddenly cease the moment they leave school and cease to be called upon to recite lessons on the other hand if instruction is all that is aimed at and recitation by which i mean as above explained such an examination of individuals as is necessary to ascertain that they have faithfully performed the tasks assigned is neglected the exercise soon becomes not much more than a lecture to which those and those only will attend who please  the business therefore of a thorough examination of the class must not be omitted i do not mean that each individual scholar must every day be examined but simply that the teacher must in some way or other satisfy himself by reasonable evidence that the whole class are really prepared a great deal of ingenuity may be exercised in contriving means for effecting this object in the shortest possible time i know of no part of the field of a teachers labors which may be more facilitated by a little ingenuity than this  one teacher for instance has a spelling lesson to hear he begins at the head of the line and putting one word to each boy goes regularly down each successive pupil calculating the chances whether a word which he can accidentally spell will or will not come to him if he spells it the teacher cannot tell whether he is prepared or not that word is only one among fifty constituting the lesson if he misses it the teacher cannot decide that he was unprepared it might have been a single accidental error  another teacher hearing the same lesson requests the boys to bring their slates and as he dictates the words one after another requires all to write them after they are all written he calls upon the pupils to spell them aloud as they have written them simultaneously pausing a moment after each to give those who are wrong an opportunity to indicate it by some mark opposite the word misspelled they all count the number of errors and report them he passes down the class glancing his eye at the work of each one to see that all is right noticing particularly those slates which from the character of the boys need a more careful inspection a teacher who had never tried this experiment would be surprised at the rapidity with which such work will be done by a class after a little practice  now how different are these two methods in their actual results in the latter case the whole class are thoroughly examined in the former not a single member of it is let me not be understood to recommend exactly this method of teaching spelling as the best one to be adopted in all cases i only bring it forward as an illustration of the idea that a little machinery a little ingenuity in contriving ways of acting on the whole rather than on individuals will very much promote the teachers designs  in order to facilitate such plans it is highly desirable that the classes should be trained to military precision and exactness in these manipulations what i mean by this may perhaps be best illustrated by describing a case it will show in another branch how much will be gained by acting upon numbers at once instead of upon each individual in succession  imagine then that a teacher requested all the pupils of his school who could write to take out their slates at the hour for a general exercise as soon as the first bustle of opening and shutting the desks was over he looked around the room and saw some ruling lines across their slates others wiping them all over on both sides with sponges others scribbling or writing or making figures  all those says he with a pleasant tone and look who have taken out any thing besides slates may rise  several in various parts of the room stood up  all those who have written any thing since they took out their slates may rise too and those who have wiped their slates  when all were up he said to them though not with a frown or a scowl as if they had committed some very great offence  suppose a company of soldiers should be ordered to form a line and instead of simply obeying that order they should all set at work each in his own way doing something else one man at one end of the line begins to load and fire his gun another takes out his knapsack and begins to eat his luncheon a third amuses himself by going as fast as possible through the exercise and another still begins to march about hither and thither facing to the right and left and performing all the evolutions he can think of what should you say to such a company as that  the boys laughed  it is better said the teacher when numbers are acting under the direction of one that they should all act exactly together in this way we advance much faster than we otherwise should be careful therefore to do exactly what i command and nothing more  provide a place on your slates large enough to write a single line added the teacher in a distinct voice i print his orders in italics and his remarks and explanations in roman letter  prepare to write  i mean by this he continued that you place your slates before you with your pencils at the place where you are to begin so that all may commence precisely at the same instant  the teacher who tries such an experiment as this will find at such a juncture an expression of fixed and pleased attention upon every countenance in school all will be intent all will be interested boys love order and system and acting in concert and they will obey with great alacrity such commands as these if they are goodhumoredly though decidedly expressed  the teacher observed in one part of the room a hand raised indicating that the boy wished to speak to him he gave him liberty by pronouncing his name  i have no pencil said the boy  a dozen hands all around him were immediately seen fumbling in pockets and desks and in a few minutes several pencils were reached out for his acceptance  the boy looked at the pencils and then at the teacher he did not exactly know whether he was to take one or not  all those boys said the teacher pleasantly who have taken out pencils may rise  have these boys done right or wrong  right wrong right answered their companions variously  their motive was to help their classmate out of his difficulties that is a good feeling certainly  yes sir right right  but i thought you promised me a moment ago replied the teacher not to do any thing unless i commanded it did i ask for pencils  a pause  i do not blame these boys at all in this case still it is better to adhere rigidly to the principle of exact obedience when numbers are acting together i thank them therefore for being so ready to assist a companion but they must put their pencils away as they were taken out without orders  now such a dialogue as this if the teacher speaks in a goodhumored though decided manner would be universally well received in any school whenever strictness of discipline is unpopular it is rendered so simply by the illhumored and illjudged means by which it is attempted to be introduced but all children will love strict discipline if it is pleasantly though firmly maintained it is a great though very prevalent mistake to imagine that boys and girls like a lax and inefficient government and dislike the pressure of steady control what they dislike is sour looks and irritating language and they therefore very naturally dislike every thing introduced or sustained by their means if however exactness and precision in all the operations of a class and of the school are introduced and enforced in the proper manner i e by a firm but mild and goodhumored authority scholars will universally be pleased with them they like to see the uniform appearancethe straight linethe simultaneous movement they like to feel the operation of system and to realize while they are at the school room that they form a community governed by fixed and steady laws firmly but pleasantly administered on the other hand laxity of discipline and the disorder which will result from it will only lead the pupils to contemn their teacher and to hate their school  by introducing and maintaining such a discipline as i have described great facilities will be secured for examining the classes for example to take a case different from the one before described let us suppose that a class have been performing a number of examples in addition they come together to the recitation and under one mode of managing classes the teacher is immediately beset by a number of the pupils with excuses one had no slate another was absent when the lesson was assigned a third performed the work but it got rubbed out and a fourth did not know what was to be done the teacher stops to hear all these and to talk about them fretted himself and fretting the delinquents by his impatient remarks the rest of the class are waiting and having nothing good to do the temptation is almost irresistible to do something bad one boy is drawing pictures on his slate to make his neighbors laugh another is whispering and two more are at play the disorder continues while the teacher goes round examining slate after slate his whole attention being engrossed by each individual as the pupils come to him successively while the rest are left to themselves interrupted only by an occasional harsh or even angry but utterly useless rebuke from him  but under another mode of managing classes and schools a very different result would be produced  a boy approaches the teacher to render an excuse the teacher replies addressing himself however to the whole class i shall give all an opportunity to offer their excuses presently no one must come till he is called  the class then regularly take their places in the recitation seats the prepared and unprepared together the following commands are given and obeyed promptly they are spoken pleasantly but still in the tone of command  the class may rise  all those that are not fully prepared with this lesson may sit  a number sit and others doubtful whether they are prepared or not or thinking that there is something peculiar in their cases which they wish to state raise their hands or make any other signal which is customary to indicate a wish to speak such a signal ought always to be agreed upon and understood in school  the teacher shakes his head saying i will hear you presently if there is on any account whatever any doubt whether you are prepared you must sit  those that are standing may read their answers to no 1 unit figure  boys five  teacher tens  b six  t hundreds  b seven  while these numbers are thus reading the teacher looks at the boys and can easily see whether any are not reading their own answers but only following the rest if they have been trained to speak exactly together his ear will also at once detect any erroneous answer which any one may give he takes down the figures given by the majority on his own slate and reads them aloud  this is the answer obtained by the majority it is undoubtedly right those who have different answers may sit  these directions if understood and obeyed would divide the class evidently into two portions those standing have their work done and done correctly and those sitting have some excuse or error to be examined a new lesson may now be assigned and the first portion may be dismissed which in a well regulated school will be twothirds of the class their slates may be slightly examined as they pass by the teacher on their way to their seats to see that all is fair but it will be safe to take it for granted that a result in which a majority agree will be right truth is consistent with itself but error in such a case never is this the teacher can at any time show by comparing the answers that are wrong they will always be found not only to differ from the correct result but to contradict each other  the teacher may now if be pleases after the majority of the class have gone hear the reasons of those who were unprepared and look for the errors of those whose work was incorrect but it is better to spend as little time as possible in such a way if a scholar is not prepared it is not of much consequence whether it is because he forgot his book or mistook the lesson or if it is ascertained that his answer is incorrect it is ordinarily a mere waste of time to search for the particular error  i have looked over my work sir says the boy perhaps and i cannot find where it is wrong he means by it that he does not believe that it is wrong  it is no matter if you cannot would be the proper reply since it certainly is wrong you have made a mistake in adding somewhere but it is not worth while for me to spend two or three minutes apiece with all of you to ascertain where try to be careful next time  the cases of those who are unprepared at a recitation ought by no means to be passed by unnoticed although it would be unwise to spend much time in examining each in detail  it is not of much consequence the teacher might say whether you have good excuses or bad so long as you are not prepared in future life you will certainly be unsuccessful if you fail no matter for what reason to discharge the duties which devolve upon you a carpenter for instance would certainly lose his work if he should not perform it faithfully and in season excuses no matter how reasonable will do him little good so in this school i want good recitations not good excuses i hope every one will be prepared tomorrow  it is not probable however that every one would be prepared the next day in such a case but by acting steadily on these principles the number of delinquencies would be so much diminished that the very few which should be left could easily be examined in detail and the remedies applied  simultaneous recitation by which i mean the practice of addressing a question to all the class to be answered by all together is a practice which has been for some years rapidly extending in our schools and if adopted with proper limits and restrictions is attended with great advantage the teacher must guard against some dangers however which will be likely to attend it  1 some will answer very eagerly instantly after the question is completed they wish to show their superior readiness let the teacher mention this expose kindly the motive which leads to it and tell them it is as irregular to answer before the rest as after them  2 some will defer their answers until they can catch those of their comrades for a guide let the teacher mention this fault expose the motive which leads to it and tell them that if they do not answer independently and at once they had better not answer at all  3 some will not answer at all the teacher can tell by looking around the class who do not for they cannot counterfeit the proper motion of the lips with promptness and decision unless they know what the answer is to be he ought occasionally to say to such an one i perceive you do not answer and ask him questions individually  4 in some cases there is danger of confusion in the answers from the fact that the question may be of such a nature that the answer is long and may by different individuals be differently expressed this evil must be guarded against by so shaping the question as to admit of a reply in a single word in reading large numbers for example each figure may be called for by itself or they may be given one after another the pupils keeping exact time when it is desirable to ask a question to which the answer is necessarily long it may be addressed to an individual or the whole class may write their replies which may then be read in succession  in a great many cases where simultaneous answering is practised after a short time the evils above specified are allowed to grow until at last some half dozen bright members of a class answer for all the rest dragging after them echoing their replies or ceasing to take any interest in an exercise which brings no personal and individual responsibility upon them to prevent this the teacher should exercise double vigilance at such a time he should often address questions to individuals alone especially to those most likely to be inattentive and careless and guard against the ingress of every abuse which might without close vigilance appear  with these cautions the method here alluded to will be found to be of very great advantage in many studies for example all the arithmetical tables may be recited in this way words may be spelled answers to sums given columns of figures added or numbers multiplied and many questions in history geography and other miscellaneous studies answered especially the general questions asked for the purpose of a review  but besides being useful as a mode of examination this plan of answering questions simultaneously is a very important means of fixing in the mind any facts which the teacher may communicate to his pupils if for instance he says some day to a class that vasco de gama was the discoverer of the passage round the cape of good hope and leaves it here in a few days not one in twenty will recollect the name but let him call upon them all to spell it simultaneously and then to pronounce it distinctly three or four times in concert and the word will be very strongly impressed upon the mind the reflecting teacher will find a thousand cases in the instruction of his classes and in his general exercises in the school in which this principle will be of great utility it is universal in its application what we say we fix by the very act of saying it in the mind hence reading aloud though a slower is a far more thorough method than reading silently and it is better in almost all cases whether in the family or in sabbath or common schools when general instructions are given to have the leading points fixed in the mind by questions answered simultaneously  but we are wandering a little from our subject which is in this part of our chapter the methods of examining a class not of giving or fixing instructions  another mode of examining classes which it is important to describe consists in requiring written answers to the questions asked the form and manner in which this plan may be adopted is various the class may bring their slates to the recitation and the teacher may propose questions successively the answers to which all the class may write numbering them carefully after a dozen answers are written the teacher may call at random for them or he may repeat a question and ask each pupil to read the answer he had written or he may examine the slates perhaps this method may be very successfully employed in reviews by dictating to the class a list of questions relating to the ground they have gone over for a week and to which they are to prepare answers written out at length and to be brought in at the next exercise this method may be made more formal still by requiring a class to write a full and regular abstract of all they have learned during a specified time the practice of thus reducing to writing what has been learned will be attended with many advantages so obvious that they need not be described  it will be perceived that three methods of examining classes have now been named and these will afford the teacher the means of introducing a very great variety in his mode of conducting his recitations while he still carries his class forward steadily in their prescribed course each is attended with its peculiar advantages the single replies coming from individuals specially addressed are more rigid and more to be relied uponbut they consume a great deal of time and while one is questioned it requires much skill to keep up interest in the rest the simultaneous answers of a class awaken more general interest but it is difficult without special care to secure by this means a thorough examination of all the written replies are more thorough but they require more time and attention and while they habituate the pupil to express his thoughts in writing they would if exclusively adopted fail to accustom him to an equally important practice that of the oral communication of his thoughts a constant variety of which these three methods should be the elements is unquestionably the best mode we not only by this means secure in a great degree the advantages which each is fitted to produce but we gain also the additional advantage and interest of variety  by these and perhaps by other means it is the duty of the teacher to satisfy himself that his pupils are really attentive to their duties it is not perhaps necessary that every individual should be every day minutely examined this is in many cases impossible but the system of examination should be so framed and so administered as to be daily felt by all and to bring upon every one a daily responsibility                                       we come now to consider the second general head which was to be discussed in this chapter  the study of books alone is insufficient to give knowledge to the young in the first stage learning to read a book is of no use whatever without the voice of the living teacher the child cannot take a step alone as the pupil however advances in his course his dependence upon his teacher for guidance and help continually diminishes until at last the scholar sits in his solitary study with no companion but his books and desiring for a solution of every difficulty nothing but a larger library in schools however the pupils have made so little progress in this course that they all need more or less of this oral assistance difficulties must be explained questions must be answered the path must be smoothed and the way pointed out by a guide who has travelled it before or it will be impossible for the pupil to go on this is the part of our subject which we now approach  the great principle which is to guide the teacher in this part of his duty is this assist your pupils in such a way as to lead them as soon as possible to do without assistance this is fundamental in a short time they will be away from your reach they will have no teacher to consult and unless you teach them how to understand books themselves they must necessarily stop suddenly in their course the moment you cease to help them forward i shall proceed therefore to consider the subject in the following plan       1 means of exciting interest in study      2 the kind and degree of assistance to be rendered      3 miscellaneous suggestions  1 interesting the pupils in their studies there are various principles of human nature which may be of great avail in accomplishing this object making intellectual effort and acquiring knowledge are always pleasant to the human mind unless some peculiar circumstances render them otherwise the teacher has therefore only to remove obstructions and sources of pain and the employment of his pupils will be of itself a pleasure  i am going to give you a new exercise today said a teacher to a class of boys in latin i am going to have you parse your whole lesson in writing it will be difficult but i think you may be able to accomplish it  the class looked surprised they did not know what parsing in writing could be  you may first when you take your seats and are ready to prepare the lesson write upon your slates a list of the ten first nouns arranging them in a column do you understand so far  yes sir  then rule lines for another column just beyond this in parsing nouns what is the first particular to be named  what the noun is from  yes that is its nominative now you may write at the head of the first column the word nouns and at the head of the second nom for nominative then rule a line for the third column what shall this contain the declension yes and the fourth gender the fifth number  in the same manner the other columns were designated the sixth was to contain case the seventh the word with which the noun was connected in construction and the eighth a reference to the rule  now i wish you continued the teacher to fill up such a table as this with ten nouns do you understand how i mean  yes sir no sir they answered variously  all who do understand may take their seats as i wish to give as little explanation as possible the more you can depend upon yourselves the better  those who saw clearly what was to be done left the class and the teacher continued his explanation to those who were left behind he made the plan perfectly clear to them by taking a particular noun and running it through the table showing what should be written opposite to the word in all the columns and then dismissed them  the class separated as every class would in such a case with strong interest in the work before them it was not so difficult as to perplex them and yet it required attention and care they were interested and pleasedpleased with the effort which it required them to make and they anticipated with interest and pleasure the time of coming again to the class to report and compare their work  when the time for the class came the teacher addressed them somewhat as follows  before looking at your slates i am going to predict what the faults are i have not seen any of your work but shall judge altogether from my general knowledge of schoolboys and the difficulties i know they meet with do you think i shall succeed  the scholars made no reply and an unskilful teacher would imagine that time spent in such remarks would be wholly wasted by no means the influence of it was to awaken universal interest in the approaching examination of the slates every scholar would be intent watching with eager interest to see whether the imagined faults would be found upon his work the class was by that single pleasant remark put into the best possible state for receiving the criticisms of the teacher  the first fault which i suppose will be found is that some are unfinished  the scholars looked surprised they did not expect to have that called a fault  how many plead guilty to it  a few raised their hands and the teacher continued  i suppose that some will be found partly effaced the slates were not laid away carefully or they were not clean so that the writing is not distinct how many find this the case with their work  i suppose that in some cases the lines will not be perpendicular but will slant probably towards the left like writing  i suppose also that in some cases the writing will be careless so that i cannot easily read it how many plead guilty to this  after mentioning such other faults as occurred to him relating chiefly to the form of the table and the mere mechanical execution of the work he said  i think i shall not look at your slates today you can all see i have no doubt how you can considerably improve them in mechanical execution in your next lesson and i suppose you would a little prefer that i should not see your first imperfect efforts in fact i should rather not see them at the next recitation they probably will be much better  one important means by which the teacher may make his scholars careful of their reputation is to show them thus that he is careful of it himself  now in such a case as this for it is except in the principles which it is intended to illustrate imaginary a very strong interest would be awakened in the class in the work assigned them intellectual effort in new and constantly varied modes is in itself a pleasure and this pleasure the teacher may deepen and increase very easily by a little dexterous management designed to awaken curiosity and concentrate attention it ought however to be constantly borne in mind that this variety should be confined to the modes of pursuing an object which is permanent and constant and steadily pursued for instance if a little class are to be taught simple addition after the process is once explained which may be done perhaps in two or three lessons they will need many days of patient practice to render it familiar to impress it firmly in their recollection and to enable them to work with rapidity now this object must be steadily pursued it would be very unwise for the teacher to say to himself my class are tired of addition i must carry them on to subtraction or give them some other study it would be equally unwise to keep them many days performing example after example in monotonous succession each lesson a mere repetition of the last he must steadily pursue his object of familiarizing them fully with this elementary process but he may give variety and spirit to the work by changing occasionally the modes one week he may dictate examples to them and let them come together to compare their results one of the class being appointed to keep a list of all who are correct each day at another time each one may write an example which he may read aloud to all the others to be performed and brought in at the next time again he may let them work on paper with pen and ink that he may see how few mistakes they make as mistakes in ink cannot be easily removed he may excite interest by devising ingenious examples such as finding out how much all the numbers from one to fifty will make when added together or the amount of the ages of the whole class or any such example the result of which they might feel a little interest in learning thus the object is steadily pursued though the means of pursuing it are constantly changing we have the advantage of regular progress in the acquisition of knowledge truly valuable while this progress is made with all the spirit and interest which variety can give  the necessity of making such efforts as this however to keep up the interest of the class in their work and to make it pleasant to them will depend altogether upon circumstances or rather it will vary much with circumstances a class of pupils somewhat advanced in their studies and understanding and feeling the value of knowledge will need very little of such effort as this while young and giddy children who have been accustomed to dislike books and school and every thing connected with them will need more it ought however in all cases to be made a means not an endthe means to lead on a pupil to an interest in progress in knowledge itself which is after all the great motive which ought to be brought as soon and as extensively as possible to operate in the schoolroom  another way to awaken interest in the studies of the school is to bring out as frequently and as distinctly as possible the connexion between these studies and the practical business of life the events which are occurring around you and which interest the community in which you are placed may by a little ingenuity be connected in a thousand ways with the studies of the school if the practice which has been already repeatedly recommended of appropriating a quarter of an hour each day to a general exercise should be adopted it will afford great facilities for doing this  suppose for example while the question between the general government and the state of south carolina was pending and agitating the whole country almost every one looking with anxious interest every day for intelligence from the scene of the conflict that the teacher of a school had brought up the subject at such a general exercise as has been mentioned he describes in a few words the nature of the question and in such a manner as to awaken throughout the school a strong interest in the result of the contest he then says  i wish now to make you all more fully acquainted with this case and the best way of doing it which occurs to me is as follows  there are several studies in school which throw light upon this controversy especially history geography and political economy now i shall take the classes in these studies for a day or two out of their regular course and assign them lessons which relate to this subject and then hear them recite in the general exercise that you may all hear the first class in geography may take therefore for their next lesson the state of south carolina tomorrow they will recite in the hearing of the whole school when i shall make such additional explanations as will occur to me the next day i shall assign to the class in history a passage giving an account of the formation of this government and afterwards lessons will be recited from the political class book explaining the mode of collecting money for the use of our government by duties and the relative powers of the general and state governments after hearing all these lessons recited with my remarks in addition you will be the better able to understand the subject and then i shall bring in a newspaper now and then and keep you acquainted with the progress of the affair  now the propriety of taking up the particular subject which i have here introduced by way of illustration in such a way would depend altogether upon the character and standing of the school the age and mental maturity of the scholars and their capacity to understand the circumstances of such a case and to appreciate those considerations which give interest to it the principle however is applicable to all and one such experiment dexterously carried through will do more towards giving boys and girls clear and practical ideas of the reason why they go to school and of the importance of acquiring knowledge than the best lecture on such a subject which ever was delivered  there is no branch of study attended to in school which may by judicious efforts be made more effectual in accomplishing this objectleading the pupils to see the practical utility and the value of knowledge than composition if such subjects as are suitable themes for moral essays are assigned the scholars will indeed dislike the work of writing and derive little benefit from it the mass of pupils in our schools are not to be writers of moral essays or orations and they do not need to form that style of empty florid verbose declamation which the practice of writing composition in our schools as it is too frequently managed tends to form assign practical subjectssubjects relating to the business of the schoolor the events taking place around you is there a question before the community on the subject of the location of a new schoolhouse assign it to your pupils as a question for discussion and direct them not to write empty declamation but to obtain from their parents the real arguments in the case and to present them distinctly and clearly and in simple language to their companions was a building burnt by lightning in the neighborhood let those who saw the scene describe it their productions to be read by the teacher aloud and let them see that clear descriptions please and that good legible writing can be read fluently and that correct spelling and punctuation and grammar make the article go smoothly and pleasantly and enable it to produce its full effect is a public building going forward in the neighborhood of your school you can make it a very fruitful source of subjects and questions to give interest and impulse to the studies of the schoolroom your classes in geometry may measureyour arithmeticians may calculate and make estimatesyour writers may describe its progress from week to week and anticipate the scenes which it will in future years exhibit  by such means the practical bearings and relations of the studies of the schoolroom may he constantly kept in view but i ought to guard the teacher while on this subject most distinctly against the danger of making the schoolroom a scene of literary amusement instead of study these means of awakening interest and relieving the tedium of the uninterrupted and monotonous study of text books must not encroach on the regular duties of the school they must be brought forward with judgment and moderation and made subordinate and subservient to these regular duties their design is to give spirit and interest and a feeling of practical utility to what the pupils are doing and if resorted to with these restrictions and within these limits they will produce powerful but safe results  another way to excite interest and that of the right kind in school is not to remove difficulties but to teach the pupils how to surmount them a text book so contrived as to make study mere play and to dispense with thought and effort is the worst text book that can be made and the surest to be in the end a dull one the great source of literary enjoyment which is the successful exercise of intellectual power is by such a mode of presenting a subject cut off secure therefore severe study let the pupil see that you are aiming to secure it and that the pleasure which you expect that they will receive is that of firmly and patiently encountering and overcoming difficulty of penetrating by steady and persevering effort into regions from which the idle and the inefficient are debarred and that it is your province to lead them forward not to carry them they will soon understand this and like it  never underrate the difficulties which your pupils will have to encounter or try to persuade them that what you assign is easy doing easy things is generally dull work and it is especially discouraging and disheartening for a pupil to spend his strength in doing what is really difficult for him when his instructer by calling his work easy gives him no credit for what may have been severe and protracted labor if a thing is really hard for the pupil his teacher ought to know it and admit it the child then feels that he has some sympathy  it is astonishing how great an influence may be exerted over a child by his simply knowing that his efforts are observed and appreciated you pass a boy in the street wheeling a heavy load in a barrow now simply stop to look at him with a countenance which says that is a heavy load i should not think that boy could wheel it and how quick will your look give fresh strength and vigor to his efforts on the other hand when in such a case the boy is faltering under his load try the effect of telling him why that is not heavy you can wheel it easily enough trundle it along the poor boy will drop his load disheartened and discouraged and sit down upon it in despair no even if the work you are assigning to a class is easy do not tell them so unless you wish to destroy all their spirit and interest in doing it and if you wish to excite their spirit and interest make your work difficult and let them see that you know it is so not so difficult as to tax their powers too heavily but enough so to require a vigorous and persevering effort let them distinctly understand too that you know it is difficultthat you mean to make it sobut that they have your sympathy and encouragement in the efforts which it calls them to make  you may satisfy yourself that human nature is in this respect what i have described by some such experiment as the followingselect two classes not very familiar with elementary arithmetic and offer to each of them the following example in addition       1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9      2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  1      3  4  5  6  7  8  9  1  2        c c  the numbers may be continued according to the obvious law regulating the above until each one of the nine digits has commenced the line or if you choose multiplication let the example be this       multiply  123456789      by        123456789                  now when you bring the example to one of the classes address the pupils as follows  i have contrived for you a very difficult sum it is the most difficult one that can be made with the number of figures contained in it and i do not think that any of you can do it but you may try i shall not be surprised if every answer should contain mistakes  to the other class say as follows  i have prepared an example for you which i wish you to be very careful to perform correctly it is a little longer than those you have had heretofore but it is to be performed upon the same principles and you can all do it correctly if you really try  now under such circumstances the first class will go to their seats with ardor and alacrity determined to show you that they can do work even if it is difficult and if they succeed they come to the class the next day with pride and pleasure they have accomplished something which you admit it was not easy to accomplish on the other hand the second class will go to their seats with murmuring looks and words and with a hearty dislike of the task you have assigned them they know that they have something to do which however easy it may be to the teacher is really difficult for them and they have to be perplexed and wearied with the work without having at last even the little satisfaction of knowing that the teacher appreciates the difficulties with which they had to contend  2 we now come to consider the subject of rendering assistance to the pupil which is one of the most important and delicate parts of a teachers work the great difference which exists among teachers in regard to the skill they possess in this part of their duty is so striking that it is very often noticed by others and perhaps skill here is of more avail in deciding the question of success or failure than any thing besides the first great principle is however simple and effectual  1 divide and subdivide a difficult process until your steps are so short that the pupil can easily take them  most teachers forget the difference between the pupils capacity and their own and they pass rapidly forward through a difficult train of thought in their own ordinary gait their unfortunate followers vainly trying to keep up with them the case is precisely analagous to that of the father who walks with the step of a man while his little son is by his side wearying and exhausting himself with fruitless efforts to reach his feet as far and to move them as rapidly as a full gown man  but to show what i mean by subdividing a difficult process so as to make each step simple i will take a case which may serve as an example i will suppose that the teacher of a common school undertakes to show his boys who we will suppose are acquainted with nothing but elementary arithmetic how longitude is ascertained by means of the eclipses of jupiters satellites not a very simple question as it would at first view strike one but still one which like all others may be merely by the power of the subdivision alluded to easily explained i will suppose that the subject has come up at a general exerciseperhaps the question was asked in writing by one of the older boys i will present the explanation chiefly in the form of question and answer that it may be seen that the steps are so short that the boys may take them themselves  which way asks the teacher are the rocky mountains from us  west answer two or three of the boys  in such cases as this it is very desirable that the answers should be general so that throughout the school there should be a spirited interest in the questions and replies this will never be the case if a small number of the boys only take part in the answers and many teachers complain that when they try this experiment they can seldom induce many of the pupils to take a part  the reason ordinarily is that they say that any of the boys may answer instead of that all of them may the boys do not get the idea that it is wished that an universal reply should come from all parts of the room in which every ones voice should be heard if the answers were feeble in the instance we are supposing the teacher would perhaps say  i only heard one or two answers do not more of you know where the rocky mountains are will you all think and answer together which way are they from us  west answer a large number of boys  you do not answer fully enough yet i do not think more than forty answered and there are about sixty here i should like to have every one in the room answer and all precisely together  he then repeats the question and obtains a full response a similar effort will always succeed  now does the sun in going round the earth pass over the rocky mountains or over us first  to this question the teacher hears a confused answer some do not reply some say over the rocky mountains others over us and others still the sun does not move at all  it is true that the sun strictly speaking does not move the earth turns round presenting the various countries in succession to the sun but the effect is precisely the same as it would be if the sun moved and accordingly i use that language now how long does it take the sun to pass round the earth  twenty four hours  does he go towards the west or towards the east from us  towards the west  but it is not necessary to give the replies the questions alone will be sufficient the reader will observe that they inevitably lead the pupil by short and simple steps to a clear understanding of the point to be explained  will the sun go towards or from the rocky mountains after leaving us  how long did you say it takes the sun to go round the globe and come to us again  how long to go half round quarter round  how long will it take him to go to the rocky mountains  no answer  you cannot tell it would depend upon the distance suppose then the rocky mountains were half round the globe how long would it take the sun to go to them suppose they were quarter round  the whole distance is divided into portions called degrees 360 in all how many will the sun pass in going half round in going quarter round  ninety degrees then make one quarter of the circumference of the globe this you have already said will take six hours in one hour then how many degrees will the sun pass over  perhaps no answer if so the teacher will subdivide the question on the principle we are explaining so as to make the steps such that the pupils can take them  how many degrees will the sun pass over in three hours  fortyfive  how large a part of that then will he pass in one hour  one third of it  and what is one third of fortyfive  the boys would readily answer fifteen and the teacher would then dwell for a moment on the general truth thus deduced that the sun in passing round the earth passes over fifteen degrees every hour  suppose then it takes the sun one hour to go from us to the river mississippi how many degrees west of us would the river be  having thus familiarized the pupils to the fact that the motion of the sun is a proper measure of the difference of longitude between two places the teacher must dismiss the subject for a day and when the next opportunity of bringing it forward occurs he would perhaps take up the subject of the suns motion as a measure of time  is the sun ever exactly over our heads  is he ever exactly south of us  when he is exactly south of us or in other words exactly opposite to us in his course round the earth he is said to be in our meridian for the word meridian means a line drawn exactly north or south from any place  there is no limit to the simplicity which may be imparted even to the most difficult subjects by subdividing the steps this point for instance the meaning of meridian may be the subject if it were necessary of many questions which would render it simple to the youngest child the teacher may point to the various articles in the room or buildings or other objects without and ask if they are or are not in his meridian but to proceed  when the sun is exactly opposite to us in the south at the highest point to which he rises what oclock is it  when the sun is exactly opposite to us can he be opposite to the rocky mountains  does he get opposite to the rocky mountains before or after he is opposite to us  when he is opposite to the rocky mountains what oclock is it there  is it twelve oclock here then before or after it is twelve oclock there  suppose the river mississippi is fifteen degrees from us how long is it twelve oclock here before it is twelve oclock there  when it is twelve oclock here then what time will it be there  some will probably answer one and some eleven if so the step is too long and may be subdivided thus  when it is noon here is the sun going towards the mississippi or has he passed it  then has noon gone by at that river or has it not yet come  then will it be one hour before or one hour after noon  then will it be eleven or one  such minuteness and simplicity would in ordinary cases not be necessary i go into it here merely to show how by simply subdividing the steps a subject ordinarily perplexing may be made plain the reader will observe that in the above there are no explanations by the teacher there are not even leading questions that is there are no questions whose form suggests the answers desired the pupil goes on from step to step simply because he has but one short step to take at a time  can it be noon then continues the teacher here and at a place fifteen degrees west of us at the same time  can it be noon here and at a place ten miles west of us at the same time  it is unnecessary to continue the illustration for it will be very evident to every reader that by going forward in this way the whole subject may be laid out before the pupils so that they shall perfectly understand it they can by a series of questions like the above be led to see by their own reasoning that time as denoted by the clock must differ in every two places not upon the same meridian and that the difference must be exactly proportional to the difference of longitude so that a watch which is right in one place cannot strictly speaking be right in any other place east or west of the first and that if the time of day at two places can be compared either by taking a chronometer from one to another or by observing some celestial phenomenon like the eclipses of jupiters satellites and ascertaining precisely the time of their occurrence according to the reckoning at both the distances east or west by degrees may be determined the reader will observe too that the method by which this explanation is made is strictly in accordance with the principle i am illustratingwhich is by simply dividing the process into short steps there is no ingenious reasoning on the part of the teacher no happy illustrations no apparatus no diagrams it is a pure process of mathematical reasoning made clear and easy by simple analysis  in applying this method however the teacher should be very careful not to subdivide too much it is best that the pupils should walk as fast as they can the object of the teacher should be to smooth the path not much more than barely enough to enable the pupil to go on he should not endeavor to make it very easy  2 truths must not only be taught to the pupils but they must be fixed and made familiar this is a point which seems to be very generally overlooked  can you say the multiplication table said a teacher to a boy who was standing before him in his class  yes sir  well i should like to have you say the line beginning nine times one  the boy repeated it slowly but correctly  now i should like to have you try again and i will at the same time say another line to see if i can put you out  the boy looked surprised the idea of his teachers trying to perplex and embarrass him was entirely new  you must not be afraid said the teacher you will undoubtedly not succeed in getting through but you will not be to blame for the failure i only try it as a sort of intellectual experiment  the boy accordingly began again but was soon completely confused by the teachers accompaniment he stopped in the middle of his line saying  i could say it only you put me out  well now try to say the alphabet and let me see if i can put you out there  as might have been expected the teacher failed the boy went regularly onward to the end  you see now said the teacher to the class which had witnessed the experiment that this boy knows his alphabet in a different sense from that in which he knows his multiplication table in the latter his knowledge is only imperfectly his own he can make use of it only under favorable circumstances in the former it is entirely his own circumstances have no control over him  a child has a lesson in latin grammar to recite she hesitates and stammers miscalls the cases and then corrects herself and if she gets through at last she considers herself as having recited well and very many teachers would consider it well too if she hesitates a little longer than usual in trying to summon to her recollection a particular word she says perhaps dont tell me and if she happens at last to guess right she takes her book with a countenance beaming with satisfaction  suppose you had the care of an infant school might the instructer say to such a scholar and were endeavoring to teach a little child to count and she should recite her lesson to you in this way one two four no threeone two three  stop dont tell mefiveno fourfour five   i shall think in a minutesixis that right five six c should you call that reciting well  nothing is more common than for pupils to say when they fail of reciting their lesson that they could say it at their seats but that they cannot now say it before the class when such a thing is said for the first time it should not be severely reproved because nine children in ten honestly think that if the lesson was learned so that it could be recited any where their duty is discharged but it should be kindly though distinctly explained to them that in the business of life they must have their knowledge so much at command that they can use it at all times and in all circumstances or it will do them little good  one of the most common causes of difficulty in pursuing mathematical studies or studies of any kind where the succeeding lessons depend upon those which precede is the fact that the pupil though he may understand what precedes is not familiar with it this is very strikingly the case with geometry the class study the definitions and the teacher supposes they fully understand them in fact they do understand them but the name and the thing are so feebly connected in their minds that a direct effort and a short pause are necessary to recall the idea when they hear or see the word when they come on therefore to the demonstrations which in themselves would be difficult enough they have double duty to perform the words used do not readily suggest the idea and the connexion of the ideas requires careful study under this double burden many a young geometrician sinks discouraged  a class should go on slowly and dwell on details so long as to fix firmly and make perfectly familiar whatever they undertake to learn in this manner the knowledge they acquire will become their own it will be incorporated as it were into their very minds and they cannot afterwards be deprived of it  the exercises which have for their object this rendering familiar what has been learned may be so varied as to interest the pupil very much instead of being tiresome as it might at first be supposed  suppose for instance a teacher has explained to a large class in grammar the difference between an adjective and an adverb if he leave it here in a fortnight one half would have forgotten the distinction but by dwelling upon it a few lessons he may fix it for ever the first lesson might be to write twenty short sentences containing only adjectives the second to write twenty containing only adverbs the third to write sentences in two forms one containing the adjective and the other expressing the same idea by means of the adverb arranging them in two columns thus       he writes well       his writing is good  again they may make out a list of adjectives with the adverbs derived from each in another column then they may classify adverbs on the principle of their meaning or according to their termination the exercise may be infinitely varied and yet the object of the whole may be to make perfectly familiar and to fix for ever in the mind the distinction explained  these two points seem to me to be fundamental so far as assisting pupils through the difficulties which lie in their way is concerned diminish the difficulties as far as is necessary by merely shortening and simplifying the steps and make thorough work as you go on these principles carried steadily into practice will be effectual in leading any mind through any difficulties which may occur and though they cannot perhaps be fully applied to every mind in a large school yet they can be so far acted upon in reference to the whole mass as to accomplish the object for a very large majority  3 general cautions a few miscellaneous suggestions which we shall include under this head will conclude this chapter  1 never do any thing for a scholar but teach him to do it for himself how many cases occur in the schools of our country where the boy brings his slate to the teacher saying he cannot do a certain sum the teacher takes the slate and pencilperforms the work in silencebrings the resultand returns the slate to the hands of his pupil who walks off to his seat and goes to work on the next example perfectly satisfied with the manner in which he is passing on a man who has not done this a hundred times himself will hardly believe it possible that such a practice can prevail it is so evidently a waste of time both for master and scholar  2 never get out of patience with dulness perhaps i ought to say never get out of patience with any thing that would perhaps be the wisest rule but above all things remember that dulness and stupidity and you will certainly find them in every school are the very last things to get out of patience with if the creator has so formed the mind of a boy that he must go through life slowly and with difficulty impeded by obstructions which others do not feel and depressed by discouragements which others never know his lot is surely hard enough without having you to add to it the trials and suffering which sarcasm and reproach from you can heap upon him look over your schoolroom therefore and wherever you find one whom you perceive the creator to have endued with less intellectual power than others fix your eye upon him with an expression of kindness and sympathy such a boy will have suffering enough from the selfish tyranny of his companions he ought to find in you a protector and friend one of the greatest pleasures which a teachers life affords is the interest of seeking out such an one bowed down with burdens of depression and discouragementunaccustomed to sympathy and kindness and expecting nothing for the future but a weary continuation of the cheerless toils which have imbittered the pastand the pleasure of taking off the burden of surprising the timid disheartened sufferer by kind words and cheering looks and of seeing in his countenance the expression of ease and even of happiness gradually returning  3the teacher should be interested in all his scholars and aim equally to secure the progress of all let there be no neglected ones in the school room we should always remember that however unpleasant in countenance and manners that bashful boy in the corner may be or however repulsive in appearance or unhappy in disposition that girl seeming to be interested in nobody and nobody appearing interested in her they still have each of them a mother who loves her own child and takes a deep and constant interest in its history those mothers have a right too that their children should receive their full share of attention in a school which has been established for the common and equal benefit of all  4 do not hope or attempt to make all your pupils alike providence has determined that human minds should differ from each other for the very purpose of giving variety and interest to this busy scene of life now if it were possible for a teacher so to plan his operations as to send his pupils forth upon the community formed on the same model as if they were made by machinery he would do so much towards spoiling one of the wisest of the plans which the almighty has formed for making this world a happy scene let it be the teachers aim to cooperate with not vainly to attempt to thwart the designs of providence we should bring out those powers with which the creator has endued the minds placed under our control we must open our garden to such influences as shall bring forward all the plants each in a way corresponding to its own nature it is impossible if it were wise and it would be foolish if it were possible to stimulate by artificial means the rose in hope of its reaching the size and magnitude of the appletree or to try to cultivate the fig and the orange where wheat only will grow no it should be the teachers main design to shelter his pupils from every deleterious influence and to bring every thing to bear upon the community of minds before him which will encourage in each one the developement of its own native powers for the rest he must remember that his province is to cultivate not to create  error on this point is very common many teachers even among those who have taken high rank through the success with which they have labored in this field have wasted much time in attempting to do what can never be done to form the character of those brought under their influence after a certain uniform model which they have conceived as the standard of excellence their pupils must write just such a hand they must compose in just such a style they must be similar in sentiment and feeling and their manners must be formed according to a fixed and uniform model and when in such a case a pupil comes under their charge whom providence has designed to be entirely different from the beau ideal adopted as the standard more time and pains and anxious solicitude is wasted in vain attempts to produce the desired conformity than half the school require beside  5 do not allow the faults or obliquities of character or the intellectual or moral wants of any individual of your pupils to engross a disproportionate share of your time i have already said that those who are peculiarly in need of sympathy or help should receive the special attention they seem to require what i mean to say now is do not carry this to an extreme when a parent sends you a pupil who in consequence of neglect or mismanagement at home has become wild and ungovernable and full of all sorts of wickedness he has no right to expect that you shall turn your attention away from the wide field which in your whole schoolroom lies before you to spend your time and exhaust your spirits and strength in endeavoring to repair the injuries which his own neglect has occasioned when you open a school you do not engage either openly or tacitly to make every pupil who may be sent to you a learned or a virtuous man you do engage to give them all faithful instruction and to bestow upon each such a degree of attention as is consistent with the claims of the rest but it is both unwise and unjust to neglect the many trees in your nursery which by ordinary attention may be made to grow straight and tall and to bear good fruit that you may waste your labor upon a crooked stick from which all your toil can secure very little beauty or fruitfulness  let no one now understand me to say that such cases are to be neglected i admit the propriety and in fact have urged the duty of paying to them a little more than their due share of attention what i now condemn is the practice of which all teachers are in danger of devoting such a disproportionate and unreasonable degree of attention to them as to encroach upon their duties to others the school the whole school is your field the elevation of the mass in knowledge and virtue and no individual instance either of dulness or precocity should draw you away from its steady pursuit  6 the teacher should guard against unnecessarily imbibing those faulty mental habits to which his station and employment expose him accustomed to command and to hold intercourse with minds which are immature and feeble compared with our own we gradually acquire habits that the rough collisions and the friction of active life prevent from gathering around other men narrowminded prejudices and prepossessions are imbibed through the facility with which in our own little community we adopt and maintain opinions a too strong confidence in our own views on every subject almost inevitably comes from never hearing our opinions contradicted or called in question and we express those opinions in a tone of authority and even sometimes of arrogance which we acquire in the schoolroom for there when we speak nobody can reply  these peculiarities show themselves first and in fact most commonly in the schoolroom and the opinions thus formed very often relate to the studies and management of the school one has a peculiar mode of teaching spelling which is successful almost entirely through the magic influence of his interest in it and he thinks no other mode of teaching this branch is even tolerable another must have all his pupils write on the angular system or the antiangular system and he enters with all the zeal into a controversy on the subject as if the destiny of the whole rising generation depended upon its decision tell him that all that is of any consequence in any handwriting is that it should be legible rapid and uniform and that for the rest it would be better that every human being should write a different hand and he looks upon you with astonishment wondering that you cannot see the vital importance of the question whether the vertex of an o should be pointed or round so in every thing he has his way in every minute particulara way from which he cannot deviate and to which he wishes every one else to conform  this set formal mannerism is entirely inconsistent with that commanding intellectual influence which the teacher should exert in the administration of his school he should work with what an artist calls boldness and freedom of touch activity and enterprise of mind should characterize all his measures if he wishes to make bold original and efficient men  7 assume no false appearances in your school either as to knowledge or character perhaps it may justly be said to be the common practice of teachers in this country to affect dignity of deportment in the presence of their pupils which in other cases is laid aside and to pretend to superiority in knowledge and an infallibility of judgment which no sensible man would claim before other sensible men but which an absurd fashion seems to require of the teacher it can however scarcely be said to be a fashion for the temptation is almost exclusively confined to the young and the ignorant who think they must make up by appearance what they want in reality very few of the older and more experienced and successful instructers in our country fall into it at all but some young beginner whose knowledge is very limited and who in manner and habits has only just ceased to be a boy walks into his schoolroom with a countenance of forced gravity and with a dignified and solemn step which is ludicrous even to himself i describe accurately for i describe from recollection this unnatural and forced and ludicrous dignity cleaves to him like disease through the whole period of his duty in the presence of his scholars he is always under restraintassuming a stiff and formal dignity which is as ridiculous as it is unnatural he is also obliged to resort to arts which are certainly not very honorable to conceal his ignorance  a scholar for example brings him a sum in arithmetic which he does not know how to perform this may be the case with a most excellent teacherand one well qualified for his business in order to be successful as a teacher it is not necessary to understand every thing instead however of saying frankly i do not understand that example i will look at it and examine it he looks at it embarrassed and perplexed not knowing how he shall escape the exposure of his ignorance his first thought is to give some general directions to the pupil and send him to his seat to make a new experiment hoping that in some way or other he scarcely knows how he will get through and at any rate if he does not the teacher at least gains time by manoeuvre and is glad to postpone his trouble though he knows it must soon return  all efforts to conceal ignorance and all affectation of knowledge not possessed are as unwise as they are dishonest if a scholar asks a question which you cannot answer or brings you a difficulty which you cannot solve say frankly i do not know it is the only way to avoid continual anxiety and irritation and the surest means of securing real respect let the scholars understand that the superiority of the teacher does not consist in his infallibility or in his universal acquisitions but in a well balanced mind where the boundary between knowledge and ignorance is distinctly marked in a strong desire to go forward in mental improvement and in fixed principles of action and systematic habits you may even take up in school a study entirely new to you and have it understood at the outset that you know no more of it than the class commencing but that you can be their guide on account of the superior maturity and discipline of your powers and the comparative ease with which you can meet and overcome difficulties this is the understanding which ought always to exist between master and scholars the fact that the teacher does not know every thing cannot long be concealed if he tries to conceal it and in this as in every other case honesty is the best policy     chapter iv  moral discipline   under the title which i have placed at the head of this chapter i intend to discuss the methods by which the teacher is to secure a moral ascendency over his pupils so that he may lead them to do what is right and bring them back to duty when they do what is wrong i shall use in what i have to say a very plain and familiar style and as very much depends not only on the general principles by which the teacher is actuated but also on the tone and manner in which in cases of discipline he addresses his pupils i shall describe particular cases real and imaginary because by this method i can better illustrate the course to be pursued i shall also present and illustrate the various principles which i consider important and in the order in which they occur to my mind  1 the first duty then of the teacher when he enters his school is to beware of the danger of making an unfavorable impression at first upon his pupils many years ago when i was a child the teacher of the school where my early studies were performed closed his connexion with the establishment and after a short vacation another was expected on the appointed day the boys began to collect some from curiosity at an early hour and many speculations were started as to the character of the new instructer we were standing near a table with our hats onand our position and the exact appearance of the group is indelibly fixed on my memorywhen a small and youthful looking man entered the room and walked up towards us supposing him to be some stranger or rather not making any supposition at all we stood looking at him as he approached and were thunderstruck at hearing him accost us with a stern voice and sterner brow take off your hats take off your hats and go to your seats the conviction immediately rushed upon our minds that this must be our new teacher the first emotion was that of surprise and the second was that of the ludicrous though i believe we contrived to smother the laugh until we got out into the open air  so long since was this little occurrence that i have entirely forgotten the name of the teacher and have not the slightest recollection of any other act in his administration of the school but this recollection of his first greeting of his pupils and the expression of his countenance at the moment will go with me to the end of life so strong are first impressions  be careful then when you first see your pupils that you meet them with a smile i do not mean a pretended cordiality which has no existence in the heart but think of the relation which you are to sustain to them and think of the very interesting circumstances under which for some months at least your destinies are to be united to theirs until you cannot help feeling a strong interest in them shut your eyes for a day or two to their faults if possible and take an interest in all their pleasures and pursuits that the first attitude in which you exhibit yourself before them may be one which shall allure not repel  2 in endeavoring to correct the faults of your pupils do not as many teachers do seize only upon those particular cases of transgression which may happen to come under your notice these individual instances are very few probably compared with the whole number of faults against which you ought to exert an influence and though you perhaps ought not to neglect those which may accidentally come under your notice yet the observing and punishing such cases is a very small part of your duty  you accidentally hear i will suppose as you are walking home from school two of your boys in earnest conversation and one of them uses profane language now the course to be pursued in such a case is most evidently not to call the boy to you the next day and punish him and there let the matter rest this would perhaps be better than nothing but the chief impression which it would make upon the individual and upon the other scholars would be i must take care how i let the master hear me use such language again a wise teacher who takes enlarged and extended views of his duty in regard to the moral progress of his pupils would act very differently he would look at the whole subject does this fault he would say to himself prevail among my pupils if so how extensively it is comparatively of little consequence to punish the particular transgression the great point is to devise some plan to reach the whole evil and to correct it if possible  in one case where such a circumstance occurred the teacher managed it most successfully in the following way  he said nothing to the boy and in fact the boy did not know that he was overheard he allowed a day or two to elapse so that the conversation might be forgotten and then took an opportunity one day after school when all things had gone on pleasantly and the school was about to be closed to bring forward the whole subject he told the boys that he had something to say to them after they had laid by their books and were ready to go the desks were soon closed and every face in the room was turned towards the master with a look of fixed attention it was almost evening the sun had gone down the boys labors were over the day was done and their minds were at rest and every thing was favorable for making a deep and permanent impression  a few days ago says the teacher when all was still i accidentally overheard some conversation between two of the boys of this school and one of them swore  there was a pause  perhaps you expect that i am now going to call the boy out and punish him is that what i ought to do  there was no answer  i think a boy who uses bad language of any kind does what he knows is wrong he breaks gods commands he does what he knows would be displeasing to his parents and he sets a bad example he does wrong therefore and justly deserves punishment  there were of course many boys who felt that they were in danger every one who had used profane language was aware that he might be the one who had been overheard and of course all were deeply interested in what the teacher was saying  he might i say continued the teacher justly be punished but i am not going to punish him for if i should i am afraid that it would only make him a little more careful hereafter not to commit this sin when i could possibly be within hearing instead of persuading him as i wish to to avoid such a sin in future altogether i am satisfied that that boy would be far happier even in this world if he would make it a principle always to do his duty and never in any case to do wrong and then when i think how soon he and all of us will be in another world where we shall all be judged for what we do here i feel strongly desirous of persuading him to abandon entirely this practice i am afraid that punishing him now would not do that  besides continues the teacher i think it very probable that there are many other boys in this school who are sometimes guilty of this fault and i have thought that it would be a great deal better and happier for us all if instead of punishing this particular boy whom i have accidentally overheard and who probably is not more to blame than many other boys in school i should bring up the whole subject and endeavor to persuade all to reform  i am aware that there are unfortunately in our country a great many teachers from whose lips such an appeal as this would be wholly in vain the man who is accustomed to scold and storm and punish with unsparing severity every transgression under the influence of irritation and anger must not expect that he can win over his pupils to confidence in him and to the principles of duty by a word but such an appeal will not be lost when it comes from a man whose daily and habitual management corresponds with it but to return to the story  the teacher made some farther remarks explaining the nature of the sin not in the language of execration and affected abhorrence but calmly temperately and without any disposition to make the worst of the occurrence which had taken place in concluding what he said he addressed the boys as follows  now boys the question is do you wish to abandon this habit or not if you do all is well i shall immediately forget all the past and will do all i can to help you resist and overcome temptation in future but all i can do is only to help you and the first thing to be done if you wish to engage in this work of reform is to acknowledge your fault and i should like to know how many are willing to do this  i wish all those who are willing to tell me whether they use profane language would rise  every individual but one rose  i am very glad to see so large a number said the teacher and i hope you will find that the work of confessing and forsaking your faults is on the whole pleasant not painful business now those who can truly and honestly say that they never do use profane language of any kind may take their seats  three only of the whole number which consisted of not far from 20 sat down it was in a seaport town where the temptation to yield to this vice is even greater than would be in the interior of our country supposed possible  those who are now standing pursued the teacher admit that they do sometimes at least commit this sin i suppose all however are determined to reform for i do not know what else should induce you to rise and acknowledge it here unless it is a desire hereafter to break yourselves of the habit but do you suppose that it will be enough for you merely to resolve here that you will reform  no sir said the boys  why if you now sincerely determine never more to use a profane word will you not easily avoid it  the boys were silent some said faintly no sir  it will not be easy for you to avoid the sin hereafter continued the teacher even if you do now sincerely and resolutely determine to do so you have formed the habit of sin and the habit will not be easily overcome but i have detained you long enough now i will try to devise some method by which you may carry your plan into effect and tomorrow i wilt tell you what it is  so they were dismissed for the day the pleasant countenance and cheerful tone of the teacher conveying to them the impression that they were engaging in the common effort to accomplish a most desirable purpose in which they were to receive the teachers help not that he was pursuing them with threatening and punishment into the forbidden practice into which they had wickedly strayed great caution is however in such a case necessary to guard against the danger that the teacher in attempting to avoid the tones of irritation and anger should so speak of the sin as to blunt their sense of its guilt and lull their consciences into a slumber  at the appointed time on the following day the subject was again brought before the school and some plans proposed by which the resolutions now formed might be more certainly kept these plans were readily and cheerfully adopted by the boys and in a short time the vice of profaneness was in a great degree banished from the school this whole account is substantially fact  i hope the reader will keep in mind the object of the above illustration which is to show that it is the true policy of the teacher not to waste his time and strength in contending against such accidental instances of transgression as may chance to fall under his notice but to take an enlarged and extended view of the whole ground endeavoring to remove whole classes of faultsto elevate and improve multitudes together  by these means his labors will not only be more effectual but far more pleasant you cannot come into collision with an individual scholar to punish him for a mischievous spirit or even to rebuke him for some single act by which he has given you trouble without an uncomfortable and uneasy feeling which makes in ordinary cases the discipline of a school the most unpleasant part of a teachers duty but you can plan a campaign against a whole class of faults and put into operation a system of measures to correct them and watch from day to day the operation of that system with all the spirit and interest of a game it is in fact a game where your ingenuity and moral power are brought into the field in opposition to the evil tendencies of the hearts which are under your influence you will notice the success or the failure of the means you may put into operation with all the interest with which the experimental philosopher observes the curious processes he guides though your interest may be much purer and higher for he works upon matter but you are experimenting upon mind  remember then as for the first time you take your new station that it is not your duty simply to watch with an eagle eye for those accidental instances of transgression which may chance to fall under your notice you are to look over the whole ground you are to make yourself acquainted as soon as possible with the classes of character and classes of faults which may prevail in your dominions and to form deliberate and well digested plans for improving the one and correcting the other  and this is to be the course pursued not only with great delinquencies such as those to which i have already alluded but to every little transgression against the rules of order and propriety you can correct them far more easily and pleasantly in the mass than in detail  to illustrate this principle by another case a teacher who takes the course i am condemning approaches the seat of one of his pupils and asks to see one of his books as the boy opens his desk the teacher observes that it is in complete disorder books maps papers playthings are there in promiscuous confusion and from the impulse of the moment the displeased teacher pours out upon the poor boy a torrent of reproach  what a looking desk why john i am really ashamed of you look continues he holding up the lid so that the boys in the neighborhood can look in see what a mass of disorder and confusion if ever i see your desk in such a state again i shall most certainly punish you  the boys around laugh very equivocally however for with the feeling of amusement there is mingled the fear that the angry master may take it into his head to inspect their dominions the boy accidentally exposed looks sullen and begins to throw his books into some sort of arrangement just enough to shield himself from the charge of absolutely disobeying and there the matter ends  another teacher takes no apparent notice of the confusion he thus accidentally witnesses i must take up thinks he to himself the subject of order before the whole school i have not yet spoken of it he thanks the boy for the book he borrowed and goes away he makes a memorandum of the subject and the boy does not know that the condition of his desk was noticed perhaps he does not even know that there was any thing amiss  a day or two after at a time regularly appropriated to such subjects he addresses the boys as follows  in our efforts to improve the school as much as possible there is one subject which we must not forget i mean the order of the desks  the boys all begin to open their desk lids  you may stop a moment says the teacher i shall give you all an opportunity to examine your desks presently  i do not know what the condition of your desks is i have not examined them and have not in fact seen the inside of more than one or two as i have not brought up this subject before i presume that there are a great many which can be arranged better than they are will you all now look into your desks and see whether you consider them in good order stop a moment however let me tell you what good order is all those things which are alike should be arranged together books should be in one place papers in another and thus every thing should be classified again every thing should be so placed that it can be taken out without disturbing other things there is another principle also which i will mention the various articles should have constant placesthat is they should not be changed from day to day by this means you soon remember where every thing belongs and you can put away your things much more easily every night than if you had every night to arrange them in a new way now will you look into your desks and tell me whether they are on these three principles well arranged  the boys of most schools where this subject had not been regularly attended to would nearly all answer in the negative  i will allow you then some time today fifteen minutes to arrange them and i hope you will try to keep them in good order hereafter a few days hence i shall examine them if any of you wish for assistance or advice from me in putting them in order i shall be happy to render it  by such a plan which will occupy but little more time than the irritating and useless scolding which i supposed in the other case how much more will be accomplished such an address would of itself probably be the means of putting in order and keeping in order at least one half and following up the plan in the same manner and in the same spirit with which it was begun would secure the rest  i repeat it therefore make it a principle in all cases to aim as much as possible at the correction of those faults which are likely to be general by general measures you avoid by this means a vast amount of irritation and impatience both on your own part and on the part of your scholars and you produce at least twenty times the useful effect  3 the next principle which occurs to me as deserving the teachers attention in the outset of his course is this  interest your scholars in doing something themselves to elevate the moral character of the school so as to secure a decided majority who will of their own accord cooperate with you  let your pupils understand not by any formal speech you make to that effect but by the manner in which from time to time you incidentally allude to the subject that you consider the school when you commence it as at par so to speakthat is on a level with other schools and that your various plans for improving and amending it are not to be considered in the light of finding fault and punishing transgressions and controlling evil propensities so as just to keep things in a tolerable state but as efforts to improve and carry forward to a state of excellence not yet attained all the affairs of the institution such is the tone and manner of some teachers that they never appear to be more than merely satisfied when the scholars do right nothing is said about it the teacher seems to consider that a matter of course it does not appear to interest or please him at all nothing arouses him but when they do wrong and that only excites him to anger and frowns now in such a case there can of course be no stimulus to effort on the part of the pupils but the cold and heartless stimulus of fear  now it is wrong for the teacher to expect that things will go right in his school as a matter of course all that he can expect as a matter of course is that things should go on as well as they do ordinarily in schoolsthe ordinary amount of idlenessthe ordinary amount of misconduct this is the most that he can expect to come as a matter of course he should feel this and then all he can gain which will be better than this will be a source of positive pleasure a pleasure which his pupils have procured for him and which consequently they should share they should understand that the teacher is engaged in various plans for improving the school in which they should be invited to engage not from the selfish desire of thereby saving him trouble but because it will really be happy employment for them to engage in such an enterprise and because by such efforts their own moral powers will be exerted and strengthened in the best possible way  in another chapter i have explained to what extent and in what manner the assistance of the pupils may be usefully and successfully employed in carrying forward the general arrangements of the school the same principles will apply here though perhaps a little more careful and delicate management is necessary in interesting them in subjects which relate to moral discipline  one important method of doing this is to present these plans before the minds of the scholars as experimentsmoral experiments whose commencement progress and results they may take a great interest in witnessing let us take for example the case alluded to under the last headthe plan of effecting a reform in regard to keeping desks in order suppose the teacher were to say when the time had arrived at which he had promised to give them an opportunity to put them in order  i think it would be a good plan to keep some account of our efforts for improving the school in this respect we might make a record of what we do today noting the day of the month and the number of desks which may be found to be disorderly then at the end of any time you may propose we will have the desks examined again and see how many are disorderly we can then see how much improvement has been made in that time should you like to adopt the plan  if the boys should appear not much interested in the proposal the teacher might at his own discretion waive it in all probability however they would like it and would indicate their interest by their countenances or perhaps by a response if so the teacher might proceed  you may all examine your desks then and decide whether they are in order or not i do not know however but that we ought to appoint a committee to examine them for perhaps all the boys would not be honest and report their desks as they really are  yes sir yes sir say the boys  do you mean that you will be honest or that you would like to have a committee appointed  there was a confused murmur some answer one and some the other  i think proceeds the teacher the boys will be honest and report their desks just as they are at any rate the number of dishonest boys in this school cannot be so large as materially to affect the result i think we had better take your own statements as soon as the desks are all examined those who have found theirs in a condition which does not satisfy them are requested to rise and be counted  the teacher then looks around the room and selecting some intelligent boy who has influence among his companions and whose influence he is particularly desirous of enlisting on the side of good order says shall i nominate some one to keep an account of this plan  yes sir say the boys  well i nominate william jones how many are in favor of requesting william jones to perform this duty  it is a vote william i will thank you to write upon a piece of paper that on the 8th of december the subject of order in the desks was brought up and that the boys resolved on making an effort to improve the school in this respect then say that the boys reported all their desks which they thought were disorderly and that the number was 35 and that after a week or two the desks are to be examined again and the disorderly ones counted that we may see how much we have improved after you have written it you may bring it to me and i will tell you whether it is right  how many desks do you think will be found to be disorderly when we come to make the examination  the boys hesitate  the teacher names successively several numbers and asks whether they think the real number will be greater or less he notices their votes upon them and at last fixes upon one which seems to be about the general sense of the school then the teacher himself mentions the number which he supposes will be found to be disorderly his estimate will ordinarily be larger than that of the scholars because he knows better how easily resolutions are broken this number too is recorded and then the whole subject is dismissed  now of course no reader of these remarks will understand me to be recommending by this imaginary dialogue for the whole of it is imaginary a particular course to be taken in regard to this subject far less the particular language to be used all i mean is to show by a familiar illustration how the teacher is to endeavor to enlist the interest and to excite the curiosity of his pupils in his plans for the improvement of his school by presenting them as moral experiments which they are to assist him in tryingexperiments whose progress they are to watch and whose results they are to predict if the precise steps which i have described should actually be taken although it would occupy but a few minutes and would cause no thought and no perplexing care yet it would undoubtedly be the means of awakening a very general interest in the subject of order throughout the school all would be interested in the work of arrangement  all would watch too with interest the progress and the result of the experiment and if a few days after the teacher should accidentally in recess see a disorderly desk a pleasant remark made with a smile to the bystanders i suspect my prediction will turn out the correct one would have far more effect than the most severe reproaches or the tingling of a rap over the knuckles with a rattan  i know from experience that scholars of every kind can be led by such measures as these or rather by such a spirit as this to take an active interest and to exert a most powerful influence in regard to the whole condition of the institution i have seen the experiment successful in boys schools and in girls schools among very little children and among the seniors and juniors at college  in one of the colleges of new england a new and beautiful edifice was erected the lecture rooms were fitted up in handsome style and the officers when the time for the occupation of the building approached were anticipating with regret what seemed to be the unavoidable defacing and cutting and marking of the seats and walls it was however thought that if the subject was properly presented to the students they would take an interest in preserving the property from injury they were accordingly addressed somewhat as follows  it seems young gentlemen to be generally the custom in colleges for the students to ornament the walls and benches of their recitation rooms with various inscriptions and carricatures so that after the premises have been for a short time in the possession of a class every thing within reach which will take an impression from a penknife or a trace from a pencil is covered with names and dates and heads and inscriptions of every kind the faculty do not know what you wish in this respect in regard to the new accommodations which the trustees have now provided for you and which you are soon to enter they have had them fitted up for you handsomely and if you wish to have them kept in good order we will assist you if the students think proper to express by a vote or in any other way their wish to keep them in good order we will engage to have such incidental injuries as may from time to time occur immediately repaired such injuries will of course be done for whatever may be the wish and general opinion of the whole it is not to be expected that every individual in so large a community will be careful if however as a body you wish to have the building preserved in its present state and will as a body take the necessary precautions we will do our part  the students responded to this appeal most heartily they passed a vote expressing a desire to preserve the premises in order and for many years and for ought i know to the present hour the whole is kept as a room occupied by gentlemen should be kept at some other colleges and those too sustaining the very highest rank among the institutions of the country the doors of the public buildings are sometimes studded with nails as thick as they can possibly be driven and then covered with a thick coat of sand dried into the paint as a protection from the knives of the students  the particular methods by which the teacher is to interest his pupils in his various plans for their improvement cannot be very fully described here in fact it does not depend so much on the methods he adopts as upon the view which he himself takes of these plans and the tone and manner in which he speaks of them to his pupils  a teacher for example perhaps on the first day of his labors in a new school calls a class to read they pretend to form a line but it crooks in every direction one boy is leaning back against a desk another comes forward as far as possible to get near the fire the rest lounge in every position and in every attitude john is holding up his book high before his face to conceal an apple from which he is endeavoring to secure an enormous bite james is by the same sagacious device concealing a whisper which he is addressing to his next neighbor and moses is seeking amusement by crowding and elbowing the little boy who is unluckily standing next him  what a spectacle says the master to himself as he looks at this sad display what shall i do the first impulse is to break forth upon them at once with all the artillery of reproof and threatening and punishment i have seen in such a case a scolding and frowning master walk up and down before such a class with a stern and angry air commanding this one to stand back and that to come forward ordering one boy to put down his book and scolding at a second for having lost his place and knocking the knees of another with his rule because he was out of the line the boys scowl at their teacher and with illnatured reluctance they obey just enough to escape punishment  another teacher looks calmly at the scene and says to himself what shall i do to remove effectually these evils if i can but interest the boys in reform it will be far more easy to effect it than if i attempt to accomplish it by the mere exercise of my authority  in the meantime things go on during the reading in their own way the teacher simply observes he is in no haste to commence his operations he looks for the faults watches without seeming to watch the movements which he is attempting to control he studies the materials with which he is to work and lets their true character develope itself he tries to find something to approve in the exercise as it proceeds and endeavors to interest the class by narrating some fact connected with the reading or making some explanation which interests the boys at the end of the exercise he addresses them perhaps as follows  i have observed boys in some military companies that the officers are very strict requiring implicit and precise obedience the men are required to form a precise line here there is a sort of involuntary movement all along the line by which it is very sensibly straightened they make all the men stand erect at this word heads go up and straggling feet draw in all along the class in the true military posture they allow nothing to be done in the ranks but to attend to the exercise john hastily crowds his apple into his pocket and thus they regulate every thing in exact and steady discipline so that all things go on in a most systematic and scientific manner this discipline is so admirable in some countries especially in europe where much greater attention is paid to military tactics than in our country that i have heard it said by travellers that some of the soldiers who mount guard at public places look as much like statues as they do like living men  other commanders act differently they let the men do pretty much as they please so you will see such a company lounging into a line when the drum beats as if they took little interest in what was going on while the captain is giving his commands one is eating his luncheon another is talking with his next neighbor part are out of the line part lounge on one foot they hold their guns in every position and on the whole present a very disorderly and unsoldierlike appearance  i have observed too that boys very generally prefer to see the strict companies but perhaps they would prefer to belong to the lax ones  no sir no sir say the boys  suppose you all had your choice either to belong to a company like the first one i described where the captain was strict in all his requirements or to one like the latter where you could do pretty much as you pleased which should you prefer  unless i entirely mistaken in my idea of the inclinations of boys it would be very difficult to get a single honest expression of preference for the latter they would say with one voice  the first  i suppose it would be so you would be put to some inconvenience by the strict commands of the captain but then you would be more than paid by the beauty of regularity and order which you would all witness there is nothing so pleasant as regularity and nobody likes regularity more than boys do to show this i should like to have you now form a line as exact as you can  after some unnecessary shoving and pushing increased by the disorderly conduct of a few bad boys a line is formed most of the class are pleased with the experiment and the teacher takes no notice of the few exceptions the time to attend to them will come by and by  hands down the boys obey  shoulders back  therethere is a very perfect line  do you stand easily in that position  yes sir  i believe your position is the military one now pretty nearly and military men study the postures of the human body for the sake of finding the one most easy for they wish to preserve as much as possible of the soldiers strength for the time of battle i should like to try the experiment of your standing thus at the next lesson it is a very great improvement upon your common mode are you willing to do it  yes sir say the boys  you will get tired i have no doubt in fact i do not expect you will succeed the first day very well you will probably become restless and uneasy before the end of the lesson especially the smaller boys i must excuse it i suppose if you do as it will be the first time  by such methods as these the teacher will certainly secure a majority in favor of all his plans but perhaps some experienced teacher who knows from his own repeated difficulties with bad boys what sort of spirits the teacher of district schools has sometimes to deal with may ask as he reads this  do you expect that such a method as this will succeed in keeping your school in order why there are boys in almost every school whom you would no more coax into obedience and order in this way than you would persuade the northeast wind to change its course by reasoning  i know there are and my readers are requested to bear in mind that my object is not now to show how the whole government of the school may be secured but how one important advantage may be gained which will assist in accomplishing the object all i should expect or hope for by such measures as these is to interest and gain over to our side the majority what is to be done with those who cannot be reached by such kinds of influence i shall endeavor presently to show the object now is simply to gain the majorityto awaken a general interest which you can make effectual in promoting your plans and thus to narrow the field of discipline by getting those right who can be got right by such measures  thus securing a majority to be on your side in the general administration of the school is absolutely indispensable to success a teacher may by the force of mere authority so control his pupils as to preserve order in the schoolroom and secure a tolerable progress in study but the heart will not be in it the progress in knowledge must accordingly be in ordinary cases slow and the cultivation of moral principle must be in such a case entirely neglected the principles of duty cannot be inculcated by fear and though pain and terror must in many instances be called in to coerce an individual offender whom milder measures will not reach yet these agents and others like them can never be successfully employed as the ordinary motives to action they cannot produce any thing but mere external and heartless obedience in the presence of the teacher with an inclination to throw off all restraint when the pressure of stern authority is removed  we should all remember that our pupils are but a very short time under our direct control even when they are in school the most untiring vigilance will not enable us to watch except for a very small portion of the time any individual many hours of the day too they are entirely removed from our inspection and a few months will take them away from us altogether subjecting them then to mere external restraint is a very inadequate remedy for the moral evil to which they are exposed what we aim at is to bring forward and strengthen an internal principle which will act when both parent and teacher are away and control where external circumstances are all unfavorable  i have thus far under this head been endeavoring to show the importance of securing by gentle measures a majority of the scholars to cooperate with the teacher in his plans the methods of doing this demand a little attention  1 the teacher should study human nature as it exhibits itself in the schoolroom by taking an interest in the sports and enjoyments of the pupils and connecting as much as possible what is interesting and agreeable with the pursuits of the school so as to lead the scholars to like the place an attachment to the institution and to the duties of it will give the teacher a very strong hold upon the community of mind which exists there  2 every thing which is unpleasant in the discipline of the school should be attended to as far as possible privately sometimes it is necessary to bring a case forward in public for reproof or punishment but this is seldom in some schools it is the custom to postpone cases of discipline till the close of the day and then just before the boys are dismissed at night all the difficulties are settled thus day after day the impression which is last made upon their minds is received from a season of suffering and terror and tears  now such a practice may be attended with many advantages but it seems to be on the whole unwise awing the pupils by showing them the consequences of doing wrong should be very seldom resorted to it is far better to allure them by showing them the pleasures of doing right doing right is pleasant to every body and no persons are so easily convinced of this or rather so easily led to see it as children now the true policy is to let them experience the pleasure of doing their duty and they will easily be allured to it  in many cases where a fault has been publicly committed it seems at first view to be necessary that it should be publicly punished but the end will in most cases be answered if it is noticed publicly so that the pupils may know that it received attention and then the ultimate disposal of the case may be made a private affair between the teacher and the individual concerned if however every case of disobedience or idleness or disorder is brought out publicly before the school so that all witness the teachers displeasure and feel the effects of it for to witness it is to feel its most unpleasant effects the school becomes in a short time hardened to such scenes unpleasant associations become connected with the management of the school and the scholars are prepared to do wrong with less reluctance since the consequence is only a repetition of what they are obliged to see every day  besides if a boy does something wrong and you severely reprove him in the presence of his class you punish the class almost as much as you do him in fact in many cases you punish them more for i believe it is almost invariably more unpleasant for a good boy to stand by and listen to rebukes than for a bad boy to take them keep these things therefore as much as possible out of sight never bring forward cases of discipline except on mature deliberation and for a distinct and welldefined purpose  3 never bring forward a case of discipline of this kind unless you are sure that public opinion will go in your favor if a case comes up in which the sympathy of the scholars is excited for the criminal in such a way as to be against yourself it will always do more harm than good now this unless there is great caution will often be the case in fact it is probable that a very large proportion of the punishments which are ordinarily inflicted in schools only prepare the way for more offences  it is however possible to bring forward individual cases in such a way as to produce a very strong moral effect of the right kind this is to be done by seizing upon those peculiar emergencies which will arise in the course of the administration of a school and which each teacher must watch for and discover himself they cannot be pointed out i may however give a clearer idea of what is meant by such emergencies by an example it is a case which actually occurred as here narrated  in a school where nearly all the pupils were faithful and docile there were one or two boys who were determined to find amusement in those mischievous tricks so common in schools and colleges there was one boy in particular who was the life and soul of all these plans devoid of principle idle as a scholar morose and sullen in his manners he was in every respect a true specimen of the whole class of mischiefmakers wherever they are to be found his mischief consisted as usual in such exploits as stopping up the keyhole upsetting the teachers inkstand or fixing something to his desk to make a noise and interrupt the school  it so happened that there was a standing feud between the boys of his neighborhood and those of another situated a mile or two from it by his malicious activity he had stimulated this quarrel to a high pitch and was very obnoxious to the boys of the other party one day when taking a walk the teacher observed a number of boys with excited looks and armed with sticks and stones standing around a shoemakers shop to which his poor pupil had gone for refuge from them they had got him completely within their power and were going to wait until he should be wearied with his confinement and come out when they were going to inflict upon him the punishment they thought he deserved  the teacher interfered and by the united influence of authority management and persuasion succeeded in effecting a rescue the boy would probably have preferred to owe his safety to any one else than to the teacher whom he had so often tried to tease but he was glad to escape in any way the teacher said nothing about the subject and the boy soon supposed it was entirely forgotten  but it was not forgotten the teacher knew perfectly well that the boy would before long be at his old tricks again and was reserving this story as the means of turning the whole current of public opinion against such tricks should they again occur  one day he came to school in the afternoon and found the room filled with smoke the doors and windows were all closed though as soon as he came in some of the boys opened them he knew by this circumstance that it was roguery not accident which caused the smoke he appeared not to notice it however said he was sorry it smoked and asked the mischievous boy for he was sure to be always near in such a case to help him fix the fire the boy supposed it was understood to be accidental and perhaps secretly laughed at the dulness of his master  in the course of the afternoon the teacher ascertained by private inquiries that his suspicions were correct as to the author of the mischief at the close of school when the studies were ended and the books laid away he told the scholars that he wanted to tell them a story  he then with a pleasant tone and manner gave a very minute and to the boys a very interesting narrative of his adventure two or three weeks before when he rescued this boy from his danger he called him however simply a boy without mentioning his name or even hinting that he was a member of the school no narrative could excite a stronger interest among an audience of schoolboys than such an one as this and no act of kindness from a teacher would make as vivid an impression as interfering to rescue a trembling captive from such a situation as the one this boy had been in  the scholars listened with profound interest and attention and though the teacher said little about his share in the affair and spoke of what he did as if it were a matter of course that he should thus befriend a boy in distress an impression very favorable to himself must have been made after he had finished his narrative he said  now should you like to know who this boy was  yes sir yes sir said they eagerly  it was a boy that you all know  the boys looked around upon one another who could it be  he is a member of this school  there was an expression of fixed and eager and increasing interest on every face in the room  he is here now said the teacher winding up the interest and curiosity of the scholars by these words to the highest pitch  but i cannot tell you his name for what return do you think he made to me to be sure it was no very great favor that i did him i should have been unworthy the name of teacher if i had not done it for him or for any boy in my school but at any rate it showed my good wishes for himit showed that i was his friend and what return do you think he made me for it why today he spent his time between schools in filling the room with smoke that he might torment his companions here and give me trouble and anxiety and suffering when i should come if i should tell you his name the whole school would turn against him for his ingratitude  the business ended here and it put a stop a final stop to all malicious tricks in the school now it is not very often that so fine an opportunity occurs to kill by a single blow the disposition to do wilful wanton injury as this circumstance afforded but the principle illustrated by itbringing forward individual cases of transgression in a public manner only for the sake of the general effect and so arranging what is said and done as to produce the desired effect upon the public mind in the highest degree may very frequently be acted upon cases are continually occurring and if the teacher will keep it constantly in mind that when a particular case comes before the whole school the object is an influence upon the whole and not the punishment or reform of the guilty individual he will insensibly so shape his measures as to produce the desired result  4 there should be a great difference made between the measures you take to prevent wrong and the feelings of displeasure against wrong when it is done the former should be strict authoritative unbending the latter should be mild and gentle your measures if uniform and systematic will never give offence however powerfully you may restrain and control it is the morose look the harsh expression the tone of irritation and fretfulness which is so unpopular in school the sins of childhood are by nine tenths of mankind enormously overrated and perhaps none overrate them more extravagantly than teachers we confound the trouble they give us with their real moral turpitude and measure the one by the other now if a fault prevails in school one teacher will scold and fret himself about it day after day until his scholars are tired both of school and of him and yet he will do nothing effectual to remove it another will take efficient and decided measures and yet say very little on the subject and the whole evil will be removed without suspending for a moment the good humor and pleasant feeling which should prevail in school  the expression of your displeasure on account of any thing that is wrong will seldom or never do any good the scholars consider it scolding it is scolding and though it may in many cases contain many sound arguments and eloquent expostulations it operates simply as a punishment it is unpleasant to hear it general instruction must indeed be given but not general reproof  5 feel that in the management of the school you are under obligation as well as the scholars and let this feeling appear in all that you do your scholars wish you to dismiss school earlier than usual on some particular occasion or to allow them an extra holiday show by the manner in which you consider and speak of the question that your main inquiry is what is your duty speak often of your responsibility to your employers not formally but incidentally and naturally as you will speak if you feel this responsibility  it will assist very much too in securing cheerful goodhumored obedience to the regulations of the school if you extend their authority over yourself not that the teacher is to have no liberty from which the scholars are debarred this would be impossible but the teacher should submit himself to every thing which he requires of his scholars unless it is in cases where a different course is necessary  suppose for instance a study card like the one described in a preceding chapter is made so as to mark the time of recess and of study the teacher near the close of recess is sitting with a group of his pupils around him telling them some story they are all interested and they see he is interested he looks at his watch and shows by his manner that he is desirous of finishing what he is saying but that he knows that the striking of the bell will cut short his story perhaps he says not a word about it but his pupils see that he is submitting to the control which is placed over them and when the card goes up and he stops instantly in the middle of his sentence and rises with the rest each one to go to his own place to engage at once in their several duties he teaches them a most important lesson and in the most effectual way such a lesson of fidelity and obedience and such an example of it will have more influence than a half hours scolding about whispering without leave or a dozen public punishments at least so i find it for i have tried both  show then continually that you see and enjoy the beauty of system and strict discipline and that you submit to it yourself as well as require it of others  6 lead your pupils to see that they must share with you the credit or the disgrace which success or failure may bring lead them to feel this not by telling them so for there are very few things which can be impressed upon children by direct efforts to impress them but by so speaking of the subject from time to time as to lead them to see that you understand it so  repeat with judicious caution what is said of the school both for and against it and thus endeavor to interest the scholars in its public reputation this feeling of interest in the institution may very easily be awakened it sometimes springs up spontaneously and where it is not guided aright by the teacher sometimes produces very bad effects upon the minds of the pupils in rival institutions when two schools are situated near each other evil consequences will result from this feeling unless the teacher manages it so as to deduce good consequences i recollect that in my boyish days there was a standing quarrel between the boys of a town school and an academy which were in the same village we were all ready at any time when out of school to fight for the honor of our respective institutions but very few were ready to be diligent and faithful when in it though it would seem that that might have been rather a more effectual means of establishing the point if the scholars are led to understand that the school is to a great extent their institution that they must assist to sustain its character and that they share the honor if any honor is acquired a feeling will prevail in the school which may be turned to a most useful account  7 in giving instruction on moral duty the subject should be taken up generally in reference to imaginary cases or cases which are unknown to most of the scholars if this is done the pupils feel that the object of bringing up the subject is to do good whereas if questions of moral duty are only brought up from time to time when some prevailing or accidental fault in school calls for it the feeling will be that the teacher is only endeavoring to remove from his own path a source of inconvenience and trouble the most successful mode of giving general moral instruction that i have known and which has been adopted in many schools with occasional variations of form is the following  when the time has arrived a subject is assigned and small papers are distributed to the whole school that all may write something concerning it these are then read and commented on by the teacher and are made the occasion of any remarks which he may wish to make the interest is strongly excited to hear the papers read and the instruction which the teacher may give produces a deeper effect when engrafted thus upon something which originates in the minds of the pupils  to take a particular case a teacher addressed his scholars thus the subject for the moral exercise to day is prejudice each one may take one of the papers which have been distributed and you may write upon them any thing you please relating to the subject as many as have thought of any thing to write may raise their hands  one or two only of the older scholars gave the signal  i will mention the kinds of communications you can make and perhaps what i say will suggest something to you as fast as you think of any thing you may raise your hands and as soon as i see a sufficient number up i will give directions to begin you can describe any case in which you have been prejudiced yourselves either against persons or things  here a number of the hands went up  you can mention any facts relating to antipathies of any kind or any cases where you know other persons to be prejudiced you can ask any questions in regard to the subject questions about the nature of prejudice or the causes of it or the remedy for it  as he said this many hands were successively raised and at last directions were given for them to begin to write five minutes were allowed and at the end of that time the papers were collected and read the following specimens transcribed verbatim from the originals with the remarks made as nearly as they could be remembered immediately after the exercise will give an idea of the ordinary operation of this plan       i am very much prejudiced against spiders and every insect in the      known world with scarcely an exception there is a horrid      sensation created by their ugly forms that makes me wish them all      to jericho the butterflys wings are pretty but he is dreadful      ugly there is no affectation in this for my pride will not permit      me to show this prejudice to any great degree when i can help it      i do not fear the little wretches but i do hate them                                                    antispidersparer  this is not expressed very well the phrases to jericho and dreadful ugly are vulgar and in very bad taste such a dislike too is more commonly called an antipathy than a prejudice though perhaps it comes under the general head of prejudices       how may we overcome prejudice i think that when we are prejudiced      against a person it is the hardest thing in the world to overcome      it  a prejudice is usually founded on some unpleasant association connected with the subject of it the best way to overcome the prejudice therefore is to connect some pleasant association with it  for example to take the case of the antipathy to the spider alluded to in the last article the reason why that young lady dislikes spiders is undoubtedly because she has some unpleasant idea associated with the thought of that animal perhaps for example the idea of their crawling upon herwhich is certainly not a very pleasant one for any body now the way to correct such a prejudice is to try to connect some pleasant thoughts with the sight of the animal  i once found a spider in an empty apartment hanging in its web on the wall with a large ball of eggs which it had suspended by its side my companion and myself cautiously brought up a tumbler under the web and pressed it suddenly against the wall so as to enclose both spider and eggs within it we then contrived to run in a pair of shears so as to cut off the web and let both the animal and its treasure fall down into the tumbler we put a book over the top and walked off with our prize to a table to see what it would do  at first it tried to climb up the side of the tumbler but its feet slipped from the smooth glass we then inclined the glass so as to favor its climbing and to enable it to reach the book at the top as soon as it touched the book it was safe it could cling to the book easily and we placed the tumbler again upright to watch its motions  it attached a thread to the book and let itself down by it to the bottom of the tumbler and walked round and round the ball of eggs apparently in great trouble presently it ascended by its thread and then came down again it attached a new thread to the ball and then went up drawing the ball with it it hung the ball at a proper distance from the book and bound it firmly in its place by threads running from it in every direction to the parts of the book which were near and then the animal took its place quietly by its side  now i do not say that if any body had a strong antipathy to a spider seeing one perform such a work as this would entirely remove it but it would certainly soften it it would tend to remove it it would connect an interesting and pleasant association with the object so if she should watch a spider in the fields making his web you have all seen those beautiful regular webs in the morning dew yes sir yes sir composed of concentric circles and radii diverging in every direction yes sir well watch a spider when making one of these or observe his artful ingenuity and vigilance when he is lying in wait for a fly by thus connecting pleasant ideas with the sight of the animal you will destroy the unpleasant association which constitutes the prejudice in the same manner if i wished to create an antipathy to a spider in a child it would be very easily done i would tie her hands behind her and put three or four upon her to crawl over her face  thus you must destroy prejudices in all cases by connecting pleasant thoughts and associations with the objects of them       i am very often prejudiced against new scholars without knowing      why  we sometimes hear a person talk in this way i do not like such or such a person at all  why  oh i dont know i do not like her at all i cant bear her  but why not what is your objection to her  oh i dont know i have not any particular reason but i never did like her  now whenever you hear any person talk so you may be sure that her opinion on any subject is worth nothing at all she forms opinions in one case without grounds and it depends merely upon accident whether she does not in other cases       why is it that so many of our countrymen are or seem to be      prejudiced against the unfortunate children of africa almost every      large white boy who meets a small black boy insults him in      some way or other       it is so hard to overcome prejudices that we ought to be      careful how we form them       when i see a new scholar enter this school and she does not happen      to suit me exactly in her ways and manners i very often get      prejudiced against her though sometimes i find her a valuable      friend after i get acquainted with her  there is an inquiry i should like very much to make though i suppose it would not be quite right to make it i should like to ask all those who have some particular friend in school and who can recollect the impression which the individual made upon them when they first saw her to rise and then i should like to inquire in how many cases the first impression was favorable and in how many unfavorable  yes sir yes sir  do you mean you would like to have the inquiry made  yes sir  all then who have intimate friends and can recollect the impression which they first made upon them may rise  about thirty rose more than two thirds of whom voted that the first impression made by the persons who had since become their particular friends was unfavorable  this shows how much dependence you can justly place on first impressions       it was the next monday morning after i had attained the wise age      of 4 years that i was called up into my mothers room and told      that i was the next day going to school       i called forth all my reasoning powers and with all the ability      of a child of four years i reasoned with my mother but to no      purpose i told her that i hated the school mistress then though      i had never seen her the very first day i tottered under the      weight of the mighty foolscap i only attended her school two      quarters with prejudice i went and with prejudice i came away       the old schoolhouse is now torn down and a large brick house      takes the place of it but i never pass by without remembering my      teacher i am prejudiced to against the very spot                                                 is it not right to allow prejudice to have influence over our      minds as far as this if any thing comes to our knowledge with      which wrong seems to be connected and one in whom we have always      felt confidence is engaged in it is it not right to allow our      prejudice in favor of this individual to have so much influence      over us as to cause us to believe that all is really right though      every circumstance which has come to our knowledge is against such      a conclusion i felt this influence not many weeks since in a very      great degree  no it would not be prejudice in such a case that is a prejudice would not be a sufficient ground to justify withholding blame well grounded confidence in such a person if there was reason for it ought to leave such an effect but not prejudice                                       the above may be considered as a fair specimen of the ordinary operation of such an exercise it is taken as an illustration not by selection from the large number of similar exercises which i have witnessed but simply because it was an exercise occurring at the time when a description was to be written besides the articles quoted above there were thirty or forty others which were read and commented on the above will however be sufficient to give the reader a clear idea of the exercise and to show what is the nature of the moral effect it is calculated to produce  the subjects which may be advantageously brought forward in such a way are of course very numerous they are such as the following in connexion with each give the suggestions as to the kind of articles to be written which the pupils may receive at the time the subject is assigned       1 duties to parents anecdotes of good or bad conduct at home      questions cases where it is most difficult to obey dialogues      between parents and children excuses which are often made for      disobedience       2 selfishness cases of selfishness any of the pupils have      observed dialogues they have heard exhibiting it questions about      its nature indications of selfishness       3 faults of the school any bad practices the scholars may have      observed in regard to general deportment recitations habits of      study or the scholars treatment of one another each scholar may      write what is his own greatest trouble in school and whether he      thinks any thing can be done to remove it any thing they think can      be improved in the management of the school by the teacher      unfavorable things they have heard said about it out of school      though without names       4 excellences of the school good practices which ought to be      persevered in any little incidents the scholars may have noticed      illustrating good character cases which have occurred in which      scholars have done right in temptation or when others around were      doing wrong favorable reports in regard to the school in the      community around       5 the sabbath any thing the scholars may have known to be done on      the sabbath which they doubt whether right or wrong questions in      regard to the subject various opinions they have heard expressed      difficulties they have in regard to proper ways of spending the      sabbath  8 we have one other method to describe by which a favorable moral influence may be exerted in school the method can however go into full effect only where there are several pupils who have made considerable advances in mental cultivation  it is to provide a way by which teachers and pupils may write anonymously for the school this may be done by having a place of deposit for such articles as may be written where any person may leave what he wishes to have read nominating by a memorandum upon the article itself the reader if a proper feeling on the subject of good discipline and the formation of good character prevails in school many articles which will have a great deal of effect upon the pupils will find their way through such an avenue once opened the teacher can himself often bring forward in this way his suggestions with more effect than he otherwise could do such a plan is in fact like the plan of a newspaper for an ordinary community where sentiments and opinions stand on their own basis and influence the community just in proportion to their intrinsic merits unassisted by the authority of the writers name and unimpeded by any prejudice which may exist against him in my own school this practice has had a very powerful effect i have myself often thus anonymously addressed my pupils and i have derived great assistance from communications which many of the pupils have written sometimes we have had full discussions of proposed measures and at others criticisms of the management of the school or of prevailing faults sometimes good humored satires and sometimes simple descriptions tis true the practice is not steadily kept up often for months together there is not an article offered still the place of deposit remains and after a time some striking communication is made which awakens general attention and calls out other pens until the fifteen minutes corresponding to the afternoon general exercise in the plan provided in a preceding chapter which is all which is allowed to be devoted to such purposes is not sufficient to read what is daily offered of course in such a plan as this the teacher must have the usual editorial powers to comment upon what is written or to alter or suppress it at pleasurea  footnote a the following articles which were really offered for such a purpose will serve as specimens one or two were written by teachers i do not know the authors of the others i do not offer them as remarkable compositions every teacher will see that they are not so the design of inserting them is merely to show that the ordinary literary ability to be found in every school may be turned to useful account by simply opening a channel for it and to furnish such teachers as may be inclined to try the experiment the means of making the plan clearly understood by their pupils        marks of a bad scholar       at the time when she should be ready to take her seat at school      she commences preparation for leaving home to the extreme      annoyance of those about her all is now hurry and bustle and ill      humor thorough search is to be made for every book or paper for      which she has occasion some are found in one place some in      another and others are forgotten altogether being finally      equipped she casts her eye at the clock hopes to be in tolerable      good season notwithstanding that the hour for opening the school      has already arrived and sets out in the most violent hurry       after so much haste she is unfitted for attending properly to the      duties of the school until a considerable time after her arrival      if present at the devotional exercises she finds it difficult to      command her attention even when desirous of so doing and her      deportment at this hour is accordingly marked with an unbecoming      listlessness and abstraction       when called to recitations she recollects that some task was      assigned which till that moment she had forgotten of others she      had mistaken the extent most commonly thinking them to be shorter      than her companions suppose in her answers to questions with which      she should be familiar she always manifests more or less of      hesitation and what she ventures to express is very commonly in      the form of a question in these as in all exercises there is an      inattention to general instructions unless what is said be      addressed particularly to herself her eyes are directed towards      another part of the room it may be her thoughts are employed about      something not at all connected with the school if reproved by her      teacher for negligence in any respects she is generally provided      with an abundance of excuses and however mild the reproof she      receives it as a piece of extreme severity       throughout her whole deportment there is an air of indolence and      a want of interest in those exercises which should engage her      attention in her seat she most commonly sits in some lazy      postureeither with her elbows upon her desk her head leaning      upon her hands or with her seat tipped forwards or backwards when      she has occasion to leave her seat it is in a sauntering      lingering gaitperhaps some trick is contrived on the way for      exciting the mirth of her companions       about every thing in which it is possible to be so she is untidy      her books are carelessly used and placed in her desk without      order if she has a piece of waste paper to dispose of she finds      it much more convenient to tear it into small pieces and scatter      it about her desk than to put it in a proper place her hands and      clothes are usually covered with ink her written exercises are      blotted and full of mistakes        the consequences of being behindhand       the following incident which i witnessed on a late journey      illustrates an important principle and i will relate it       when our steamboat started from the wharf all our passengers had      not come after we had proceeded a few yards there appeared among      the crowd on the wharf a man with his trunk under his armout of      breathand with a most disappointed and disconsolate air the      captain determined to stop for him but stopping an immense      steamboat moving swiftly through the water is not to be done in a      moment so we took a grand sweep wheeling majestically around an      english ship which was at anchor in the harbor as we came towards      the wharf again we saw the man in a small boat coming off from      it as the steamboat swept round they barely succeeded in catching      a rope from the stern and then immediately the steam engine began      its work again and we pressed forwardthe little boat following      us so swiftly that the water around her was all in a foam       they pulled upon the rope attached to the little boat until they      drew it alongside they then let down a rope with a hook in the end      of it from an iron crane which projected over the side of the      steamboat and hooked it into a staple in the front of the small      boat hoist away said the captain the sailors hoisted and      the front part of the little boat began to rise the stern still      ploughing and foaming through the water and the man still in it      with his trunk under his arm they hoisted away until i began to      think that the poor man would actually tumble out behind he clung      to the seat and looked as though he was saying to himself i will      take care how i am tardy the next time however after awhile      they hoisted up the stern of the boat and he got safely on board       moral though coming to school a few minutes earlier or later      may not in itself be a matter of much consequence yet the habit of      being five minutes too late if once formed will in actual life      be a source of great inconvenience and sometimes of lasting      injury        new scholars       there is at a young ladies school taught by mr                                                      but with all these excellences there is one fault which i      considered a great one and which does not comport with the general      character of the school for kindness and good feeling it is the      little effort made by the scholars to become acquainted with the      new ones who enter whoever goes there must push herself forward      or she will never feel at home the young ladies seem to forget      that the new comer must feel rather unpleasantly in the midst of a      hundred persons to whom she is wholly a stranger and with no one      to speak to two or three will stand together and instead of      deciding upon some plan by which the individual may be made to      feel at ease something like the following conversation takes      place       miss x how do you like the looks of miss a who entered school      today       miss y i dont think she is very pretty but she looks as if she      might be a good scholar       miss x she does not strike me very pleasantly did you ever see      such a face and her complexion is so dark i should think she had      always lived in the open air and what a queer voice she has       miss y i wonder if she has a taste for arithmetic       miss x she does not look as if she had much taste for any thing      see how strangely she fixes her hair       miss s whether she has much taste or not some one of us ought      to go and get acquainted with her see how unpleasantly she feels       miss x i dont want to get acquainted with her until i know      whether i shall like her or not       thus nothing is done to relieve her when she does become      acquainted all her first strange appearance is forgotten but this      is sometimes not the case for several weeks it depends entirely on      the character of the individual herself if she is forward and      willing to make the necessary effort she can find many friends      but if she is diffident she has much to suffer this arises      principally from thoughtlessness the young ladies do not seem to      realize that there is any thing for them to do they feel enough at      home themselves and the remembrance of the time when they entered      school does not seem to arise in their minds        a satirical spirit       i witnessed a short time since a meeting between two friends      who had had but little intercourse before for a long while i      thought a part of their conversation might be useful and i shall      therefore relate it as nearly as i can recollect leaving each      individual to draw her own inferences       for some time i sat silent but not uninterested while the days of      auld lang syne came up to the remembrance of the two friends      after speaking of several individuals who were among their former      acquaintances one asked do you remember miss w yes replied      the former i remember her as the fear terror and abhorrence of      all who knew her i knew the lady by report and asked why she      was so regarded the reply was because she was so severe so      satirical in her remarks upon others she spared neither friend or      foe       the friends resumed conversation did you know said the one who      had first spoken of miss w that she sometimes had seasons of      bitter repentance for indulging in this unhappy propensity of hers      she would at such times resolve to be more on her guard but      after all her good resolutions she would yield to the slightest      temptations when she was expressing and apparently really      feeling sorrow for having wounded the feelings of others those      who knew her would not venture to express any sympathy for very      likely the next moment that would be turned into ridicule no      confidence could be placed in her       a few more facts will be stated respecting the same individual      which i believe are strictly true miss w possessed a fine and      well cultivated mind great penetration and a tact at      discriminating character rarely equalled she could if she chose      impart a charm to her conversation that would interest and even      fascinate those who listened to it still she was not beloved      weaknesses and foibles met with unmerciful severity and      wellmeaning intentions and kind actions did not always escape      without the keen sarcasm which it is so difficult for the best      regulated mind to bear unmoved the mild and gentle seemed to      shrink from her and thus she who might have been the bright and      beloved ornament of the circle in which she moved was regarded      with distrust fear and even hatred this dangerous habit of      making satirical remarks was evinced in childhood it was      cherished it grew with her growth and strengthened with her      strength until she became what i have described laura  though such a satirical spirit is justly condemned a little goodhumored raillery may sometimes be allowed as a mode of attacking faults in school which cannot be reached by graver methods the teacher must not be surprised if some things connected with his own administration come in sometimes for a share        variety       i was walking out a few days since and not being particularly in      haste i concluded to visit a certain school for an hour or two in      a few minutes after i had seated myself on the sofa the study      card was dropped and the general noise and confusion indicated      that recess had arrived a line of military characters bearing the      title of the freedoms band was soon called out headed by one      of their own number the tune chosen to guide them was kendalls      march       please to form a regular line said the lady commander      remember that there is to be no speaking in the ranks do not      begin to step until i strike the bell miss b i requested you      not to step until i gave the signal       presently the command was given and the whole line stepped for      a few minutes to all intents and purposes again the bell      soundedsome of you have lost the step said the general look      at me and begin again left right left right the line was      once more in order and i observed a new army on the opposite side      of the room performing the same manoeuvres always to the tune      of kendalls march after a time the recess closed and order      was again restored in about half an hour i approached a class      which was reciting behind the railing miss a said a teacher      how many kinds of magnitude are there miss a answer      inaudible several voices we cant hear teacher will      you try to speak a little louder miss a       some of the class at length seemed to guess the meaning of the      young lady but i was unable to do even that until the answer      was repeated by the teacher finding that i should derive little      instruction from the recitation i returned to the sofa       in a short time the propositions were read proposed that the      committee be impeached for not providing suitable pens lost a      pencil with a piece of indiarubber attached to it by a blue      riband c c       recess was again announced and the lines commenced their      evolutions to the tune of kendalls march thought i oh that      there were a new tune under the sun       before the close of school some compositions were read one was      entitled the magical ring and commenced as i was sitting alone      last evening i heard a gentle tap on the door and immediately a      beautiful fairy appeared before me she placed a ring on my finger      and left me the next began it is my week to write composition      but i do not know what to say however i must write something so      it shall be a dialogue another was entitled the magical shoe      and contained a marvellous narration of adventures made in a pair      of shoes more valuable than the farfamed seven league boots a      fourth began are you acquainted with that new scholar no but      i dont believe i shall like her and soon the magical thimble      the magical eyeglass c were read in succession until i      could not but exclaim how pleasing is variety school was at      length closed and the young ladies again attacked the piano oh      repeated i to myself how pleasing is variety as i left the      room to the tune of kendalls march  by means like these it will not be difficult for any teacher to obtain so far an ascendancy over the minds of his pupils as to secure an overwhelming majority in favor of good order and cooperation with him in his plans for elevating the character of the school but let it be distinctly understood that this and this only has been the object of this chapter thus far the first point brought up was the desirableness of making at first a favourable impressionthe second the necessity of taking general views of the condition of the school and aiming to improve it in the mass and not merely to rebuke or punish accidental faultsand the third the importance and the means of gaining a general influence and ascendency over the minds of the pupils but though an overwhelming majority can be reached by such methods as these all cannot we must have the majority secured however in order to enable us to reach and to reduce the others but to this work we must come at last  4 i am therefore now to consider under a fourth general head what course is to be taken with individual offenders whom the general influences of the schoolroom will not control  1 the first point to be attended to is to ascertain who they are not by appearing suspiciously to watch any individuals for this would be almost sufficient to make them bad if they were not so before observe however notice from day to day the conduct of individuals not for the purpose of reproving or punishing their faults but to enable you to understand their characters this work will often require great adroitness and very close scrutiny and you will find as the results of it a considerable variety of character which the general influences above described will not be sufficient to control the number of individuals will not he great but the diversity of character comprised in it will be such as to call into exercise all your powers of vigilance and discrimination on one seat you will find a coarse rough looking boy who will openly disobey your commands and oppose your wishes on another a more sly rogue whose demure and submissive look is assumed to conceal a mischiefmaking disposition here is one whose giddy spirit is always leading him into difficulty but who is of so open and frank a disposition that you will most easily lead him back to duty but there is another who when reproved will fly into a passion and there a third who will stand sullen and silent before you when he has done wrong and is neither to be touched by kindness nor awed by authority  now all these characters must be studied it is true that the caution given in a preceding part of this chapter against devoting undue and disproportionate attention to such persons must not be forgotten still these individuals will require and it is right that they should receive a far greater degree of attention so far as the moral administration of the school is concerned than their mere numbers would appear to justify this is the field in which the teacher is to study human nature for here it shows itself without disguise it is through this class too that a very powerful moral influence is to be exerted upon the rest of the school the manner in which such individuals are managed the tone the teacher assumes towards them the gentleness with which he speaks of their faults and the unbending decision with which he restrains them from wrong will have a most powerful effect upon the rest of the school that he may occupy this field therefore to the best advantage it is necessary that he should first thoroughly explore it  by understanding the dispositions and characters of such a class of pupils as i have described i do not mean merely watching them with vigilance in school so that none of their transgressions shall go unobserved and unpunished i intend a far deeper and more thorough examination of character every boy has something or other which is good in his disposition and character which he is aware of and on which he prides himself find out what it is for it may often be made the foundation on which you may build the superstructure of reform every one has his peculiar sources of enjoymentand objects of pursuit which are before his mind from day to day find out what they are that by taking an interest in what interests him and perhaps sometimes assisting him in his plans you can bind him to you every boy is from the circumstances in which he is placed at home exposed to temptations which have perhaps had a far greater influence in the formation of his character than any deliberate and intentional depravity of his own ascertain what these temptations are that you may know where to pity him and where to blame the knowledge which such an examination of character will give you will not be confined to making you acquainted with the individual it will be the most valuable knowledge which a man can possess both to assist him in the general administration of the school and in his intercourse among mankind in the business of life men are but boys only with somewhat loftier objects of pursuit their principles motives and ruling passions are essentially the same extended commercial speculations are so far as the human heart is concerned substantially what trading in jackknives and toys is at school and building a snow fort to its own architects the same as erecting a monument of marble  2 after exploring the ground the first thing to be done as a preparation for reforming individual character in school is to secure the personal attachment of the individuals to be reformed this must not be attempted by professions and affected smiles and still less by that sort of obsequiousness common in such cases which produces no effect but to make the bad boy suppose that his teacher is afraid of him which by the way is in fact in such cases usually true approach the pupil in a bold and manly but frank and pleasant manner approach him as his superior but still as his friend desirous to make him happy not merely to obtain his goodwill and the best way to secure these appearances is just to secure the reality actually be the boys friend really desire to make him happyhappy too in his own way not in yours feel that you are his superior and that you must and will enforce obedience but with this feel that probably obedience will be rendered without any contest if these are really the feelings which reign within you the boy will see it and they will exert a strong influence over him but you cannot counterfeit appearances  a most effectual way to secure the good will of a scholar is to ask him to assist you the creator has so formed the human heart that doing good must be a source of pleasure and he who tastes this pleasure once will almost always wish to taste it again to do good to any individual creates or increases the desire to do it  there is a boy in your school who is famous for his skill in making whistles from the green branches of the poplar he is a bad boy and likes to turn his ingenuity to purposes of mischief you observe him some day in school when he thinks your attention is engaged in another way blowing softly upon one which he has concealed in his desk for the purpose of amusing his neighbors without attracting the attention of the teacher now there are two remedies will you try the physical one then call him out into the floor inflict painful punishment and send him smarting to his seat with his heart full of anger and revenge to plot some new and less dangerous scheme of annoyance will you try the moral one then wait till the recess and while he is out at his play send a message out by another boy saying that you have heard he is very skilful in making whistles and asking him to make one for you to carry home to a little child at your boardinghouse what would in ordinary cases be the effect it would certainly be a very simple application but its effect would be to open an entirely new train of thought and feeling for the boy what he would say to himself while at work on his task give the master pleasure by making whistles who ever heard of such a thing i never thought of any thing but giving him trouble and paini wonder who told him i could make whistles he would find too that the new enjoyment was far higher and purer than the old and would have little disposition to return to the latter  i do not mean by this illustration that such a measure as this would be the only notice that ought to be taken of such an act of wilful disturbance in school probably it would not what measures in direct reference to the fault committed would be necessary would depend upon the circumstances of the case it is not necessary to our purpose that they should be described here  the teacher can awaken in the hearts of his pupils a personal attachment for him by asking in various ways their assistance in school and then appearing honestly gratified with the assistance rendered boys and girls are delighted to have what powers and attainments they possess brought out into action especially where they can lead to useful results they love to be of some consequence in the world and will be especially gratified to be able to assist their teacher even if the studies of a turbulent boy are occasionally interrupted for half an hour that he might help you arrange papers or rule books or cut the tops of quills or distribute exercises it will be time well spent get him to cooperate with you in any thing and he will feel how much pleasanter it is to cooperate than to thwart and oppose and by judicious measures of this kind almost any boy may be brought over to your side  another means of securing the personal attachment of boys is to notice themto take an interest in their pursuits and the qualities and powers which they value in one another it is astonishing what an influence is exerted by such little circumstances as stopping at a play ground a moment to notice with interest though perhaps without saying a word speed of runningor exactness of aimthe force with which a ball is struckor the dexterity with which it is caught or thrown the teacher must indeed in all his intercourse with his pupils never forget his station nor allow them to lay aside the respect without which authority cannot be maintained but he may be notwithstanding this on the most intimate and familiar footing with them all he may take a strong and open interest in all their enjoyments and thus awaken on their part a personal attachment to himself which will exert over them a constant and powerful control  3 the efforts described under the last head for gaining a personal influence over those who from their disposition and character are most in danger of doing wrong will not be sufficient entirely to prevent transgression cases of deliberate intentional wrong will occur and the question will rise what is the duty of the teacher in such an emergency when such cases occur the course to be taken is first of all to come to a distinct understanding on the subject with the guilty individual think of the case calmly until you have obtained just and clear ideas of it endeavor to understand precisely in what the guilt of it consists notice every palliating circumstance and take as favorable a view of the thing as you can while at the same time you fix most firmly in your mind the determination to put a stop to it then go to the individual and lay the subject before him for the purpose of understanding distinctly from his own lips what he intends to do i can however as usual explain more fully what i mean by describing a particular case substantially true  the teacher of a school observed himself and learned from several quarters that a certain boy was in the habit of causing disturbance during time of prayer at the opening and close of school by whispering playing making gestures to the other boys and throwing things about from seat to seat the teachers first step was to speak of the subject generally before the whole school not alluding however to any particular instance which had come under his notice these general remarks produced as he expected but little effect  he waited for some days and the difficulty still continued had the irregularity been very great it would have been necessary to have taken more immediate measures but he thought the case admitted of a little delay in the meantime he took a little pains to cultivate the acquaintance of the boy to discover and to show that he noticed what was good in his character and conduct occasionally to get from him some little assistance and thus to gain some personal ascendancy over him  one day when every thing had gone smoothly and pleasantly the teacher told the boy at the close of school that he wanted to talk with him a little and asked him to walk home with him it was not uncommon for the teacher to associate thus with his pupils out of school and this request accordingly attracted no special attention on the walk the teacher thus accosted the criminal  do you like frank open dealing james  james hesitated a moment and then answered faintly yes sir  most boys do and i do and i supposed that you would prefer being treated in that way do you  yes sir  well i am going to tell you of one of your faults i have asked you to walk with me because i supposed it would be pleasanter for you to have me see you privately than to bring it up in school  james said it would be pleasanter  well the fault is being disorderly at prayer time now if you like frank and open dealing and are willing to deal so with me i should like to talk with you a little about it but if you are not willing i will dismiss the subject i do not wish to talk with you now about it unless you yourself desire it but if we talk at all we must both be open and honest and sincere now should you rather have me talk with you or not  yes sir i should rather have you talk with me now than in school  the teacher then described his conduct in a mild manner using the style of simple narrationadmitting no harsh epithetsno terms of reproach the boy was surprised for he supposed he had not been noticed he thought perhaps he should have been punished if he had been observed the teacher said in conclusion  now james i do not suppose you have done this from any designed irreverence towards god or deliberate intention of giving me trouble and pain you have several times lately assisted me in various ways and i know from the cheerful manner with which you comply with my wishes that your prevailing desire is to give me pleasure not pain you have fallen into this practice through thoughtlessness but that does not alter the character of the sin to do so is a great sin against god and a great offence against good order in school you see yourself that my duty to the school will require me to adopt the most decided measures to prevent the continuance and the spread of such a practice i should be imperiously bound to do it even if the individual was the very best friend i had in school and if the measures necessary should bring upon him great disgrace and suffering do you not think it would be so  yes sir said james seriously i suppose it would  i want to remove the evil however in the pleasantest way do you remember my speaking on this subject in school the other day  yes sir  well my object in that was almost entirely to persuade you to reform without having to speak to you directly i thought it would be pleasanter to you to be reminded of your duty in that way but i do not think it did you much good did it  i dont think i have played so much since then  nor i you have improved a little but you have not decidedly and thoroughly reformed so i was obliged to take the next step which would be least unpleasant to you that is talking with you alone now you told me when we began that you would deal honestly and sincerely with me if i would with you i have been honest and open i have told you all about it so far as i am concerned now i wish you to be honest and tell me what you are going to do if you think from this conversation that you have done wrong and if you are fully determined to do so no more and to break off at once and for ever from this practice i should like to have you tell me and then the whole thing will be settled on the other hand if you feel about it pretty much as you have done i should like to have you tell me that too honestly and frankly that we may have a distinct understanding and that i may be considering what to do next i shall not be offended with you for giving me either of these answers but be sure that you are honest you promised to be so  the boy looked up in his masters face and said with great earnestness  mr t i will do better i will not trouble you any more  i have detailed this case thus particularly because it exhibits clearly what i mean by going directly and frankly to the individual and coming at once to a full understanding in nine cases out of ten this course will be effectual for four years and with a very large school i have found this sufficient in every case of discipline which has occurred except in three or four instances where something more was required to make it successful however it must be done properly several things are necessary it must be deliberate generally better after a little delay it must be indulgent so far as the view which the teacher takes of the guilt of the pupil is concerned every palliating consideration must be felt it must be firm and decided in regard to the necessity of a change and the determination of the teacher to effect it it must also be open and frank no insinuations no hints no surmises but plain honest open dealing  in many cases the communication may be made most delicately and most successfully in writing the more delicately you touch the feelings of your pupils the more tender these feelings will become many a teacher hardens and stupefies the moral sense of his pupils by the harsh and rough exposures to which he drags out the private feelings of the heart a man may easily produce such a state of feeling in his schoolroom that to address even the gentlest reproof to any individual in the hearing of the next would be a most severe punishment and on the other hand he may so destroy that sensitiveness that his vociferated reproaches will be as unheeded as the idle wind  if now the teacher has taken the course recommended in this chapter if he has by his general influence in the school done all in his power to bring the majority of his pupils to the side of order and discipline if he has then studied attentively and impartially the characters of those who cannot thus be led if he has endeavored to make them his friends and to acquire by every means a personal influence over them if finally when they do wrong he goes plainly but in a gentle and delicate manner to them and lays before them the whole case if he has done all this he has gone as far as moral influence will carry him my opinion is that this course faithfully and judiciously pursued will in almost all instances succeed but it will not in all and where it fails there must be other and more vigorous and decided measures what these measures of restraint or punishment shall be must depend upon the circumstances of the case but in resorting to them the teacher must be decided and unbending  the course above recommended is not trying lax and inefficient measures for a long time in hopes of their being ultimately successful and then when they are found not to be so changing the policy there should be through the whole the tone and manner of authority not of persuasion the teacher must be a monarch and while he is gentle and forbearing always looking on the favorable side of conduct so far as guilt is concerned he must have an eagle eye and an efficient hand so far as relates to arresting the evil and stopping the consequences he may slowly and cautiously and even tenderly approach a delinquent he may be several days in gathering around him the circumstances of which he is ultimately to avail himself in bringing him to submission but while he proceeds thus slowly and tenderly he must come with the air of authority and power the fact that the teacher bases all his plans on the idea of his ultimate authority in every case may be perfectly evident to all the pupils while he proceeds with moderation and gentleness in all his specific measures let it be seen then that the constitution of your school is a monarchy absolute and unlimitedbut let it also be seen that the one who holds the power is himself under the control of moral principle in all that he does and that he endeavors to make the same moral principle which guides him go as far as it is possible to make it go in the government of his subjects     chapter v  religious influence   in consequence of the unexampled religious liberty enjoyed in this country for which it is happily distinguished above all other countries on the globe there necessarily results a vast variety of religious sentiment and action we cannot enjoy the blessings without the inconveniences of freedom where every man is allowed to believe as he pleases some will undoubtedly believe wrong and others will be divided by embracing views of a subject which are different though perhaps equally consistent with truth hence we have among us every shade and every variety of religious opinion and in many cases contention and strife resulting from hopeless efforts to produce uniformity  a stranger who should come among us would suppose from the tone of our religious journals and from the general aspect of society on the subject of religion that the whole community was divided into a thousand contending sects who hold nothing in common and whose sole objects are the annoyance and destruction of each other but if we leave out of view some hundreds or if you please some thousands of theological controversialists who manage the public discussions and say and do all that really comes before the public on this subject it will be found that there is vastly more religious truth admitted by common consent among the people of new england than is generally supposed this common ground i shall endeavor briefly to describe for it is very plain that the teacher must in ordinary cases confine himself to it by common consent however i do not mean the consent of every body i mean that of the great majority of serious thinking men  but let us examine first for a moment what right any member of the community has to express and to disseminate his opinions with a view to the inquiry whether the teacher is really bound to confine himself to what he can do on this subject with the common consent of his employers  the french nation has been for some time as is well known strongly agitated with questions of politics it is with difficulty that public tranquillity is preserved every man takes sides now in this state of things a wealthy gentleman opposed to the revolutionary projects so constantly growing up there and from principle and feeling strongly attached to a monarchial government wishes to bring up his children with the same feelings which he himself cherishes he has a right to do so no matter if his opinions are wrong he ought it will be generally supposed in this country to be republican i suppose him to adopt opinions which will generally by my readers be considered wrong that i may bring more distinctly to view the right he has to educate his children as he thinks it proper that they should be educated he may be wrong to form such opinions but the opinions once formed he has a right with which no human power can justly interfere to educate his children in conformity with those opinions it is alike the law of god and nature that the father should control as he alone is responsible the education of his child  now under these circumstances he employs an american mechanic who is residing in paris to come to his house and teach his children the use of the lathe after some time he comes into their little workshop and is astonished to find the lathe standing still and the boys gathered round the republican turner who is telling them stories of the tyranny of kings the happiness of republicans and the glory of war the parent remonstrates the mechanic defends himself  i am a republican he says upon principle and wherever i go i must exert all the influence in my power to promote free principles and to expose the usurpations and the tyranny of kings  to this the frenchman might very properly reply  in your efforts to promote your principles you are limited or you ought to be limited to modes that are proper and honorable i employ you for a distinct and specific purpose which has nothing to do with questions of government and you ought not to allow your love of republican principles to lead you to take advantage of the position in which i place you and interfere with my plans for the political education of my children  now for the parallel case a member of a congregational society is employed to teach a school in a district occupied exclusively by quakersa case not uncommon he is employed there not as a religious teacher but for another specific and welldefined object it is for the purpose of teaching the children of that district reading writing and calculation and for such other purposes analogous to this as the law providing for the establishment of district schools contemplated now when he is placed in such a situation with such a trust confided to him and such duties to discharge it is not right for him to make use of the influence which this official station gives him over the minds of the children committed to his care for the accomplishment of any other purposes whatever which the parents would disapprove it would not be considered right by men of the world to attempt to accomplish any other purposes in such a case and are the pure and holy principles of piety to be extended by methods more exceptionable than those by which political and party contests are managed  there is a very great and obvious distinction between the general influence which the teacher exerts as a member of the community and that which he can employ in his school room as teacher he has unquestionably a right to exert upon the community by such means as he shares in common with every other citizen as much influence as he can command for the dissemination of his own political or religious or scientific opinions but the strong ascendency which in consequence of his official station he has obtained over the minds of his pupils is sacred he has no right to use it for any purpose foreign to the specific objects for which he is employed unless by the consent expressed or implied of those by whom he is entrusted with his charge the parents who send their children to him to be taught to read to write and to calculate may have erroneous views of their duty as parents in other respects he may know that their views are erroneous they may be taking a course which the teacher knows is wrong but he has not on this account a right to step in between the parent and the child to guide the latter according to his own opinions and to violate the wishes and thwart the plans of the former  god has constituted the relation between the parent and the child and according to any view which a rational man can take of this relation the parent is alone responsible for the guidance he gives to that mind so entirely in his power he is responsible to god and where our opinions in regard to the manner in which any of the duties arising from the relation are to be performed differ from his we have no right to interfere without his consent to rectify what we thus imagine to be wrong i know of but one exception which any man whatever would be inclined to make to this principle and that is where the parent would if left to himself take such a course as would ultimately make his children unsafe members of society the community have a right to interfere in such a case as they in fact do by requiring every man to provide for the instruction of his children and in some other ways which need not now be specified beyond this however no interference contrary to the parents consent is justifiable where parents will do wrong notwithstanding any persuasions which we can address to them we must not violate the principles of an arrangement which god has himself made but submit patiently to the awful consequences which will in some cases occurreflecting that the responsibility for these consequences is on the head of those who neglect their duty and that the being who makes them liable will settle the account  whatever then the teacher attempts to do beyond the specific and defined duties which are included among the objects for which he is employed must be done by permissionby the voluntary consent whether tacit or openly expressed of those by whom he is employed this of course confines him to what is generally common ground among his particular employers in a republican country where all his patrons are republican he may without impropriety explain and commend to his pupils as occasion may occur the principles of free governments and the blessings which may be expected to flow from them but it would not be justifiable for him to do this under a monarchy or in a community divided in regard to this subject because this question does not come within the objects for the promotion of which his patrons have associated and employed himand consequently he has no right while continuing their teacher to go into it without their consent in the same manner an episcopal teacher in a private school formed and supported by episcopalians may use and commend forms of prayer and explain the various usages of that church exhibiting their excellence and their adaptation to the purposes for which they are intended he may properly do this because in the case supposed the patrons of the school are united on this subject and their tacit consent may be supposed to be given but place the same teacher over a school of quaker children whose parents dislike forms and ceremonies of every kind in religion and his duty would be changed altogether so if a roman catholic is entrusted with the instruction of a common district school in a community composed of many protestant denominations it would be plainly his duty to avoid all influence direct or indirect over the minds of his pupils except in those religious sentiments and opinions which are common to himself and all his employers i repeat the principle he is employed for a specific purpose and he has no right to wander from that purpose except as far as he can go with the common consent of his employers  now the common ground on religious subjects in this country is very broad there are indeed many principles which are in my view essential parts of christianity which are subjects of active discussion among us but setting these aside there are other principles equally essential in regard to which the whole community are agreed or at least if there is a dissenting minority it is so small that it is hardly to be considered let us look at some of these principles  1 our community is agreed that there is a god there is probably not a school in our country where the parents of the scholars would not wish to have the teacher in his conversation with his pupils take this for granted and allude reverently and judiciously to that great being with the design of leading them to realize his existence and to feel his authority  2 our community are agreed that we are responsible to god for all our conduct though some persons absurdly pretend to believe that the being who formed this world if indeed they think there is any such being has left it and its inhabitants to themselves not inspecting their conduct and never intending to call them to account they are too few among us to need consideration a difference of opinion on this subject might embarrass the teacher in france and in other countries in europe but not here however negligent men may be in obeying gods commands they do almost universally in our country admit in theory the authority from which they come and believing this the parent even if he is aware that he himself does not obey these commands chooses to have his children taught to respect them the teacher will thus be acting with the consent of his employers in almost any part of our country in endeavoring to influence his pupils to perform moral duties not merely from worldly motives nor from mere abstract principles of right and wrong but from regard to the authority of god  3 the community are agreed too in the belief of the immortality of the soul they believe almost without exception that there is a future state of being to which this is introductory and preparatory and almost every father and mother in our country wish to have their children keep this in mind and to be influenced by it in all their conduct  4 the community are agreed that we have a revelation from heaven i believe there are very few instances where the parents would not be glad to have the bible read from time to time its geographical and historical meanings illustrated and its moral lessons brought to bear upon the hearts and lives of their children of course if the teacher is so unwise as to make such a privilege if it were allowed him the occasion of exerting an influence upon one side or the other of some question which divides the community around him he must expect to excite jealousy and distrust and to be excluded from a privilege which he might otherwise have been permitted freely to enjoy there may alas be some cases where the use of the scriptures is altogether forbidden in school but probably in almost every such case it would be found that it is from fear of its perversion to sect or party purposes and not from any unwillingness to have the bible used in the way i have described  5 the community are agreed in theory that personal attachment to the supreme being is the duty of every human soul and every parent with exceptions so few that they are not worth naming wishes that his children should cherish that affection and yield their hearts to its influence he is willing therefore that the teacher of course without interfering with the regular duties for the performance of which he holds his office should from time to time so speak of this dutyof gods goodness to menof his daily protectionand his promised favors as to awaken if possible this attachment in the hearts of his children of course it is very easy for the teacher if he is so disposed to abuse this privilege also he can under pretence of awakening and cherishing the spirit of piety in the hearts of his pupils present the subject in such aspects and relations as to arouse the sectarian or denominational feelings of some of his employers but i believe if this was honestly and fully avoided there are few if any parents in our country who would not be gratified to have the great principle of love to god manifest itself in the instructions of the schoolroom and showing itself by its genuine indications in the hearts and conduct of their children  6 the community are agreed not only in believing that piety consists primarily in love to god but that the life of piety is to be commenced by penitence for past sins and forgiveness in some way or other through a saviour i am aware that one class of theological writers in the heat of controversy charge the other with believing that jesus christ was nothing more nor less than a teacher of religion and there are unquestionably individuals who take this view but these individuals are few there are very few in our community who do not in some sense look upon jesus christ as our saviourour redeemer who do not feel themselves in some way indebted to him for the offer of pardon there may be here and there a theological student or a contributor to the columns of a polemical magazine who ranks jesus christ with moses and with paul but the great mass of the fathers and mothers of every name and denomination through all the ranks of society look up to the saviour of sinners with something at least of the feeling that he is the object of extraordinary affection and reverence i am aware however that i am approaching the limit which in many parts of our country ought to bound the religious influence of the teacher in a public school and on this subject as on every other he ought to do nothing directly or indirectly which would be displeasing to those who have entrusted children to his care  so much ground it seems the teacher may occupy by common consent in newengland and it certainly is a great deal it may be doubted whether after all our disputes there is a country in the world whose inhabitants have so much in common in regard to religious belief there is perhaps no country in the world where the teacher may be allowed to do so much towards leading his pupils to fear god and to obey his commands with the cordial consent of parents as he can hereb  footnote b in speaking of this common ground and in commenting upon it i wish not to be understood that i consider these truths as comprising all that is essential in christianity very far from it a full expression of the christian faith would go far in advance of all here presented we must not confound however what is essential to prepare the way for the forgiveness of sin with what is essential that a child should understand in order to secure his penitence and forgiveness the former is a great deal the latter very little  the ground which i have been laying out is common all over our country in particular places there will be even much more that is common of course the teacher in such cases will be at much greater liberty if a roman catholic community establish a school and appoint a roman catholic teacher he may properly in his intercourse with his scholars allude with commendation to the opinions and practices of that church if a college is established by the methodist denomination the teacher of that institution may of course explain and enforce there the views of that society each teacher is confined only to those views which are common to the founders and supporters of the particular institution to which he is attached  i trust the principle which i have been attempting to enforce is fully before the readers mind namely that moral and religious instruction in a school being in a great degree extraofficial in its nature must be carried no farther than the teacher can go with the common consent either expressed or implied of those who have founded and who support his school of course if those founders forbid it altogether they have a right to do so and the teacher must submit the only question that can justly arise is whether he will remain in such a situation or seek employment where a door of usefulness here closed against him will be opened while he remains he must honestly and fully submit to the wishes of those in whose hands providence has placed the ultimate responsibility of training up the children of his school it is only for a partial and specific purpose that they are placed under his care  the religious reader may inquire why i am so anxious to restrain rather than to urge on the exercise of religious influence in schools there is far too little some one will say instead of too much and teachers need to be encouraged and led on in this duty not to be restrained from it there is indeed far too little religious influence exerted in common schools what i have said has been intended to prepare the way for an increase of it my view of it is this  if teachers do universally confine themselves to limits which i have been attempting to define they may accomplish within these limits a vast amount of good by attempting however to exceed them the confidence of parents is destroyed or weakened and the door is closed in this way injury to a very great extent has been done in many parts of our country parents are led to associate with the very idea of religion indirect and perhaps secret efforts to influence their children in a way which they themselves would disapprove they transfer to the cause of piety itself the dislike which was first awakened by exceptionable means to promote it and other teachers seeing these evil effects are deterred from attempting what they might easily and pleasantly accomplish before therefore attempting to enforce the duty and to explain the methods of exerting religious influence in school i thought proper distinctly to state with what restrictions and within what limits the work is to be done                                       there are many teachers who profess to cherish the spirit and to entertain the hopes of piety who yet make no effort whatever to extend its influence to the hearts of their pupils others appeal sometimes to religious truth merely to assist them in the government of the school they perhaps bring it before the minds of disobedient pupils in a vain effort to make an impression upon the conscience of one who has done wrong and who cannot by other means be brought to submission but the pupil in such cases understands or at least he believes that the teacher applies to religious truth only to eke out his own authority and of course it produces no effect another teacher thinks he must to discharge his duty give a certain amount weekly of what he considers religious instruction he accordingly appropriates a regular portion of time to a formal lecture or exhortation which he delivers without regard to the mental habits of thought and feeling which prevail among his charge he forgets that the heart must be led not driven to piety and that unless his efforts are adapted to the nature of the minds he is acting upon and suited to influence them he must as certainly fail of success as when there is a want of adaptedness between the means and the end in any other undertaking whatever  the arrangement which seems to me as well calculated as any for the religious exercises of a school is this  1 in the morning open the school with a very short prayer resembling in its object and length the opening prayer in the morning at congregational churches the posture which from four years experience i would recommend at this exercise is sitting with the heads reclined upon the desks the prayer besides being short should be simple in its language and specific in its petitions a degree of particularity and familiarity which might be improper elsewhere is not only allowable here but necessary to the production of the proper effect that the reader may understand to what extent i mean to be understood to recommend this i will subjoin a form such as in spirit i suppose such a prayer ought to be       our father in heaven who has kindly preserved the pupils and the      teacher of this school during the past night come and grant us a      continuance of thy protection and blessing during this day we      cannot spend the day prosperously and happily without thee come      then and be in this schoolroom during this day and help us all      to be faithful and successful in duty       guide the teacher in all that he may do give him wisdom and      patience and faithfulness may he treat all his pupils with      kindness and if any of them should do any thing that is wrong      wilt thou help him gently but firmly to endeavor to bring him back      to duty may he sympathize with the difficulties and trials of all      and promote the present happiness as well as the intellectual      progress of all who are committed to his care       take care of the pupils too may they spend the day pleasantly and      happily together wilt thou who didst originally give us all our      powers direct and assist us all this day in the use and      improvement of them remove difficulties from our path and give us      all fidelity and patience in every duty let no one of us destroy      our peace and happiness this day by breaking any of thy      commandsor encouraging our companions in sinsor neglecting      in any respect our duty we ask all in the name of our great      redeemer amen  of course the prayer of each day will be varied unless in special cases the teacher prefers to read some form like the above but let every one be minute and particular relating especially to schoolto school temptations and trials and difficulties let every one be filled with expressions relating to school so that it will bear upon every sentence the impression that it is the petition of a teacher and his pupils at the throne of grace  2 if the pupils can sing there may be a single verse or sometimes two verses of some well known hymn sung after the prayer at the opening of the school teachers will find it much easier to introduce this practice than it would at first be supposed in almost every school there are enough who can sing to begin especially if the first experiment is made in a recess or before or after school and the beginning once made the difficulty is over if but few tunes are sung a very large proportion of the scholars will soon learn them  3 let there be no other regular exercise until the close of the afternoon school when that hour has arrived let the teacher devote a very short period five minutes perhaps to religious instruction given in various ways at one time he may explain and illustrate some important truth at another read and comment upon a very short portion of scripture at another relate an anecdote or fact which will tend to interest the scholars in the performance of duty the teacher should be very careful not to imitate on these occasions the formal style of exhortation from the pulpit let him use no cant and hackneyed phrases and never approach the subject of personal pietyi e such feelings as penitence for sin trust in god and love for the saviourunless his own heart is really at the time warmed by the emotions which he wishes to awaken in others children very easily detect hypocrisy they know very well when a parent or teacher is talking to them on religious subjects merely as a matter of course for the sake of effect and such constrained and formal efforts never do any good  let then every thing which you do in reference to this subject be done with proper regard to the character and condition of the youthful mind and in such a way as shall be calculated to interest as well as to instruct a cold and formal exhortation or even an apparently earnest one delivered in a tone of affected solemnity will produce no good effect perhaps i ought not to say it will produce no good effect for good does sometimes result as a sort of accidental consequence from almost any thing i mean it will have no effectual tendency to do good you must vary your method too in order to interest your pupils watch their countenances when you are addressing them and see if they look interested if they do not be assured that there is something wrong or at least something illjudged or inefficient in your manner of explaining the truths which you wish to have produce an effect upon their minds  that you may be prepared to bring moral and religious truths before their minds in the way i have described your own mind must take a strong interest in this class of truths you must habituate yourself to look at the moral and religious aspects and relations of all that you see and hear when you are reading notice such facts and remember such narratives as you can turn to good account in this way in the same way treasure up in mind such occurrences as may come under your own personal observation when travelling or when mixing with society  that the spirit and manner of these religious exercises may be the more distinctly understood i will give some examples  let us suppose then that the hour for closing school has come the books are laid aside the room is still the boys expect the few words which the teacher is accustomed to address to them and looking up to him they listen to hear what he has to say  you may take your bibles  the boys by a simultaneous movement open their desks and take from them their copies of the sacred volume  what is the first book of the new testament  matthew they all answer at once  the second mark the third luke  the next john the next the acts  the next  many answer romans  the next  a few voices say faintly and with hesitation first of corinthians  i perceive your answers become fainter and fainter do you know what is the last book of the new testament  the boys answer promptly revelations  do you know what books are between the acts and the book of revelation  some say no sir some begin to enumerate such books as occur to them and some perhaps begin to name them promptly and in their regular order  i do not mean interrupts the teacher the names of the books but the kinds of books  the boys hesitate  they are epistles or letters do you know who wrote the letters  paul peter answer many voices at once  yes there were several writers now the point which i wish to bring before you is this do you know in what order i mean on what principles the books are arranged  no sir is the universal reply  i will tell you first come all pauls epistles if you turn over the leaves of the testament you will see that pauls letters are all put together after the book of the acts and what i wish you to notice is that they are arranged in the order of their length the longest comes first and then the next and so on to the shortest which is the epistle to philemon this of course comes lastnoi am wrong in saying it is the last of pauls epistles there is one moreto the hebrews and this comes after all the others for there has been a good deal of dispute whether it was really written by paul you will see that his name is not at the beginning of it as it is in his other epistles so it was put last  then comes the epistle of james will you see whether it is longer than any that come after it the boys after a minutes examination answer yes sir yes sir  what comes next  the epistles of peter  yes and you will see that the longest of peters epistles is next in length to that of james and indeed all his are arranged in the order of their length  yes sir  what comes next  johns  yes and they arranged in the order of their length do you now understand the principles of the arrangement of the epistles  yes sir  i should like to have any of you who are interested in it try to express this principle in a few sentences on paper and lay it on my desk tomorrow and i will read what you write you will find it very difficult to express it now you may lay aside your books it will be pleasanter for you if you do it silently  intelligent children will be interested even in so simple a point as thismuch more interested than a maturer mind unacquainted with the peculiarities of children would suppose by bringing up from time to time some such literary inquiry as this they will be led insensibly to regard the bible as opening a field for interesting intellectual research and will more easily be led to study it  at another time the teacher spends his five minutes in aiming to accomplish a very different object i will suppose it to be one of those afternoons when all has gone smoothly and pleasantly in school there has been nothing to excite strong interest or emotion and there has been as every teacher knows there sometimes will be without any assignable cause which he can perceive a calm and quiet and happy spirit diffused over the minds and countenances of the little assembly his evening communication should accord with this feeling and he should make it the occasion to promote those pure and hallowed emotions in which every immortal mind must find its happiness if it is to enjoy any worth possessing  when all is still the teacher addresses his pupils as follows  i have nothing but a simple story to tell you tonight it is true and the fact interested me very much when i witnessed it but i do not know that it will interest you now merely to hear it repeated it is this  last vacation i was travelling in a remote and thinly settled country among the mountains in another state i was riding with a gentleman on an almost unfrequented road forests were all around us and the houses were small and very few  at length as we were passing a humble and solitary dwelling the gentleman said to me there is a young woman sick in this house should you like to go in and see her yes sir said i very much she can have very few visiters i think in this lonely place and if you think she would like to see us i should like to go  we turned our horses towards the door and as we were riding up i asked what was the matter with the young woman  consumption the gentleman replied and i suppose she will not live long  at that moment we dismounted and entered the house it was a very pleasant summers afternoon and the door was open we entered and were received by an elderly lady who seemed glad to see us in one corner of the room was a bed on which was lying the patient whom we had come to visit she was pale and thin in her countenance but there was a very calm and happy expression beaming in her eye i went up to her bedside and asked her how she did  i talked with her some time and found that she was a christian she did not seem to know whether she would get well again or not and in fact she did not seem to care much about it she was evidently happy then and believed she should continue so she had been penitent for her sins and sought and obtained forgiveness and enjoyed in her loneliness not only the protection of god but also his presence in her heart diffusing peace and happiness there when i came into the house i said to myself i pity i am sure a person who is confined by sickness in this lonely place with nothing to interest or amuse her but when i came out i said to myself i do not pity her at all  never destroy the effect of such a communication as this by attempting to follow it up with an exhortation or with general remarks vainly attempting to strengthen the impression  never do i say perhaps there may be some exceptions but children are not reached by formal exhortations their hearts are touched and affected in other ways sometimes you must reprove sometimes you must condemn but indiscriminate and perpetual harangues about the guilt of impenitence and earnest entreaties to begin a life of piety only harden the hearts they are intended to soften and consequently confirm those who hear them in the habits of sin  in the same way a multitude of other subjects infinite in number and variety may be brought before your pupils at stated seasons for religious instruction it is unnecessary to give any more particular examples but still it may not be amiss to suggest a few general principles which ought to guide those who are addressing the young on every subject and especially on the subject of religion  1 make no effort to simplify language children always observe this and are always displeased with it unless they are very young and it is not necessary they can understand ordinary language well enough if the subject is within their comprehension and treated in a manner adapted to their powers if you doubt whether children can understand language tell such a story as this with ardor of tone and proper gesticulation to a child only two or three years old  i saw an enormous dog in the street the other day he was sauntering along slowly until he saw a huge piece of meat lying down on the ground he grasped it instantly between his teeth and ran away with all speed until he disappeared around a corner so that i could see him no more  in such a description there is a large number of words which such a child would not understand if they stood alone but the whole description would be perfectly intelligible the reason is the subject is simple the facts are such as a very little child would be interested in and the connexion of each new word in almost every instance explains its meaning that is the way by which children learn all language they learn the meaning of words not by definitions but by their connexion in the sentences in which they hear them and by long practice they acquire an astonishing facility of doing this tis true they sometimes mistake but not often and the teacher of children of almost any age need not be afraid that he shall not be understood there is no danger from his using the language of men if his subject and the manner in which he treats it and the form and structure of his sentences are what they ought to be of course there may be cases in fact there often will be cases where particular words will require special explanation but they will be comparatively few and instead of making efforts to avoid them it will be better to let them come the pupils will be interested and profited by the explanation  perhaps some may ask what harm it will do to simplify language when talking to children it certainly can do no injury they may say and it diminishes all possibility of being misunderstood it does injury in at least three ways  1 it disgusts the young persons to whom it is addressed and prevents their being interested in what is said i once met two children twelve years of age who had just returned from hearing a very able discourse delivered before a number of sabbath schools assembled on some public occasion how did you like the discourse said i  very well indeed they replied only said one of them smiling he talked to us as if we were all little children  girls and boys however young never consider themselves little children for they can always look down upon some younger than themselves they are mortified when treated as though they could not understand what is really within the reach of their faculties they do not like to have their powers underrated and they are right in this feeling it is common to all old and young  2 children are kept back in learning language if their teacher makes effort to come down as it is called to their comprehension in the use of words notice that i say in the use of words for as i shall show presently it is absolutely necessary to come down to the comprehension of children in some other respects if however in the use of words those who address children confine themselves to such words as children already understand how are they to make progress in that most important of all studies the knowledge of language many a mother keeps back her child in this way to a degree that is hardly conceivable thus doing all in her power to perpetuate in the child an ignorance of its mother tongue  teachers ought to make constant efforts to increase their scholars stock of words by using new ones from time to time taking care to explain them when the connexion does not do it for them so that instead of coming down to the language of childhood he ought rather to go as far away from it as he possibly can without leaving his pupils behind him  3 but perhaps the greatest evil of this practice is it satisfies the teacher he thinks he addresses his pupils in the right manner and overlooks altogether the real peculiarities in which the power to interest the young depends he talks to them in simple language and wonders why they are not interested he certainly is plain enough he is vexed with them for not attending to what he says attributing it to their dulness or regardlessness of all that is useful or good instead of perceiving that the great difficulty is his own want of skill these three evils are sufficient to deter the teacher from the practice  2 present your subject not in its general views but in its minute details this is the great secret of interesting the young present it in its details and in its practical exemplifications do this with any subject whatever and children will always be interested  to illustrate this let us suppose two teachers wishing to explain to their pupils the same subject and taking the following opposite methods of doing it one at the close of school addresses his charge as follows  the moral character of any action that is whether it is right or wrong depends upon the motives with which it is performed men look only at the outward conduct but god looks at the heart in order now that any action should be pleasing to god it is necessary it should be performed from the motive of a desire to please him  now there are a great many other motives of action which prevail among mankind besides this right one there is love of praise love of money affection for friends c  by the time the teacher has proceeded thus far he finds as he looks around the room that the countenances of his pupils are assuming a listless and inattentive air one is restless in his seat evidently paying no attention another has reclined his head upon his desk lost in a reverie and others are looking round the room at one another or at the door restless and impatient hoping the dull lecture will soon be over  the other teacher says  i have thought of an experiment i might try which would illustrate to you a very important subject suppose i should call one of the boys a to me and should say to him i want you to go to your seat and transcribe for me a piece of poetry as handsomely as you can if it is written as well as you can possibly write it i will give you 25 cents suppose i say this to him privately so that none of the rest of the boys can hear and he goes to take his seat and begins to work you perceive that i have presented to him a motive to exertion  yes sir say the boys all looking with interest at the teacher wondering how this experiment is going to end  well what would that motive be  money the quarter of a dollar love of money or perhaps other answers are heard from the various parts of the room  yes love of money it is called now suppose i should call another boy one with whom i was particularly acquainted and who i should know would make an effort to please me and should say to him for a particular reason i want you to copy this poetrygiving him the samei wish you to copy it handsomely for i wish to send it away and have not time to copy it myself can you do it as well as not  suppose the boy should say he could and should take it to his seat and begin neither of the boys knowing what the other was doing i should now have offered to this second boy a motive would it be the same with the other  no sir  what was the other  love of money  what is this  the boys hesitate  it might be called continues the teacher friendship it is the motive of a vast number of the actions which are performed in this world  do you think of any other common motive of action besides love of money and friendship  love of honor says one fear says another  yes continues the teacher both these are common motives i might to exhibit them call two more boys one after the other and say to the one i will thank you to go and copy this piece of poetry as well as you can i want to send it to the school committee as a specimen of improvement made in this school  to the other i might say you have been a careless boy today you have not got your lessons well now take your seat and copy this poetry do it carefully unless you take pains and do it as well as you possibly can i shall punish you severely before you go home  how many motives have i got now four i believe  yes sir say the boys  love of money friendship love of honor and fear we called the first boy a let us call the others b c and d no we shall remember better to call them by the name of their motives we will call the first m for money the second f for friendship the third h for honor and the last fwe have got an f already what shall we do on the whole it is of no consequence we will have two fs we shall remember not to confound them  but there are a great many other motives entirely distinct from these for example suppose i should say to a fifth boy will you copy this piece of poetry it belongs to one of the little boys in school he wants a copy of it and i told him i would try to get some one to copy it for him this motive now would be benevolence that is if the boy who was asked to copy it was not particularly acquainted with the other and did it chiefly to oblige him we will call this boy b for benevolence  now suppose i call a sixth boy and say to him i have set four or five boys to work copying this piece of poetry now i want you to set down and see if you cannot do it better than any of them no one of them knows that any other is writing except you but after the others are all done i will compare them and see if yours is not the best this would be trying to excite emulation we must call this boy then ebut the time i intended to devote to talking with you on this subject for today is expired perhaps tomorrow i will take up the subject again  the reader now will observe that the grand peculiarity of the instructions given by this last teacher as distinguished from those of the first consists in this that the parts of the subject are presented in detail and in particular exemplification in the first case the whole subject was despatched in a single general and comprehensive description in the latter it is examined minutely one point being brought forward at a time the discussions are enlivened too by meeting and removing such little difficulties as will naturally come up in such an investigation boys and girls will take an interest in such a lecture they will regret to have it come to a conclusion and will give their attention when the subject is again brought forward on the following day let us suppose the time for continuing the exercise to have arrived the teacher resumes the discussion thus  i was talking to you yesterday about the motives of action how many had i made  some say four some five some six  can you name any of them  the boys attempt to recollect them and they give the names in the order in which they accidentally occur to the various individuals of course the words fear emulation honor friendship and others come in confused and irregular sounds from every part of the schoolroom  you do not recollect the order says the teacher and it is of no consequence for the order i named was only accidental now to go on with my account suppose all these boys to sit down and go to writing each one acting under the impulse of the motive which had been presented to him individually but in order to make the supposition answer my purpose i must add two other cases i will imagine that one of these boys is called away a few minutes and leaves his paper on his desk and that another boy of an illnatured and morose disposition happening to pass by and see his paper thinks he will sit down and write upon it a few lines just to plague and vex the one who was called away we will also suppose that i call another boy to me who i have reason to believe is a sincere christian and say to him here is a new duty for you to perform this afternoon this piece of poetry is to be copied now do it carefully and faithfully you know that this morning you committed yourself to gods care during the day now remember he has been watching you all the time thus far and he will be noticing you all the time you are doing this he will be pleased if you do your duty faithfully  the boys thus all go to writing now suppose a stranger should come in and seeing them all busy should say to me  what are all these boys doing  they are writing  what are they writing  they are writing a piece of poetry  they seem to be very busy they are very industrious good boys  oh no it is not by any means certain that they are good boys  i mean that they are good boys now that they are doing right at this time  that is not certain some of them are doing right and some are doing very wrong though they are all writing the same piece of poetry  the stranger would perhaps look surprised while i said this and would ask an explanation and i might properly reply as follows  whether the boys are at this moment doing right or wrong depends not so much upon what they are doing as upon the feelings of the heart with which they are doing it i acknowledge that they are all doing the same thing outwardlythey are all writing the same extract and they are all doing it attentively and carefully but they are thinking of very different things  what are they thinking of  do you see that boy i might say pointing to one of them his name is m he is writing for money he is saying to himself all the time i hope i shall get the quarter of a dollar he is calculating what he shall buy with it and every good or bad letter that he makes he is considering the chance whether he shall succeed or fail in obtaining it  what is the next boy to him thinking of  his name is b he is copying to oblige a little fellow whom he scarcely knows and is trying to make his copy handsome so as to give him pleasure he is thinking how gratified his schoolmate will be when he receives it and is forming plans to get acquainted with him  do you see that boy in the back seat he has maliciously taken another boys place just to spoil his work he knows too that he is breaking the rules of the school in being out of his place but he stays notwithstanding and is delighting himself with thinking how disappointed and sad his schoolmate will be when he comes in and finds his work spoiled because he was depending on doing it all himself  i see the stranger might say by this time that there is a great difference among these boys have you told me about them all  no i might reply there are several others i will only mention one more he sits in the middle of the second desk he is writing carefully simply because he wishes to do his duty and please god he thinks that god is present and loves him and takes care of him and he is obedient and grateful in return i do not mean that he is all the time thinking of god but love to him is his motive of effort  do you see now boys what i mean to teach you by this long supposition  yes sir  i presume you do perhaps it would be difficult for you to express it in words i can express it in general terms thus  our characters depend not on what we do but on the spirit and motive with which we do it what i have been saying throws light upon one important verse in the bible which i should like to have read james have you a bible in your desk  yes sir  will you turn to 1 samuel xvi 7 and then rise and read it read it loud so that all the school can hear  james reads as follows  man looketh on the outward appearance but god looketh on the heart  this is the way to reach the intellect and the heart of the young go into detail explain truth and duty not in an abstract form but exhibit it in actual and living examples  3 be very cautious how you bring in the awful sanctions of religion to assist you directly in the discipline of your school you will derive a most powerful indirect assistance from the influence of religion in the little community which you govern but this will be through the prevalence of its spirit in the hearts of your pupils and not from any assistance which you can usually derive from it in managing particular cases of transgression many teachers make great mistakes in this respect a bad boy who has done something openly and directly subversive of the good order of the school or the rights of his companions is called before the master who thinks that the most powerful weapon to wield against him is the bible so while the trembling culprit stands before him he administers to him a reproof which consists of an almost ludicrous mixture of scolding entreaty religious instruction and threatening of punishment but such an occasion as this is no time to touch a bad boys heart he is steeled at such a moment against any thing but mortification and the desire to get out of the hands of the master and he has an impression that the teacher appeals to religious principles only to assist him to sustain his own authority of course religious truth at such a time can make no good impression there may be exceptions to this rule there doubtless are i have found some and every successful teacher who reads this will probably call some to mind some which have occurred in the course of his own experience i am only speaking of what ought to be the general rule which is to reserve religious truths for moments of a different character altogether bring the principles of the bible forward when the mind is calm when the emotions are quieted and all within is at rest and in exhibiting them be actuated not by a desire to make your duties of government easier but to promote the real and permanent happiness of your charge  4 do not be eager to draw from your pupils an expression of their personal interest in religious truth lay before them and enforce by all the means in your power the principles of christian duty but do not converse with them for the purpose of gratifying your curiosity in regard to their piety or your spiritual pride by counting up the numbers of those who have been led to piety by your influence beginning to act from christian principles is the beginning of a new life and it may be an interesting subject of inquiry to you to ascertain how many of your pupils have experienced the change but in many cases it would merely gratify curiosity to know there is no question too that in very many instances the faint glimmering of religious interest which would have kindled into a bright flame is extinguished at once and perhaps for ever by the rough inquiries of a religious friend besides if you make inquiries and form a definite opinion of your pupils they will know that this is your practice and many a one will repose in the belief that you consider him or her a christian and you will thus increase the number already unfortunately too large of those who maintain the form and pretences of piety without its power whose hearts are filled with selfsufficiency and spiritual pride and perhaps zeal for the truths and external duties of religion while the real spirit of piety has no place there they trust to some imaginary change long since passed by and which has proved to be spurious by its failing of its fruits the best way in fact the only way to guard against this danger especially with the young is to show by your manner of speaking and acting on this subject at all times that you regard a truly religious life as the only evidence of pietyand that consequently however much interest your pupils may apparently take in religious instruction they cannot know and you cannot know whether christian principle reigns within them in any other way than by following them through life and observing how and with what spirit the various duties of it are performed  there are very many fallacious indications of piety so fallacious and so plausible that there are very few even among intelligent christians who are not often greatly deceived by their fruits ye shall know them said the saviour a direction sufficiently plain one would think and pointing to a test sufficiently easy to be applied but it is slow and tedious work to wait for fruits and we accordingly seek a criterion which will help us quicker to a result you see your pupil serious and thoughtful it is well but it is not proof of piety you see him deeply interested when you speak of his obligations to his maker and the duties he owes to him this is well but it is no proof of piety you know he reads his bible daily and offers his morning and evening prayers when you speak to him of gods goodness and of his past ingratitude his bosom heaves with emotion and the tear stands in his eye it is all well you may hope that he is going to devote his life to the service of god but you cannot know you cannot even believe with any great confidence these appearances are not piety they are not conclusive evidences of it they are only in the young faint grounds of hope that the genuine fruits of piety will appear  i am aware that there are many persons so habituated to judging with confidence of the piety of others from some such indications as i have described that they will think i carry my cautions to the extreme perhaps i do but the saviour said by their fruits ye shall know them and it is safest to follow his direction  by the word fruits however our saviour unquestionably does not mean the mere moral virtues of this life the fruits to be looked at are the fruits of piety that is indications of permanent attachment to the creator and a desire to obey his commands we must look for these  there is no objection to your giving particular individuals special instruction adapted to their wants and circumstances you may do this by writing or in other ways but do not lead them to make up their minds fully that they are christians in such a sense as to induce them to feel that the work is done let them understand that becoming a christian is beginning a work not finishing it be cautious how you form an opinion even yourself on the question of the genuineness of their piety be content not to know you will be more faithful and watchful if you consider it uncertain and they will be more faithful and watchful too  5 bring very fully and frequently before your pupils the practical duties of religion in all their details especially their duties at home to their parents and to their brothers and sisters do not however allow them to mistake morality for religion show them clearly what piety is in its essence and this you can do most successfully by exhibiting its effects  6 finally let me insert as the keystone of all that i have been saying in this chapter be sincere and ardent and consistent in your own piety the whole structure which i have been attempting to build will tumble into ruins without this be constantly watchful and careful not only to maintain intimate communion with god and to renew it daily in your seasons of retirement but guard your conduct let piety control and regulate it show your pupils that it makes you amiable patient forbearing benevolent in little things as well as in great things and your example will cooperate with your instructions and allure your pupils to walk in the paths which you tread but no clearness and faithfulness in religious teaching will atone for the injury which a bad example will effect conduct speaks louder than words and no persons are more shrewd than the young to discover the hollowness of empty professions and the heartlessness of mere pretended interest in their good                                       i am aware that this book may fall into the hands of some who may take little interest in the subject of this chapter to such i may perhaps owe an apology for having thus fully discussed a topic in which only a part of my readers can be supposed to be interested my apology is this it is obvious and unquestionable that we all owe allegiance to the supreme it is so obvious and unquestionable as to be entirely beyond the necessity of proof for it is plain that nothing but such a bond of union can keep the peace among the millions of distinct intelligences with which the creation is filled it is therefore the plain duty of every man to establish that connexion between himself and his maker which the bible requires and to do what he can to bring others to the peace and happiness of piety these truths are so plain that they admit of no discussion and no denial and it seems to me highly unsafe for any man to neglect or to postpone the performance of the duty which arises from them a still greater hazard is incurred when such a man having forty or fifty fellow beings almost entirely under his influence leads them by his example away from their maker and so far that he must in many cases hopelessly confirm the separation with these views i could not when writing on the duties of a teacher of the young refrain from bringing distinctly to view this which has so imperious a claim     chapter vi  the mt vernon school   there is perhaps no way by which teachers can in a given time do more to acquire a knowledge of their art and an interest in it than by visiting each others schools  it is not always the case that any thing is observed by the visiter which he can directly and wholly introduce into his own school but what he sees suggests to him modifications or changes and it gives him at any rate renewed strength and resolution in his work to see how similar objects are accomplished or similar difficulties removed by others i have often thought that there ought on this account to be far greater freedom and frequency in the interchange of visits than there is  next however to a visit to a school comes the reading of a vivid description of it i do not mean a cold theoretical exposition of the general principles of its management and instruction for these are essentially the same in all good schools i mean a minute account of the plans and arrangements by which these general principles are applied suppose twenty of the most successful teachers in new england would write such a description each of his own school how valuable would be the volume which should contain them  with these views i have concluded to devote one chapter to a description of the school which has been for four years under my care the account was originally prepared and printed but not published for the purpose of distribution among the scholars simply because this seemed to be the easiest and surest method of making them on their admission to the school acquainted with its arrangements and plans it is addressed therefore throughout to a pupil and i preserve its original form as by its being addressed to pupils and intended to influence them it is an example of the mode of address and the kind of influence recommended in this work it was chiefly designed for new scholars a copy of it was presented to each on the day of her admission to the school and it was made her first duty to read it attentively  the system which it describes is one which gradually grew up in the institution under the writers care the school was commenced with a small number of pupils and without any system or plan whatever and the one here described was formed insensibly and by slow degrees through the influence of various and accidental circumstances i have no idea that it is superior to the plans of government and instruction adopted in many other schools it is true that there must necessarily be some system in every large school but various instructers will fall upon different principles of organization which will naturally be such as are adapted to the habits of thought and manner of instruction of their respective authors and consequently each will be best for its own place while therefore some systemsome methodical arrangement is necessary in all schools it is not necessary that it should be the same in all it is not even desirable that it should be i consider this plan as only one among a multitude of others each of which will be successful not by the power of its intrinsic qualities but just in proportion to the ability and faithfulness with which it is carried into effect  there may be features of this plan which teachers who may read it may be inclined to adopt in other cases suggestions may occur to the mind of the reader which may modify in some degree his present plans others may merely be interested in seeing how others effect what they by easy methods are equally successful in effecting  it is in these and similar ways that i have often myself been highly benefited in visiting schools and in reading descriptions of them and it is for such purposes that i insert the account here   to a new scholar on her admission to the mt vernon school  as a large school is necessarily somewhat complicated in its plan and as new scholars usually find that it requires some time and gives them no little trouble to understand the arrangements they find in operation here i have concluded to write a brief description of these arrangements by help of which you will i hope the sooner feel at home in your new place of duty that i may be more distinct and specific i shall class what i have to say under separate heads   i your personal duty  your first anxiety as you come into the schoolroom and take your seat among the busy multitude if you are conscientiously desirous of doing your duty will be lest ignorant as you are of the whole plan and of all the regulations of the institution you should inadvertently do what will be considered wrong i wish first then to put you at rest on this score there is but one rule of this school that you can easily keep  you will observe on one side of my desk a clock upon the wall and upon the other a piece of apparatus that is probably new to you it is a metallic plate upon which are marked in gilded letters the words study hours this is upright but it is so attached by its lower edge to its support by means of a hinge that it can fall over from above and thus be in a horizontal position or it will rest in an inclined positionhalf down as it is called it is drawn up and let down by a cord passing over a pulley when it passes either way its upper part touches a bell which gives all in the room notice of its motion  now when this study cardc as the scholars call it is up so that the words study hours are presented to the view of the school it is the signal for silence and study there is then to be no communication and no leaving of seats except at the direction of teachers  footnote c this apparatus has been previously described see p 40  when it is half down each scholar may leave her seat and whisper but she must do nothing which will disturb others when it is down all the duties of school are suspended and scholars are left entirely to their liberty  as this is the only rule of the school it deserves a little more full explanation for not only your progress in study but your influence in promoting the welfare of the school and consequently your peace and happiness while you are a member of it will depend upon the strictness with which you observe it  whenever then the study card goes up and you hear the sound of its little bell immediately and instantaneously stop whatever you are saying if you are away from your seat go directly to it and there remain and forget in your own silent and solitary studies so far as you can all that are around you you will remember that all communication is forbidden whispering making signs writing upon paper or a slate bowing to any oneand in fact every possible way by which one person may have any sort of mental intercourse with another is wrong a large number of the scholars take a pride and pleasure in carrying this rule into as perfect an observance as possible they say that as this is the only rule with which i trouble them they ought certainly to observe this faithfully i myself however put it upon other ground i am satisfied that it is better and pleasanter for you to observe it most rigidly if it is attempted to be enforced at all  you will ask cannot we obtain permission of you or of the teachers to leave our seats or to whisper if it is necessary the answer is no you must never ask permission of me or of the teachers you can leave seats or speak at the direction of the teachers i e when they of their own accord ask you to do it but you are never to ask their permission if you should and if any teachers should give you permission it would be of no avail i have never given them authority to grant any permissions of the kind  you will then say are we never on any occasion whatever to leave our seats in study hours yes you are there are two ways  1 at the direction of teachers going to and from recitations is considered as at the direction of teachers so if a person is requested by a teacher to transact any business or is elected to a public office or appointed upon a committeeleaving seats or speaking so far as is really necessary for the accomplishing such a purpose is considered as at the direction of teachers and is consequently right in the same manner if a teacher should ask you individually or give general notice to the members of class to come to her seat for private instruction or to go to any part of the schoolroom for her it would be right to do it the distinction you observe is this the teacher may of her own accord direct any leaving of seats which she may think necessary to accomplish the objects of the school she must not however at the request of an individual for the sake of her mere private convenience give her permission to speak or to leave her seat if for example a teacher should say to you in your class as soon as you have performed a certain work you may bring it to meyou would in bringing it be acting under her direction and would consequently do right if however you should want a pencil and should ask her to give you leave to borrow it even if she should give you leave you would do wrong to go for you would not be acting at her direction but simply by her consent and she has no authority to grant consent  2 the second case in which you may leave your seat is when some very uncommon occurrence takes place which is sufficient reason for suspending all rules if your neighbor is faint you may speak to her and if necessary lead her out if your mother or some other friend should come into the schoolroom you can go and sit with her upon the sofa and talk about the school and so in many other similar cases be very careful not to abuse this privilege and make slight causes the grounds of your exceptions it ought to be a very clear case if a young lady is unwell in a trifling degree so as to need no assistance you would evidently do wrong to talk to her the rule in fact is very similar to that which all well bred people observe at church they never speak or leave their seats unless some really important cause such as sickness requires them to break over all rules and go out you have in the same manner in really important cases such as serious sickness in your own case or in that of your companions or the coming in of a stranger or any thing else equally extraordinary power to lay aside any rule and to act as the emergency may require in using this discretion however be sure to be on the safe side in such cases never ask permission you must act on your own responsibility  reasons for this rule when the school was first established there was no absolute prohibition of whispering each scholar was allowed to whisper in relation to her studies they were often very often enjoined to be conscientious and faithful but as might have been anticipated the experiment failed it was almost universally the practice to whisper more or less about subjects entirely foreign to the business of the school this they all repeatedly acknowledged and the scholars almost unanimously admitted that the good of the school required the prohibition of all communication during certain hours i gave them their choice either always to ask permission when they wished to speak or to have a certain time allowed for the purpose during which free intercommunication might be allowed to all the schoolwith the understanding however that out of this time no permission should ever be asked or granted they very wisely chose the latter plan and the study card was constructed and put up to mark the times of free communication and of silent study the card was at first down every half hour for one or two minutes the scholars afterwards thinking that their intellectual habits would be improved and the welfare of the school promoted by their having a longer time for uninterrupted study of their own accord without any influence from me proposed that the card should be down only once an hour this plan was adopted by them by vote i wish it to be understood that it was not my plan but theirs and that i am at any time willing to have the study card down once in half an hour whenever a majority of the scholars voting by ballot desire it  you will find that this system of having a distinct time for whispering when all may whisper freely all communication being entirely excluded at other times will at first give you some trouble it will be hard for you if you are not accustomed to it to learn conscientiously and faithfully to comply besides at first you will often need some little information or an article which you might obtain in a moment but which you cannot innocently ask for till the card is down and this might keep you waiting an hour you will however after a few such instances soon learn to make your preparations before hand and if you are a girl of enlarged views and elevated feelings you will good humoredly acquiesce in suffering a little inconvenience yourself for the sake of helping to preserve those distinct and well defined lines by which all boundaries must be marked in a large establishment if order and system are to be preserved at all  though at first you may experience a little inconvenience you will soon take pleasure in the scientific strictness of the plan it will gratify you to observe the profound stillness of the room where a hundred are studying you will take pleasure in observing the sudden transition from the silence of study hours to the joyful sounds and the animating activity of recess when the study card goes down and then when it rises again at the close of the recess you will be gratified to observe how suddenly the sounds which have filled the air and made the room so lively a scene are hushed into silence by the single and almost inaudible touch of that little bell you will take pleasure in this for young and old always take pleasure in the strict and rigid operation of system rather than in laxity and disorder i am convinced also that the scholars do like the operation of this plan for i do not have to make any efforts to sustain it with the exception that occasionally usually not oftener than once in several months i allude to the subject and that chiefly on account of a few careless and unfaithful individuals i have little to say or to do to maintain the authority of the study card most of the scholars obey it of their own accord implicitly and cordially and i believe they consider this faithful monitor not only one of the most useful but one of the most agreeable friends they have we should not only regret its services but miss its company if it should be taken away  this regulation then viz to abstain from all communication with one another and from all leaving of seats at certain times which are marked by the position of the study card is the only one which can properly be called a rule of the school there are a great many arrangements and plans relating to the instruction of the pupils but no other specific rules relating to their conduct you are of course while in the school under the same moral obligations which rest upon you elsewhere you must be kind to one another respectful to superiors and quiet and orderly in your deportment you must do nothing to encroach upon anothers rights or to interrupt and disturb your companions in their pursuits you must not produce disorder or be wasteful of the public property or do any thing else which you might know is in itself wrong but you are to avoid these things not because there are any rules in this school against them for there are nonebut because they are in themselves wrongin all places and under all circumstances wrong the universal and unchangeable principles of duty are the same here as elsewhere i do not make rules pointing them out but expect that you will through your own conscience and moral principle discover and obey them  such a case as this for example once occurred a number of little girls began to amuse themselves in recess with running about among the desks in pursuit of one another and they told me in excuse for it that they did not know that it was against the rule  it is not against the rule said i i have never made any rule against running about among the desks  then asked they did we do wrong  do you think it would be a good plan i inquired to have it a common amusement in the recess for the girls to hunt each other among the desks  no sir they replied simultaneously  why not there are some reasons i do not know however whether you will have the ingenuity to think of them  we may start the desks from their places said one  yes said i they are fastened down very slightly so that i may easily alter their position  we might upset the inkstands said another  sometimes added a third we run against the scholars who are sitting in their seats  it seems then you have ingenuity enough to discover the reasons why did not these reasons prevent your doing it  we did not think of them before  true that is the exact state of the case now when persons are so eager to promote their own enjoyment as to forget the rights and the comforts of others it is selfishness now is there any rule in this school against selfishness  no sir  you are right there is not but selfishness is wrongvery wrong in whatever form it appearshere and every where else and that whether i make any rules against it or not  you will see from this anecdote that though there is but one rule of the school i by no means intend to say that there is only one way of doing wrong here that would be very absurd you must not do any thing which you may know by proper reflection to be in itself wrong this however is an universal principle of duty not a rule of the mt vernon school if i should attempt to make rules which would specify and prohibit every possible way by which you might do wrong my laws would be innumerable and even then i should fail of securing my object unless you had the disposition to do your duty no legislation can enact laws as fast as a perverted ingenuity can find means to evade them  you will perhaps ask what will be the consequence if we transgress either the single rule of the school or any of the great principles of duty in other words what are the punishments which are resorted to in the mt vernon school the answer is there are no punishments i do not say that i should not in case all other means should fail resort to the most decisive measures to secure obedience and subordination most certainly i should do so as it would plainly be my duty to do it if you should at any time be so unhappy as to violate your obligations to yourself to your companions or to meshould you misimprove your time or exhibit an unkind or a selfish spirit or be disrespectful or insubordinate to your teachersi should go frankly and openly but kindly to you and endeavor to convince you of your fault i should very probably do this by addressing a note to you as i suppose this should be less unpleasant to you than a conversation in such a case i shall hope that you will as frankly and openly reply telling me whether you admit your fault and are determined to amend or else informing me of the contrary i shall wish you to be sincere and then i shall know what course to take next but as to the consequences which may result to you if you should persist in what is wrong it is not necessary that you should know them before hand they who wander from duty always plunge themselves into troubles they do not anticipate and if you do what at the time you are doing it you know to be wrong it will not be unjust that you should suffer the consequences even if they were not beforehand understood and expected this will be the case with you all through life and it will be the case here  i say it will be the case here i ought rather to say that it will be the case should you be so unhappy as to do wrong and to persist in it such cases however never occur at least they occur so seldom and at intervals so great that every thing of the nature of punishment that is the depriving a pupil of any enjoyment or subjecting her to any disgrace or giving her pain in any way in consequence of her faults except the simple pain of awakening conscience in her bosom is almost entirely unknown i hope that you will always be ready to confess and forsake your faults and endeavor while you remain in school to improve in character and attain as far as possible every moral excellence  i ought to remark before dismissing this topic that i place very great confidence in the scholars in regard to their moral conduct and deportment and they fully deserve it i have no care and no trouble in what is commonly called the government of the school neither myself nor any one else is employed in any way in watching the scholars or keeping any sort of account of them i should not at any time hesitate to call all the teachers in an adjoining room leaving the school alone for half an hour and i should be confident that at such a time order and stillness and attention to study would prevail as much as ever the scholars would not look to see whether i was in my desk but whether the study card was up the school was left in this way half an hour every day during a quarter that we might have a teachers meeting and the school went on generally quite as well to say the least as when the teachers were present one or two instances of irregular conduct occurred i do not now recollect precisely what they were they were however fully acknowledged and not repeated and i believe the scholars were generally more scrupulous and faithful then than at other times they would not betray the confidence reposed in them this plan was continued until it was found more convenient to have the teachers meeting in the afternoons  when any thing wrong is done in school i generally state the case and request the individuals who have done it to let me know who they are they do it sometimes by notes and sometimes in conversationbut they always do it the plan always succeeds the scholars all know that there is nothing to be feared from confessing faults to mebut that on the other hand it is a most direct and certain way to secure returning peace and happiness  i can illustrate this by describing a case which actually occurred though the description is not to be considered so much an accurate account of what occurred in a particular case as an illustration of the general spirit and manner in which such cases are disposed of i accidentally understood that some of the younger scholars were in the habit during recesses and after school of ringing the door bell and then running away to amuse themselves with the perplexity of their companions who should go to the door and find no one there i explained in a few words one day to the school that this was wrong  how many i then asked have ever been put to the trouble to go to the door when the bell has thus been rung they may rise  a very large number of scholars stood up those who had done the mischief were evidently surprised at the extent of the trouble they had occasioned  now i continued i think all will be convinced that the trouble which this practice has occasioned to the fifty or sixty young ladies who cannot be expected to find amusement in such a way is far greater than the pleasure it can have given to the few who are young enough to have enjoyed it therefore it was wrong do you think the girls who rang the bell might have known this by proper reflection  yes sir the school generally answered  i do not mean said i if they had set themselves formally at work to think about the subject but with such a degree of reflection as ought reasonably to be expected of little girls in the hilarity of recess and of play  yes sir was still the reply but fainter than before  there is one way by which i might ascertain whether you were old enough to know that this was wrong and that is by asking those who have refrained from doing this because they supposed it would be wrong to rise then if some of the youngest scholars in school should stand up as i have no doubt they would it would prove that all might have known if they had been equally conscientious but if i ask those to rise who have not rung the bell i shall make known to the whole school who they are that have done it and i wish that the exposure of faults should be private unless it is necessary that it should be public i will therefore not do it i have myself however no doubt that all might have known that it was wrong  there is continued i another injury which must grow out of such a practice this i should not have expected the little girls could think of in fact i doubt whether any in school will think of it can any one tell what it is  no one replied  i should suppose that it would lead you to disregard the bell when it rings and that consequently a gentleman or lady might sometimes ring in vain the scholars near the door saying oh it is only the little girls  yes sir was heard from all parts of the room  i found from farther inquiry that this had been the case and i closed by saying  i am satisfied that those who have inadvertently fallen into this practice are sorry for it and that if i should leave it here no more cases of it would occur and this is all i wish at the same time they who have done this will feel more effectually relieved from the pain which having done wrong must necessarily give them if they individually acknowledge it to me i wish therefore that all who have done so would write me notes stating the facts if any one does not do it she will punish herself severely for she will feel for many days to come that while her companions were willing to acknowledge their faults she wished to conceal and cover hers conscience will reproach her bitterly for her insincerity and whenever she hears the sound of the door bell it will remind her not only of her fault but of what is far worse her willingness to appear innocent when she was really guilty  before the close of the school i had eight or ten notes acknowledging the fault describing the circumstances of each case and expressing promises to do so no more  it is by such methods as this rather than by threatening and punishment that i manage the cases of discipline which from time to time occur but even such as this slight as it is occur very seldom weeks and weeks sometimes elapse without one when they do occur they are always easily settled by confession and reform sometimes i am asked to forgive the offence but i never forgive i have no power to forgive god must forgive you when you do wrong or the burden must remain my duty is to take measures to prevent future transgression and to lead those who have been guilty of it to god for pardon if they do not go to him though they may satisfy me as principal of a school by not repeating the offencethey must remain unforgiven i can forget and i do forget for example in this last case i have not the slightest recollection of any individual who was engaged in it the evil was entirely removed and had it not afforded me a convenient illustration here perhaps i should never have thought of it againstill it may not yet be forgiven it may seem strange that i should speak so seriously of gods forgiveness for such a trifle as that does he notice a childs ringing a door bell in play he notices when a child is willing to yield to temptation to do what she knows to be wrong and to act even in the slightest trifle from a selfish disregard for the convenience of others this spirit he always notices and though i may stop any particular form of its exhibition it is for him alone to forgive it and to purify the heart from its power but i shall speak more particularly on this subject under the head of religious instruction   ii order of daily exercises  there will be given you when you enter the school a blank schedule in which the divisions of each forenoon for one week are marked and in which your own employments for every half hour are to be written a copy of this is inserted on page 196                                       this schedule when filled up forms a sort of a map of the week in which you can readily find what are your duties for any particular time the following description will enable you better to understand it  opening of the school  the first thing which will call your attention as the hour for the commencement of the school approaches in the morning is the ringing of a bell five minutes before the time arrives by the regulator who sits at the curtained desk before the study card one minute before the time the bell is rung again which is the signal for all to take their seats and prepare for the opening of the school when the precise moment arrives the study card is drawn up and at the sound of its little bell all the scholars recline their heads upon their desks and unite with me in a very short prayer for gods protection and blessing during the day i adopted the plan of allowing the scholars to sit because i thought it would be pleasanter for them and they have in return been generally so far as i know faithful in complying with my wish that they would all assume the posture proposed so that the school may present the uniform and serious aspect which is proper when we are engaged in so solemn a duty if you move your chair back a little you will find the posture not inconvenient but the only reward you will have for faithfully complying with the general custom is the pleasure of doing your duty for no one watches you and you would not be called to account should you neglect to conform  after the prayer we sing one or two verses of a hymn the music is led by the piano and we wish all to join in it who can sing the exercises

                           first hourevening lessons  see plan page 196  we then as you will see by the schedule commence the first hour of the day it is marked evening lessons because most though not all of the studies are intended to be prepared out of school these studies are miscellaneous in their character comprising geography history natural and intellectual philosophy and natural history this hour like all the other hours for study is divided into two equal parts some classes reciting in the first part and others in the second a bell is always rung five minutes before the time for closing the recitation to give the teachers notice that their time is nearly expired and then again at the time to give notice to new classes to take their places thus you will observe that five minutes before the half hour expires the bell will ring soon after which the classes in recitation will take their seats precisely at the end of the half hour it will ring again when new classes will take their places in the same manner notice is given five minutes before the second half of the hour expires and so in all the other three hours  at the end of the first hour the study card will be let half down five minutes and you will perceive that the sound of its bell will immediately produce a decided change in the whole aspect of the room it is the signal as has been before explained for universal permission to whisper and to leave seats though not for loud talking or play so that those who wish to continue their studies may do so without interruption when the five minutes has expired the card goes up again and its sound immediately restores silence and order   second hourlanguages  see plan  we then commence the second hour of the school this is devoted to the study of the languages the latin french and english classes recite at this time by english classes i mean those studying the english as a language i e classes in grammar rhetoric and composition the hour is divided as the first hour is and the bell is rung in the same way i e at the close of each half hour and also five minutes before the close to give the classes notice that the time for recitation is about to expire   first general exercise  see plan  you will observe then that there follows upon the schedule a quarter of an hour marked g that initial stands for general exercise and when it arrives each pupil is to lay aside her work and attend to any exercise which may be proposed this quarter of an hour is appropriated to a great variety of purposes sometimes i give a short and familiar lecture on some useful subject connected with science or art or the principles of duty sometimes we have a general reading lesson sometimes we turn the school into a bible class again the time is occupied in attending to some general business of the school the bell is rung one minute before the close of the time and when the period appropriated to this purpose has actually expired the study card for the first time in the morning is let entirely down and the room is at once suddenly transformed into a scene of life and motion and gaiety   first recess  see plan  the time for the recess is a quarter of an hour and as you will see it is marked r on the schedule we have various modes of amusing ourselves and finding exercise and recreation in recesses sometimes the girls bring their battledoors to school sometimes they have a large number of soft balls with which they amuse themselves a more common amusement is marching to the music of the piano for this purpose a set of signals by the whistle has been devised by which commands are communicated to the school  in these and similar amusements the recess passes away and one minute before it expires the bell is rung to give notice of the approach of study hours  at this signal the scholars begin to prepare for a return to the ordinary duties of school and when at the full expiration of the recess the study card again goes up silence and attention and order is immediately restored   third hourmathematics  see plan  there follows next as you will see by reference to the schedule an hour marked mathematics it is time for studying and reciting arithmetic algebra geometry and similar studies it is divided as the previous hours were into two equal parts and the bell is rung as has been described five minutes before the close and precisely at the close of each half hour   second general exercisebusiness  see plan  then follows two quarter hours appropriated like those heretofore described the first to a general exercise the second to a recess at the first of these the general business of the school is transacted as this business will probably appear new to you and will attract your attention i will describe its nature and design  at first you will observe a young lady rise at the secretarys desk to read a journal of what was done the day before the notices which i gave the arrangements i madethe subjects discussed and decidedand in fact every thing important and interesting in the business or occurrences of the preceding dayis recorded by the secretary of the school and read at this time this journal ought not to be a mere dry record of votes and business but as far as possible an interesting description in a narrative style of the occurrences of the day the secretary must keep a memorandum and ascertain that every thing important really finds a place in the record but she may employ any good writer in school to prepare from her minutes the full account  after the record is read you will observe me take from a little red morocco wrapper which has been brought to my desk a number of narrow slips of paper which i am to read aloud in most assemblies it is customary for any person wishing it to rise in his place and propose any plan or as it is called make any motion that he pleases it would be unpleasant for a young lady to do this in presence of a hundred companions and we have consequently resorted to another plan the red wrapper is placed in a part of the room accessible to all and any one who pleases writes upon a narrow slip of paper anything she wishes to lay before the school and deposits it there and at the appointed time the whole are brought to me these propositions are of various kinds i can perhaps best give you an idea of them by such specimens as occur to me       a b resigns her office of copyist as she is about to leave      school       proposed that a class in botany be formed there are many who      would like to join it       when will vacation commence       proposed that a music committee be appointed so that we      can have some marching in recess       proposed that school begin at nine oclock       mr abbott will you have the goodness to explain to us what is      meant by the veto message       proposed that we have locks upon our desks  you see that the variety is very great and there are usually from four or five to ten or fifteen of such papers daily you will be at liberty to make in this way any suggestion or inquiry or to propose any change you please in any part of the instruction or administration of the school if any thing dissatisfies you you ought not to murmur at it in private or complain of it to your companions thus injuring to no purpose both your own peace and happiness and theirsbut you ought immediately to bring up the subject in the way above described that the evil may be removed i receive some of the most valuable suggestions in this way from the older and more reflecting pupils these suggestions are read sometimes i decide myself sometimes i say the pupils may decide sometimes i ask their opinion and wishes and then after taking them into consideration come to a conclusion  for example i will insert a few of these propositions as these papers are called describing the way in which they would be disposed of most of them are real cases       mr abbott the first class in geography is so large that we have      not room in the recitation seats cannot we have another place  after reading this i should perhaps say  the class in geography may rise and be counted  they rise those in each division are counted by the proper officer as will hereafter be explained and the numbers are reported aloud to me it is all done in a moment  how many of you think you need better accommodations  if a majority of hands are raised i say  i wish the teacher of that class would ascertain whether any other place of recitation is vacant or occupied by a smaller class at that time and report the case to me       proposed that we be allowed to walk upon the common in the      recesses  i should like to have some plan formed by which you can walk on the common in recesses but there are difficulties if all should go out together it is probable that some would be rude and noisy and that others would come back tardy and out of breath besides as the recess is short so many would be in haste to prepare to go out that there would be a great crowd and much confusion in the anteroom and passage ways i do not mention these as insuperable objections but only as difficulties which there must be some plan to avoid perhaps however they cannot be avoided do any of you think of any plan  i see perhaps two or three hands raised and call upon the individuals by name and they express their opinions one says that a part can go out at a time another proposes that those who are tardy one day should not go out again c  i think it possible that a plan can be formed on these or some such principles if you will appoint a committee who will prepare a plan and mature its details and take charge of the execution of it you may try the experiment i will allow it to go on as long as you avoid the evils i have above alluded to  a committee is then raised to report in writing at the business hour of the following day       proposed that the study card be down every half hour  you may decide this question yourselves that you may vote more freely i wish you to vote by ballot the boxes will be open during the next recess the votereceivers will write the question and place it upon the boxes all who feel interested in the subject may carry in their votes ay or nay when the result is reported to me i will read it to the school                                       in this and similar ways the various business brought up is disposed of this custom is useful to the scholars for it exercises and strengthens their judgment and their reflecting powers more than almost any thing besides so that if interesting them in this way in the management of the school were of no benefit to me i should retain the practice as most valuable to them but it is most useful to me and to the school i think nothing has contributed more to its prosperity than the active interest which the scholars have always taken in its concerns and the assistance they have rendered me in carrying my plans into effect  you will observe that in transacting this business very little is actually done by myself except making the ultimate decision all the details of business are assigned to teachers or to officers and committees appointed for the purpose by this means we despatch business very rapidly the system of offices will be explained in another place but i may say here that all appointments and elections are made in this quarter hour and by means of the assistance of these officers the transaction of business is so facilitated that much more can sometimes be accomplished than you would suppose possible i consider this period as one the most important in the whole morning   second recess  see plan  after the expiration of the quarter hour above described the study card is dropped and a recess succeeds   fourth hoursections  see plan  in all the former part of the day the scholars are divided into classes according to their proficiency in particular branches of study and they resort to their recitations for instruction they now are divided into six sections as we call them and placed under the care of superintendents not for instruction but for what may be called supervision teaching a pupil is not all that is necessary to be done for her in school there are many other things to be attended tosuch as supplying her with the various articles necessary for her useseeing that her desk is convenientthat her time is well arrangedthat she has not too much to do nor too littleand that no difficulty which can be removed obstructs her progress in study or her happiness in school the last hour is appropriated to this purpose with the understanding however that such a portion of it as is not wanted by the superintendent is to be spent in study you will see then when the last hour arrives that all the scholars go in various directions to the meetings of their respective sections here they remain as long as the superintendent retains them sometimes they adjourn almost immediately perhaps after having simply attended to the distribution of pens for the next day at other times they remain during the hour attending to such exercises as the superintendent may plan the design however and nature of this whole arrangement i shall explain more fully in another place   close of the school  as the end of the hour approaches five minutes notice is given by the bell and when the time arrives the study card is half dropped for a moment before the closing exercises when it rises again the room is restored to silence and order we then sing a verse or two of a hymn and commend ourselves to gods protection in a short prayer as the scholars raise their heads from the posture of reverence they have assumed they pause a moment till the regulator lets down the study card and the sound of its bell is the signal that our duties at school are ended for the day   iii instruction and supervision of pupils  for the instruction of the pupils the school is divided into classes and for their general supervision into sections as has been intimated in the preceding chapter the head of a class is called a teacher and the head of a section a superintendent the same individual may be both the teacher of a class and the superintendent of a section the two offices are however entirely distinct in their nature and design as you will perceive by recalling to mind the daily order of exercises the classes meet and recite during the first three hours of the school and the sections assemble on the fourth and last we shall give each a separate description   1 classes  the object of the division into classes is instruction whenever it is desirable that several individuals should pursue a particular study a list of their names is made out a book selected a time for recitation assigned a teacher appointed and the exercises begin in this way a large number of classes have been formed and the wishes of parents or the opinion of the principal and in many cases that of the pupil determines how many and what shall be assigned to each individual a list of these classes with the average age of the members the name of the teacher and the time of recitation is posted in a conspicuous place and public notice is given whenever a new class is formed you will therefore have the opportunity to know all the arrangements of school in this respect and i wish you to exercise your own judgment and discretion a great deal in regard to your studies i do not mean i expect you to decide but to reflect upon them look at the list and consider what am most useful for you propose to me or to your parents changes whenever you think any are necessary and when you finish one study reflect carefully yourself on the question what you shall next commence  the scholars prepare their lessons when they please they are expected to be present and prepared at the time of recitation but they make the preparation when it is most convenient the more methodical and systematic of the young ladies mark the times of study as well as of recitation upon their schedules so that the employment of their whole time at school is regulated by a systematic plan you will observe too that by this plan of having a great many classes reciting through the first three hours of the morning every pupil can be employed as much or as little as her parents please in a case of ill health she may as has often been done in such cases at the request of parents join one or two classes only and occupy the whole forenoon in preparing for them and be entirely free from school duties at home or she may as is much more frequently the case choose to join a great many classes so as to fill up perhaps her whole schedule with recitations in which case she must prepare all her lessons at home it is the duty of teachers to take care however when a pupil pleads want of time as a reason for being unprepared in any lesson that the case is fully examined that it may be ascertained whether the individual has joined too many classes in which case some one should be dropped and thus the time and the employments of each individual should be so adjusted as to give her constant occupation in school and as much more as her parents may desire by this plan of the classes each scholar goes on just as rapidly in her studies as her time and talents and health will allow no one is kept back by the rest each class goes on regularly and systematically all its members keeping exactly together in that study but the various members of it will have joined a greater or less number of other classes according to their age or abilities or progress in study so that all will or may have full employment for their time  when you first enter the school you will for a day or two be assigned to but few classes for your mind will be distracted by the excitement of new scenes and pursuits and the intellectual effort necessary for joining a class is greater than that requisite for going on with it after being once under way after a few days you will come to me and say perhaps for this is ordinarily the process  mr abbott i think i have time for some more studies  i will thank you to bring me your schedule i say in reply so that i can see what you have now to do  by glancing my eye over the schedule in such a case i see in a moment what duties have been already assigned you and from my general schedule containing all the studies of the school i select what would be most suitable for you after conferring with you about your past pursuits and your own wishes or those of your parents in regard to your future course additions are thus made until your time is fully occupied                                       the manner of recitation in the classes is almost boundlessly varied the design is not to have you commit to memory what the book contains but to understand and digest itto incorporate it fully into your own mind that it may come up in future life in such a form as you wish it for use do not then in ordinary cases endeavor to fix words but ideas in your minds conceive clearlypaint distinctly to your imagination what is describedcontemplate facts in all their bearings and relations and thus endeavor to exercise the judgment and the thinking and reasoning powers rather than the mere memory upon the subjects which will come before you   2 sections  in describing the order of daily exercises i alluded to the sections which assemble in the last hour of the school it is necessary that i should fully describe the system of sections as it constitutes a very important part of the plan of the school  besides giving the scholars the necessary intellectual instruction there are as i have already remarked a great many other points which must receive attention in order to promote their progress and to secure the regular operation and general welfare of the school these various points have something common in their nature but it is difficult to give them a common name they are such as supplying the pupils with pens and paper and stationary of other kindsbecoming acquainted with each individual ascertaining that she has enough and not too much to doarranging her work so that no one of her duties shall interfere with anotherassisting her to discover and to correct her faultsand removing any sources of difficulty or causes of discontent which may gradually come in her way these and a multitude of similar points constituting what may be called the general administration of the school become when the number of pupils is large a most important branch of the teachers duty  to accomplish these objects more effectually the school is divided into six sections arranged not according to proficiency in particular studies as the several classes are but according to age and general maturity of mind each one of these sections is assigned to the care of a superintendent these superintendents it is true during most of school hours are also teachers their duties however as teachers and as superintendents are entirely distinct i shall briefly enumerate the duties which devolve upon her in the latter capacity  1 a superintendent ought to prepare an exact list of the members of her section and to become intimately acquainted with them so as to be as far as possible their friend and confidant and to feel a stronger interest in their progress in study and their happiness in school and a greater personal attachment to them than to any other scholars  2 she is to superintend the preparation of their schedulesto see that each one has enough and not too much to do by making known to me the necessity of a change where such necessity existsto see that the schedules are submitted to the parents and that their opinion or suggestions if they wish to make any are reported to me  3 she is to take care that all the daily wants of her section are suppliedthat all have pens and paper and desks of suitable height if any are new scholars she ought to interest herself in assisting them to become acquainted in schoolif they are friendless and alone to find companions for them and to endeavor in every way to make their time pass pleasantly and happily  4 to watch the characters of the members of her section to inquire of their several teachers as to the progress they make in study and the faithfulness and punctuality with which they prepare their lessons she ought to ascertain whether they are punctual at school and regular in their habitswhether their desks are neat and well arranged and their exercises carefully executed she ought to correct through her own influence any evils of this kind she may find or else immediately to refer the cases where this cannot be done to me  the better and the more pleasantly to accomplish the object of exerting a favorable influence upon the characters of the members of their sections the superintendents ought often to bring up subjects connected with moral and religious duty in section meetings this may be done in the form of subjects assigned for composition or proposed for free discussion in writing or conversation or the superintendents may write themselves and read to the section the instructions they wish to give  5 though the superintendents as such have necessarily speaking no teaching to do still they ought particularly to secure the progress of every pupil in what may be called the essential studies such as reading writing and spelling for this purpose they either see that their pupils are going on successfully in classes in school in these branches or they may attend to them in the section provided that they never allow such instruction to interfere with their more appropriate and important duties  in a word the superintendents are to consider the members of their sections as pupils confided to their care and they are not merely to discharge mechanically any mere routine of duty such as can be here pointed out but to exert all their powerstheir ingenuity their knowledge of human character their judgment and discretion in every way to secure for each of those committed to their care the highest benefits which the institution to which they belong can afford they are to keep a careful and faithful record of their plans and of the history of their respective sections and to endeavor as faithfully and as diligently to advance the interests of the members of them as if the sections were separate and independent schools of their own  a great responsibility is thus evidently intrusted to them but not a great deal of power they ought not to make changes except in very plain cases without referring the subject to me they ought not to make rash experiments or even to try many new plans without first obtaining my approval of them they ought to refer all cases which they cannot easily manage to my care they ought to understand the distinction between seeing that a thing is done and doing it for example if a superintendent thinks that one of her section is in too high a class in arithmetic her duty is not to undertake by her own authority to remove her to a lower one for as superintendent she has no authority over arithmetic classes nor should she go the opposite extreme of saying i have no authority over arithmetic classes and therefore i have nothing to do with this case she ought to go to the teacher of the class to which her pupil had been unwisely assigned converse with her obtain her opinion then find some other class more suited to her attainments and after fully ascertaining all the facts in the case bring them to me that i may make the change this is superintendencelooking over the condition and progress of the scholar the superintendents have thus great responsibility and yet comparatively little power they accomplish a great deal of good and in its ordinary course it is by their direct personal efforts but in making changes and remedying defects and evils they act generally in a different way  the last hour of school is devoted to the sections no classes recite then but the sections meet if the superintendents wish and attend to such exercises as they provide each section has its own organization its own officers and plans these arrangements of course vary in their character according to the ingenuity and enterprise of the superintendents and more especially according to the talents and intellectual ardor of the members of the section  the two upper sections are called senior the next two middle and the two younger junior the senior sections are distinguished by using paper for section purposes with a light blue tinge to the middle sections is assigned a light straw color and to the junior pink these colors are used for the schedules of the members and for the records and other documents of the section  this account though it is brief will be sufficient to explain to you the general principles of the plan you will soon become acquainted with the exercises and arrangements of the particular section to which you will be assigned and by taking an active interest in them and endeavoring to cooperate with the superintendent in all her measures and to comply with her wishes you will very materially add to her happiness and do your part towards elevating the character of the circle to which you will belong   iv officers  in consequence of the disposition early manifested by the scholars to render me every assistance in their power in carrying into effect the plans of the school and promoting its prosperity i gradually adopted the plan of assigning to various officers and committees a number of specific duties relating to the general business of the school these offices have gradually multiplied as the school has increased and as business has accumulated the system has from time to time been revised condensed and simplified and at the present time it is thus arranged the particular duties of each officer are minutely described to the individuals themselves at the time of their election all i intend here is to give a general view of the plan such as is necessary for the scholars at large  there are then five departments of business entrusted to officers of the school the names of the officers and a brief exposition of their duties are as follows       i omit the particular explanation of the duties of the officers      as the arrangement must vary in different schools and the details      of any one plan can only be useful in the schoolroom to which it      belongs it will be sufficient to name the officers of each      department with their duties in general terms  1 regulators to assist in the ordinary routine of business in schoolringing the bellsmanaging the study carddistributing and collecting paperscounting votes c  2 secretaries keeping the records and executing writing of various kinds  3 accountants keeping a register of the scholars and various other duties connected with the accounts  4 librarians to take charge of books and stationary  5 curators to secure neatness and good order in the apartments  the secretaries and accountants are appointed by the principal and will generally be chosen from the teachers the first in each of the other departments are chosen by ballot by the scholars each one thus chosen nominates the second in her department and they two the assistants these nominations must be approved at a teachers meeting for if a scholar is inattentive to her studies disorderly in her desk or careless and troublesome in her manners she evidently ought not to be appointed to public office no person can hold an office in two of these departments she can if she pleases however resign one to accept another each of these departments ought often to assemble and consult together and form plans for carrying into effect with greater efficiency the objects entrusted to them they are to keep a record of all their proceedings the head of the department acting as secretary for this purpose  the following may be given as an example of the manner in which business is transacted by means of these officers on the day that the above description of their duties was written i wished for a sort of directory to assist the collector employed to receive payments for the bills and to obtain it i took the following steps  at the business quarter hour i issued the following order  before the close of school i wish the distributors to leave upon each of the desks a piece of paper the size i described it is for a purpose which i shall then explain  accordingly at any leisure moment before the close of school each one went with her box to the stationary shelves which you will see in the corners of the room where a supply of paper of all the various sizes used in school is kept and taking out a sufficient number they supplied all the desks in their respective divisions  when the time for closing school arrived i requested each young lady to write the name of her parent or guardian upon the paper and opposite to it his place of business this was done in a minute or two  all those whose parents or guardians name begins with a letter above m may rise  they rose  the distributors may collect the papers  the officers then passed round in regular order each through her own division and collected the papers  deliver them at the accountants desk  they were accordingly carried there and received by the accountants  in the same manner the others were collected and received by the accountants but kept separate  i wish now the second accountant would copy these in a little book i have prepared for the purpose arranging them alphabetically referring all doubtful cases again to me  the second accountant then arranged the papers and prepared them to go into the book and the writer who belongs to the department copied them fairly  i describe this case because it was one which occurred at the time i was writing the above description and not because there is any thing otherwise peculiar in it such cases are continually taking place and by the division of labor above illustrated i am very much assisted in a great many of the duties which would otherwise consume a great portion of my time  any of the scholars may at any time make suggestions in writing to any of these officers or to the whole school and if an officer should be partial or unfaithful or negligent in her duty any scholar may propose her impeachment after hearing what she chooses to write in her defence a vote is taken on sustaining the impeachment if it is sustained she is deprived of the office and another appointed to fill her place   v the court  i have already described how all serious cases of doing wrong or neglect of duty are managed in the school i manage them myself by coming as directly and as openly as i can to the heart and conscience of the offender there are however a number of little transgressions too small to be individually worthy of serious attention but which are yet troublesome to the community when frequently repeated these relate chiefly to order in the school rooms these misdemeanors are tried half in jest and half in earnest by a sort of court whose forms of process might make a legal gentleman smile they however fully answer our purpose i can best give you an idea of the court by describing an actual trial i ought however first to say that any young lady who chooses to be free from the jurisdiction of the court can signify that wish to me and she is safe from it this however is never done they all see the useful influence of it and wish to sustain it  near the close of school i find perhaps on my desk a paper of which the following may be considered a copy it is called the indictment  we accuse miss a b of having waste papers in the aisle opposite her desk at 11 oclock on friday oct 12       c d       e f  witnesses  i give notice after school that a case is to be tried those interested twenty or thirty perhaps gather around my desk while the sheriff goes to summon the accused and the witnesses a certain space is marked off as the precincts of the court within which no one must enter in the slightest degree on pain of imprisonment i e confinement to her seat until the court adjourns  miss a b you are accused of having an untidy floor about your desk have you any objection to the indictment  while she is looking over the indictment to discover a misspelled word or an error in the date or some other latent flaw i appoint any two of the bystanders jury the jury come forward to listen to the cause  the accused returns the indictment saying she has no objection and the witnesses are called upon to present their testimony  perhaps the prisoner alleges in defence that the papers were out in the aisle not under her desk or that she did not put them there or that they were too few or too small to deserve attention  my charge to the jury would be somewhat as follows  you are to consider and decide whether she was guilty of disorder taking into view the testimony of the witnesses and also her defence it is considered here that each young lady is responsible not only for the appearance of the carpet under her desk but also for the aisle opposite to it so that her first ground of defence must be abandoned so also with the second that she did not put them there she ought not to have them there each scholar must keep her own place in a proper conditionso that if disorder is found there no matter who made it she is responsible if she only had time to remove it as to the third you must judge whether enough has been proved by the witnesses to make out real disorder the jury write guilty or not guilty upon the paper and it is returned to me if sentence is pronounced it is usually confinement to the seat during a recess or part of a recess or something that requires slight effort or sacrifice for the public good the sentence is always something real though always slight and the court has a great deal of influence in a double way making amusement and preserving order  the cases tried are very various but none of the serious business of the school is entrusted to it its sessions are always held out of school hours and in fact it is hardly considered by the scholars as a constituent part of the arrangements of the school so much so that i hesitated much about inserting an account of it in this description   vi religious instruction  in giving you this account brief as it is i ought not to omit to speak of one feature of our plan which we have always intended should be one of the most prominent and distinctive characteristics of the school the gentlemen who originally interested themselves in its establishment had mainly in view the exertion by the principal of a decided moral and religious influence over the hearts of the pupils knowing as they did how much more dutiful and affectionate at home you would be how much more successful in your studies at school how much happier in your intercourse with each other and in your prospects for the future both here and hereafter if your hearts could be brought under the influence of christian principle they were strongly desirous that the school should be so conducted that its religious influence though gentle and alluring in its character should be frank and open and decided i need not say that i myself entered very cordially into these views it has been my constant effort and one of the greatest sources of my enjoyment to try to win my pupils to piety and to create such an atmosphere in school that conscience and moral principle and affection for the unseen jehovah should reign here you can easily see hew much pleasanter it is for me to have the school controlled by such an influence than if it were necessary for we to hire you to diligence in duty by prizes or rewards or to deter you from neglect or from transgression by reproaches and threatenings and punishments  the influence which the school has thus exerted has always been cordially welcomed by my pupils and approved so far as i have known by their parents though four or five denominations and fifteen or twenty different congregations have been from time to time represented in the school there are few parents who would not like to have their children christianssincerely and practically sofor every thing which a parent can desire in a child is promoted just in proportion as she opens her heart to the influence of the spirit of piety but that you may understand what course is taken i shall describe first what i wish to effect in the hearts of my pupils and then what means i take to accomplish the object  1 a large number of young persons of your age and in circumstances similar to those in which you are placed perform with some fidelity their various outward duties but maintain no habitual and daily communion with god it is very wrong for them to live thus without god but they do not seeor rather do not feel the guilt of it they only think of their accountability to human beings like themselves for example their parents teachers brothers and sisters and friends consequently they think most of their external conduct which is all that human beings can see their hearts are neglected and become very impurefull of evil thoughts and desires and passions which are not repented of and consequently not forgiven now what i wish to accomplish in regard to all my pupils is that they should begin to feel their accountability to god and to act according to it that they should explore their hearts and ask gods forgiveness for all their past sins through jesus christ who died for them that they might be forgiven and that they should from this time try to live near to god feel his presence and enjoy that solid peace and happiness which flows from a sense of his protection when such a change takes place it relieves the mind from that constant and irritating uneasiness which the great mass of mankind feel as a constant burden the ceaseless forebodings of a troubled conscience reproaching them for their past accumulated guilt and warning them of a judgment to come the change which i endeavor to promote relieves the heartboth of the present suffering and of the future danger  after endeavoring to induce you to begin to act from christian principle i wish to explain to you your various duties to yourselves your parents and to god                                       2 the measures to which i resort to accomplish these objects are three  first religious exercises in school we open and close the school with a very short prayer and one or two verses of a hymn sometimes i occupy ten or fifteen minutes at one of the general exercises or at the close of the school in giving instruction upon practical religious duty the subjects are sometimes suggested by a passage of scripture read for the purpose but more commonly in another way  you will observe often at the close of the school or at an appointed general exercise that a scholar will bring to my desk a darkcolored morocco wrapper containing several small strips of paper upon which questions relating to moral or religious duty or subjects for remarks from me or anecdotes or short statements of facts giving rise to inquiries of various kinds are written this wrapper is deposited in a place accessible to all the scholars and any one who pleases deposits in it any question or suggestion on religious subjects which may occur to her you can at any time do this yourself thus presenting any doubt or difficulty or inquiry which may at any time occur to you  second religious exercise on saturday afternoon in order to bring up more distinctly and systematically the subject of religious duty i established a long time ago a religious meeting on saturday afternoon it is intended for those who feel interested in receiving such instruction and who can conveniently attend at that time if you have not other engagements and if your parents approve of it i should be happy to have you attend there will be very little to interest you except the subject itself for i make all the instructions which i give there as plain direct and practical as is in my power a considerable number of the scholars usually attend and frequently bring with them many of their female friends you can at any time invite any one whom you please to come to the meeting it commences at half past three and continues about half an hour  third personal religious instruction in consequence of the large number of my pupils and the constant occupation of my time in school i have scarcely any opportunity of religious conversation with them even with those who particularly desire it the practice has therefore arisen and gradually extended itself almost universally in school of writing to me on the subject these communications are usually brief notes expressing the writers interest in the duties of piety or bringing forward her own peculiar practical difficulties or making specific inquiries or asking particular instruction in regard to some branch of religious duty i answer in a similar wayvery briefly and concisely howeverfor the number of notes of this kind which i receive is very large and the time which i can devote to such a correspondence necessarily limited i should like to receive such communications from all my pupils for advice or instruction communicated in reply being directly personal is far more likely to produce effect besides my remarks being in writing can be read a second time and be more attentively considered and reconsidered than when words are merely spoken these communications must always be begun by the pupil i never unless there may be occasional exceptions in some few very peculiar cases commence i am prevented from doing this both by my unwillingness to obtrude such a subject personally upon those who might not welcome it and by want of time i have scarcely time to write to all those who are willing first to write to me many cases have occurred where individuals have strongly desired some private communication with me but have hesitated long and shrunk reluctantly from the first step i hope it will not be so with you should you ever wish to receive from me any direct religious instruction i hope you will write immediately and freely i shall very probably not even notice that it is the first time i have received such a communication from you so numerous and so frequent are these communications that i seldom observe when i receive one from any individual for the first time that it comes from one who has not written me before                                       such are the means to which i resort in endeavoring to lead my pupils to god and to duty and you will observe that the whole design of them is to win and to allure not to compel the regular devotional exercises of school are all which you will necessarily witness these are very short occupying much less time than many of the pupils think desirable the rest is all private and voluntary i never make any effort to urge any one to attend the saturday meeting nor do i except in a few rare and peculiar cases ever address any one personally unless she desires to be so addressed you will be left therefore in this school unmolestedto choose your own way if you should choose to neglect religious duty and to wander away from god i shall still do all in my power to make you happy in school and to secure for you in future life such a measure of enjoyment as can fall to the share of one over whose prospects in another world there hangs so gloomy a cloud i shall never reproach you and perhaps may not even know what your choice is should you on the other hand prefer the peace and happiness of piety and be willing to begin to walk in its paths you will find many both among the teachers and pupils of the mt vernon school to sympathize with you and to encourage and help you on your way     chapter vii  scheming   the best teachers in our country or rather those who might be the best lose a great deal of their time and endanger or perhaps entirely destroy their hopes of success by a scheming spirit which is always reaching forward to something new one has in his mind some new school book by which arithmetic grammar or geography are to be taught with unexampled rapidity and his own purse to be filled in a much more easy way than by waiting for the rewards of patient industry another has the plan of a school bringing into operation new principles of management or instruction which he is to establish on some favored spot and which is to become in a few years a second hofwyl another has some royal road to learning and though he is trammeled and held down by what he calls the ignorance and stupidity of his trustees or his school committee yet if he could fairly put his principles and methods to the test he is certain of advancing the science of education half a century at least at a single leap  ingenuity in devising new ways and enterprise in following them are among the happiest characteristics of a new country rapidly filling with a thriving population without these qualities there could be no advance society must be stationary and from a stationary to a retrograde condition the progress is inevitable the disposition to make improvements and changes may however be too great if so it must he checked on the other hand a slavish attachment to old established practices may prevail then the spirit of enterprise and experiment must be awakened and encouraged which of these two is to be the duty of a writer at any time will of course depend upon the situation of the community at the time he writes and of the class of readers for which he takes his pen now at the present time it is undoubtedly true that while among the great mass of teachers there may be too little originality and enterprise there is still among many a spirit of innovation and change to which a caution ought to be addressed but before i proceed let me protect myself from misconception by one or two remarks  1 there are a few individuals in various parts of our country who by ingenuity and enterprise have made real and important improvements in many departments of our science and are still making them the science is to be carried forward by such men let them not therefore understand that any thing which i shall say applies at all to those real improvements which are from time to time brought before the public as examples of this there might easily be mentioned were it necessary several new modes of study and new text books and literary institutions on new plans which have been brought forward within a few years and proved on actual trial to be of real and permanent value  these are or rather they were when first conceived by the original projectors new schemes and the result has proved that they were good ones every teacher too must hope that such improvements will continue to be made let nothing therefore which shall be said on the subject of scheming in this chapter be interpreted as intended to condemn real improvements of this kind or to check those which may now be in progress by men of age or experience or of sound judgment who are capable of distinguishing between a real improvement and a whimsical innovation which can never live any longer than it is sustained by the enthusiasm of the original inventor  2 there are a great many teachers in our country who make their business a mere dull and formal routine through which they plod on month after month and year after year without variety or change and who are inclined to stigmatize with the appellation of idle scheming all plans of whatever kind to give variety or interest to the exercises of the school now whatever may be said in this chapter against unnecessary innovation and change does not apply to efforts to secure variety in the details of daily study while the great leading objects are steadily pursued this subject has already been discussed in the chapter on instruction where it has been shown that every wise teacher while he pursues the same great object and adopts in substance the same leading measures at all times will exercise all the ingenuity he possesses and bring all his inventive powers into requisition to give variety and interest to the minute details                                       to explain now what is meant by such scheming as is to be condemned let us suppose a case which is not very uncommon a young man while preparing for college takes a school when he first enters upon the duties of his office he is diffident and timid and walks cautiously in the steps which precedent has marked out for him distrusting himself he seeks guidance in the example which others have set for him and very probably he imitates precisely though it may be insensibly and involuntarily the manners and the plans of his own last teacher this servitude soon however if he is a man of natural abilities passes away he learns to try one experiment after another until he insensibly finds that a plan may succeed even if it was not pursued by his former teacher so far it is well he throws greater interest into his school and into all its exercises by the spirit with which he conducts them he is successful after the period of his services has expired he returns to the pursuit of his studies encouraged by his success and anticipating further triumphs in his subsequent attempts  he goes on through college we will suppose teaching from time to time in the vacations as opportunity occurs taking more and more interest in the employment and meeting with greater and greater success this success is owing in a very great degree to the freedom of his practice that is to his escape from the thraldom of imitation so long as he leaves the great objects of the school untouched and the great features of its organization unchanged his many plans for accomplishing these objects in new and various ways awaken interest and spirit both in himself and in his scholars and all goes on well  now in such a case as this a young teacher philosophizing upon his success and the causes of it will almost invariably make this mistake viz he will attribute to something essentially excellent in his plans the success which in fact results from the novelty of them  when he proposes something new to a class they all take an interest in it because it is new he takes too a special interest in it because it is an experiment which he is trying and he feels a sort of pride and pleasure in securing its success the new method which he adopts may not be in itself in the least degree better than old methods yet it may succeed vastly better in his hands than any old method he had tried before and why why because it is new it awakens interest in his class because it offers them variety and it awakens interest in him because it is a plan which he has devised and for whose success therefore he feels that his credit is at stake either of these circumstances is abundantly sufficient to account for its success either of these would secure success unless the plan was a very bad one indeed  this may easily be illustrated by supposing a particular case the teacher has we will imagine been accustomed to teach spelling in the usual way by assigning a lesson in the spelling book which the scholars have studied in their seats and then they have recited by having the words put to them individually in the class after sometime he finds that one class has lost its interest in this study he can make them get the lesson it is true but he perceives perhaps that it is a weary task to them of course they proceed with less alacrity and consequently with less rapidity and success he thinks very justly that it is highly desirable to secure cheerful not forced reluctant efforts from his pupils and he thinks of trying some new plan accordingly he says to them  boys i am going to try a new plan for this class  the mere annunciation of a new plan awakens universal attention the boys all look up wondering what it is to be  instead of having you study your lessons in your seats as heretofore i am going to let you all go together into one corner of the room and choose some one to read the lesson to you spelling all the words aloud you will all listen and endeavor to remember how the difficult ones are spelled do you think you can remember  yes sir say the boys children always think they can do every thing which is proposed to them as a new plan or experiment though they are very often inclined to think they cannot do what is required of them as a task  you may have continues the teacher the words read to you once or twice just as you please only if you have them read but once you must take a shorter lesson  he pauses and looks round upon the class some say once some twice  i am willing that you should decide this question how many are in favor of having shorter lessons and having them read but oncehow many prefer longer lessons and having them read twice  after comparing the numbers it is decided according to the majority and the teacher assigns or allows them to assign a lesson  now he proceeds i am not only going to have you study in a different way but recite in a different way too you may take your slates with you and after you have had time to hear the lesson read slowly and carefully twice i shall come and dictate to you the words aloud and you will all write them from my dictation then i shall examine your slates and see how many mistakes are made  any class of boys now would be exceedingly interested in such a proposal as this especially if the masters ordinary principles of government and instruction had been such as to interest the pupils in the welfare of the school and in their own progress in study they will come together in the place assigned and listen to the one who is appointed to read the words to them with every faculty aroused and their whole souls engrossed in the new duties assigned them the teacher too feels a special interest in his experiment whatever else be may be employed about his eye turns instinctively to this group with an intensity of interest which an experienced teacher who has long been in the field and who has tried experiments of this sort a hundred times can scarcely conceive for let it be remembered that i am describing the acts and feelings of a new beginner of one who is commencing his work with a feeble and trembling step and perhaps this is his first step from the beaten path in which he has been accustomed to walk  this new plan is continued we will suppose a week during which time the interest of the pupils continues they get longer lessons and make fewer mistakes than they did by the old method now in speculating on this subject the teacher reasons very justly that it is of no consequence whether the pupil receives his knowledge through the eye or through the ear whether they study in solitude or in company the point is to secure their progress in learning to spell the words of the english language and as this point is secured far more rapidly and effectually by his new method the inference is to his mind very obvious that he has made a great improvementone of real and permanent value perhaps he will consider it an extraordinary discovery  but the truth is that in almost all such cases as this the secret of the success is not that the teacher has discovered a better method than the ordinary ones but that he has discovered a new one the experiment will succeed in producing more successful results just as long as the novelty of it continues to excite unusual interest and attention in the class or the thought that it is a plan of the teachers own invention leads him to take a peculiar interest in it and this may be a month or perhaps a quarter and precisely the same effects would have been produced if the whole had been reversed that is if the plan of dictation had been the old one which in process of time had in this supposed school lost its interest and the teacher by his ingenuity and enterprise had discovered and introduced what is now the common mode  very well perhaps my reader will reply it is surely something gained to awaken and continue interest in a dull study for a quarter or even a month the experiment is worth something as a pleasant and useful change even if it is not permanently superior to the other  it is indeed worth something it is worth a great deal and the teacher who can devise and execute such plans understanding their real place and value and adhering steadily through them all to the great object which ought to engage his attention is in the almost certain road to success as an instructer what i wish is not to discourage such efforts they ought to be encouraged to the utmost but to have their real nature and design and the real secret of their success fully understood and to have the teacher above all take good care that all his new plans are made not the substitutes for the great objects which he ought to keep steadily in view but only the means by which he may carry them into more full and complete effect  in the case we are supposing however we will imagine that the teacher does not do this he fancies that he has made an important discovery and begins to inquire whether the principle as he calls it cannot be applied to some other studies he goes to philosophizing upon it and can find many reasons why knowledge received through the ear makes a more ready and lasting impression than when it comes through the eye he tries to apply the method to arithmetic and geography and in a short time is forming plans for the complete metamorphosis of his school when engaged in hearing a recitation his mind is distracted with his schemes and plans and instead of devoting his attention fully to the work he may have in hand his thoughts are wandering continually to new schemes and fancied improvements which agitate and perplex him and which elude his efforts to give them a distinct and definite form he thinks he must however carry out his principle he thinks of its applicability to a thousand other cases he revolves over and over again in his mind plans for changing the whole arrangement of his school he is again and again lost in perplexity his mind is engrossed and distracted and his present duties are performed with no interest and consequently with little spirit or success  now his error is in allowing a new idea which ought only to have suggested to him an agreeable change for a time in one of his classes to swell itself into undue and exaggerated importance and to draw off his mind from what ought to be the objects of his steady pursuit  perhaps some teacher of steady intellectual habits and a well balanced mind may think that this picture is fanciful and that there is little danger that such consequences will ever actually result from such a cause but far from having exaggerated the results i am of opinion that i might have gone much farther there is no doubt that a great many instances have occurred in which some simple idea like the one i have alluded to has led the unlucky conceiver of it in his eager pursuit far deeper into the difficulty than i have here supposed he gets into a contention with the school committee that formidable foe to the projects of all scheming teachers and it would not be very difficult to find many actual cases where the individual has in consequence of some such idea quietly planned and taken measures to establish some new institution where he can carry on unmolested his plans and let the world see the full results of his wonderful discoveries  we have in our country a very complete system of literary institutions so far as external organization will go and the prospect of success is far more favorable in efforts to carry these institutions into more complete and prosperous operation than in plans for changing them or substituting others in their stead were it not that such a course would be unjust to individuals a long and melancholy catalogue might easily be made out of abortive plans which have sprung up in the minds of young men in the manner i have described and which after perhaps temporary success have resulted in partial or total failure these failures are of every kind some are schoolbooks on a new plan which succeed in the inventors hand chiefly on account of the spirit which carried it into effect but which in ordinary hands and under ordinary circumstances and especially after long continued use have failed of exhibiting any superiority others are institutions commenced with great zeal by the projectors and which succeed just as long as that zeal continues zeal will make any thing succeed for a time others are new plans of instruction or government generally founded on some good principle carried to an extreme or made to grow into exaggerated and disproportionate importance examples almost innumerable of these things might be particularized if it were proper and it would be found upon examination that the amount of ingenuity and labor wasted upon such attempts would have been sufficient if properly expended to have elevated very considerably the standard of education and to have placed existing institutions in a far more prosperous and thriving state than they now exhibit  the reader will perhaps ask shall we make no efforts at improvement must every thing in education go on in a uniform and monotonous manner and while all else is advancing shall our cause alone stand still by no means it must advance but let it advance mainly by the industry and fidelity of those who are employed in it by changes slowly and cautiously made not by great efforts to reach forward to brilliant discoveries which will draw off the attention from essential duties and after leading the projector through perplexities and difficulties without number end in mortification and failure  were i to give a few concise and summary directions in regard to this subject to a young teacher they would be the following  1 examine thoroughly the system of public and private schools as now constituted in new england until you fully understand it and appreciate its excellences and its completeness see how fully it provides for the wants of the various classes of our population  by this i mean to refer only to the completeness of the system as a system of organization i do not refer at all to the internal management of these institutions this last is of course a field for immediate and universal effort at progress and improvement  2 if after fully understanding this system as it now exists you are of opinion that something more is necessary if you think some classes of the community are not fully provided for or that some of our institutions may be advantageously exchanged for others whose plan you have in mind consider whether your age and experience and standing as an instructer are such as to enable you to place confidence in your opinion  i do not mean by this that a young man may not make a useful discovery but only that he may be led away by the ardor of early life to fancy that essential and important which is really not so it is important that each one should determine whether this is not the case with himself if his mind is revolving some new plan  3 perhaps you are contemplating only a single new institution which is to depend for its success on yourself and some coadjutors whom you have in mind and whom you well know if this is the case consider whether the establishment you are contemplating can be carried on after you shall have left it by such men as can ordinarily be obtained if the plan is founded on some peculiar notions of your own which would enable you to succeed in it when others also interested in such a scheme would probably fail consider whether there may not be danger that your plan may be imitated by others who cannot carry it into successful operation so that it may be the indirect means of doing injury a man is in some degree responsible for his example and for the consequences which may indirectly flow from his course as well as for the immediate results which he produces the fellenberg school at hofwyl has perhaps by its direct results been as successful for a given time as perhaps any other institution in the world but there is a great offset to the good which it has thus done to be found in the history of the thousand wretched imitations of it which have been started only to linger a little while and die and in which a vast amount of time and talent and money have been wasted  consider the influence you may have upon the other institutions of our country by attaching yourself to some one under the existing organization if you take an academy or a private school constituted and organized like other similar institutions success in your own will give you influence over others a successful teacher of an academy raises the standard of academic instruction a college professor if he brings extraordinary talents to bear upon the regular duties of that office throws light universally upon the whole science of college discipline and instruction by going however to some new field establishing some new and fanciful institution you take yourself from such a sphereyou exert no influence over others except upon feeble imitators who fail in their attempts and bring discredit upon your plans by the awkwardness with which they attempt to adopt them how much more service to the cause of education have professors cleaveland and silliman rendered by falling in with the regularly organized institutions of the country and elevating them than if in early life they had given themselves to some magnificent project of an establishment to which their talents would unquestionably have given temporary success but which would have taken them away from the community of teachers and confined the results of their labors to the more immediate effects which their daily duties might produce  5 perhaps however your plan is not the establishment of some new institution but the introduction of some new study or pursuit into the one with which you are connected before however you interrupt the regular plans of your school to make such a change consider carefully what is the real and appropriate object of your institution every thing is not to be done in school the principles of division of labor apply with peculiar force to this employment so that you must not only consider whether the branch which you are now disposed to introduce is important but whether it is really such an one as it is on the whole best to include among the objects to be pursued in such an institution many teachers seem to imagine that if any thing is in itself important and especially if it is an important branch of education the question is settled of its being a proper object of attention in school but this is very far from being the case the whole work of education can never be intrusted to the teacher much must of course remain in the hands of the parent it ought so to remain the object of a school is not to take children out of the parental hands substituting the watch and guardianship of a stranger for the natural care of father and mother far from it it is only the association of the children for those purposes which can be more successfully accomplished by association it is an union for few specific and limited objects for the accomplishment of that part and it is comparatively a small part of the general objects of education which can be most successfully affected by public institutions and in assemblies of the young  6 if the branch which you are desiring to introduce appears to you to be an important part of education and if it seems to you that it can be most successfully attended to in schools then consider whether the introduction of it and of all the other branches having equal claims will or will not give to the common schools too great a complexity consider whether it will succeed in the hands of ordinary teachers consider whether it will require so much time and effort as will draw off in any considerable degree the attention of the teacher from the more essential parts of his duty all will admit that it is highly important that every school should be simple in its planas simple as its size and general circumstances will permit and especially that the public schools in every town and village of our country should never lose sight of what is and must be after all their great designteaching the whole population to read write and calculate  7 if it is a schoolbook which you are wishing to introduce consider well before you waste your time in preparing it and your spirits in the vexatious work of getting it through the press whether it is for general use so superior to those already published as to induce teachers to make a change in favor of yours i have italicised the words for general use for no delusion is more common than for a teacher to suppose that because a textbook which he has prepared and uses in manuscript is better for him than any other work which he can obtain it will therefore be better for general circulation every man if he has any originality of mind has of course some peculiar method of his own and he can of course prepare a textbook which will be better adapted to this method than those ordinarily in use the history of a vast multitude of textbooks arithmetics geographies and grammars is this a man of a somewhat ingenious mind adopts some peculiar mode of instruction in one of these branches and is quite successful not because the method has any very peculiar excellence but simply because he takes a greater interest in it both on account of its novelty and also from the fact that it is his own invention he conceives the plan of writing a textbook to develope and illustrate this method he hurries through the work by some means or other he gets it printed in due time it is regularly advertised the annals of education gives notice of it the author sends a few copies to his friends and that is the end of it perhaps a few schools may make a trial of it and if for any reason the teachers who try it are interested in the work perhaps in their hands it succeeds but it does not succeed so well as to attract general attention and consequently does not get into general circulation the author loses his time and his patience the publisher unless unfortunately it was published on the authors account loses his paper and in a few months scarcely any body knows that such a book ever saw the light  it is in this way that the great multitude of schoolbooks which are now constantly issuing from the press take their origin far be it from me to discourage the preparation of good schoolbooks this department of our literature offers a fine field for the efforts of learning and genius what i contend against is the endless multiplicity of useless works hastily conceived and carelessly executed and which serve no purpose but to employ uselessly talents which if properly applied might greatly benefit both the community and the possessor  8 if however after mature deliberation you conclude that you have the plan of a schoolbook which you ought to try to mature and execute be slow and cautious about it remember that so great is now the competition in this branch nothing but superior excellences will secure the favorable reception of a work examine all that your predecessors have done before you obtain whatever may be the trouble and expense all other text books on the subject and examine them thoroughly if you see that you can make a very decided advance on all that has been done and that the public will probably submit to the inconvenience and expense of a change to secure the result of your labors go forward slowly and thoroughly in your work no matter how much investigation how much time and labor it may require the more difficulty you may find in gaining the eminence the less likely will you be to be followed by successful competitors  9 consider in forming your textbook not merely the whole subject on which you are to write but also look extensively and thoroughly at the institutions throughout the country and consider carefully the character of the teachers by whom you expect it to be used sometimes a man publishes a textbook and when it fails on trial he says it is because they did not know how to use it the book in itself was good the whole fault was in the awkwardness and ignorance of the teacher how absurd as if to make a good textbook it was not as necessary to adapt it to teachers as to scholars a good textbook which the teachers for whom it was intended did not know how to use i e a good contrivance but entirely unfit for the purpose for which it was intended  10 lastly in every new plan consider carefully whether its success in your hands after you have tried it and found it successful be owing to its novelty and to your own special interest or to its own innate and intrinsic superiority if the former use it so long as it will last simply to give variety and interest to your plans recommend it in conversation or in other ways to teachers with whom you are acquainted not as a wonderful discovery which is going to change the whole science of education but as one method among others which may be introduced from time to time to relieve the monotony of the teachers labors  in a word do not go away from the established institutions of our country or deviate from the great objects which are at present and ought to be pursued by them without great caution circumspection and deliberate inquiry but within these limits exercise ingenuity and invention as much as you will pursue steadily the great objects which demand the teachers attention they are simple and few never lose sight of them nor turn to the right or to the left to follow any ignis fatuus which may endeavor to allure you away but exercise as much ingenuity and enterprise as you please in giving variety and interest to the modes by which these objects are pursued                                       if planning and scheming are confined within these limits and conducted on these principles the teacher will save all the agitating perplexity and care which will otherwise be his continual portion he can go forward peaceably and quietly and while his own success is greatly increased he may be of essential service to the cause in which he is engaged by making known his various experiments and plans to others for this purpose it seems to me highly desirable that every teacher should keep a journal of all his plans in these should be carefully entered all his experiments the new methods he adopts the course he takes in regard to difficulties which may arise and any interesting incidents which may occur which it would be useful for him to refer to at some future time these or the most interesting of them should be made known to other teachers this may be done in several ways  1 by publishing them in periodicals devoted to education such contributions furnished by judicious men would be among the most valuable articles in such a work they would be far more valuable than any general speculations however well conceived or expressed  2 in newspapers intended for general circulation there are very few editors whose papers circulate in families who would not gladly receive articles of this kind to fill a teachers department in their columns if properly written they would be read with interest and profit by multitudes of parents and would throw much light on family government and instruction  3 by reading them in teachers meetings if half a dozen teachers who are associated in the same vicinity would meet once a fortnight simply to hear each others journals they would be amply repaid for their time and labor teachers meetings will be interesting and useful when those who come forward in them will give up the prevailing practice of delivering orations and come down at once to the scenes and to the business of the schoolroom  there is one topic connected with the subject of this chapter which deserves a few paragraphs i refer to the rights of the committee or the trustees or patrons in the control of the school the right to such control when claimed at all is usually claimed in reference to the teachers new plans which renders it proper to allude to the subject here and it ought not to be omitted for a great many cases occur in which teachers have difficulties with the trustees or committee of their school sometimes these difficulties have amounted to an open rupture at other times only to a slight and temporary misunderstanding arising from what the teacher calls an unwise and unwarrantable interference on the part of the committee or the trustees in the arrangements of the school difficulties of some sort very often arise in fact a right understanding of this subject is in most cases absolutely essential to the harmony and cooperation of the teacher and the representatives of his patrons  there are then it must be recollected three different parties connected with every establishment for education the parents of the scholars the teacher and the pupils themselves sometimes as for example in a common private school the parents are not organized and whatever influence they exert they must exert in their individual capacity at other times as in a common district or town school they are by law organized and the school committee chosen for this purpose are their legal representatives in other instances a board of trustees are constituted by the appointment of the founders of the institution or by the legislature of a state to whom is committed the oversight of its concerns and who are consequently the representatives of the founders and patrons of the school  there are differences between these various modes of organization which i shall not now stop to examine as it will be sufficiently correct for my purpose to consider them all as only various ways of organizing the employers in the contract by which the teacher is employed the teacher is the agent the patrons represented in these several ways are the principals when therefore in the following paragraphs i use the word employers i mean to be understood to speak of the committee or the trustees or the visiters or the parents themselves as the case in each particular institution may be that is the persons for whose purpose and at whose expense the institution is maintained or their representatives  now there is a very reasonable and almost universally established rule which teachers are very frequently prone to forget viz the employed ought always to be responsible to the employers and to be under their direction so obviously reasonable is this rule and in fact so absolutely indispensable in the transaction of all the business of life that it would be idle to attempt to establish and illustrate it here it has however limitations and it is applicable to a much greater extent in some departments of human labor than in others it is applicable to the business of teaching and though i confess that it is somewhat less absolute and imperious here still it is obligatory i believe to far greater extent than teachers have been generally willing to admit  a young lady i will imagine wishes to introduce the study of botany into her school the parents or the committee object they say that they wish the children to confine their attention exclusively to the elementary branches of education it will do them no good says the chairman of the committee to learn by heart some dozen or two of learned names we want them to read well to write well and to calculate well and not to waste their time in studying about pistils and stamens and nonsense  now what is the duty of the teacher in such a case why very plainly her duty is the same as that of the governor of a state where the people through their representatives regularly chosen negative a proposal which he considers calculated to promote the public good it is his duty to submit to the public will and though he may properly do all in his power to present the subject to his employers in such a light as to lead them to regard it as he does he must still until they do so regard it bow to their authority and every magistrate who takes an enlarged and comprehensive view of his duties as the executive of a republican community will do this without any humiliating feelings of submission to unauthorized interference with his plans he will on the other hand enjoy the satisfaction of feeling that he confines himself to his proper sphere and leave to others the full possession of rights which properly pertain to them  it is so with every case where the relation of employer and employed subsists you engage a carpenter to erect a house for you and you present your plan instead of going to work and executing your orders according to your wishes he goes to criticising and condemning it he finds fault with this and ridicules that and tells you you ought to make such and such an alteration in it it is perfectly right for him to give his opinion in the tone and spirit of recommendation or suggestion with a distinct understanding that with his employer rests the power and the right to decide but how many teachers take possession of their school room as though it was an empire in which they are supreme who resist every interference of their employers as they would an attack upon their personal freedom and who feel that in regard to every thing connected with school they have really no actual responsibility  in most cases the employers knowing how sensitive teachers very frequently are on this point acquiesce in it and leave them to themselves whenever in any case they think that the state of the school requires their interference they come cautiously and fearfully to the teacher as if they were encroaching upon his rights instead of advancing with the confidence and directness with which employers have always a right to approach the employed and the teacher with the view he has insensibly taken of the subject being perhaps confirmed by the tone and manner which his employers use makes the conversation quite as often an occasion of resentment and offence as of improvement he is silent perhaps but in his heart he accuses his committee or his trustees of improper interference in his concerns as though it was no part of their business to look after work which is going forward for their advantage and for which they pay  perhaps some individuals who have had some collision with their trustees or committee will ask me if i mean that a teacher ought to be entirely and immediately under the supervision and control of the trustees just as a mechanic is when employed by another man by no means there are various circumstances connected with the nature of this employment the impossibility of the employers fully understanding it in all its details and the character and the standing of the teacher himself which always will in matter of fact prevent this the employers always will in a great many respects place more confidence in the teacher and in his views than they will in their own but still the ultimate power is theirs even if they errif they wish to have a course pursued which is manifestly inexpedient and wrong they still have a right to decide it is their work it is going on at their instance and at their expense and the power of ultimate decision on all disputed questions must from the very nature of the case rest with them the teacher may it is true have his option either to comply with their wishes or to seek employment in another sphere but while he remains in the employ of any persons whether in teaching or in any other service he is bound to yield to the wishes of his employers when they insist upon it and to submit pleasantly to their direction when they shall claim their undoubted right to direct  this is to be done it must be remembered when they are wrong as well as when they are right the obligation of the teacher is not founded upon the superior wisdom of his employers in reference to the business for which they have engaged him for they are very probably his inferiors in this respect but upon their right as employers to determine how their own work shall be done a gardener we will suppose is engaged by a gentleman to lay out his grounds the gardener goes to work and after a few hours the gentleman comes out to see how he goes on and to give directions he proposes something which the gardener who to make the case stronger we will suppose knows better that the proprietor of the grounds considers ridiculous and absurd nay we will suppose it is ridiculous and absurd now what can the gardener do there are obviously two courses he can say to the proprietor after a vain attempt to convince him he is wrong well sir i will do just as you say the grounds are yours i have no interest in it or responsibility except to accomplish your wishes this would be right or he might say sir you have a right to direct upon your own grounds and i do not wish to interfere with your plans but i must ask you to obtain another gardener i have a reputation at stake and this work if i do it even at your direction will be considered as a specimen of my taste and of my planning so that i must in justice to myself decline remaining in your employment this too would be right though probably both in the business of gardening and of teaching the case ought to be a strong one to render it expedient  but it would not be right for him after his employer should have gone away to say to himself with a feeling of resentment at the imaginary interference i shall not follow any such directions i understand my own trade and shall receive no instructions in it from him and then disobeying all directions go on and do the work contrary to the orders of his employer who alone has a right to decide  and yet a great many teachers take a course as absurd and unjustifiable as this would be whenever the parents or the committee or the trustees express however mildly and properly their wishes in regard to the manner in which they desire to have their own work performed their pride is at once aroused they seem to feel it an indignity to act in any other way than just in accordance with their own will and pleasure and they absolutely refuse to comply resenting the interference as an insult or else if they apparently yield it is with mere cold civility and entirely without any honest desires to carry the wishes thus expressed into actual effect  parents may indeed often misjudge a good teacher will however soon secure their confidence and they will acquiesce in his opinion but they ought to be watchful and the teacher ought to feel and acknowledge their authority on all questions connected with the education of their children they have originally entire power in regard to the course which is to be pursued with them providence has made the parents responsible and wholly responsible for the manner in which their children are prepared for the duties of this life and it is interesting to observe how very cautious the laws of society are about interfering with the parents wishes in regard to the education of the child there are many cases in which enlightened governments might make arrangements which would be better than those made by the parents if they are left to themselves but they will not do it they ought not to do it god has placed the responsibility in the hands of the father and mother and unless the manner in which it is exercised is calculated to endanger or to injure the community there can rightfully be no interference except that of argument and persuasion  it ought also to be considered that upon the parents will come the consequences of the good or bad education of their children and not upon the teacher and consequently it is right that they should direct the teacher remains perhaps a few months with his charge and then goes to other places and perhaps hears of them no more he has thus very little at stake the parent has every thing at stake and it is manifestly unjust to give one man the power of deciding while he escapes all the consequences of his mistakes if he makes any and to take away all the power from those upon whose heads all the suffering which will follow an abuse of the power must descend     chapter viii  reports of cases   there is perhaps no way by which a writer can more effectually explain his views on the subject of education than by presenting a great variety of actual cases whether real or imaginary and describing particularly the course of treatment he would recommend in each this method of communicating knowledge is very extensively resorted to in the medical profession where writers detail particular cases and report the symptoms and the treatment for each succeeding day so that the reader may almost fancy himself actually a visiter at the sick bed and the nature and effects of the various prescriptions become fixed in the mind with almost as much distinctness and permanency as actual experience would give  this principle has been kept in view the reader may perhaps think too closely in all the chapters of this volume almost every point brought up having been illustrated by anecdotes and narratives i propose however devoting one chapter now to presenting a number of miscellaneous cases without any attempt to arrange them sometimes the case will be merely stated the reader being left to draw the inference at others such remarks will be added as the case suggests all will however be intended to answer some useful purpose either to exhibit good or bad management and its consequences or to bring to view some trait of human nature as it exhibits itself in children which it may be desirable for the teacher to know let it be understood however that these cases are not selected with reference to their being strange or extraordinary they are rather chosen because they are common i e they or cases similar will be constantly occurring to the teacher and reading such a chapter will be the best substitute for experience which the teacher can have some are descriptions of literary exercises or plans which the reader can adopt in classes or with a whole school others are cases of disciplinegood or bad management which the teacher can imitate or avoid the stories are from various sources and are the results of the experience of several individuals   1 hats and bonnets the master of a district school was accidentally looking out of the window one day and he saw one of the boys throwing stones at a hat which was put up for that purpose upon the fence he said nothing about it at the time but made a memorandum of the occurrence that he might bring it before the school at the proper time when the hour set apart for attending to the general business of the school had arrived and all were still he said  i saw one of the boys throwing stones at a hat today did he do right or wrong  there were one or two faint murmurs which sounded like wrong but the boys generally made no answer  perhaps it depends a little upon the question whose hat it was do you think it does depend upon that  yes sir  well suppose then it was not his own hat and he was throwing stones at it without the owners consent would it be plain in that case whether he was doing right or wrong  yes sir wrong was the universal reply  suppose it was his own hat would he have been right has a boy a right to do what he pleases with his own hat  yes sir yes sir no sir no sir answered the boys confusedly  i do not know whose hat it was if the boy who did it is willing to rise and tell me it will help us to decide this question  the boy knowing that a severe punishment was not in such a case to be anticipated and in fact apparently pleased with the idea of exonerating himself from the blame of wilfully injuring the property of another rose and said  i suppose it was i sir who did it and it was my own hat  well said the master i am glad you are willing to tell frankly how it was but let us look at this case there are two senses in which a hat may be said to belong to any person it may belong to him because he bought it and paid for it or it may belong to him because it fits him and he wears it in other words a person may have a hat as his property or he may have it only as a part of his dress now you see that according to the first of these senses all the hats in this school belong to your fathers there is not in fact a single boy in this school who has a hat of his own  the boys laughed  is not this the fact  yes sir  it certainly is so though i suppose james did not consider it your fathers bought your hats they worked for them and paid for them you are only the wearers and consequently every generous boy and in fact every honest boy will be careful of the property which is intrusted to him but which strictly speaking is not his own   2 mistakes a wide difference must always be made between mistakes arising from carelessness and those resulting from circumstances beyond control such as want of sufficient data c the former are always censurable the latter never for they may be the result of correct reasoning from insufficient data and it is the reasoning only for which the child is responsible  what do you suppose a prophet is said an instructer to a class of little boys the word occurred in their reading lesson  the scholars all hesitated at last one ventured to reply  if a man should sell a yoke of oxen and get more for them than they are worth he would be a prophet  yes said the instructer that is right that is one kind of profit but this is another and a little different and he proceeded to explain the word and the difference of the spelling  this child had without doubt heard of some transaction of the kind which he described and had observed that the word profit was applied to it now the care which he had exercised in attending to it at the time and remembering it when the same word for the difference in the spelling he of course knew nothing about occurred again was really commendable the fact which is a mere accident that we affix very different significations to the same sound was unknown the fault if anywhere was in the language and not in him for he reasoned correctly from the data he possessed and he deserved credit for it   3 tardiness my duty to this school said a teacher to his pupils demands as i suppose you all admit that i should require you all to be here punctually at the time appointed for the commencement of the school i have done nothing on this subject yet for i wished to see whether you would not come early on principle i wish now however to inquire in regard to this subject and to ascertain how many have been tardy and to consider what must be done hereafter  he made the inquiries and ascertained pretty nearly how many had been tardy and how often within a week  the number was found to be so great that the scholars admitted that something ought to be done  what shall i do asked he can any one propose a plan which will remedy the difficulty  there was no answer  transcribers note the footnote marker for the following footnote is missing footnote d the above and one or two of the succeeding articles have been before published in periodicals  the easiest and pleasantest way to secure punctuality is for the scholars to come early of their own accord upon principle it is evident from the reports that many of you do so but some do not now there is no other plan which will not be attended with very serious difficulty but i am willing to adopt the one which will be pleasantest to yourselves if it will be likely to accomplish the object has any one any plan to propose  there was a pause  it would evidently continued the teacher be the easiest for me to leave this subject and do nothing about it it is of no personal consequence to me whether you come early or not but as long as i hold this office i must be faithful and i have no doubt the school committee if they knew how many of you were tardy would think i ought to do something to diminish the evil  the best plan i can think of is that all who are tardy should lose their recess  the boys looked rather anxiously at one another but continued silent  there is a great objection to this plan from the fact that a boy is sometimes necessarily absent and by this rule he will lose his recess with the rest so that the innocent will be punished with the guilty  i should think sir said william that those who are necessarily tardy might be excused  yes i should be very glad to excuse them if i could find out who they are  the boys seemed to be surprised at this remark as if they thought it would not be a difficult matter to decide  how can i tell asked the master  you can hear their excuses and then decide  yes said the teacher but here are fifteen or twenty boys tardy this morning now how long would it take me to hear their excuses and understand each case thoroughly so that i could really tell whether they were tardy from good reasons or not  no answer  should you not think it would take a minute apiece  yes sir  it would undoubtedly and even then i could not in many cases tell it would take fifteen minutes at least i cannot do this in schoolhours for i have not time and if i do it in recess it will consume the whole of every recess now i need the rest of a recess as well as you and it does not seem to me to be just that i should lose the whole of mine every day and spend it in a most unpleasant business when i take pains myself to come punctually every morning would it be just  no sir  i think it would be less unjust to deprive all of their recess who are tardy for then the loss of a recess by a boy who had not been to blame would not be very common and the evil would be divided among the whole but in the plan of my hearing the excuses it would all come upon one  after a short pause one of the boys said that they might be required to bring written excuses  yes that is another plan said the teacher but there are objections to it can any of you think what they are i suppose you have all been either at this school or at some other required to bring written excuses so that you have seen the plan tried now have you never noticed any objection to it  one boy said that it gave the parents a great deal of trouble at home  yes said the teacher this is a great objection it is often very inconvenient to write but that is not the greatest difficulty can any of you think of any other  there was a pause  do you think that these written excuses are after all a fair test of the real reasons for tardiness i understand that sometimes boys will tease their fathers or mothers for an excuse when they do not deserve it yes sir and sometimes they will loiter about when sent of an errand before school knowing that they can get a written excuse when they might easily have been punctual  yes sir yes sir said the boys  well now if we adopt this plan some unprincipled boy would always contrive to have an excuse whether necessarily tardy or not and besides each parent would have a different principle and a different opinion as to what was a reasonable excuse so that there would be no uniformity and consequently no justice in the operation of the system  the boys admitted the truth of this and as no other plan was presented the rule was adopted of requiring all those who were tardy to remain in their seats during the recess whether they were necessarily tardy or not the plan very soon diminished the number of loiterers   4 helens lesson the possibility of being inflexibly firm in measures and at the same time gentle and mild in manners and language is happily illustrated in the following description which is based on an incident narrated by mrs sherwood  mrs m had observed even during the few days that helen had been under her care that she was totally unaccustomed to habits of diligence and application after making all due allowance for long indulged habits of indolence and inattention she one morning assigned an easy lesson to her pupil informing her at the same time that she should hear it immediately before dinner helen made no objections to the plan but she silently resolved not to perform the required task being in some measure a stranger she thought her aunt would not insist upon perfect obedience and besides in her estimation she was too old to be treated like a child  during the whole morning helen exerted herself to be mild and obliging her conduct towards her aunt was uncommonly affectionate by these and various other artifices she endeavored to gain her first victory meanwhile mrs m quietly pursued her various avocations without apparently noticing helens conduct at length dinner hour arrived the lesson was called for and found unprepared mrs m told helen she was sorry she had not got the lesson and went on to explain one or two sentences more fully and concluded by saying that she hoped it would be learned before teatime  helen finding she was not to come to the table began to be a little alarmed she was acquainted in some measure with the character of her aunt still she hoped to be allowed to partake of the dessert as she had been accustomed to on similar occasions at home and soon regained her wonted composure but the dinner cloth was removed and there sat helen suffering not a little from hunger still she would not complain she meant to convince her aunt that she was not moved by trifles  a walk had been proposed for the afternoon and as the hour drew near helen made preparations to accompany the party mrs m reminded her of her lesson but she just noticed the remark by a toss of the head and was soon in the green fields apparently the gayest of the gay after her return from the excursion she complained of a headache which in fact she had she threw herself languidly on the sofa sighed deeply and took up her history  tea was now on the table and most tempting looked the white loaf mrs m again heard the pupil recite but was sorry to find the lesson still imperfectly prepared she left her saying she thought an half hours study would conquer all the difficulties she found in the lesson  during all this time mrs m appeared so perfectly calm composed and even kind and so regardless of sighs and doleful exclamations that helen entirely lost her equanimity and let her tears flow freely and abundantly her mother was always moved by her tears and would not her aunt relent no mrs m quietly performed the duties of the table and ordered the teaequipage to be removed this latter movement brought helen to reflection it is useless to resist thought she indeed why should i wish to nothing too much has been required of me how ridiculous i have made myself appear in the eyes of my aunt and even of the domestics  in less than an hour she had the satisfaction of reciting her lesson perfectly her aunt made no comments on the occasion but assigned her the next lesson and went on sewing helen did not expect this she had anticipated a refreshing cup of tea after the long siege she had expected that even something nicer than usual would be necessary to compensate her for past sufferings at length worn out by long continued watching and fasting she went to the closet provided herself with a cracker and retired to bed to muse deliberately on the strange character of her aunt  teachers not unfrequently threaten their pupils with some proper punishment but when obliged to put the threat into execution contrive in some indirect way to abate its rigor and thus destroy all its effects for example a mother was in the habit when her little boy ran beyond his proscribed playground of putting him into solitary confinement on such occasions she was very careful to have some amusing book or diverting plaything in a conspicuous part of the room and not unfrequently a piece of gingerbread was given to solace the runaway the mother thought it very strange her little boy should so often transgress when he knew what to expect from such a course of conduct the boy was wiser than the mother he knew perfectly well how to manage he could play with the boys beyond the garden gate and if detected to be sure he was obliged to spend a quiet hour in the pleasant parlor but this was not intolerable as long as he could expect a paper of sugarplums a cake or at least something amply to compensate him for the loss of a game at marbles   5 complaints of long lessons a college officer assigned lessons which the idle and ignorant members of the class thought too long they murmured for a time and at last openly complained the other members of the class could say nothing in behalf of the professor awed by the greatest of all fears to a collegian the fear of being called a fisher or a blueskin the professor paid no attention to the petitions and complaints which were poured in upon him and which though originated by the idle all were compelled to vote for he coldly and with uncompromising dignity went on the excitement in the class increased and what is called a college rebellion with all its disastrous consequences to the infatuated rebels ensued  another professor had the dexterity to manage in a different way after hearing that there was dissatisfaction he brought up the subject as follows  i understand gentlemen that you consider your lessons too long perhaps i have overrated the abilities of the class but i have not intended to assign you more than you can accomplish i feel no other interest in the subject than the pride and pleasure it would give me to have my class stand high in respect to the amount of ground it has gone over when you come to examination i propose therefore that you appoint a committee in whose abilities and judgment you can confide and let them examine this subject and report they might ascertain how much other classes have done and how much is expedient for this class to attempt and then by estimating the number of recitations assigned to this study they can easily determine what should be the length of the lessons  the plan was adopted and the report put an end to the difficulty   6 english composition the great prevailing fault of writers in this country is an affectation of eloquence it is almost universally the fashion to aim not at striking thoughts simply and clearly expressed but at splendid language glowing imagery and magnificent periods it arises perhaps from the fact that public speaking is the almost universal object of ambition and consequently both at school and at college nothing is thought of but oratory vain attempts at oratory result in nine cases out of ten in grandiloquence and empty verbiagecommon thoughts expressed in pompous periods  the teacher should guard against this and assign to children such subjects as are within the field of childish observation a little skill on his part will soon determine the question which kind of writing shall prevail in his school the following specimens both written with some skill will illustrate the two kinds of writing alluded to both were written by pupils of the same age twelve one a boy the other a girl the subjects were assigned by the teacher i need not say that the following was the writers first attempt at composition and that it is printed without alteration        the pains of a sailors life       the joyful sailor embarks on board of his ship the sails are      spread to catch the playful gale swift as an arrow he cuts the      rolling wave a few days thus sporting on the briny wave when      suddenly the sky is overspread with clouds the rain descends in      torrents the sails are lowered the gale begins the vessel is      carried with great velocity and the shrouds unable to support the      tottering mast gives way to the furious tempest the vessel is      drove among the rocks is sprung aleak the sailor works at the      pumps till faint and weary is heard from below six feet of      water in the hold the boats are got ready but before they are      into them the vessel dashed against a reef of rocks some in      despair throw themselves into the sea others get on the rocks      without any clothes or provisions and linger a few days perhaps      weeks or months living on shell fish or perhaps taken up by some      ship others get on pieces of the wreck and perhaps be cast on      some foreign country where perhaps he may be taken by the natives      and sold into slavery where he never more returns  in regard to the following specimen it should be stated that when the subject was assigned the pupil was directed to see how precisely she could imitate the language and conversation which two little children really lost in the woods would use while writing therefore her mind was in pursuit of the natural and the simple not of the eloquent       two children lost in the woods       emily look here see how many berries ive got i dont believe      youve got so many       charles yes im sure i have my baskets most full and if we      hurry we shall get ever so many before we go home so pick away as

oh dear theres the sun setting it will be dreadfully      dark by and by wont it  we have given enough for a specimen the composition though faulty in many respects illustrates the point we had in view   7 insincere confession an assistant in a school informed the principal that she had some difficulty in preserving order in a certain class composed of small children the principal accordingly went into the class and something like the following dialogue ensued  your teacher informs me said the principal that there is not perfect order in this class now if you are satisfied that there has not been order and wish to help me discover and correct the fault we can do it very easily if on the other hand you do not wish to cooperate with me it will be a little more difficult for me to correct it and i must take a different course now i wish to know at the outset whether you do or do not wish to help me  a faint yes sir was murmured through the class  i do not wish you to assist me unless you really and honestly desire it yourselves and if you undertake to do it you must do it honestly the first thing which will be necessary will be an open and thorough exposure of all which has been wrong and this you know will be unpleasant but i will put the question to vote by asking how many are willing that i should know entirely and fully all that they have done in this class that has been wrong  very nearly all the hands were raised at once promptly and the others were gradually brought up though with more or less of hesitation  are you willing not only to tell me yourselves what you have done but also in case any one has forgotten something which she has done that others should tell me of it  the hands were all raised  after obtaining thus from the class a distinct and universal expression of willingness that all the facts should be made known the principal called upon all those who had any thing to state to raise their hands and those who raised them had opportunity to say what they wished a great number of very trifling incidents were mentioned such as could not have produced any difficulty in the class and consequently could not have been the real instances of disorder alluded to or at least it was evident if they were that in the statement they must have been so palliated and softened that a really honest confession had not been made this result might in such a case have been expected such is human nature that in nine cases out of ten unless such a result had been particularly guarded against it would have inevitably followed  not only will such a result follow in individual cases like this but unless the teacher watches and guards against it it will grow into a habit i mean boys will get a sort of an idea that it is a fine thing to confess their faults and by a show of humility and frankness will deceive their teacher and perhaps themselves by a sort of acknowledgement which in fact exposes nothing of the guilt which the transgressor professes to expose a great many cases occur where teachers are pleased with the confession of faults and scholars perceive it and the latter get into the habit of coming to the teacher when they have done something which they think may get them into difficulty and make a sort of half confession which by bringing forward every palliating circumstance and suppressing every thing of different character keeps entirely out of view all the real guilt of the transgression the criminal is praised by the teacher for the frankness and honesty of the confession and his fault is freely forgiven he goes away therefore well satisfied with himself when in fact he has been only submitting to a little mortification voluntarily to avoid the danger of a greater much in the same spirit with that which leads a man to receive the smallpox by inoculation to avoid the danger of taking it in the natural way  the teacher who accustoms his pupils to confess their faults voluntarily ought to guard carefully against this danger when such a case as the one just described occurs it will afford a favorable opportunity of showing distinctly to pupils the difference between an honest and an hypocritical confession in this instance the teacher proceeded thus  now i wish to ask you one more question which i wish you all to answer by your votes honestly it is this do you think that the real disorder which has been in this class that is the real cases which you referred to when you stated to me that you thought that the class was not in good order have been now really exposed so that i honestly and fully understand the case how many suppose so  not a single hand was raised  how many of you think and are willing to avow your opinion that i have not been fully informed of the case  a large proportion held up their hands  now it seems the class pretended to be willing that i should know all the affair you pretended to be willing to tell me the whole but when i call upon you for the information instead of telling me honestly you attempt to amuse me by little trifles which in reality made no disturbance and you omit the things which you know were the real objects of my inquiries am i right in my supposition  they were silent after a moments pause one perhaps raised her hand and began now to confess something which she had before concealed  the teacher however interrupted her by saying  i do not wish to have the confession made now i gave you all time to do that and now i should rather not hear any more about the disorder i gave an opportunity to have it acknowledged but it was not honestly improved and now i should rather not hear i shall probably never know  i wished to see whether this class would be honestreally honest or whether they would have the insincerity to pretend to be confessing when they were not doing so honestly so as to get the credit of being frank and sincere when in reality they are not so now am i not compelled to conclude that this latter is the case  such an example will make a deep and lasting impression it will show that the teacher is upon his guard and there are very few so hardened in deception that they would not wish that they had been really sincere rather than rest under such an imputation   8 court a pupil quite young says a teacher came to me one day with a complaint that one of her companions had got her seat there had been some changes in the seats by my permission and probably from some inconsistency in the promises which i had made there were two claimants for the same desk the complainant came to me and appealed to my recollection of the circumstance  i do not recollect anything about it said i  why mr b replied she with astonishment  no said i you forget that i have every day arrangements almost without number of such a kind to make and as soon as i have made one i immediately forget all about it  why dont you remember that you got me a new baize  no i ordered a dozen new baizes at that time but i do not remember who they were for  there was a pause the disappointed complainants seemed not to know what to do  i will tell you what to do bring the case into court and i will try it regularly  why mr b i do not like to do any thing like that about it besides i do not know how to write an indictment  oh i replied they will like to have a good trial it will make a new sort of case all our cases thus far have been for offences that is what they call criminal cases and this will be only an examination of the conflicting claims of two individuals to the same property and it will excite a good deal of interest i think you had better bring it into court  she went slowly and thoughtfully to her seat and presently returned with an indictment  mr b is this right  it was as follows       i accuse miss a b of coming to take away my seat the one mr b      gave me       witnesses   c d                   e t  why   yesthat will do and yet it is not exactly right you see this is what they call a civil case  i dont think it is very civil  no i dont mean it was civil to take your seat but this is not a case where a person is prosecuted for having done anything wrong  the plaintiff looked a little perplexed as if she could not understand how it could be otherwise than wrong for a girl to usurp her seat  i mean you do not bring it into court as a case of wrong you do not want her to be punished do you  no i only want her to give me up my seat i dont want her to be punished  well then you see that although she may have done wrong to take your seat it is not in that point of view that you bring it into court it is a question about the right of property and the lawyers call such cases civil cases to distinguish them from cases where persons are tried for the purpose of being punished for doing wrong these are called criminal cases  the aggrieved party still looked perplexed well mr b she continued what shall i do how shall i write it i cannot say anything about civil in it can i  a form was given her which would be proper for the purpose and the case was brought forward and the evidence on both sides examined the irritation of the quarrel was soon dissipated in the amusement of a semiserious trial and both parties good humoredly acquiesced in the decision   9 teachers personal character much has been said within a few years by writers in the subject of education in this country on the desirableness of raising the business of teaching to the rank of a learned profession there is but one way of doing this and that is raising the personal characters and attainments of teachers themselves whether an employment is elevated or otherwise in public estimation depends altogether on the associations connected with it in the public mind and these depend altogether on the characters of the individuals who are engaged in it franklin by the simple fact that he was a printer himself has done more towards giving dignity and respectability to the employment of printing than a hundred orations on the intrinsic excellence of the art in fact all mechanical employments have within a few years risen in rank in this country not through the influence of efforts to impress the community directly with a sense of their importance but simply because mechanics themselves have risen in intellectual and moral character in the same manner the employment of the teacher will be raised most effectually in the estimation of the public not by the individual who writes the most eloquent oration on the intrinsic dignity of the art but by the one who goes forward most successfully in the exercise of it and who by his general attainments and public character stands out most fully to the view of the public as a well informed liberal minded and useful man  if this is so and it cannot well be denied it furnishes every teacher a strong motive to exertion for the improvement of his own personal character but there is a stronger motive still in the results which flow directly to himself from such efforts no man ought to engage in any business which as mere business will engross all his time and attention the creator has bestowed upon every one a mind upon the cultivation of which our rank among intelligent beings our happiness our moral and intellectual power every thing valuable to us depend and after all the cultivation which we can bestow in this life upon this mysterious principle it will still be in embryo the progress which it is capable of making is entirely indefinite if by ten years of cultivation we can secure a certain degree of knowledge and power by ten more we can double or more than double it and every succeeding year of effort is attended with equal success there is no point of attainment where we must stop or beyond which effort will bring in a less valuable return  look at that teacher and consider for a moment his condition he began to teach when he was twenty years of age and now he is forty between the years of fifteen and twenty he made a vigorous effort to acquire such an education as would fit him for these duties he succeeded and by these efforts he raised himself from being a mere laborer receiving for his daily toil a mere daily subsistence to the respectability and the comforts of an intellectual pursuit but this change once produced he stops short in his progress once seated in his desk he is satisfied and for twenty years he has been going through the same routine without any effort to advance or to improve he does not reflect that the same efforts which so essentially altered his condition and prospects at twenty would have carried him forward to higher and higher sources of influence and enjoyment as long as he should continue them his efforts ceased when he obtained a situation as teacher at forty dollars a month and though twenty years have glided away he is now exactly what he was then  there is probably no employment whatever which affords so favorable an opportunity for personal improvementfor steady intellectual and moral progress as that of teaching there are two reasons for this  first there is time for it with an ordinary degree of health and strength the mind can be vigorously employed at least ten hours a day as much as this is required of students in many literary institutions in fact ten hours to study seven to sleep and seven to food exercise and recreation is perhaps as good an arrangement as can be made at any rate very few persons will suppose that such a plan allows too little under the latter head now six hours is as much as is expected of teachers under ordinary circumstances and it is as much as ought ever to be bestowed for though he may labor four hours out of school in some new field his health and spirits will soon sink under the burden if after his weary labors during the day in school he gives up his evenings to the same perplexities and cares and it is not necessary no one who knows any thing of the nature of the human mind and who will reflect a moment on the subject can doubt that a man can make a better school by expending six hours labor upon it which he can go through with with some alacrity and ardor than he can by driving himself on to ten every teacher therefore who is commencing his work should begin with the firm determination of devoting only six hours daily to the pursuit make as good a school and accomplish as much for it as you can in six hours and let the rest go when you come from your school room at night leave all your perplexities and cares behind you no matter what unfinished business or unsettled difficulties remain dismiss them all till another sun shall rise and the hour of duty for another day shall come carry no school work home with you and do not talk of your work you will then get refreshment and rest your mind during the evening will be in a different world from that in which you have moved during the day at first this will be difficult it will be hard for you unless your mind is uncommonly well disciplined to dismiss all your cares and you will think each evening that some peculiar emergency demands your attention just at that time and that as soon as you have passed the crisis you will confine yourself to what you admit are generally reasonable limits but if you once allow school with its perplexities and cares to get possession of the rest of the day it will keep possession it will intrude itself into all your waking thoughts and trouble you in your dreams you will lose all command of your powers and besides cutting off from yourself all hope of general intellectual progress you will in fact destroy your success as a teacher exhaustion weariness and anxiety will be your continual portion and in such a state no business can be successfully prosecuted  there need be no fear that employers will be dissatisfied if the teacher acts upon this principle if he is faithful and enters with all his heart into the discharge of his duties during six hours there will be something in the ardor and alacrity and spirit with which his duties will be performed which parents and scholars will both be very glad to receive in exchange for the languid and dull and heartless toil in which the other method must sooner or later result                                       if the teacher then will confine himself to such a portion of time as is in fact all he can advantageously employ there will be much left which can be devoted to his own private employmentmore than is usual in the other employments of life in most of these other employments there is not the same necessity for limiting the hours which a man may devote to his business a merchant for example may be employed nearly all the day at his countingroom and so may a mechanic a physician may spend all his wakinghours in visiting patients and feel little more than healthy fatigue the reason is that in all these employments and in fact in most of the employments of life there is so much to diversify so many little incidents constantly occurring to animate and relieve and so much bodily exercise which alternates with and suspends the fatigues of the mind that the labors may be much longer continued and with less cessation and yet the health not suffer but the teacher while engaged in his work has his mind continually on the stretch there is little to relieve little respite and he is almost entirely deprived of bodily exercise he must consequently limit his hours of attending to his business or his health will soon sink under labors which providence never intended the human mind to bear  there is another circumstance which facilitates the progress of the teacher it is a fact that all this general progress has a direct and immediate bearing upon his pursuits a lawyer may read in an evening an interesting book of travels and find nothing to help him with his case the next day in courtbut almost every fact which the teacher thus learns will come at once into use in some of his recitations at school we do not mean to imply by this that the members of the legal profession have not need of a great variety and extent of knowledge they doubtless have it is simply in the directness and certainty with which the teachers knowledge may be applied to his purpose that the business of teaching has the advantage over every other pursuit  this fact now has a very important influence in encouraging and leading forward the teacher to make constant intellectual progress for every step brings at once a direct reward   10 the chestnut burr a story for schoolboyse one fine pleasant morning in the fall of the year the master was walking along towards school and he saw three or four boys under a large chestnut tree gathering chestnuts  footnote e originally written for a periodical  one of the boys was sitting upon the ground trying to open some chestnut burrs which he had knocked off from the tree the burrs were green and he was trying to open them by pounding them with a stone  he was a very impatient boy and was scolding in a loud angry tone against the burrs he did not see he said what in the world chestnuts were made to grow so for they ought to grow right out in the open air like apples and not have such vile porcupine skins on themjust to plague the boys so saying he struck with all his might a fine large burr crushed it to pieces and then jumped up using at the same time profane and wicked words as soon as he turned round he saw the master standing very near him he felt very much ashamed and afraid and hung down his head  roger said the master for this boys name was roger can you get me a chestnut burr  roger looked up for a moment to see whether the master was in earnest and then began to look around for a burr  a boy who was standing near the tree with a red cap full of burrs in his hand held out one of them roger took the burr and handed it to the master who quietly put it into his pocket and walked away without saying a word  as soon as he was gone the boy with the red cap said to roger i expected the master would have given you a good scolding for talking so  the master never scolds said another boy who was sitting on a log pretty near with a green satchel in his hand but you see if he does not remember it roger looked as if he did not know what to think about it  i wish said he i knew what he is going to do with that burr  that afternoon when the lessons had been all recited and it was about time to dismiss the school the boys put away their books and the master read a few verses in the bible and then offered a prayer in which he asked god to forgive all the sins which any of them had committed that day and to take care of them during the night after this he asked the boys all to sit down he then took his handkerchief out of his pocket and laid it on the desk and afterwards he put his hand into his pocket again and took out the chestnut burr and all the boys looked at it  boys said he do you know what this is  one of the boys in the back seat said in a half whisper it is nothing but a chestnut burr  lucy said the master to a brighteyed little girl near him what is this  it is a chestnut burr sir said she  do you know what it is for  i suppose there are chestnuts in it  but what is this rough prickly covering for  lucy did not know  does any body here know said the master  one of the boys said he supposed it was to hold the chestnuts together and keep them up on the tree  but i heard a boy say replied the master that they ought not to be made to grow so the nut itself he thought ought to hang alone on the branches without any prickly coveringjust as apples do  but the nuts themselves have no stems to be fastened by answered the same boy  that is true but i suppose this boy thought that god could have made them grow with stems and that this would have been better than to have them in burrs  after a little pause the master said he would explain to them what the chestnut burr was for and wished them all to listen attentively  how much of the chestnut is good to eat william asked he looking at a boy before him  only the meat  how long does it take the meat to grow  all summer i suppose it is growing  yes it begins early in the summer and gradually swells and grows until it has become of full size and is ripe in the fall now suppose there was a tree out here near the schoolhouse and the chestnut meats should grow upon it without any shell or covering suppose too that they should taste like good ripe chestnuts at first when they were very small do you think they would be safe  william said no the boys would pick and eat them before they had time to grow  well what harm would there be in that would it not be as well to have the chestnuts early in the summer as to have them in the fall  william hesitated another boy who sat next to him said  there would not be so much meat in the chestnuts if they were eaten before they had time to grow  right said the master but would not the boys know this and so all agree to let the little chestnuts stay and not eat them while they were small  william said he thought they would not if the chestnuts were good he was afraid they would pick them off and eat them if they were small  all the rest of the boys in the school thought so too  here then said the master is one reason for having prickles around the chestnuts when they are small but then it is not necessary to have all chestnuts guarded from boys in this way a great many of the trees are in the woods which the boys do not see what good do the burrs do in these trees  the boys hesitated presently the boy who had the green satchel under the tree with roger who was sitting in one corner of the room said  i should think they would keep the squirrels from eating them  and besides continued he after thinking a moment i should suppose if the meat of the chestnut had no covering the rain might wet it and make it rot or the sun might dry and wither it  yes said the master these are very good reasons why the nut should be carefully guarded first the meats are packed away in a hard brown shell which the water cannot get through this keeps it dry and away from dust and other things which might injure it then several nuts thus protected grow closely together inside this green prickly covering which spreads over them and guards them from the larger animals and the boys where the chestnut gets its full growth and is ripe this covering you know splits open and the nuts drop out and then any body can get them and eat them  the boys were then all satisfied that it was better that chestnuts should grow in burrs  but why asked one of the boys do not apples grow so  can any body answer that question asked the master  the boy with the green satchel said that apples had a smooth tight skin which kept out the wet but he did not see how they were guarded from animals  the master said is was by their taste they are hard and sour before they are full grown and so the taste is not pleasant and nobody wants to eat themexcept sometimes a few foolish boys and these are punished by being made sick when the apples are full grown they change from sour to sweet and become mellow then they can be eaten can you tell me of any other fruits which are preserved in this way  one boy answered strawberries and blackberries and another said peaches and pears  another boy asked why the peachstone was not outside the peach so as to keep it from being eaten but the master said he would explain this another time then he dismissed the scholars after asking roger to wait until the rest had gone as he wished to see him alone   11 the series of writing lessons cf very many pupils soon become weary of the dull and monotonous business of writing unless some plans are devised to give interest and variety to the exercise and on this account this branch of education in which improvement may be most rapid is often the last and most tedious to be acquired  footnote f the articles to which this letter is prefixed were communicated for the work by different teachers at the request of the author  a teacher by adopting the following plan succeeded in awakening a great degree of interest in this subject and consequently of promoting rapid improvement the plan was this he prepared on a large sheet of paper a series of lessons in coarse hand beginning with straight lines and proceeding to the elementary parts of the various letters and finally to the letters themselves this paper was posted up in a part of the room accessible to all  the writingbooks were made of three sheets of foolscap paper folded into a convenient size which was to be ruled by each pupil for it was thought important that each one should learn this art every pupil in school then being furnished with one of these writing books was required to commence this series and to practice each lesson until he could write it well then and not till then he was permitted to pass to the next a few brief directions were given under each lesson on the large sheet for example under the line of straight marks which constituted the first lesson was written as follows       straight equidistant parallel smooth well terminated  these directions were to call the attention of the pupil to the excellences which he must aim at and when he supposed he had secured them his book was to be presented to the teacher for examination if approved the word passed or afterwards simply p was written under the line and he could then proceed to the next lesson other requisites were necessary besides the correct formation of the letters to enable one to pass for example the page must not be soiled or blotted no paper must be wasted and in no case a leaf torn out as soon as one line was written in the manner required the scholar was allowed to pass in a majority of cases however not less than a page would be practised and in many instances a sheet would be covered before one line could be produced which would be approved  one peculiar excellency of this method was that although the whole school were working under a regular and systematic plan individuals could go on independently that is the progress of no scholar was retarded by that of his companion the one more advanced might easily pass the earlier lessons in few days while the others would require weeks of practice to acquire the same degree of skill  during the writing hour the scholars would practice each at the lesson where he left off before and at a particular time each day the books were brought from the regular place of deposit and laid before the teacher for examination without some arrangement for an examination of all the books together the teacher would be liable to interruption at any time from individual questions and requests which would consume much time and benefit only a few  when a page of writing could not pass a brief remark calling the attention of the pupil to the faults which prevented it was sometimes made in pencil at the bottom of the page in other cases the fault was of such a character as to require full and minute oral directions to the pupil at last to facilitate the criticism of the writing a set of arbitrary marks indicative of the various faults was devised and applied as occasion might require to the writing books by means of red ink  these marks which were very simple in their character were easily remembered for there was generally some connexion between the sign and the thing signified for example the mark denoting that letters were too short was simply lengthening them in red ink a faulty curve was denoted by making a new curve over the old one c the following are the principal criticisms and directions for which marks were contrived       strokes rough      curve wrong      bad termination      too slanting and the reverse      too broad and the reverse      not parallel      form of the letter bad      large stroke made too fine and the reverse      too tall or too short      stems not straight      careless work      paper wasted      almost well enough to pass      bring your book to the teacher      former fault not corrected  a catalogue of these marks with an explanation was made out and placed where it was accessible to all and by means of them the books could be very easily and rapidly but thoroughly criticised  after the plan had gone on for some time and its operation was fully understood the teacher gave up the business of examining the books into the hands of a committee appointed by him from among the older and more advanced pupils that the committee might be unbiased in their judgment they were required to examine and decide upon the books without knowing the names of the writers each scholar was indeed required to place her name on the right hand upper corner of every page of her writingbook for the convenience of the distributors but this corner was turned down when the book was brought in that it might not be seen by the committee  this committee were entrusted with plenary powers and there was no appeal from their decision in case they exercised their authority in an improper way or failed on any account to give satisfaction they were liable to impeachment but while they continued in office they were to be strictly obeyed  this plan went on successfully for three months and with very little diminution of interest the whole school went regularly through the lessons in coarse hand and afterwards through a similar series in fine hand and improvement in this branch was thought to be greater than at any former period in the same length of time  the same principle of arranging the several steps of an art or a study into a series of lessons and requiring the pupil to pass regularly from one to the other might easily be applied to other studies and would afford a pleasant variety   12 the correspondence a master of a district school was walking through the room with a large rule in his hands and as he came up behind two small boys he observed that they were playing with some papers he struck them once or twice though not very severely on the head with the rule which he had in his hand tears started from the eyes of one they were called forth by a mingled feeling of grief mortification and pain the other who was of sterner stuff looked steadily into the masters face and when his back was turned shook his fist at him and laughed in defiance  another teacher seeing a similar case did nothing the boys when they saw him hastily gathered up their playthings and put them away an hour or two after a little boy who sat near the master brought them a note addressed to them both they opened it and read as follows       to edward and john       i observed when i passed you today from your concerned looks      and your hurried manner of putting something into your desk that      you were doing something that you knew was wrong when you attempt      to do any thing whatever which conscience tells you is wrong you      only make yourself uneasy and anxious while you do it and then you      are forced to resort to concealment and deception when you see me      coming you would be a great deal happier if you would always be      doing your duty and then you would never be afraid                                    your affectionate teacher    as the teacher was arranging his papers in his desk at the close of school he found a small piece of paper neatly folded up in the form of a note and addressed to him he read as follows       dear teacher       we are very much obliged to you for writing us a note we were      making a paper box we know it was wrong and are determined not to      do so any more we hope you will forgive us                                          your pupils                                                      edward                                                      john  which of these teachers understood human nature best   13 weekly reports the plan described by the following article which was furnished by a teacher for insertion here was originally adopted so far as i know in a school on the kennebec i have adopted it with great advantage                                       c a teacher had one day been speaking to her scholars of certain cases of slight disorder in the school which she remarked had been gradually creeping in and which she thought it devolved upon the scholars by systematic efforts to repress she enumerated instances of disorder in the arrangement of the rooms leaving the benches out of their places throwing waste papers upon the floor having the desk in disorder inside spilling water upon the entry floor disorderly deportment such as too loud talking or laughing in recess or in the intermission at noon or when coming to school and making unnecessary noise in going to or returning from recitations  i have a plan to propose said the teacher which i think may be the pleasantest way of promoting a reform in things of this kind it is this let several of your number be chosen a committee to prepare statedlyperhaps as often as once a weeka written report of the state of the school the report might be read before the school at the close of each week the committee might consist in the whole of seven or eight or even of eleven or twelve individuals who should take the whole business into their hands this committee might appoint individuals of their number to write in turn each week by this arrangement it would not be known to the school generally who are the writers of any particular report if the individuals wish to be anonymous two individuals might be appointed at the beginning of the week who should feel it their business to observe particularly the course of things from day to day with reference to the report individuals not members of the committee can render assistance by any suggestions they may present to this committee these should however generally be made in writing  subjects for such a report will be found to suggest themselves very abundantly though you may not perhaps think so at first the committee may be empowered not only to state the particulars in which things are going wrong but the methods by which they may be made right let them present us with any suggestions they please if we do not like them we are not obliged to adopt them for instance it is generally the case whenever a recitation is attended in the corner yonder that an end of one of the benches is put against the door so as to occasion a serious interruption to the exercises when a person wishes to come in or go out it would come within the province of the committee to attend to such a case as this that is to bring it up in the report the remedy in such a case is a very simple one suppose however that instead of the simple remedy our committee should propose that the classes reciting in the said corner should be dissolved and the studies abolished we should know the proposal was an absurd one but then it would do no hurtwe should have only to reject it  again besides our faults let our committee notice the respects in which we are doing particularly well that we may be encouraged to go on doing well or even to do better if they think for example that we are deserving of credit for the neatness with which books are keptfor their freedom from blots or scribblings or dogsears by which schoolbooks are so commonly defaced let them tell us so and the same of any other excellence  with the plan as thus presented the scholars were very much pleased it was proposed by one individual that such a committee should be appointed immediately and a report prepared for the ensuing week this was done the committee were chosen by ballot the following may be taken as a specimen of their reports       weekly report       the committee appointed to write the weekly report have noticed      several things which they think wrong in the first place there      have been a greater number of tardy scholars during the past week      than usual much of this tardiness we suppose is owing to the      interest felt in building the bower but we think this business      ought to be attended to only in play hours if only one or two come      in late when we are reading in the morning or after we have      composed ourselves to study at the close of the recess every      scholar must look up from her bookwe do not say they ought to do      so but only that they will do so however we anticipate an      improvement in this respect as we know a word to the wise is      sufficient       in the two back rows we are sorry to say that we have noticed      whispering we know that this fact will very much distress our      teacher as she expects assistance and not trouble from our older      scholars it is not our business to reprove any ones misconduct      but it is our duty to mention it however disagreeable it may be      we think the younger scholars during the past week have much      improved in this respect only three cases of whispering among them      have occurred to our knowledge       we remember some remarks made a few weeks ago by our teacher on      the practice of prompting each other in the classes we wish she      would repeat them for we fear that by some they are forgotten in      the class in geography particularly in the questions on the map      we have noticed sly whispers which we suppose were the hints of      some kind friend designed to refresh the memory of her less      attentive companion we propose that the following question be now      put to vote shall the practice of prompting in the classes be any      longer continued       we would propose that we have a composition exercise this week      similar to the one on thursday last it was very interesting and      we think all would be willing to try their thinking powers once      more we would propose also that the readers of the compositions      should sit near the centre of the room as last week many fine      sentences escaped the ears of those seated in the remote corners       we were requested by a very publicspirited individual to mention      once more the want of three nails for bonnets in the entry also      to say that the air from the broken pane of glass on the east side      of the room is very unpleasant to these who sit near       proposed that the girls who exhibited so much taste and ingenuity      in the arrangement of the festoons of evergreen and tumblers of      flowers around the teachers desk be now requested to remove the      faded roses and drooping violets we have gazed on these sad      emblems long enough       finally proposed that greater care be taken by those who stay at      noon to place their dinner baskets in proper places the contents      of more than one were partly strewed upon the entry floor this      morning  if such a measure as this is adopted it should not be continued uninterrupted for a very long time every thing of this sort should be occasionally changed or it sooner or later becomes only a form   14 the shopping exercise c i have often when going a shopping found difficulty and trouble in making change i could never calculate very readily and in the hurry and perplexity of the moment i was always making mistakes i have heard others often make the same complaint and i resolved to try the experiment of regularly teaching children to make change i had a bright little class in arithmetic who were always ready to engage with interest in any thing new and to them i proposed my plan it was to be called the shopping exercise i first requested each individual to write something upon her slate which she would like to buy if she was going a shopping stating the quantity she wished and the price of it to make the first lesson as simple as possible i requested no one to go above ten either in the quantity or price when all were ready i called upon some one to read what she had written her next neighbor was then requested to tell us how much the purchase would amount to then the first one named a bill which she supposed to be offered in payment and the second showed what change was needed a short specimen of the exercise will probably make it clearer than mere description  mary   eight ounces of candy at seven cents susan  fiftysix cents mary   one dollar susan  fortyfour cents  susan  nine yards of lace at eight cents anna   seventytwo cents susan  two dollars anna   one dollar and twentyeight cents  anna   three pieces of tape at five cents jane   fifteen cents anna   three dollars jane   eightyfive cents several voices   wrong jane   two dollars and eightyfive cents  jane   six pictures at eight cents sarah  fortytwo cents several voices   wrong sarah  fortyeight cents jane   one dollar sarah  sixtytwo cents several voices   wrong sarah  fiftytwo cents  it will be perceived that the same individual who names the article and the price names also the bill which she would give in payment and the one who sits next her who calculated the amount calculated also the change to be returned she then proposed her example to the one next in the line with whom the same course was pursued and thus it passed down the class  the exercise went on for some time in this way till the pupils had become so familiar with it that i thought it best to allow them to take higher numbers they were always interested in it and made great improvement in a short time and i myself derived great advantage from listening to them  there is one more circumstance i will add which may contribute to the interest of this account while the class were confined in what they purchased to the number ten they were sometimes inclined to turn the exercise into a frolic the variety of articles which they could find costing less than ten cents was so small that for the sake of getting something new they would propose examples really ludicrous such as these three meetinghouses at two cents four pianos at nine cents but i soon found that if i allowed this at all then attention was diverted from the main object and occupied in seeking the most diverting and curious examples   15 artifices in recitations c the teacher of a small newly established school had all of his scholars classed together in some of their studies at recitations he usually sat in the middle of the room while the scholars occupied the usual places at their desks which were arranged around the sides in the recitation in rhetoric the teacher after a time observed that one or two of the class seldom answered appropriately the questions which came to them but yet were always ready with some kind of answergenerally an exact quotation of the words of the book upon noticing these individuals more particularly he was convinced that their books were open before them in some concealed situation another practice not uncommon in the class was that of prompting each other either by whispers or writing the teacher took no notice publicly of these practices for some time until at the close of an uncommonly good recitation he remarked well i think we have had a fine recitation today it is one of the pleasantest things i ever do to hear a lesson that is learned as well as this do you think it would be possible for us to have as good an exercise every day yes sir answered several faintly do you think it would be reasonable for me to expect of every member of the class that she should always be able to recite all her lessons without ever missing a single question no sir answered all i do not expect it said the teacher all i wish is that each of you should be faithful in your efforts to prepare your lessons i wish you to study from a sense of duty and for the sake of your own improvement you know i do not punish you for failures i have no going up or down no system of marking your only reward when you have made faithful preparation for a recitation is the feeling of satisfaction which you will always experience and when you have been negligent your only punishment is a sort of uneasy feeling of selfreproach i do not expect you all to be invariably prepared with every question of your lessons sometimes you will be unavoidably prevented from studying them and at other times when you have studied them very carefully you may have forgotten or you may fail from some misapprehension of the meaning in some cases do not in such a case feel troubled because you may not have appeared as well as some individual who has not been half as faithful as yourself if you have done your duty that is enough on the other hand you ought to feel no better satisfied with yourselves when your lesson has not been studied well because you may have happened to know the parts which came to you have i done well should always be the question not have i managed to appear well  i will say a word here continued the teacher upon a practice which i have known to be very common in some schools and which i have been sorry to notice occasionally in this i mean that of prompting or helping each other along in some way at recitations now where a severe punishment is the consequence of a failure there might seem to be some reasonableness in helping your companions out of difficulty though even then such tricks are departures from honorable dealing but especially when there is no purpose to be served but that of appearing to know more than you do it certainly must be considered a very mean kind of artifice i think i have sometimes observed an individual to be prompted where evidently the assistance was not desired and even where it was not needed to whisper to an individual the answer to a question is sometimes to pay her rather a poor compliment at least for it is the same as saying i am a better scholar than you are let me help you along a little  let us then hereafter have only fair open honest dealings with each other no attempts to appear to advantage by little artful manoeuveringno promptingno peeping into books be faithful and conscientious and then banish anxiety for your success do you not think you shall find this the pleasantest courseyes sir answered every scholar are you willing to pledge yourselves to adopt it yes sir those who are may raise their hands said the teacher every hand was raised and the pledge there was evidence to believe was honorably sustained   16 keeping resolutions the following are notes of a familiar lecture on this subject given by a teacher at some general exercise in the school the practice of thus reducing to writing what the teacher may say on such subjects will be attended with excellent effects       this is a subject upon which young persons find much difficulty      the question is asked a thousand times how shall i ever learn to      keep my resolutions perhaps the great cause of your failures is      this you are not sufficiently definite in forming your purposes      you will resolve to do a thing without knowing with certainty      whether it is even possible to do it again you make resolutions      which are to run on indefinitely so that of course they can never      be fully kept for instance one of you will resolve to rise      earlier in the morning you fix upon no definite hour on any      definite number of mornings only you are going to rise      earlier morning comes and finds you sleepy and disinclined to      rise you remember your resolution of rising earlier but then it      is very early you say you resolved to rise earlier but you      didnt resolve to rise just then and this it may be is the last      of your resolution or perhaps you are for a few mornings a      little earlier but then at the end of a week or fortnight you do      not know exactly whether your resolution has been broken or kept      for you had not decided whether to rise earlier for ten days or      for ten years       in the same vague and general manner a person will resolve to be      more studious or more diligent in the case of an individual of      a mature and welldisciplined mind of acquired firmness of      character such a resolution might have effect the individual will      really devote more time and attention to his pursuits but for one      of you to make such a resolution would do no sort of good it      would only be a source of trouble and disquiet you perceive there      is nothing definitenothing fixed about it you have not decided      what amount of additional time or attention to give to your      studies or when you will begin or when you will end there is no      one time when you will feel that you are breaking your resolution      because there were no particular times when you were to study more      you waste one opportunity and another and then with a feeling of      discouragement and selfreproach conclude to abandon your      resolution oh it does no good to make resolutions you say i      never shall keep them       now if you would have the business of making resolutions a      pleasant and interesting instead of a discouraging disquieting      one you must proceed in a different manner be definite and      distinct in your plandecide exactly what you will do and how      you will do itwhen you will begin and when you will end instead      of resolving to rise earlier resolve to rise at the ringing of      the sunrise bells or at some other definite time resolve to try      this as an experiment for one morning or for one week or      fortnight decide positively if you decide at all and then rise      when the time comes sleepy or not sleepy do not stop to repent of      your resolution or to consider the wisdom or folly of it when the      time for acting under it has once arrived       in all cases little and great make this a principleto consider      well before you begin to act but after you have begun to act      never stop to consider resolve as deliberately as you please but      be sure to keep your resolution whether a wise one or an unwise      one after it is once made never allow yourself to reconsider the      question of getting up after the morning has come except it be      for some unforeseen circumstance get up for that time and be more      careful how you make resolutions again   17 topics c the plan of the topic exercise as we called it is this six or seven topics are given out information upon which is to be obtained from any source and communicated verbally before the whole school or sometimes before a class formed for this purpose the next day the subjects are proposed both by teacher and scholars and if approved adopted the exercise is intended to be voluntary but ought to be managed in a way sufficiently interesting to induce all to join  at the commencement of the exercise the teacher calls upon all who have any information in regard to the topic assigned suppose for example it is alabaster to rise perhaps twenty individuals out of forty rise the teacher may perhaps say to those in their seats  do you not know any thing of this subject have you neither seen nor heard of alabaster and had no means of ascertaining any thing in regard to it if you have you ought to rise it is not necessary that you should state a fact altogether new and unheard of but if you tell me its color or some of the uses to which it is applied you will be complying with my request  after these remarks perhaps a few more rise and possibly the whole school individuals are then called upon at random each to state only one particular in regard to the topic in question this arrangement is made so as to give all an opportunity to speak if any scholar after having mentioned one fact has something still farther to communicate she remains standing till called upon again as soon as an individual has exhausted her stock of information or if the facts that she intended to mention are stated by another she takes her seat  the topics at first most usually selected are the common objects by which we are surrounded for example glass iron mahogany c the list will gradually extend itself until it will embrace a large number of subjects  the object of this exercise is to induce pupils to seek for general information in an easy and pleasant manner as by the perusal of books newspapers periodicals and conversation with friends it induces care and attention in reading and discrimination in selecting the most useful and important facts from the mass of information as individuals are called upon also to express their ideas verbally they soon acquire by practice the power of expressing their ideas with clearness and force and communicating with ease and confidence the knowledge they possess   18 music c the girls of our school often amused themselves in recess by collecting into little groups for singing as there seemed to be a sufficient power of voice and a respectable number who were willing to join in the performance it was proposed one day that singing should be introduced as a part of the devotional exercises of the school  the first attempt nearly resulted in a failure only a few trembling voices succeeded in singing old hundred to the words be thou c on the second day peterborough was sung with much greater confidence on the part of the increased number of singers the experiment was tried with greater and greater success for several days when the teacher proposed that a systematic plan should be formed by which there night be singing regularly at the close of school it was then proposed that a number of singing books be obtained and one of the scholars who was well acquainted with common tunes be appointed as chorister her duty should be to decide what particular tune may be sung each day inform the teacher of the metre of the hymn and take the lead in the exercise this plan being approved of by the scholars was adopted and put into immediate execution several brought copies of the sabbath school hymn book which they had in their possession and the plan succeeded beyond all expectation the greatest difficulty in the way was to get some one to lead the chorister however was somewhat relieved from the embarrassment which she would naturally feel in making a beginning by the appointment of one or two individuals with herself who were to act as her assistants these constituted the leading committee or as it was afterwards termed singing committee  singing now became a regular and interesting exercise of the school and the committee succeeded in managing the business themselves   19 tabu c an article was one day read in a school relating to the tabu of the sandwich islanders tabu is a term with them which signifies consecratednot to be touchedto be let alonenot to be violated thus according to their religious observances a certain day will be proclaimed tabu that is one upon which there is to be no work or no going out  a few days after this article was read the scholars observed one morning a flower stuck up in a conspicuous place against the wall with the word tabu in large characters above it this excited considerable curiosity the teacher informed them in explanation that the flower was a very rare and beautiful specimen brought by one of the scholars which he wished all to examine you would naturally feel a disposition to examine it by the touch said he but you will all see that by the time it was touched by sixty individuals it would be likely to be injured if not destroyed so i concluded to label it tabu and it has occurred to me that this will be a convenient mode of apprising you generally that any article had better not be handled you know we sometimes have some apparatus exposed which would be liable to injury from disturbance where there are so many persons to touch it i shall in such a case just mention that an article is tabu and you will understand that it is not only not to be injured but not even touched  a little delicate management of this sort will often have more influence over young persons than the most vehement scolding or the most watchful and jealous precautions the tabu was always most scrupulously regarded after this whenever employed   20 mental analysis scene a class in arithmetic at recitation the teacher gives them an example in addition requesting them when they have performed it to rise some finish it very soon others are very slow in accomplishing the work  i should like to ascertain says the teacher how great is the difference of rapidity with which different members of the class work in addition i will give you another example and then notice by my watch the shortest and longest time required to do it  the result of the experiment was that some members of the class were two or three times as long in doing it as others  perhaps you think said the teacher that this difference is altogether owing to difference of skill but it is not it is mainly owing to the different methods adopted by various individuals i am going to describe some of these and as i describe them i wish you would notice them carefully and tell me which you practice  there are then three modes of adding up a column of figures which i shall describe  1 i shall call the first counting you take the first figure and then add the next to it by counting up regularly there are three distinct ways of doing this  a counting by your fingers yes sir you take the first figuresuppose it is seven and the one above it eight now you recollect that to add eight you must count all the fingers of one hand and all but two again so you say seveneight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen  yes sir yes sir said the scholars  b the next mode of counting is to do it mentally without using your fingers at all but as it is necessary for you to have some plan to secure your adding the right number you divide the units into sets of two each thus you remember that eight consists of four twos and you accordingly say when adding eight to seven seveneight nineten eleventwelve thirteen c  c the third mode is to add by three in the same way you recollect that eight consists of two threes and a two so you say seveneight nine teneleven twelve thirteenfourteen fifteen  the teacher here stops to ascertain how many of the class are accustomed to add in either of these modes it is a majority  2 the next general method is calculating that is you do not unite one number to another by the dull and tedious method of applying the units one by one as in the ways described under the preceding head but you come to a result more rapidly by some mode of calculating these modes are several  a doubling a number and then adding or subtracting as the case may require for instance in the example already specified in order to add seven and eight you say twice seven are fourteen and one are fifteen yes sir yes sir or twice eight are sixteen and taking one off leaves fifteen yes sir  b another way of calculating is to skip about the column adding those numbers which you can do most easily and then bringing in the rest as you best can thus if you see three eights in one column you say three times eight are twentyfour and then you try to bring in the other numbers often in such cases you forget what you have added and what you have not and get confused yes sir or you omit something in your work and consequently it is incorrect  c if nines occur you sometimes add ten and then take off one for it is very easy to add ten  d another method of calculating which is however not very common is this to take our old case adding eight to seven you take as much from the eight to add to the seven as will be sufficient to make ten and then it will be easy to add the rest thus you think in a minute that three from the eight will make the seven a ten and then there will be five more to add which will make fifteen if the next number was seven you would say five of it will make twenty and then there will be two left which will make twentytwo this mode though it may seem more intricate than any of the others is in fact more rapid than any of them when one is little accustomed to it  these are the four principal modes of calculating which occur to me pupils do not generally practice any one of them exclusively but occasionally resort to each according to the circumstances of the particular case  the teacher here stopped to inquire how many of the class were accustomed to add by calculating in either of these ways or in any simpler ways  3 there is one more mode which i shall describe it is by memory before i explain this mode i wish to ask you some questions which i should like to have you answer as quick as you can  how much is four times fivefour and five  how much is seven times nineseven and nine  eight times sixeight and six  nine times sevennine and seven  after asking a few questions of this kind it was perceived that the pupils could tell much more readily what was the result when the numbers were to be multiplied then when they were to be added  the reason is said the teacher because you committed the multiplication table to memory and have not committed the addition table now many persons have committed the addition table so that it is perfectly familiar to them and when they see any two numbers the amount which is produced when they are added together comes to mind in an instant adding in this way is the last of the three modes i was to describe  now of these three methods the last is undoubtedly the best if you once commit the addition table thoroughly you have it fixed for life whereas if you do not you have to make the calculation over again every time and thus lose a vast amount of labor i have no doubt that there are some in this class who are in the habit of counting who have ascertained that seven and eight for instance make fifteen by counting up from seven to fifteen hundreds of times now how much better it would be to spend a little time in fixing the fact in the mind once for all and then when you come to the case seven and eight aresay at once fifteeninstead of mumbling over and over again hundreds of times seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen  the reason then that some of the class add so slowly is not probably because they want skill and rapidity of execution but became they work to a great disadvantage by working in the wrong way i have often been surprised at the dexterity and speed with which some scholars can count with their fingers when adding and yet they could not get through the sum very quickat least they would have done it in half the time if the same effort had been made in travelling on a shorter road we will therefore study the addition table now in the class before we go on any farther                                       the foregoing narratives it is hoped may induce some of the readers of this book to keep journals of their own experiments and of the incidents which may from time to time come under their notice illustrating the principles of education or simply the characteristics and tendencies of the youthful mind the business of teaching will excite interest and afford pleasure just in proportion to the degree in which it is conducted by operations of mind upon mind and the means of making it most fully so are careful practice based upon and regulated by the results of careful observation every teacher then should make observations and experiments upon mind a part of his daily duty and nothing will more facilitate this than keeping a record of results there can be no opportunity for studying human nature more favorable than the teacher enjoys the materials are all before him his very business from day to day brings him to act directly upon them and the study of the powers and tendencies of the human mind is not only the most interesting and the noblest that can engage human attention but every step of progress he makes in it imparts an interest and charm to what would otherwise be a weary toil it at once relieves his labors while it doubles their efficiency and success     chapter ix  the teachers first day   the teacher enters upon the duties of his office by a much more sudden transition than is common in the other avocations and employments of life in ordinary cases business comes at first by slow degrees and the beginner is introduced to the labors and responsibilities of his employment in a very gradual manner the young teacher however enters by a single step into the very midst of his labors having perhaps never even heard a class recite before he takes a short walk some winter morning and suddenly finds himself instated at the deskhis fifty scholars all around looking him in the face all waiting to be employed everything comes upon him at once he can do nothing until the day and the hour for opening the school arrivesthen he has everything to do  under these circumstances it is not surprising that the young teacher should look forward with unusual solicitude to his first day in school and he desires ordinarily special instructions in respect to this occasion some such special instructions we propose to give in this chapter the experienced teacher may think some of them too minute and trivial but he must remember that they are intended for the youngest beginner in the humblest school and if he recalls to mind his own feverish solicitude on the morning when he went to take his first command in the district school he will pardon the seeming minuteness of detail  1 it will be well for the young teacher to take opportunity between the time of his engaging his school and that of his commencing itto acquire as much information in respect to it beforehand as possibleso as to be somewhat acquainted with the scene of his labors before entering upon it ascertain the names and the characters of the principal families in the district their ideas and wishes in respect to the government of the school the kind of management adopted by one or two of the last teachers the difficulties they fell into the nature of the complaints made against them if any and the families with whom difficulty has usually arisen this information must of course be obtained in private conversation a good deal of it must be from its very nature highly confidential but it is very important that the teacher should be possessed of it he will necessarily become possessed of it by degrees in the course of his administration when however it may be too late to be of any service to him but by judicious and proper efforts to acquire it beforehand he will enter upon the discharge of his duties with great advantage it is like a navigators becoming acquainted beforehand with the nature and the dangers of the sea over which he is about to sail  such inquiries as these will in ordinary cases bring to the teachers knowledge in most districts in our country some cases of peculiarly troublesome scholars or unreasonable and complaining parentsand stories of their unjustifiable conduct on former occasions will come to him exaggerated by the jealousy of rival neighbours there is danger that his resentment may be roused a little and that his mind will assume a hostile attitude at once towards such individuals so that he will enter upon his work rather with a desire to seek a collision with them or at least with secret feelings of defiance towards themfeelings which will lead to that kind of unbending perpendicularity in his demeanour towards them which will almost inevitably lead to a collision now this is wrong there is indeed a point where firm resistance to unreasonable demands becomes a duty but as a general principle it is most unquestionably true that it is the teachers duty to accommodate himself to the character and expectations of his employers not to face and brave them those italicized words may be understood to mean something which would be entirely wrong but in the sense in which i mean to use them there can be no question that they indicate the proper path for one employed by others to do work for them in all cases to pursue if therefore the teacher finds by his inquiries into the state of his district that there are some peculiar difficulties and dangers there let him not cherish a disposition to face and resist them but to avoid them let him go with an intention to soothe rather than to irritate feelings which have been wounded beforeto comply with the wishes of all so far as he can even if they are not entirely reasonableand while he endeavours to elevate the standard and correct the opinions prevailing among his employers by any means in his power to aim at doing it gently and in a tone and manner suitable to the relation he sustainsin a word let him skilfully avoid the dangers of his navigation not obstinately run his ship against a rock on purpose on the ground that the rock has no business to be there  this is the spirit then with which these preliminary inquiries in regard to the patrons of the school ought to be made we come now to a second point  2 it will assist the young teacher very much in his first days labors if he takes measures for seeing and conversing with some of the older or more intelligent scholars on the day or evening before he begins his school with a view of obtaining from them some acquaintance with the internal arrangements and customs of the school the object of this is to obtain the same kind of information with respect to the interior of the school that was recommended in respect to the district under the former head he may call upon a few families especially those which furnish a large number of scholars for the school and make as many minute inquiries of them as he can respecting all the interior arrangements to which they have been accustomed what reading books and other text books have been usedwhat are the principal classes in all the several departments of instructionand what is the system of discipline and of rewards and punishments to which the school has been accustomed  if in such conversations the teacher should find a few intelligent and communicative scholars he might learn a great deal about the past habits and condition of the school which would be of great service to him not by any means that he will adopt and continue these methods as a matter of coursebut only that a knowledge of them will render him very important aid in marking out his own course the more minute and full the information of this sort is which he thus obtains the better if practicable it would be well to make out a catalogue of all the principal classes with the names of those individuals belonging to them who will probably attend the new school and the order in which they were usually called upon to read or recite the conversation which would be necessary to accomplish this would of itself be of great service it would bring the teacher into an acquaintance with several important families and groups of children under the most favorable circumstances the parents would see and be pleased with the kind of interest they would see the teacher taking in his new duties the children would be pleased to be able to render their new instructer some service and would go to the schoolroom on the next morning with a feeling of acquaintance with him and a predisposition to be pleased and if by chance any family should be thus called upon that had heretofore been captious or complaining or disposed to be jealous of the higher importance or influence of other familiesthat spirit would be entirely softened and subdued by such an interview with their new instructer at their own fireside on the evening preceding the commencement of his labors the great object however which the teacher would have in view in such inquiries should be the value of the information itself as to the use which he will make of it we shall speak hereafter  3 it is desirable that the young teacher should meet his scholars first in an unofficial capacity for this purpose repair to the schoolroom on the first day at an early hour so as to see and become acquainted with the scholars as they come in one by one the intercourse between teacher and pupil should be like that between parents and children where the utmost freedom is united with the most perfect respect the father who is most firm and decisive in his family government can mingle most freely in the conversation and sports of his children without any derogation of his authority or diminution of the respect they owe young teachers however are prone to forget this and to imagine that they must assume an appearance of stern authority always when in the presence of their scholars if they wish to be respected or obeyed this they call keeping up their dignity accordingly they wait on the morning of their induction into office until their new subjects are all assembled and then walk in with an air of the highest dignity and with the step of a king and sometimes a formidable instrument of discipline is carried in the hand to heighten the impression now there is no question that it is of great importance that scholars should have a high idea of the teachers firmness and inflexible decision in maintaining his authority and repressing all disorder of every kind but this impression should be created by their seeing how he acts in the various emergencies which will spontaneously occur and not by assumed airs of importance or dignity feigned for effect in other words their respect for him should be based on real traits of character as they see them brought out into natural action and not on appearances assumed for the occasion  it seems to me therefore that it is best for the teacher first to meet his scholars with the air and tone of free and familiar intercourse and he will find his opportunity more favorable for doing this if he goes early on the first morning of his labors and converses freely with those whom he finds there and with others as they come in he may take an interest with them in all the little arrangements connected with the opening of the school the building of the fire the paths through the snow the arrangements of seats calling upon them for information or aid asking their names and in a word entering fully and freely into conversation with them just as a parent under similar circumstances would do with his children all the children thus addressed will be pleased with the gentleness and affability of the teacher even a rough and illnatured boy who has perhaps come to the school with the express determination of attempting to make mischief will be completely disarmed by being asked pleasantly to help the teacher fix the fire or alter the position of his desk thus by means of the half hour during which the scholars are coming together and of the visits made in the preceding evening as described under the last head the teacher will find when he calls upon the children to take their seats that he has made a very large number of them his personal friends many of these will have communicated their first impressions to the others so that he will find himself possessed at the outset of that which is of vital consequence in the opening of any administrationa strong party in his favor  4 the time for calling the school to order and commencing exercises of some sort will at length arrive though if the work of making personal acquaintances is going on pleasantly it may perhaps be delayed a little beyond the usual hour when however the time arrives we would strongly recommend that the first service by which the regular duties of the school are commenced should be an act of religious worship there are many reasons why the exercises of the school should every day be thus commenced and there are special reasons for it on the first day  there are very few districts where parents would have any objection to this they might indeed in some cases if the subject were to be brought up formally before them as a matter of doubt anticipate some difficulties or create imaginary ones growing out of the supposed sensitiveness of contending sects but if the teacher were of his own accord to commence the plain faithful and honest discharge of this duty as a matter of course very few would think of making any objection to it and almost all would be satisfied and pleased with its actual operation if however the teacher should in any case have reason to believe that such a practice would be contrary to the wishes of his employers it would according to views we have presented in another chapter be wrong for him to attempt to introduce it he might if he should see fit make such an objection a reason for declining to take the school but he ought not if he takes it to act counter to the known wishes of his employers in so important a point but if on the other hand no such objections are made known to him he need not raise the question himself at all but take it for granted that in a christian land there will be no objection to imploring the divine protection and blessing at the opening of a daily school  if this practice is adopted it will have a most powerful influence upon the moral condition of the school it must be so though many will be inattentive and many utterly unconcernedyet it is not possible to bring children even in form into the presence of god every day and to utter in their hearing the petitions which they ought to present without bringing a powerful element of moral influence to bear upon their hearts the good will be made betterthe conscientious more conscientious stilland the rude and savage will be subdued and softened by the daily attempt to lead them to the throne of their creator to secure this effect the devotional service must be an honest one there must be nothing feigned or hypocritical no hackneyed phrases used without meaning or intonations of assumed solemnity it must be honest heartfelt simple prayer the plain and direct expression of such sentiments as children ought to feel and of such petitions as they ought to offer we shall speak presently of the mode of avoiding some abuses to which this exercise is liable but if these sources of abuse are avoided and the duty is performed in that plain simple direct and honest manner in which it certainly will be if it springs from the heart it must have a great influence on the moral progress of the children and in fact in all respects on the prosperity of the school  but then independently of the advantages which may be expected to result from the practice of daily prayer in schoolit would seem to be the imperious duty of the teacher to adopt it so many human minds committed thus to the guidance of oneat a period when the character receives so easily and so permanently its shape and directionand in a world of probation like this is an occasion which seems to demand the open recognition of the hand of god on the part of any individual to whom such a trust is committed the duty springs so directly out of the attitude in which the teacher and pupil stand in respect to each other and the relation they together bear to the supreme that it would seem impossible for any one to hesitate to admit the duty without denying altogether the existence of a god  how vast the responsibility of giving form and character to the human soul how mighty the influence of which the unformed minds of a group of children are susceptible how much their daily teacher must inevitably exert upon them if we admit the existence of god at all and that he exerts any agency whatever in the moral world which he has produced here seems to be one of the strongest cases in which his intervention should be sought and then when we reflect upon the influence which would be exerted upon the future religious character of this nation by having the millions of children training up in the schools accustomed through all the years of early life to being brought daily into the presence of the supreme with thanksgiving confession and prayer it can hardly seem possible that the teacher who wishes to be faithful in his duties should hesitate in regard to this some teacher may perhaps say that he cannot perform it because he is not a religious manhe makes no pretensions to piety but this can surely be no reason he ought to be a religious man and his first prayer offered in school may be the first act by which he becomes so entering the service of jehovah is a work which requires no preliminary steps it is to be done at once by sincere confession and an honest prayer for forgiveness for the past and strength for time to come a daily religious service in school may be therefore the outward act by which he who has long lived without god may return to his duty  if from such considerations the teacher purposes to have a daily religious service in his school he should by all means begin on the first dayand when he first calls his school to order he should mention to his pupils the great and obvious duty of imploring gods guidance and blessing in all their ways and then read a short portion of scripture with an occasional word or two of simple explanation and offer himself a short and simple prayer in some cases teachers are disposed to postpone this duty a day or two from timidity or other causes hoping that after becoming acquainted a little with the school and having completed their more important arrangements they shall find it easier to begin but this is a sad mistake the longer it is postponed the more difficult and trying it will be and then the moral impressions will be altogether more strong and salutary if an act of solemn religious worship is made the first opening act of the school  where the teacher has not sufficient confidence that the general sense of propriety among his pupils will preserve good order and decorum during the exercise it may be better for him to read a prayer selected from books of devotion or prepared by himself expressly for the occasion by this plan his school will be during the exercise under his own observation as at other times it may in some schools where the number is small or the prevailing habits of seriousness and order are good be well to allow the older scholars to read the prayer in rotation taking especial care that it does not degenerate into a mere reading exercise but that it is understood both by readers and hearers to be a solemn act of religious worship in a word if the teacher is really honest and sincere in his wish to lead his pupils to the worship of god he will find no serious difficulty in preventing the abuses and avoiding the dangers which some might fear and in accomplishing vast good both in promoting the prosperity of the school and in the formation of the highest and best traits a individual character  we have dwelt perhaps longer on this subject than we ought to have done in this place but its importance when viewed in its bearings on the thousands of children daily assembling in our district schools must be our apology the embarrassments and difficulties arising from the extreme sensitiveness which exists among the various denominations of christians in our land threaten to interfere very seriously with giving a proper degree of religious instruction to the mass of the youthful population but we must not because we have no national church cease to have a national religion all our institutions ought to be so administered as openly to recognise the hand of god and to seek his protection and blessing and in regard to none is it more imperiously necessary than in respect to our common schools  5 after the school is thus opened the teacher will find himself brought to the great difficulty which embarrasses the beginning of his labors i e how to find immediate employment at once for the thirty or forty children who all look up to him waiting for their orders i say thirty or forty for the young teachers first school will usually be a small one his object i think should be in all ordinary cases for the first few days twofold first to revive and restore in the main the general routine of classes and exercises pursued by his predecessor in the same school and secondly while doing this to become as fully acquainted with his scholars as possible  it is best then ordinarily for the teacher to begin the school as his predecessor closed it and make the transition to his own perhaps more improved method a gradual one in some cases a different course is wise undoubtedlyas for example where a teacher is commencing a private school on a previously welldigested plan of his ownor where one who has had experience and has confidence in his power to bring his new pupils promptly and at once into the system of classification and instruction which he prefers it is difficult however to do this and requires a good deal of address and decision it is far easier and safer and in almost all cases better in every respect for a young teacher to revive and restore the former arrangements in the main and take his departure from them he may afterwards make changes as he may find them necessary or desirable and even bring the school soon into a very different state from that in which he finds it but it will generally be more pleasant for himself and better for the school to avoid the shock of a sudden and entire revolution  the first thing then when the scholars are ready to be employed is to set them at work in classes or upon lessons as they would have been employed had the former teacher continued in charge of the school to illustrate clearly how this may be done we may give the following dialogue  teacher can any one of the boys inform me what was the first lesson that the former master used to hear in the morning  the boys are silent looking to one another  teacher did he hear any recitation immediately after school began  boysfaintly and with hesitation no sir  teacher how long was it before he began to hear lessons  several boys simultaneously about half an hour a little while quarter of an hour  what did he do at this time  mended pens set copies looked over sums and various other answers are perhaps given  the teacher then makes a memorandum of this and then inquires  and what lesson came after this  geography  all the boys in this school who studied geography may rise  a considerable number rise  did you all recite together  no sir  there are two classes then  yes sir yes sir more than two  all who belong to the class that recites first in the morning may remain standing the rest may sit  the boys obey and eight or ten of them remain standing the teacher calls upon one of them to produce his book and assigns them a lesson in regular course he then requests some one of the number to write out in the course of the day a list of the class and to bring it with him to the recitation the next morning  are there any other scholars in the school who think it would be well for them to join this class  in answer to this question probably some new scholars might perhaps rise or some hitherto belonging to other classes who might be of suitable age and qualifications to be transferred if these individuals should appear to be of the proper standing and character they might at once be joined to the class in question and directed to take the same lesson  in the same manner the other classes would pass in review before the teacher and he would obtain a memorandum of the usual order of exercises and in a short time set all his pupils at work preparing for the lessons of the next day he would be much aided in this by the previous knowledge which he would have obtained by private conversation as recommended under a former head some individual cases would require a little special attention such as new scholars small children c but he would be able before a great while to look around him and see his whole school busy with the work he had assigned them and his own time for the rest of the morning in a great degree at his own command  i ought to say however that it is not probable that he would long continue these arrangements unaltered in hearing the different classes he would watch for opportunities for combining them or discontinuing those where the number was smallhe would alter the times of recitation and group individual scholars into classes so as to bring the school in a very short time into a condition corresponding more nearly with his own views all this can be done very easily and pleasantly when the wheels are once in motion for a school is like a ship in one respectmost easily steered in the right direction when under sail  by this plan also the teacher obtains what is almost absolutely necessary at the commencement of his labors time for observation it is of the first importance that he should become acquainted as early as possible with the characters of the boys especially to learn who those are which are most likely to be troublesome there always will be a few who will require special watch and care and generally there will be only a few a great deal depends on finding these individuals out in good season and bringing the pressure of a proper authority to bear upon them soon by the plan i have recommended of not attempting to remodel the school wholly at once the teacher obtains time for noticing the pupils and learning something about their individual characters in fact so important is this that it is the plan of some teachers whenever they commence a new school to let the boys have their own way almost entirely for a few days in order to find out fully who the idle and mischievous are this is perhaps going a little too far but it is certainly desirable to enjoy as many opportunities for observation as can be secured on the first few days of the school  6 make it then a special object of attention during the first day or two to discover who the idle and mischievous individuals are they will have generally seated themselves together in little knots for as they are aware that the new teacher does not know them they will imagine that though perhaps separated before they can now slip together again without any trouble it is best to avoid if possible an open collision with any of them at once in order that they may be the better observed whenever therefore you see idleness or play endeavour to remedy the evil for the time by giving the individual something special to do or by some other measure without however seeming to notice the misconduct continue thus adroitly to stop every thing disorderly while at the same time you notice and remember where the tendencies to disorder exist  by this means the individuals who would cause most of the trouble and difficulty in the discipline of the school will soon betray themselves and those too whose fidelity and good behaviour can be relied upon will also be known the names of the former should be among the first which the teacher learns and their characters should be among the first which he studies the most prominent among them those apparently most likely to make trouble he should note particularly and make inquiries out of school respecting themtheir characterstheir education at home c so as to become acquainted with them as early and as fully as possiblefor he must have this full acquaintance with them before he is prepared to commence any decided course of discipline with them the teacher often does irreparable injury by rash action at the outset he sees for instance a boy secretly eating an apple which he has concealed in his hand and which he bites with his book before his mouth or his head under the lid of his desk it is perhaps the first day of the school and the teacher thinks he had better make an example at the outset and calls the boy out knowing nothing about his general character and inflicts some painful or degrading punishment before all the school a little afterwards as he becomes gradually acquainted with the boy he finds that he is of mild gentle disposition generally obedient and harmless and that his offence was only an act of momentary thoughtlessness arising from some circumstances of peculiar temptation at the time a boy in the next seat perhaps had just before handed him the apple the teacher regrets when too late the hasty punishment he perceives that instead of having the influence of salutary example upon the other boys it must have shocked their sense of justice and excited dislike towards a teacher so quick and severe rather than of fear of doing wrong themselves it would be safer to postpone such decided measures a littleto avoid all open collisions if possible for a few days in such a case as the above the boy might be kindly spoken to in an undertone in such a way as to show both the teachers sense of the impropriety of disorder and also his desire to avoid giving pain to the boy if it then turns out that the individual is ordinarily a welldisposed boy all is right and if he proves to be habitually disobedient and troublesome the lenity and forbearance exercised at first will facilitate the effect aimed at by subsequent measures avoid then for the few first days all open collision with any of your pupils that you may have opportunity for minute and thorough observation  and here the young teacher ought to be cautioned against a fault which beginners are very prone to fall into that of forming unfavorable opinions of some of their pupils from their air and manner before they see any thing in their conduct which ought to be disapproved a boy or girl comes to the desk to ask a question or make a request and the teacher sees in the cast of countenance or in the bearing or tone of the individual something indicating a proud or a sullen or an illhumored disposition and conceives a prejudice often entirely without foundation which weeks perhaps do not wear away every experienced teacher can recollect numerous cases of this sort and he learns after a time to suspend his judgment be cautious therefore on this point and in the survey of your pupils which you make during the first few days of your school trust to nothing but the most sure and unequivocal evidences of character for many of your most docile and faithful pupils will be found among those whose appearance at first prepossessed you strongly against them  one other caution ought also to be given do not judge too severely in respect to the ordinary cases of misconduct in school the young teacher almost invariably does judge too severely while engaged himself in hearing a recitation or looking over a sum he hears a stifled laugh and looking up sees the little offender struggling with the muscles of his countenance to restore their gravity the teacher is vexed at the interruption and severely rebukes or punishes the boywhen after all the offence in a moral point of view was an exceedingly light one at least it might very probably have been so in fact a large proportion of the offences against order committed in school are the mere momentary action of the natural buoyancy and life of childhood this is no reason why they should be indulged or why the order and regularity of the school should be sacrificed but it should prevent their exciting feelings of anger or impatience or very severe reprehension while the teacher should take effectual measures for restraining all such irregularities he should do it with the tone and manner which will show that he understands their true moral character and deals with them not as heinous sins which deserve severe punishment but as serious inconveniences which he is compelled to repress  there are often cases of real moral turpitude in schoolsuch as where there is intentional wilful mischief or disturbance or habitual disobedience and there may even be in some cases open rebellion now the teacher should show that he distinguishes these cases from such momentary acts of thoughtlessness as we have described and a broad distinction ought to be made in the treatment of them in a word thenwhat we have been recommending under this head is that the teacher should make it his special study for his first few days in school to understand the characters of his pupilsto learn who are the thoughtless ones who the mischievous and who the disobedient and rebelliousand to do this with candid moral discrimination and with as little open collision with individuals as possible  8 another point to which the teacher ought to give his early attention is to separate the bad boys as soon as he can from one another the idleness and irregularity of children in school often depends more on accidental circumstances than on character two boys may be individually harmless and well disposed and yet they may be of so mercurial a temperament that together the temptation to continual play will be irresistible another case that more often happens is where one is actively and even intentionally bad and is seated next to an innocent but perhaps thoughtless boy and contrives to keep him always in difficulty now remove the former away where there are no very frail materials for him to act upon and place the latter where he is exposed to no special temptation and all would be well  this is all very obvious and known familiarly to all teachers who have had any experience but beginners are not generally so aware of it at the outset as to make any direct and systematic efforts to examine the school with reference to its condition in this respect it is usual to go on leaving the boys to remain seated as chance or their own inclinations grouped them and to endeavour to keep the peace among the various neighbourhoods by close supervision rebukes and punishment now these difficulties may be very much diminished by looking a little into the arrangement of the boys at the outset and so modifying it as to diminish the amount of temptation to which the individuals are exposed  this should be done however cautiously deliberately and with good naturekeeping the object of it a good deal out of view it must be done cautiously and deliberately for the first appearances are exceedingly fallacious in respect to the characters of the different children you see perhaps some indications of play between two boys upon the same seat and hastily conclude that they are disorderly boys and must be separated something in the air and manner of one or both of them confirms this impression and you take the necessary measures at once you then find when you become more fully acquainted with them that the appearances which you observed were only momentary and accidental and that they would have been as safe together as any two boys in the school and perhaps you will even find that by their new position you have brought one or the other into circumstances of peculiar temptation wait therefore before you make such changes till you have ascertained actual characterdoing this however without any unnecessary delay  in such removals too it is well in many cases to keep the motive and design of them as much as possible out of view for by expressing suspicion of a boy you injure his character in his own opinion and in that of others and tend to make him reckless besides if you remove a boy from a companion whom he likes avowedly to prevent his playing you offer him an inducement if he is a bad boy to continue to play in his new position for the purpose of thwarting you or from the influence of resentment it would be wrong indeed to use any subterfuge or duplicity of any kind to conceal your objectbut you are not bound to explain it and in the many changes which you will be compelled to make in the course of the first week for various purposes you may include many of these without explaining particularly the design or intention of any of them  in some instances however you may frankly state the whole case without danger provided it is done in such a manner as not to make the boy feel that his character is seriously injured in your estimation it must depend upon the tact and judgment of the teacher to determine upon the particular course to be pursued in the several cases though he ought to keep these general principles in view in all  in one instance for example he will see two boys together james and joseph we will call them exhibiting a tendency to play and after inquiring into their characters he will find that they are goodnatured pleasant boys and that he had better be frank with them on the subject he calls one of them to his desk and perhaps the following dialogue ensues  james i am making some changes in the seats and thought of removing you to another place have you any particular preference for that seat  the question is unexpected and james hesitates he wants to sit next to joseph but doubts whether it is quite prudent to avow itso he says slowly and with hesitation  no siri do not know that i have  if you have any reason i wish you would tell me frankly for i want you to have such a seat as will be pleasant to you  james does not know what to say encouraged however by the goodhumored tone and look which the master assumes he says timidly  joseph and i thought we should like to sit togetherif you are willing  ohyou and joseph are particular friends then i suppose  whyyes sir  i am not surprised then that you want to sit togetherthough to tell the truth that is rather a reason why i should separate you  why sir  because i have observed that when two great friends are seated together they are always more apt to whisper and playhave not you observed it  whyyes sir  you may go and ask joseph to come here  when the two boys make their appearance again the teacher continues  joseph james tells me that you and he want to sit together and says you are particular friends but i tell him he adds smiling that that is rather a reason for separating you now if i should put you both into different parts of the school next to boys that you are not acquainted with it would be a great deal easier for you to be still and studious than it is now do not you think so yourselves  the boys look at one another and smile  however there is one way you can do you can guard against the extra temptation by extra care and on the whole as i believe you are pretty good boys i will let you have your choice you may stay as you are and make extra exertion to be perfectly regular and studious or i will find seats for you where it will be a great deal easier for you to be so which do you think you should rather do  the boys hesitate look at one another and presently say that they had rather sit together  well said the teacher it is immaterial to me whether you sit together or apart if you are only good boys so you may take your seats and try it a little while if you find it too hard work to be studious and orderly together i can make a change hereafter i shall soon see  such a conversation will have many good effects it will make the boys expect to be watched without causing them to feel that their characters have suffered it will stimulate them to great exertion to avoid all misconduct and it will prepare the way for separating them afterwards without awakening feelings of resentment if the experiment of their sitting together should fail                                       another case would be managed perhaps in a little different way where the tendency to play was more decided after speaking to the individuals mildly two or three times you see them again at play you ask them to wait that day after school and come to your desk  they have then the rest of the day to think occasionally of the difficulty they have brought themselves into and the anxiety and suspense which they will naturally feel will give you every advantage for speaking to them with effectand if you should be engaged a few minutes with some other business after school so that they should have to stand a little while in silent expectation waiting for their turn it would contribute to the permanence of the effect  well boys at length you say with a serious but frank tone of voice i saw you playing in a disorderly manner today and in the first place i want you to tell me honestly all about it i am not going to punish youbut i want you to be open and honest about it what were you doing  the boys hesitate  george what did you have in your hand  a piece of paper  and what were you doing with it  george william was trying to take it away from me  was there any thing on it  yes sir  what  george looks down a little confused  william george had been drawing some pictures on it  i see each of you are ready to tell of the others fault but it would be much more honorable if each was open in acknowledging his own have i ever had to speak to you before for playing together in school  yes sir i believe you have says one looking down  more than once  yes sir  more than twice  i do not recollect exactlyi believe you have  well now what do you think i ought to do next  the boys have nothing to say  do you prefer sitting together or are you willing to have me separate you  we should rather sit together sir if you are willing says george  i have no objection to your sitting together if you could only resist the temptation to play i want all the boys in the school to have pleasant seats  there is a pausethe teacher hesitating what to do  suppose now i were to make one more experiment and let you try to be good boys in your present seat would you really try  yes siryes sir we will are the replies  and if i should find that you still continue to play and should have to separate you will you move into your new seats pleasantly and with good humor feeling that i have done right about it  yes sir we will                                       thus it will be seen that there may be cases where the teacher may make arrangements for separating his scholars on an open and distinct understanding with them in respect to the cause of it we have given these cases not that exactly such ones will be very likely to occur or that when they do the teacher is to manage them in exactly the way here described but to exhibit more clearly to the reader than could be done by any general description the spirit and tone which a teacher ought to assume towards his pupils we wished to exhibit this in contrast with the harsh and impatient manner which teachers too often assume in such a caseas follows  john williams and samuel smith come here to me exclaims the master in a harsh impatient tone in the midst of the exercises of the afternoon  the scholars all look up from their workthe culprits slowly rise from their seats and with a sullen air come down to the floor  you are playing boys all the time and i will not have it john do you take your books and go and sit out there by the window and samuel you come and sit here on this front seatand if i catch you playing again i shall certainly punish you severely  the boys make the move with as much rattling and disturbance as is possible without furnishing proof of wilful intention to make a noise and when they get their new seats and the teacher is again engaged upon his work they exchange winks and nods and in ten minutes are slyly cannonading each other with paper balls                                       in regard to all the directions that have been given under this head i ought to say again before concluding it that they are mainly applicable to the case of beginners and of small schools the general principles are it is true of universal application but it is only where a school is of moderate size that the details of position in respect to individual scholars can be minutely studied more summary processes are necessary i am aware when the school is very large and the time of the teacher is incessantly engaged  9 in some districts in new england the young teacher will find one or more boys generally among the larger ones who will come to the school with the express determination to make a difficulty if they can the best way is generally to face these individuals at once in the most direct and open manner and at the same time with perfect good humor and kindness of feeling and deportment towards them personally an example or two will best illustrate what i mean  a teacher heard a rapping noise repeatedly one day just after he had commenced his labors under such circumstances as to lead him to suppose it was designed he did not appear to notice it but remained after school until the scholars had all gone and then made a thorough examination he found at length a broken place in the plastering where a lath was loose and a string was tied to the end of it and thence carried along the wall under the benches to the seat of a mischievous boy and fastened to a nail by pulling the string he could spring the lath and then let it snap back to its place he left every thing as it was and the next day while engaged in a lesson he heard the noise again  he rose from his seat  the scholars all looked up from their books  did you hear that noise said he  yes sir  do you know what it is  no sir  very well i only wanted to call your attention to it i may perhaps speak of it again by and by  he then resumed his exercise as if nothing had happened the guilty boy was agitated and confused and was utterly at a loss to know what to do what could the teacher mean had he discovered the trickand if so what was he going to do  he grew more and more uneasy and resolved that at all events it was best for him to retreat accordingly at the next recess as the teacher had anticipated he went slyly to the lath cut the string then returned to his seat and drew the line in rolled it up and put it in his pocket the teacher who was secretly watching him observed the whole manoeuvre  at the close of the school when the books were laid aside and all was silence he treated the affair thus  do you remember the noise to which i called your attention early this afternoon  yes sir  i will explain it to you now one of the boys tied a string to a loose lath in the side of the room and then having the end of it at his seat he was pulling it to make a noise to disturb us  the scholars all looked astonished and then began to turn round towards one another to see who the offender could be the culprit began to tremble  he did it several times yesterday and would have gone on doing it had i not spoken about it today do you think this was wrong or not  yes sir wrong wrong are the replies  what harm does it do  it interrupts the school  yes is there any other harm  the boys hesitate  it gives me trouble and pain should you not suppose it would  yes sir  have i ever treated any boy or girl in this school unjustly or unkindly  no sir no sir  then why should any boy or girl wish to give me trouble or pain  there was a pause the guilty individual expected that the next thing would be to call him out for punishment  now what do you think i ought to do with such a boy  no answer  perhaps i ought to punish him but i am very unwilling to do that i concluded to try another plan to treat him with kindness and forbearance so i called your attention to it this afternoon to let him know that i was observing it and to give him an opportunity to remove the string and he did he went in the recess and cut off the string i shall not tell you his name for i do not wish to injure his character all i want is to have him a good boy  a pause  i think i shall try this plan for he must have some feelings of honor and gratitude and if he has he certainly will not try to give me pain or trouble win after this and now i shall say no more about it nor think any more about it only to prove that it is all as i say if you look there under that window after school you will see the lath with the end of the string round it and by pulling it you can make it snap                                       another case a little more serious in its character is the following  a teacher having had some trouble with a rude and savagelooking boy made some inquiry respecting him out of school and incidentally learned that he had once or twice before openly rebelled against the authority of the school and that he was now in the recesses actually preparing a club with which he was threatening to defend himself if the teacher should attempt to punish him  the next day soon after the boys had gone out he took his hat and followed them and turning round a corner of the schoolhouse found the boys standing around the young rebel who was sitting upon a log shaving the handle of the club smooth with his pocketknife he was startled at the unexpected appearance of the teacher and the first impulse was to hide his club behind him but it was too late and supposing that the teacher was ignorant of his designs he went on sullenly with his work feeling however greatly embarrassed  pleasant day boys said the teacher this is a fine sunny nook for you to talk in  seems to me however you ought to have a better seat than this old log continued he taking his seat at the same time by the side of the boy  not so bad a seat however after all what are you making joseph  joseph mumbled out something inarticulate by way of reply  i have got a sharper knife said he drawing his penknife out of his pocket and then let me try it he continued gently taking the club out of josephs hand  the boys looked surprised some exchanged nods and winks others turned away to conceal a laugh but the teacher engaged in conversation with them and soon put them all at their ease except poor joseph who could not tell how this strange interview was likely to end  in the mean time the teacher went on shaving the handle smooth and rounding the ends you want said he a rasp or coarse file for the ends and then you could finish it finely but what are you making this formidable club for  joseph was completely at a loss what to say he began to show evident marks of embarrassment and confusion  i know what it is for it is to defend yourself against me with is it not boys said he appealing to the others  a faint yes sir or two was the reply  well now joseph it will be a great deal better for us both to be friends than to be enemies you had better throw this club away and save yourself from punishment by being a good boy come now said he handing him back his club throw it over into the field as far as you can and we will all forget that you ever made it  joseph sat the picture of shame and confusion better feelings were struggling for admission and the case was decided by a broadfaced goodnaturedlooking boy who stood by his side saying almost involuntarily  better throw it joe  the club flew end over end into the field joseph returned to his allegiance and never attempted to rise in rebellion again  the ways by which boys engage in open intentional disobedience are of course greatly varied and the exact treatment will depend upon the features of the individual case but the frankness the openness the plain dealing and the kind and friendly tone which it is the object of the foregoing illustrations to exhibit should characterize all  11 we have already alluded to the importance of a delicate regard for the characters of the boys in all the measures of discipline adopted at the commencement of a school this is in fact of the highest importance at all times and is peculiarly so at the outset a wound to the feelings is sometimes inflicted by a single transaction which produces a lasting injury to the character children are very sensitive to ridicule or disgrace and some are most acutely so a cutting reproof administered in public or a punishment which exposes the individual to the gaze of others will often burn far more deeply into the heart than the teacher imagines  and it is often the cause of great and lasting injury too by destroying the character of a pupil you make him feel that he has nothing more to lose or gain and destroy that kind of interest in his own moral condition which alone will allure him to virtuous conduct to expose children to public ridicule or contempt tends either to make them sullen and despondent or else to arouse their resentment and to make them reckless and desperate most persons remember through life some instances in their early childhood in which they were disgraced or ridiculed at school and the permanence of the recollection is a test of the violence of the effect  be very careful then to avoid especially at the commencement of the school publicly exposing those who do wrong sometimes you may make the offence public as in the case of the snapping of the lath described under a former head while you kindly conceal the name of the offender even if the school generally understand who he is the injury of public exposure is almost altogether avoided for the sense of disgrace does not come nearly so vividly home to the mind of a child from hearing occasional allusions to his offence by individuals among his playmates as when he feels himself at a particular time the object of universal attention and dishonor and then besides if the pupil perceives that the teacher is tender of his reputation he will by a feeling somewhere between imitation and sympathy begin to feel a little tender of it too every exertion should be made therefore to lead children to value their character and to help them to preserve it and especially to avoid at the beginning every unnecessary sacrifice of it  and yet there are cases where shame is the very best possible remedy for juvenile faults if a boy for example is selfconceited bold and mischievous with feelings somewhat callous and an influence extensive and bad an opportunity will sometimes occur to hold up his conduct to the just reprobation of the school with great advantage by this means if it is done in such a way as to secure the influence of the school on the right side many good effects are sometimes attained his pride and selfconceit are humbledhis bad influence receives a very decided check and he is forced to draw back at once from the prominent stand he has occupied  richard jones for example is a rude coarse selfconceited boyoften doing wrong both in school and out and yet possessed of that peculiar influence which a bad boy often contrives to exert in school the teacher after watching some time for an opportunity to humble him one day overhears a difficulty among the boys and looking out of the window observes that he is taking away a sled from one of the little boys to slide down hill upon having none of his own the little boy resists as well as he can and complains bitterly but it is of no avail  at the close of the school that day the teacher commences conversation on the subject as follows  boys do you know what the difference is between stealing and robbery  yes sir  what  the boys hesitate and look at one another  suppose a thief were to go into a mans store in the day time and take away something secretly would it be stealing or robbery  stealing  suppose he should meet him in the road and take it away by force  then it would be robbery  yes when that which belongs to another is taken secretly it is called stealing when it is taken openly or with violence it is called robbery which now do you think is the worst  robbery  yes for it is more barefaced and determinedthen it gives a great deal more pain to the one who is injured today i saw one of the boys in this school taking away another boys sled openly and with violence  the boys all look round towards richard  was that of the nature of stealing or robbery  robbery say the boys  was it real robbery  they hesitate  if any of you think of any reason why it was not real robbery you may name it  he gave the sled back to him says one of the boys  yes and therefore to describe the action correctly we should not say richard robbed a boy of his sled but that he robbed him of his sled for a time or he robbed him of the use of his sled still in respect to the nature and the guilt of it it was robbery  there is another thing which ought to be observed about it whose sled was it that richard took away  james thompsons  james you may stand up  notice his size boysi should like to have richard jones stand up too so that you might compare them but i presume he feels very much ashamed of what he has done and it would be very unpleasant for him to stand up you all remember however how large he is now when i was a boy it used to be considered dishonorable and cowardly for a large strong boy to abuse a little one who cannot defend himself is it considered so now  yes sir  it ought to be certainly though were it not for such a case as this we should not have thought of considering richard jones a coward it seems he did not dare to try to take away a sled from a boy who was as big as himself but attacked little james for he knew he was not strong enough to defend himself                                       now in some such cases as this great good may be done both in respect to the individual and to the state of public sentiment in school by openly exposing a boys misconduct the teacher must always take care however that the state of mind and character in the guilty individual is such that public exposure is adapted to work well as a remedy and also that in managing it he carries the sympathies of the other boys with him to secure this he must avoid all harsh and exaggerated expressions or direct reproaches and while he is mild and gentle and forbearing himself lead the boys to understand and feel the nature of the sin which he exposes the opportunities for doing this to advantage will however be rare generally it will be best to manage cases of discipline more privately so as to protect the characters of those that offend                                       the teacher should thus in accordance with the directions we have given commence his labors with careful circumspection patience frankness and honest good will towards every individual of his charge he will find less difficulty at the outset than he would have expected and soon have the satisfaction of perceiving that a mild but most efficient government is quietly and firmly established in the little kingdom over which he is called to reign
