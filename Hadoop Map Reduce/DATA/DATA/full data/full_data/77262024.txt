77262024	lord arthur saviles crime and other stories     contents  lord arthur saviles crime the canterville ghost the sphinx without a secret the model millionaire the portrait of mr w h     lord arthur saviles crime     chapter i    it was lady windermeres last reception before easter and bentinck house was even more crowded than usual  six cabinet ministers had come on from the speakers levee in their stars and ribands all the pretty women wore their smartest dresses and at the end of the picturegallery stood the princess sophia of carlsruhe a heavy tartarlooking lady with tiny black eyes and wonderful emeralds talking bad french at the top of her voice and laughing immoderately at everything that was said to her  it was certainly a wonderful medley of people  gorgeous peeresses chatted affably to violent radicals popular preachers brushed coattails with eminent sceptics a perfect bevy of bishops kept following a stout prima donna from room to room on the staircase stood several royal academicians disguised as artists and it was said that at one time the supperroom was absolutely crammed with geniuses  in fact it was one of lady windermeres best nights and the princess stayed till nearly halfpast eleven  as soon as she had gone lady windermere returned to the picture gallery where a celebrated political economist was solemnly explaining the scientific theory of music to an indignant virtuoso from hungary and began to talk to the duchess of paisley  she looked wonderfully beautiful with her grand ivory throat her large blue forgetmenot eyes and her heavy coils of golden hair  or pur they werenot that pale straw colour that nowadays usurps the gracious name of gold but such gold as is woven into sunbeams or hidden in strange amber and they gave to her face something of the frame of a saint with not a little of the fascination of a sinner she was a curious psychological study  early in life she had discovered the important truth that nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion and by a series of reckless escapades half of them quite harmless she had acquired all the privileges of a personality  she had more than once changed her husband indeed debrett credits her with three marriages but as she had never changed her lover the world had long ago ceased to talk scandal about her  she was now forty years of age childless and with that inordinate passion for pleasure which is the secret of remaining young  suddenly she looked eagerly round the room and said in her clear contralto voice where is my cheiromantist  your what gladys exclaimed the duchess giving an involuntary start  my cheiromantist duchess i cant live without him at present  dear gladys you are always so original murmured the duchess trying to remember what a cheiromantist really was and hoping it was not the same as a cheiropodist  he comes to see my hand twice a week regularly continued lady windermere and is most interesting about it  good heavens said the duchess to herself he is a sort of cheiropodist after all  how very dreadful  i hope he is a foreigner at any rate  it wouldnt be quite so bad then  i must certainly introduce him to you  introduce him cried the duchess you dont mean to say he is here and she began looking about for a small tortoiseshell fan and a very tattered lace shawl so as to be ready to go at a moments notice  of course he is here i would not dream of giving a party without him  he tells me i have a pure psychic hand and that if my thumb had been the least little bit shorter i should have been a confirmed pessimist and gone into a convent  oh i see said the duchess feeling very much relieved he tells fortunes i suppose  and misfortunes too answered lady windermere any amount of them  next year for instance i am in great danger both by land and sea so i am going to live in a balloon and draw up my dinner in a basket every evening  it is all written down on my little finger or on the palm of my hand i forget which  but surely that is tempting providence gladys  my dear duchess surely providence can resist temptation by this time  i think every one should have their hands told once a month so as to know what not to do  of course one does it all the same but it is so pleasant to be warned  now if some one doesnt go and fetch mr podgers at once i shall have to go myself  let me go lady windermere said a tall handsome young man who was standing by listening to the conversation with an amused smile  thanks so much lord arthur but i am afraid you wouldnt recognise him  if he is as wonderful as you say lady windermere i couldnt well miss him  tell me what he is like and ill bring him to you at once  well he is not a bit like a cheiromantist  i mean he is not mysterious or esoteric or romanticlooking  he is a little stout man with a funny bald head and great goldrimmed spectacles something between a family doctor and a country attorney  im really very sorry but it is not my fault  people are so annoying all my pianists look exactly like poets and all my poets look exactly like pianists and i remember last season asking a most dreadful conspirator to dinner a man who had blown up ever so many people and always wore a coat of mail and carried a dagger up his shirtsleeve and do you know that when he came he looked just like a nice old clergyman and cracked jokes all the evening  of course he was very amusing and all that but i was awfully disappointed and when i asked him about the coat of mail he only laughed and said it was far too cold to wear in england  ah here is mr podgers  now mr podgers i want you to tell the duchess of paisleys hand  duchess you must take your glove off  no not the left hand the other  dear gladys i really dont think it is quite right said the duchess feebly unbuttoning a rather soiled kid glove  nothing interesting ever is said lady windermere  on a fait le monde ainsi  but i must introduce you  duchess this is mr podgers my pet cheiromantist  mr podgers this is the duchess of paisley and if you say that she has a larger mountain of the moon than i have i will never believe in you again  i am sure gladys there is nothing of the kind in my hand said the duchess gravely  your grace is quite right said mr podgers glancing at the little fat hand with its short square fingers the mountain of the moon is not developed  the line of life however is excellent kindly bend the wrist  thank you  three distinct lines on the rascette  you will live to a great age duchess and be extremely happy  ambitionvery moderate line of intellect not exaggerated line of heart  now do be indiscreet mr podgers cried lady windermere  nothing would give me greater pleasure said mr podgers bowing if the duchess ever had been but i am sorry to say that i see great permanence of affection combined with a strong sense of duty  pray go on mr podgers said the duchess looking quite pleased  economy is not the least of your graces virtues continued mr podgers and lady windermere went off into fits of laughter  economy is a very good thing remarked the duchess complacently when i married paisley he had eleven castles and not a single house fit to live in  and now he has twelve houses and not a single castle cried lady windermere  well my dear said the duchess i like  comfort said mr podgers and modern improvements and hot water laid on in every bedroom  your grace is quite right  comfort is the only thing our civilisation can give us  you have told the duchesss character admirably mr podgers and now you must tell lady floras and in answer to a nod from the smiling hostess a tall girl with sandy scotch hair and high shoulderblades stepped awkwardly from behind the sofa and held out a long bony hand with spatulate fingers  ah a pianist i see said mr podgers an excellent pianist but perhaps hardly a musician  very reserved very honest and with a great love of animals  quite true exclaimed the duchess turning to lady windermere absolutely true  flora keeps two dozen collie dogs at macloskie and would turn our town house into a menagerie if her father would let her  well that is just what i do with my house every thursday evening cried lady windermere laughing only i like lions better than collie dogs  your one mistake lady windermere said mr podgers with a pompous bow  if a woman cant make her mistakes charming she is only a female was the answer  but you must read some more hands for us  come sir thomas show mr podgers yours and a geniallooking old gentleman in a white waistcoat came forward and held out a thick rugged hand with a very long third finger  an adventurous nature four long voyages in the past and one to come  been shipwrecked three times  no only twice but in danger of a shipwreck your next journey  a strong conservative very punctual and with a passion for collecting curiosities  had a severe illness between the ages sixteen and eighteen  was left a fortune when about thirty  great aversion to cats and radicals  extraordinary exclaimed sir thomas you must really tell my wifes hand too  your second wifes said mr podgers quietly still keeping sir thomass hand in his  your second wifes  i shall be charmed but lady marvel a melancholylooking woman with brown hair and sentimental eyelashes entirely declined to have her past or her future exposed and nothing that lady windermere could do would induce monsieur de koloff the russian ambassador even to take his gloves off  in fact many people seemed afraid to face the odd little man with his stereotyped smile his gold spectacles and his bright beady eyes and when he told poor lady fermor right out before every one that she did not care a bit for music but was extremely fond of musicians it was generally felt that cheiromancy was a most dangerous science and one that ought not to be encouraged except in a teteatete  lord arthur savile however who did not know anything about lady fermors unfortunate story and who had been watching mr podgers with a great deal of interest was filled with an immense curiosity to have his own hand read and feeling somewhat shy about putting himself forward crossed over the room to where lady windermere was sitting and with a charming blush asked her if she thought mr podgers would mind  of course he wont mind said lady windermere that is what he is here for  all my lions lord arthur are performing lions and jump through hoops whenever i ask them  but i must warn you beforehand that i shall tell sybil everything  she is coming to lunch with me tomorrow to talk about bonnets and if mr podgers finds out that you have a bad temper or a tendency to gout or a wife living in bayswater i shall certainly let her know all about it  lord arthur smiled and shook his head  i am not afraid he answered  sybil knows me as well as i know her  ah  i am a little sorry to hear you say that  the proper basis for marriage is a mutual misunderstanding  no i am not at all cynical i have merely got experience which however is very much the same thing  mr podgers lord arthur savile is dying to have his hand read  dont tell him that he is engaged to one of the most beautiful girls in london because that appeared in the morning post a month ago  dear lady windermere cried the marchioness of jedburgh do let mr podgers stay here a little longer  he has just told me i should go on the stage and i am so interested  if he has told you that lady jedburgh i shall certainly take him away  come over at once mr podgers and read lord arthurs hand  well said lady jedburgh making a little moue as she rose from the sofa if i am not to be allowed to go on the stage i must be allowed to be part of the audience at any rate  of course we are all going to be part of the audience said lady windermere and now mr podgers be sure and tell us something nice  lord arthur is one of my special favourites  but when mr podgers saw lord arthurs hand he grew curiously pale and said nothing  a shudder seemed to pass through him and his great bushy eyebrows twitched convulsively in an odd irritating way they had when he was puzzled  then some huge beads of perspiration broke out on his yellow forehead like a poisonous dew and his fat fingers grew cold and clammy  lord arthur did not fail to notice these strange signs of agitation and for the first time in his life he himself felt fear  his impulse was to rush from the room but he restrained himself  it was better to know the worst whatever it was than to be left in this hideous uncertainty  i am waiting mr podgers he said  we are all waiting cried lady windermere in her quick impatient manner but the cheiromantist made no reply  i believe arthur is going on the stage said lady jedburgh and that after your scolding mr podgers is afraid to tell him so  suddenly mr podgers dropped lord arthurs right hand and seized hold of his left bending down so low to examine it that the gold rims of his spectacles seemed almost to touch the palm  for a moment his face became a white mask of horror but he soon recovered his sangfroid and looking up at lady windermere said with a forced smile it is the hand of a charming young man  of course it is answered lady windermere but will he be a charming husband  that is what i want to know  all charming young men are said mr podgers  i dont think a husband should be too fascinating murmured lady jedburgh pensively it is so dangerous  my dear child they never are too fascinating cried lady windermere  but what i want are details  details are the only things that interest  what is going to happen to lord arthur  well within the next few months lord arthur will go a voyage  oh yes his honeymoon of course  and lose a relative  not his sister i hope said lady jedburgh in a piteous tone of voice  certainly not his sister answered mr podgers with a deprecating wave of the hand a distant relative merely  well i am dreadfully disappointed said lady windermere  i have absolutely nothing to tell sybil tomorrow  no one cares about distant relatives nowadays  they went out of fashion years ago however i suppose she had better have a black silk by her it always does for church you know  and now let us go to supper they are sure to have eaten everything up but we may find some hot soup  francois used to make excellent soup once but he is so agitated about politics at present that i never feel quite certain about him  i do wish general boulanger would keep quiet  duchess i am sure you are tired  not at all dear gladys answered the duchess waddling towards the door  i have enjoyed myself immensely and the cheiropodist i mean the cheiromantist is most interesting  flora where can my tortoiseshell fan be  oh thank you sir thomas so much  and my lace shawl flora  oh thank you sir thomas very kind im sure and the worthy creature finally managed to get downstairs without dropping her scentbottle more than twice  all this time lord arthur savile had remained standing by the fireplace with the same feeling of dread over him the same sickening sense of coming evil  he smiled sadly at his sister as she swept past him on lord plymdales arm looking lovely in her pink brocade and pearls and he hardly heard lady windermere when she called to him to follow her  he thought of sybil merton and the idea that anything could come between them made his eyes dim with tears  looking at him one would have said that nemesis had stolen the shield of pallas and shown him the gorgons head  he seemed turned to stone and his face was like marble in its melancholy  he had lived the delicate and luxurious life of a young man of birth and fortune a life exquisite in its freedom from sordid care its beautiful boyish insouciance and now for the first time he became conscious of the terrible mystery of destiny of the awful meaning of doom  how mad and monstrous it all seemed  could it be that written on his hand in characters that he could not read himself but that another could decipher was some fearful secret of sin some blood red sign of crime  was there no escape possible  were we no better than chessmen moved by an unseen power vessels the potter fashions at his fancy for honour or for shame  his reason revolted against it and yet he felt that some tragedy was hanging over him and that he had been suddenly called upon to bear an intolerable burden actors are so fortunate  they can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or in comedy whether they will suffer or make merry laugh or shed tears  but in real life it is different  most men and women are forced to perform parts for which they have no qualifications  our guildensterns play hamlet for us and our hamlets have to jest like prince hal  the world is a stage but the play is badly cast  suddenly mr podgers entered the room  when he saw lord arthur he started and his coarse fat face became a sort of greenishyellow colour  the two mens eyes met and for a moment there was silence  the duchess has left one of her gloves here lord arthur and has asked me to bring it to her said mr podgers finally  ah i see it on the sofa  good evening  mr podgers i must insist on your giving me a straightforward answer to a question i am going to put to you  another time lord arthur but the duchess is anxious  i am afraid i must go  you shall not go  the duchess is in no hurry  ladies should not be kept waiting lord arthur said mr podgers with his sickly smile  the fair sex is apt to be impatient  lord arthurs finelychiselled lips curled in petulant disdain  the poor duchess seemed to him of very little importance at that moment he walked across the room to where mr podgers was standing and held his hand out  tell me what you saw there he said  tell me the truth  i must know it  i am not a child  mr podgerss eyes blinked behind his goldrimmed spectacles and he moved uneasily from one foot to the other while his fingers played nervously with a flash watchchain  what makes you think that i saw anything in your hand lord arthur more than i told you  i know you did and i insist on your telling me what it was  i will pay you  i will give you a cheque for a hundred pounds  the green eyes flashed for a moment and then became dull again  guineas said mr podgers at last in a low voice  certainly  i will send you a cheque tomorrow  what is your club  i have no club  that is to say not just at present  my address is  but allow me to give you my card and producing a bit of giltedge pasteboard from his waistcoat pocket mr podgers handed it with a low bow to lord arthur who read on it   mr  septimus r podgers professional cheiromantist 103a west moon street   my hours are from ten to four murmured mr podgers mechanically and i make a reduction for families  be quick cried lord arthur looking very pale and holding his hand out  mr podgers glanced nervously round and drew the heavy portiere across the door  it will take a little time lord arthur you had better sit down  be quick sir cried lord arthur again stamping his foot angrily on the polished floor  mr podgers smiled drew from his breastpocket a small magnifying glass and wiped it carefully with his handkerchief  i am quite ready he said    chapter ii    ten minutes later with face blanched by terror and eyes wild with grief lord arthur savile rushed from bentinck house crushing his way through the crowd of furcoated footmen that stood round the large striped awning and seeming not to see or hear anything  the night was bitter cold and the gaslamps round the square flared and flickered in the keen wind but his hands were hot with fever and his forehead burned like fire  on and on he went almost with the gait of a drunken man  a policeman looked curiously at him as he passed and a beggar who slouched from an archway to ask for alms grew frightened seeing misery greater than his own  once he stopped under a lamp and looked at his hands  he thought he could detect the stain of blood already upon them and a faint cry broke from his trembling lips  murder that is what the cheiromantist had seen there  murder  the very night seemed to know it and the desolate wind to howl it in his ear  the dark corners of the streets were full of it  it grinned at him from the roofs of the houses  first he came to the park whose sombre woodland seemed to fascinate him  he leaned wearily up against the railings cooling his brow against the wet metal and listening to the tremulous silence of the trees  murder murder he kept repeating as though iteration could dim the horror of the word  the sound of his own voice made him shudder yet he almost hoped that echo might hear him and wake the slumbering city from its dreams  he felt a mad desire to stop the casual passerby and tell him everything  then he wandered across oxford street into narrow shameful alleys two women with painted faces mocked at him as he went by  from a dark courtyard came a sound of oaths and blows followed by shrill screams and huddled upon a damp doorstep he saw the crookbacked forms of poverty and eld  a strange pity came over him  were these children of sin and misery predestined to their end as he to his were they like him merely the puppets of a monstrous show  and yet it was not the mystery but the comedy of suffering that struck him its absolute uselessness its grotesque want of meaning how incoherent everything seemed  how lacking in all harmony  he was amazed at the discord between the shallow optimism of the day and the real facts of existence  he was still very young  after a time he found himself in front of marylebone church  the silent roadway looked like a long riband of polished silver flecked here and there by the dark arabesques of waving shadows  far into the distance curved the line of flickering gaslamps and outside a little walledin house stood a solitary hansom the driver asleep inside  he walked hastily in the direction of portland place now and then looking round as though he feared that he was being followed  at the corner of rich street stood two men reading a small bill upon a hoarding  an odd feeling of curiosity stirred him and he crossed over  as he came near the word murder printed in black letters met his eye  he started and a deep flush came into his cheek  it was an advertisement offering a reward for any information leading to the arrest of a man of medium height between thirty and forty years of age wearing a billycock hat a black coat and check trousers and with a scar upon his right cheek  he read it over and over again and wondered if the wretched man would be caught and how he had been scarred  perhaps some day his own name might be placarded on the walls of london  some day perhaps a price would be set on his head also  the thought made him sick with horror  he turned on his heel and hurried on into the night  where he went he hardly knew  he had a dim memory of wandering through a labyrinth of sordid houses of being lost in a giant web of sombre streets and it was bright dawn when he found himself at last in piccadilly circus  as he strolled home towards belgrave square he met the great waggons on their way to covent garden  the whitesmocked carters with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarse curly hair strode sturdily on cracking their whips and calling out now and then to each other on the back of a huge grey horse the leader of a jangling team sat a chubby boy with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat keeping tight hold of the mane with his little hands and laughing and the great piles of vegetables looked like masses of jade against the morning sky like masses of green jade against the pink petals of some marvellous rose  lord arthur felt curiously affected he could not tell why  there was something in the dawns delicate loveliness that seemed to him inexpressibly pathetic and he thought of all the days that break in beauty and that set in storm  these rustics too with their rough goodhumoured voices and their nonchalant ways what a strange london they saw  a london free from the sin of night and the smoke of day a pallid ghostlike city a desolate town of tombs  he wondered what they thought of it and whether they knew anything of its splendour and its shame of its fierce fiery coloured joys and its horrible hunger of all it makes and mars from morn to eve  probably it was to them merely a mart where they brought their fruits to sell and where they tarried for a few hours at most leaving the streets still silent the houses still asleep it gave him pleasure to watch them as they went by  rude as they were with their heavy hobnailed shoes and their awkward gait they brought a little of a ready with them  he felt that they had lived with nature and that she had taught them peace  he envied them all that they did not know  by the time he had reached belgrave square the sky was a faint blue and the birds were beginning to twitter in the gardens    chapter iii    when lord arthur woke it was twelve oclock and the midday sun was streaming through the ivorysilk curtains of his room  he got up and looked out of the window  a dim haze of heat was hanging over the great city and the roofs of the houses were like dull silver in the flickering green of the square below some children were flitting about like white butterflies and the pavement was crowded with people on their way to the park  never had life seemed lovelier to him never had the things of evil seemed more remote  then his valet brought him a cup of chocolate on a tray  after he had drunk it he drew aside a heavy portiere of peachcoloured plush and passed into the bathroom  the light stole softly from above through thin slabs of transparent onyx and the water in the marble tank glimmered like a moonstone  he plunged hastily in till the cool ripples touched throat and hair and then dipped his head right under as though he would have wiped away the stain of some shameful memory  when he stepped out he felt almost at peace  the exquisite physical conditions of the moment had dominated him as indeed often happens in the case of very finelywrought natures for the senses like fire can purify as well as destroy  after breakfast he flung himself down on a divan and lit a cigarette  on the mantelshelf framed in dainty old brocade stood a large photograph of sybil merton as he had seen her first at lady noels ball  the small exquisitelyshaped head drooped slightly to one side as though the thin reedlike throat could hardly bear the burden of so much beauty the lips were slightly parted and seemed made for sweet music and all the tender purity of girlhood looked out in wonder from the dreaming eyes  with her soft clinging dress of crepedechine and her large leafshaped fan she looked like one of those delicate little figures men find in the olivewoods near tanagra and there was a touch of greek grace in her pose and attitude  yet she was not petite  she was simply perfectly proportioneda rare thing in an age when so many women are either over lifesize or insignificant  now as lord arthur looked at her he was filled with the terrible pity that is born of love  he felt that to marry her with the doom of murder hanging over his head would be a betrayal like that of judas a sin worse than any the borgia had ever dreamed of  what happiness could there be for them when at any moment he might be called upon to carry out the awful prophecy written in his hand what manner of life would be theirs while fate still held this fearful fortune in the scales  the marriage must be postponed at all costs  of this he was quite resolved  ardently though he loved the girl and the mere touch of her fingers when they sat together made each nerve of his body thrill with exquisite joy he recognised none the less clearly where his duty lay and was fully conscious of the fact that he had no right to marry until he had committed the murder  this done he could stand before the altar with sybil merton and give his life into her hands without terror of wrongdoing  this done he could take her to his arms knowing that she would never have to blush for him never have to hang her head in shame  but done it must be first and the sooner the better for both  many men in his position would have preferred the primrose path of dalliance to the steep heights of duty but lord arthur was too conscientious to set pleasure above principle  there was more than mere passion in his love and sybil was to him a symbol of all that is good and noble  for a moment he had a natural repugnance against what he was asked to do but it soon passed away  his heart told him that it was not a sin but a sacrifice his reason reminded him that there was no other course open  he had to choose between living for himself and living for others and terrible though the task laid upon him undoubtedly was yet he knew that he must not suffer selfishness to triumph over love  sooner or later we are all called upon to decide on the same issueof us all the same question is asked  to lord arthur it came early in lifebefore his nature had been spoiled by the calculating cynicism of middleage or his heart corroded by the shallow fashionable egotism of our day and he felt no hesitation about doing his duty  fortunately also for him he was no mere dreamer or idle dilettante  had he been so he would have hesitated like hamlet and let irresolution mar his purpose  but he was essentially practical  life to him meant action rather than thought  he had that rarest of all things common sense  the wild turbid feelings of the previous night had by this time completely passed away and it was almost with a sense of shame that he looked back upon his mad wanderings from street to street his fierce emotional agony  the very sincerity of his sufferings made them seem unreal to him now  he wondered how he could have been so foolish as to rant and rave about the inevitable  the only question that seemed to trouble him was whom to make away with for he was not blind to the fact that murder like the religions of the pagan world requires a victim as well as a priest  not being a genius he had no enemies and indeed he felt that this was not the time for the gratification of any personal pique or dislike the mission in which he was engaged being one of great and grave solemnity  he accordingly made out a list of his friends and relatives on a sheet of notepaper and after careful consideration decided in favour of lady clementina beauchamp a dear old lady who lived in curzon street and was his own second cousin by his mothers side  he had always been very fond of lady clem as every one called her and as he was very wealthy himself having come into all lord rugbys property when he came of age there was no possibility of his deriving any vulgar monetary advantage by her death  in fact the more he thought over the matter the more she seemed to him to be just the right person and feeling that any delay would be unfair to sybil he determined to make his arrangements at once  the first thing to be done was of course to settle with the cheiromantist so he sat down at a small sheraton writingtable that stood near the window drew a cheque for 105 pounds payable to the order of mr septimus podgers and enclosing it in an envelope told his valet to take it to west moon street  he then telephoned to the stables for his hansom and dressed to go out  as he was leaving the room he looked back at sybil mertons photograph and swore that come what may he would never let her know what he was doing for her sake but would keep the secret of his selfsacrifice hidden always in his heart  on his way to the buckingham he stopped at a florists and sent sybil a beautiful basket of narcissus with lovely white petals and staring pheasants eyes and on arriving at the club went straight to the library rang the bell and ordered the waiter to bring him a lemonandsoda and a book on toxicology  he had fully decided that poison was the best means to adopt in this troublesome business anything like personal violence was extremely distasteful to him and besides he was very anxious not to murder lady clementina in any way that might attract public attention as he hated the idea of being lionised at lady windermeres or seeing his name figuring in the paragraphs of vulgar societynewspapers  he had also to think of sybils father and mother who were rather oldfashioned people and might possibly object to the marriage if there was anything like a scandal though he felt certain that if he told them the whole facts of the case they would be the very first to appreciate the motives that had actuated him  he had every reason then to decide in favour of poison  it was safe sure and quiet and did away with any necessity for painful scenes to which like most englishmen he had a rooted objection  of the science of poisons however he knew absolutely nothing and as the waiter seemed quite unable to find anything in the library but ruffs guide and baileys magazine he examined the bookshelves himself and finally came across a handsomelybound edition of the pharmacopoeia and a copy of erskines toxicology edited by sir mathew reid the president of the royal college of physicians and one of the oldest members of the buckingham having been elected in mistake for somebody else a contretemps that so enraged the committee that when the real man came up they blackballed him unanimously  lord arthur was a good deal puzzled at the technical terms used in both books and had begun to regret that he had not paid more attention to his classics at oxford when in the second volume of erskine he found a very interesting and complete account of the properties of aconitine written in fairly clear english  it seemed to him to be exactly the poison he wanted  it was swift indeed almost immediate in its effectperfectly painless and when taken in the form of a gelatine capsule the mode recommended by sir mathew not by any means unpalatable  he accordingly made a note upon his shirtcuff of the amount necessary for a fatal dose put the books back in their places and strolled up st jamess street to pestle and humbeys the great chemists  mr pestle who always attended personally on the aristocracy was a good deal surprised at the order and in a very deferential manner murmured something about a medical certificate being necessary  however as soon as lord arthur explained to him that it was for a large norwegian mastiff that he was obliged to get rid of as it showed signs of incipient rabies and had already bitten the coachman twice in the calf of the leg he expressed himself as being perfectly satisfied complimented lord arthur on his wonderful knowledge of toxicology and had the prescription made up immediately  lord arthur put the capsule into a pretty little silver bonbonniere that he saw in a shop window in bond street threw away pestle and hambeys ugly pillbox and drove off at once to lady clementinas  well monsieur le mauvais sujet cried the old lady as he entered the room why havent you been to see me all this time  my dear lady clem i never have a moment to myself said lord arthur smiling  i suppose you mean that you go about all day long with miss sybil merton buying chiffons and talking nonsense  i cannot understand why people make such a fuss about being married  in my day we never dreamed of billing and cooing in public or in private for that matter  i assure you i have not seen sybil for twentyfour hours lady clem  as far as i can make out she belongs entirely to her milliners  of course that is the only reason you come to see an ugly old woman like myself  i wonder you men dont take warning  on a fait des folies pour moi and here i am a poor rheumatic creature with a false front and a bad temper  why if it were not for dear lady jansen who sends me all the worst french novels she can find i dont think i could get through the day  doctors are no use at all except to get fees out of one  they cant even cure my heartburn  i have brought you a cure for that lady clem said lord arthur gravely  it is a wonderful thing invented by an american  i dont think i like american inventions arthur  i am quite sure i dont  i read some american novels lately and they were quite nonsensical  oh but there is no nonsense at all about this lady clem  i assure you it is a perfect cure  you must promise to try it and lord arthur brought the little box out of his pocket and handed it to her  well the box is charming arthur  is it really a present  that is very sweet of you  and is this the wonderful medicine  it looks like a bonbon  ill take it at once  good heavens  lady clem cried lord arthur catching hold of her hand you mustnt do anything of the kind  it is a homoeopathic medicine and if you take it without having heartburn it might do you no end of harm  wait till you have an attack and take it then you will be astonished at the result  i should like to take it now said lady clementina holding up to the light the little transparent capsule with its floating bubble of liquid aconitine  i am sure it is delicious  the fact is that though i hate doctors i love medicines  however ill keep it till my next attack  and when will that be asked lord arthur eagerly  will it be soon  i hope not for a week  i had a very bad time yesterday morning with it  but one never knows  you are sure to have one before the end of the month then lady clem  i am afraid so  but how sympathetic you are today arthur really sybil has done you a great deal of good  and now you must run away for i am dining with some very dull people who wont talk scandal and i know that if i dont get my sleep now i shall never be able to keep awake during dinner  goodbye arthur give my love to sybil and thank you so much for the american medicine  you wont forget to take it lady clem will you said lord arthur rising from his seat  of course i wont you silly boy  i think it is most kind of you to think of me and i shall write and tell you if i want any more  lord arthur left the house in high spirits and with a feeling of immense relief  that night he had an interview with sybil merton  he told her how he had been suddenly placed in a position of terrible difficulty from which neither honour nor duty would allow him to recede  he told her that the marriage must be put off for the present as until he had got rid of his fearful entanglements he was not a free man he implored her to trust him and not to have any doubts about the future  everything would come right but patience was necessary  the scene took place in the conservatory of mr mertons house in park lane where lord arthur had dined as usual  sybil had never seemed more happy and for a moment lord arthur had been tempted to play the cowards part to write to lady clementina for the pill and to let the marriage go on as if there was no such person as mr podgers in the world  his better nature however soon asserted itself and even when sybil flung herself weeping into his arms he did not falter  the beauty that stirred his senses had touched his conscience also  he felt that to wreck so fair a life for the sake of a few months pleasure would be a wrong thing to do  he stayed with sybil till nearly midnight comforting her and being comforted in turn and early the next morning he left for venice after writing a manly firm letter to mr merton about the necessary postponement of the marriage    chapter iv    in venice he met his brother lord surbiton who happened to have come over from corfu in his yacht  the two young men spent a delightful fortnight together  in the morning they rode on the lido or glided up and down the green canals in their long black gondola in the afternoon they usually entertained visitors on the yacht and in the evening they dined at florians and smoked innumerable cigarettes on the piazza  yet somehow lord arthur was not happy  every day he studied the obituary column in the times expecting to see a notice of lady clementinas death but every day he was disappointed  he began to be afraid that some accident had happened to her and often regretted that he had prevented her taking the aconitine when she had been so anxious to try its effect sybils letters too though full of love and trust and tenderness were often very sad in their tone and sometimes he used to think that he was parted from her for ever  after a fortnight lord surbiton got bored with venice and determined to run down the coast to ravenna as he heard that there was some capital cockshooting in the pinetum  lord arthur at first refused absolutely to come but surbiton of whom he was extremely fond finally persuaded him that if he stayed at danielis by himself he would be moped to death and on the morning of the 15th they started with a strong noreast wind blowing and a rather choppy sea  the sport was excellent and the free openair life brought the colour back to lord arthurs cheek but about the 22nd he became anxious about lady clementina and in spite of surbitons remonstrances came back to venice by train  as he stepped out of his gondola on to the hotel steps the proprietor came forward to meet him with a sheaf of telegrams  lord arthur snatched them out of his hand and tore them open everything had been successful  lady clementina had died quite suddenly on the night of the 17th  his first thought was for sybil and he sent her off a telegram announcing his immediate return to london  he then ordered his valet to pack his things for the night mail sent his gondoliers about five times their proper fare and ran up to his sittingroom with a light step and a buoyant heart  there he found three letters waiting for him  one was from sybil herself full of sympathy and condolence  the others were from his mother and from lady clementinas solicitor  it seemed that the old lady had dined with the duchess that very night had delighted every one by her wit and esprit but had gone home somewhat early complaining of heartburn in the morning she was found dead in her bed having apparently suffered no pain  sir mathew reid had been sent for at once but of course there was nothing to be done and she was to be buried on the 22nd at beauchamp chalcote  a few days before she died she had made her will and left lord arthur her little house in curzon street and all her furniture personal effects and pictures with the exception of her collection of miniatures which was to go to her sister lady margaret rufford and her amethyst necklace which sybil merton was to have  the property was not of much value but mr mansfield the solicitor was extremely anxious for lord arthur to return at once if possible as there were a great many bills to be paid and lady clementina had never kept any regular accounts  lord arthur was very much touched by lady clementinas kind remembrance of him and felt that mr podgers had a great deal to answer for  his love of sybil however dominated every other emotion and the consciousness that he had done his duty gave him peace and comfort  when he arrived at charing cross he felt perfectly happy  the mertons received him very kindly  sybil made him promise that he would never again allow anything to come between them and the marriage was fixed for the 7th june  life seemed to him once more bright and beautiful and all his old gladness came back to him again  one day however as he was going over the house in curzon street in company with lady clementinas solicitor and sybil herself burning packages of faded letters and turning out drawers of odd rubbish the young girl suddenly gave a little cry of delight  what have you found sybil said lord arthur looking up from his work and smiling  this lovely little silver bonbonniere arthur  isnt it quaint and dutch  do give it to me  i know amethysts wont become me till i am over eighty  it was the box that had held the aconitine  lord arthur started and a faint blush came into his cheek  he had almost entirely forgotten what he had done and it seemed to him a curious coincidence that sybil for whose sake he had gone through all that terrible anxiety should have been the first to remind him of it  of course you can have it sybil  i gave it to poor lady clem myself  oh thank you arthur and may i have the bonbon too  i had no notion that lady clementina liked sweets  i thought she was far too intellectual  lord arthur grew deadly pale and a horrible idea crossed his mind  bonbon sybil  what do you mean he said in a slow hoarse voice  there is one in it that is all  it looks quite old and dusty and i have not the slightest intention of eating it  what is the matter arthur  how white you look  lord arthur rushed across the room and seized the box  inside it was the ambercoloured capsule with its poisonbubble  lady clementina had died a natural death after all  the shock of the discovery was almost too much for him  he flung the capsule into the fire and sank on the sofa with a cry of despair    chapter v    mr merton was a good deal distressed at the second postponement of the marriage and lady julia who had already ordered her dress for the wedding did all in her power to make sybil break off the match dearly however as sybil loved her mother she had given her whole life into lord arthurs hands and nothing that lady julia could say could make her waver in her faith  as for lord arthur himself it took him days to get over his terrible disappointment and for a time his nerves were completely unstrung  his excellent common sense however soon asserted itself and his sound practical mind did not leave him long in doubt about what to do  poison having proved a complete failure dynamite or some other form of explosive was obviously the proper thing to try  he accordingly looked again over the list of his friends and relatives and after careful consideration determined to blow up his uncle the dean of chichester  the dean who was a man of great culture and learning was extremely fond of clocks and had a wonderful collection of timepieces ranging from the fifteenth century to the present day and it seemed to lord arthur that this hobby of the good deans offered him an excellent opportunity for carrying out his scheme  where to procure an explosive machine was of course quite another matter  the london directory gave him no information on the point and he felt that there was very little use in going to scotland yard about it as they never seemed to know anything about the movements of the dynamite faction till after an explosion had taken place and not much even then  suddenly he thought of his friend rouvaloff a young russian of very revolutionary tendencies whom he had met at lady windermeres in the winter  count rouvaloff was supposed to be writing a life of peter the great and to have come over to england for the purpose of studying the documents relating to that tsars residence in this country as a ship carpenter but it was generally suspected that he was a nihilist agent and there was no doubt that the russian embassy did not look with any favour upon his presence in london lord arthur felt that he was just the man for his purpose and drove down one morning to his lodgings in bloomsbury to ask his advice and assistance  so you are taking up politics seriously said count rouvaloff when lord arthur had told him the object of his mission but lord arthur who hated swagger of any kind felt bound to admit to him that he had not the slightest interest in social questions and simply wanted the explosive machine for a purely family matter in which no one was concerned but himself  count rouvaloff looked at him for some moments in amazement and then seeing that he was quite serious wrote an address on a piece of paper initialled it and handed it to him across the table  scotland yard would give a good deal to know this address my dear fellow  they shant have it cried lord arthur laughing and after shaking the young russian warmly by the hand he ran downstairs examined the paper and told the coachman to drive to soho square  there he dismissed him and strolled down greek street till he came to a place called bayles court  he passed under the archway and found himself in a curious culdesac that was apparently occupied by a french laundry as a perfect network of clotheslines was stretched across from house to house and there was a flutter of white linen in the morning air  he walked right to the end and knocked at a little green house  after some delay during which every window in the court became a blurred mass of peering faces the door was opened by a rather roughlooking foreigner who asked him in very bad english what his business was  lord arthur handed him the paper count rouvaloff had given him  when the man saw it he bowed and invited lord arthur into a very shabby front parlour on the ground floor and in a few moments herr winckelkopf as he was called in england bustled into the room with a very winestained napkin round his neck and a fork in his left hand  count rouvaloff has given me an introduction to you said lord arthur bowing and i am anxious to have a short interview with you on a matter of business  my name is smith mr robert smith and i want you to supply me with an explosive clock  charmed to meet you lord arthur said the genial little german laughing  dont look so alarmed it is my duty to know everybody and i remember seeing you one evening at lady windermeres  i hope her ladyship is quite well  do you mind sitting with me while i finish my breakfast  there is an excellent pate and my friends are kind enough to say that my rhine wine is better than any they get at the german embassy and before lord arthur had got over his surprise at being recognised he found himself seated in the back room sipping the most delicious marcobrunner out of a pale yellow hockglass marked with the imperial monogram and chatting in the friendliest manner possible to the famous conspirator  explosive clocks said herr winckelkopf are not very good things for foreign exportation as even if they succeed in passing the custom house the train service is so irregular that they usually go off before they have reached their proper destination  if however you want one for home use i can supply you with an excellent article and guarantee that you will he satisfied with the result  may i ask for whom it is intended  if it is for the police or for any one connected with scotland yard i am afraid i cannot do anything for you  the english detectives are really our best friends and i have always found that by relying on their stupidity we can do exactly what we like  i could not spare one of them  i assure you said lord arthur that it has nothing to do with the police at all  in fact the clock is intended for the dean of chichester  dear me  i had no idea that you felt so strongly about religion lord arthur  few young men do nowadays  i am afraid you overrate me herr winckelkopf said lord arthur blushing  the fact is i really know nothing about theology  it is a purely private matter then  purely private  herr winckelkopf shrugged his shoulders and left the room returning in a few minutes with a round cake of dynamite about the size of a penny and a pretty little french clock surmounted by an ormolu figure of liberty trampling on the hydra of despotism  lord arthurs face brightened up when he saw it  that is just what i want he cried and now tell me how it goes off  ah there is my secret answered herr winckelkopf contemplating his invention with a justifiable look of pride let me know when you wish it to explode and i will set the machine to the moment  well today is tuesday and if you could send it off at once  that is impossible i have a great deal of important work on hand for some friends of mine in moscow  still i might send it off to morrow  oh it will be quite time enough said lord arthur politely if it is delivered tomorrow night or thursday morning  for the moment of the explosion say friday at noon exactly  the dean is always at home at that hour  friday at noon repeated herr winckelkopf and he made a note to that effect in a large ledger that was lying on a bureau near the fireplace  and now said lord arthur rising from his seat pray let me know how much i am in your debt  it is such a small matter lord arthur that i do not care to make any charge  the dynamite comes to seven and sixpence the clock will be three pounds ten and the carriage about five shillings  i am only too pleased to oblige any friend of count rouvaloffs  but your trouble herr winckelkopf  oh that is nothing  it is a pleasure to me  i do not work for money i live entirely for my art  lord arthur laid down 4 pounds 2s 6d on the table thanked the little german for his kindness and having succeeded in declining an invitation to meet some anarchists at a meattea on the following saturday left the house and went off to the park  for the next two days he was in a state of the greatest excitement and on friday at twelve oclock he drove down to the buckingham to wait for news  all the afternoon the stolid hallporter kept posting up telegrams from various parts of the country giving the results of horseraces the verdicts in divorce suits the state of the weather and the like while the tape ticked out wearisome details about an allnight sitting in the house of commons and a small panic on the stock exchange  at four oclock the evening papers came in and lord arthur disappeared into the library with the pall mall the st jamess the globe and the echo to the immense indignation of colonel goodchild who wanted to read the reports of a speech he had delivered that morning at the mansion house on the subject of south african missions and the advisability of having black bishops in every province and for some reason or other had a strong prejudice against the evening news none of the papers however contained even the slightest allusion to chichester and lord arthur felt that the attempt must have failed  it was a terrible blow to him and for a time he was quite unnerved  herr winckelkopf whom he went to see the next day was full of elaborate apologies and offered to supply him with another clock free of charge or with a case of nitroglycerine bombs at cost price  but he had lost all faith in explosives and herr winckelkopf himself acknowledged that everything is so adulterated nowadays that even dynamite can hardly be got in a pure condition the little german however while admitting that something must have gone wrong with the machinery was not without hope that the clock might still go off and instanced the case of a barometer that he had once sent to the military governor at odessa which though timed to explode in ten days had not done so for something like three months  it was quite true that when it did go off it merely succeeded in blowing a housemaid to atoms the governor having gone out of town six weeks before but at least it showed that dynamite as a destructive force was when under the control of machinery a powerful though a somewhat unpunctual agent  lord arthur was a little consoled by this reflection but even here he was destined to disappointment for two days afterwards as he was going upstairs the duchess called him into her boudoir and showed him a letter she had just received from the deanery  jane writes charming letters said the duchess you must really read her last  it is quite as good as the novels mudie sends us  lord arthur seized the letter from her hand  it ran as follows   the deanery chichester 27th may  my dearest aunt  thank you so much for the flannel for the dorcas society and also for the gingham  i quite agree with you that it is nonsense their wanting to wear pretty things but everybody is so radical and irreligious nowadays that it is difficult to make them see that they should not try and dress like the upper classes  i am sure i dont know what we are coming to  as papa has often said in his sermons we live in an age of unbelief  we have had great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa last thursday  it arrived in a wooden box from london carriage paid and papa feels it must have been sent by some one who had read his remarkable sermon is licence liberty for on the top of the clock was a figure of a woman with what papa said was the cap of liberty on her head  i didnt think it very becoming myself but papa said it was historical so i suppose it is all right  parker unpacked it and papa put it on the mantelpiece in the library and we were all sitting there on friday morning when just as the clock struck twelve we heard a whirring noise a little puff of smoke came from the pedestal of the figure and the goddess of liberty fell off and broke her nose on the fender  maria was quite alarmed but it looked so ridiculous that james and i went off into fits of laughter and even papa was amused  when we examined it we found it was a sort of alarum clock and that if you set it to a particular hour and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer it went off whenever you wanted  papa said it must not remain in the library as it made a noise so reggie carried it away to the schoolroom and does nothing but have small explosions all day long  do you think arthur would like one for a wedding present i suppose they are quite fashionable in london  papa says they should do a great deal of good as they show that liberty cant last but must fall down  papa says liberty was invented at the time of the french revolution  how awful it seems  i have now to go to the dorcas where i will read them your most instructive letter  how true dear aunt your idea is that in their rank of life they should wear what is unbecoming  i must say it is absurd their anxiety about dress when there are so many more important things in this world and in the next  i am so glad your flowered poplin turned out so well and that your lace was not torn i am wearing my yellow satin that you so kindly gave me at the bishops on wednesday and think it will look all right  would you have bows or not  jennings says that every one wears bows now and that the underskirt should be frilled  reggie has just had another explosion and papa has ordered the clock to be sent to the stables i dont think papa likes it so much as he did at first though he is very flattered at being sent such a pretty and ingenious toy  it shows that people read his sermons and profit by them  papa sends his love in which james and reggie and maria all unite and hoping that uncle cecils gout is better believe me dear aunt ever your affectionate niece  jane percy  psdo tell me about the bows  jennings insists they are the fashion   lord arthur looked so serious and unhappy over the letter that the duchess went into fits of laughter  my dear arthur she cried i shall never show you a young ladys letter again  but what shall i say about the clock  i think it is a capital invention and i should like to have one myself  i dont think much of them said lord arthur with a sad smile and after kissing his mother he left the room  when he got upstairs he flung himself on a sofa and his eyes filled with tears  he had done his best to commit this murder but on both occasions he had failed and through no fault of his own he had tried to do his duty but it seemed as if destiny herself had turned traitor  he was oppressed with the sense of the barrenness of good intentions of the futility of trying to be fine  perhaps it would be better to break off the marriage altogether  sybil would suffer it is true but suffering could not really mar a nature so noble as hers  as for himself what did it matter  there is always some war in which a man can die some cause to which a man can give his life and as life had no pleasure for him so death had no terror  let destiny work out his doom  he would not stir to help her  at halfpast seven he dressed and went down to the club  surbiton was there with a party of young men and he was obliged to dine with them  their trivial conversation and idle jests did not interest him and as soon as coffee was brought he left them inventing some engagement in order to get away  as he was going out of the club the hallporter handed him a letter  it was from herr winckelkopf asking him to call down the next evening and look at an explosive umbrella that went off as soon as it was opened  it was the very latest invention and had just arrived from geneva  he tore the letter up into fragments  he had made up his mind not to try any more experiments  then he wandered down to the thames embankment and sat for hours by the river  the moon peered through a mane of tawny clouds as if it were a lions eye and innumerable stars spangled the hollow vault like gold dust powdered on a purple dome now and then a barge swung out into the turbid stream and floated away with the tide and the railway signals changed from green to scarlet as the trains ran shrieking across the bridge  after some time twelve oclock boomed from the tall tower at westminster and at each stroke of the sonorous bell the night seemed to tremble then the railway lights went out one solitary lamp left gleaming like a large ruby on a giant mast and the roar of the city became fainter  at two oclock he got up and strolled towards blackfriars  how unreal everything looked  how like a strange dream  the houses on the other side of the river seemed built out of darkness  one would have said that silver and shadow had fashioned the world anew  the huge dome of st pauls loomed like a bubble through the dusky air  as he approached cleopatras needle he saw a man leaning over the parapet and as he came nearer the man looked up the gaslight falling full upon his face  it was mr podgers the cheiromantist  no one could mistake the fat flabby face the goldrimmed spectacles the sickly feeble smile the sensual mouth  lord arthur stopped  a brilliant idea flashed across him and he stole softly up behind  in a moment he had seized mr podgers by the legs and flung him into the thames  there was a coarse oath a heavy splash and all was still  lord arthur looked anxiously over but could see nothing of the cheiromantist but a tall hat pirouetting in an eddy of moonlit water  after a time it also sank and no trace of mr podgers was visible  once he thought that he caught sight of the bulky misshapen figure striking out for the staircase by the bridge and a horrible feeling of failure came over him but it turned out to be merely a reflection and when the moon shone out from behind a cloud it passed away  at last he seemed to have realised the decree of destiny  he heaved a deep sigh of relief and sybils name came to his lips  have you dropped anything sir said a voice behind him suddenly  he turned round and saw a policeman with a bullseye lantern  nothing of importance sergeant he answered smiling and hailing a passing hansom he jumped in and told the man to drive to belgrave square  for the next few days he alternated between hope and fear  there were moments when he almost expected mr podgers to walk into the room and yet at other times he felt that fate could not be so unjust to him  twice he went to the cheiromantists address in west moon street but he could not bring himself to ring the bell  he longed for certainty and was afraid of it  finally it came  he was sitting in the smokingroom of the club having tea and listening rather wearily to surbitons account of the last comic song at the gaiety when the waiter came in with the evening papers  he took up the st jamess and was listlessly turning over its pages when this strange heading caught his eye   suicide of a cheiromantist   he turned pale with excitement and began to read  the paragraph ran as follows  yesterday morning at seven oclock the body of mr septimus r podgers the eminent cheiromantist was washed on shore at greenwich just in front of the ship hotel  the unfortunate gentleman had been missing for some days and considerable anxiety for his safety had been felt in cheiromantic circles  it is supposed that he committed suicide under the influence of a temporary mental derangement caused by overwork and a verdict to that effect was returned this afternoon by the coroners jury  mr podgers had just completed an elaborate treatise on the subject of the human hand that will shortly be published when it will no doubt attract much attention  the deceased was sixtyfive years of age and does not seem to have left any relations  lord arthur rushed out of the club with the paper still in his hand to the immense amazement of the hallporter who tried in vain to stop him and drove at once to park lane  sybil saw him from the window and something told her that he was the bearer of good news she ran down to meet him and when she saw his face she knew that all was well  my dear sybil cried lord arthur let us be married tomorrow  you foolish boy  why the cake is not even ordered said sybil laughing through her tears    chapter vi    when the wedding took place some three weeks later st peters was crowded with a perfect mob of smart people  the service was read in the most impressive manner by the dean of chichester and everybody agreed that they had never seen a handsomer couple than the bride and bridegroom  they were more than handsome howeverthey were happy  never for a single moment did lord arthur regret all that he had suffered for sybils sake while she on her side gave him the best things a woman can give to any manworship tenderness and love  for them romance was not killed by reality  they always felt young  some years afterwards when two beautiful children had been born to them lady windermere came down on a visit to alton priory a lovely old place that had been the dukes wedding present to his son and one afternoon as she was sitting with lady arthur under a limetree in the garden watching the little boy and girl as they played up and down the rosewalk like fitful sunbeams she suddenly took her hostesss hand in hers and said are you happy sybil  dear lady windermere of course i am happy  arent you  i have no time to be happy sybil  i always like the last person who is introduced to me but as a rule as soon as i know people i get tired of them  dont your lions satisfy you lady windermere  oh dear no lions are only good for one season  as soon as their manes are cut they are the dullest creatures going  besides they behave very badly if you are really nice to them  do you remember that horrid mr podgers  he was a dreadful impostor  of course i didnt mind that at all and even when he wanted to borrow money i forgave him but i could not stand his making love to me  he has really made me hate cheiromancy  i go in for telepathy now  it is much more amusing  you mustnt say anything against cheiromancy here lady windermere it is the only subject that arthur does not like people to chaff about  i assure you he is quite serious over it  you dont mean to say that he believes in it sybil  ask him lady windermere here he is and lord arthur came up the garden with a large bunch of yellow roses in his hand and his two children dancing round him  lord arthur  yes lady windermere  you dont mean to say that you believe in cheiromancy  of course i do said the young man smiling  but why  because i owe to it all the happiness of my life he murmured throwing himself into a wicker chair  my dear lord arthur what do you owe to it  sybil he answered handing his wife the roses and looking into her violet eyes  what nonsense cried lady windermere  i never heard such nonsense in all my life     the canterville ghost     chapter i    when mr hiram b otis the american minister bought canterville chase every one told him he was doing a very foolish thing as there was no doubt at all that the place was haunted  indeed lord canterville himself who was a man of the most punctilious honour had felt it his duty to mention the fact to mr otis when they came to discuss terms  we have not cared to live in the place ourselves said lord canterville since my grandaunt the dowager duchess of bolton was frightened into a fit from which she never really recovered by two skeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for dinner and i feel bound to tell you mr otis that the ghost has been seen by several living members of my family as well as by the rector of the parish the rev augustus dampier who is a fellow of kings college cambridge  after the unfortunate accident to the duchess none of our younger servants would stay with us and lady canterville often got very little sleep at night in consequence of the mysterious noises that came from the corridor and the library  my lord answered the minister i will take the furniture and the ghost at a valuation  i come from a modern country where we have everything that money can buy and with all our spry young fellows painting the old world red and carrying off your best actresses and primadonnas i reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in europe wed have it at home in a very short time in one of our public museums or on the road as a show  i fear that the ghost exists said lord canterville smiling though it may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios  it has been well known for three centuries since 1584 in fact and always makes its appearance before the death of any member of our family  well so does the family doctor for that matter lord canterville but there is no such thing sir as a ghost and i guess the laws of nature are not going to be suspended for the british aristocracy  you are certainly very natural in america answered lord canterville who did not quite understand mr otiss last observation and if you dont mind a ghost in the house it is all right  only you must remember i warned you  a few weeks after this the purchase was completed and at the close of the season the minister and his family went down to canterville chase  mrs otis who as miss lucretia r tappan of west 53rd street had been a celebrated new york belle was now a very handsome middleaged woman with fine eyes and a superb profile many american ladies on leaving their native land adopt an appearance of chronic illhealth under the impression that it is a form of european refinement but mrs otis had never fallen into this error  she had a magnificent constitution and a really wonderful amount of animal spirits  indeed in many respects she was quite english and was an excellent example of the fact that we have really everything in common with america nowadays except of course language  her eldest son christened washington by his parents in a moment of patriotism which he never ceased to regret was a fairhaired rather goodlooking young man who had qualified himself for american diplomacy by leading the german at the newport casino for three successive seasons and even in london was well known as an excellent dancer  gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses  otherwise he was extremely sensible  miss virginia e otis was a little girl of fifteen lithe and lovely as a fawn and with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes  she was a wonderful amazon and had once raced old lord bilton on her pony twice round the park winning by a length and a half just in front of the achilles statue to the huge delight of the young duke of cheshire who proposed for her on the spot and was sent back to eton that very night by his guardians in floods of tears  after virginia came the twins who were usually called the stars and stripes as they were always getting swished  they were delightful boys and with the exception of the worthy minister the only true republicans of the family  as canterville chase is seven miles from ascot the nearest railway station mr otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them and they started on their drive in high spirits  it was a lovely july evening and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods now and then they heard a wood pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice or saw deep in the rustling fern the burnished breast of the pheasant  little squirrels peered at them from the beechtrees as they went by and the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy knolls with their white tails in the air  as they entered the avenue of canterville chase however the sky became suddenly overcast with clouds a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere a great flight of rooks passed silently over their heads and before they reached the house some big drops of rain had fallen  standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman neatly dressed in black silk with a white cap and apron  this was mrs umney the housekeeper whom mrs otis at lady cantervilles earnest request had consented to keep on in her former position she made them each a low curtsey as they alighted and said in a quaint oldfashioned manner i bid you welcome to canterville chase  following her they passed through the fine tudor hall into the library a long low room panelled in black oak at the end of which was a large stainedglass window  here they found tea laid out for them and after taking off their wraps they sat down and began to look round while mrs umney waited on them  suddenly mrs otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by the fireplace and quite unconscious of what it really signified said to mrs umney i am afraid something has been spilt there  yes madam replied the old housekeeper in a low voice blood has been spilt on that spot  how horrid cried mrs otis i dont at all care for bloodstains in a sittingroom  it must be removed at once  the old woman smiled and answered in the same low mysterious voice it is the blood of lady eleanore de canterville who was murdered on that very spot by her own husband sir simon de canterville in 1575  sir simon survived her nine years and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances  his body has never been discovered but his guilty spirit still haunts the chase  the bloodstain has been much admired by tourists and others and cannot be removed  that is all nonsense cried washington otis pinkertons champion stain remover and paragon detergent will clean it up in no time and before the terrified housekeeper could interfere he had fallen upon his knees and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what looked like a black cosmetic  in a few moments no trace of the bloodstain could be seen  i knew pinkerton would do it he exclaimed triumphantly as he looked round at his admiring family but no sooner had he said these words than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room a fearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet and mrs umney fainted  what a monstrous climate said the american minister calmly as he lit a long cheroot  i guess the old country is so overpopulated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody  i have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for england  my dear hiram cried mrs otis what can we do with a woman who faints  charge it to her like breakages answered the minister she wont faint after that and in a few moments mrs umney certainly came to  there was no doubt however that she was extremely upset and she sternly warned mr otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house  i have seen things with my own eyes sir she said that would make any christians hair stand on end and many and many a night i have not closed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here  mr otis however and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they were not afraid of ghosts and after invoking the blessings of providence on her new master and mistress and making arrangements for an increase of salary the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room    chapter ii    the storm raged fiercely all that night but nothing of particular note occurred  the next morning however when they came down to breakfast they found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor  i dont think it can be the fault of the paragon detergent said washington for i have tried it with everything it must be the ghost  he accordingly rubbed out the stain a second time but the second morning it appeared again  the third morning also it was there though the library had been locked up at night by mr otis himself and the key carried upstairs  the whole family were now quite interested mr otis began to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the existence of ghosts mrs otis expressed her intention of joining the psychical society and washington prepared a long letter to messrs myers and podmore on the subject of the permanence of sanguineous stains when connected with crime  that night all doubts about the objective existence of phantasmata were removed for ever  the day had been warm and sunny and in the cool of the evening the whole family went out for a drive  they did not return home till nine oclock when they had a light supper  the conversation in no way turned upon ghosts so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectation which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena  the subjects discussed as i have since learned from mr otis were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of cultured americans of the better class such as the immense superiority of miss fanny davenport over sarah bernhardt as an actress the difficulty of obtaining green corn buckwheat cakes and hominy even in the best english houses the importance of boston in the development of the worldsoul the advantages of the baggage check system in railway travelling and the sweetness of the new york accent as compared to the london drawl  no mention at all was made of the supernatural nor was sir simon de canterville alluded to in any way  at eleven oclock the family retired and by halfpast all the lights were out  some time after mr otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor outside his room  it sounded like the clank of metal and seemed to be coming nearer every moment  he got up at once struck a match and looked at the time  it was exactly one oclock  he was quite calm and felt his pulse which was not at all feverish  the strange noise still continued and with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps  he put on his slippers took a small oblong phial out of his dressingcase and opened the door  right in front of him he saw in the wan moonlight an old man of terrible aspect his eyes were as red burning coals long grey hair fell over his shoulders in matted coils his garments which were of antique cut were soiled and ragged and from his wrists and ankles hung heavy manacles and rusty gyves  my dear sir said mr otis i really must insist on your oiling those chains and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the tammany rising sun lubricator  it is said to be completely efficacious upon one application and there are several testimonials to that effect on the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines  i shall leave it here for you by the bedroom candles and will be happy to supply you with more should you require it  with these words the united states minister laid the bottle down on a marble table and closing his door retired to rest  for a moment the canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural indignation then dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor he fled down the corridor uttering hollow groans and emitting a ghastly green light  just however as he reached the top of the great oak staircase a door was flung open two little whiterobed figures appeared and a large pillow whizzed past his head  there was evidently no time to be lost so hastily adopting the fourth dimension of space as a means of escape he vanished through the wainscoting and the house became quite quiet  on reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing he leaned up against a moonbeam to recover his breath and began to try and realise his position  never in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three hundred years had he been so grossly insulted  he thought of the dowager duchess whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before the glass in her lace and diamonds of the four housemaids who had gone off into hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains of one of the spare bedrooms of the rector of the parish whose candle he had blown out as he was coming late one night from the library and who had been under the care of sir william gull ever since a perfect martyr to nervous disorders and of old madame de tremouillac who having wakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair by the fire reading her diary had been confined to her bed for six weeks with an attack of brain fever and on her recovery had become reconciled to the church and broken off her connection with that notorious sceptic monsieur de voltaire  he remembered the terrible night when the wicked lord canterville was found choking in his dressingroom with the knave of diamonds halfway down his throat and confessed just before he died that he had cheated charles james fox out of 50000 pounds at crockfords by means of that very card and swore that the ghost had made him swallow it  all his great achievements came back to him again from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because he had seen a green hand tapping at the window pane to the beautiful lady stutfield who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round her throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin and who drowned herself at last in the carp pond at the end of the kings walk  with the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist he went over his most celebrated performances and smiled bitterly to himself as he recalled to mind his last appearance as red ruben or the strangled babe his debut as gaunt gibeon the bloodsucker of bexley moor and the furore he had excited one lovely june evening by merely playing ninepins with his own bones upon the lawntennis ground  and after all this some wretched modern americans were to come and offer him the rising sun lubricator and throw pillows at his head  it was quite unbearable besides no ghosts in history had ever been treated in this manner accordingly he determined to have vengeance and remained till daylight in an attitude of deep thought    chapter iii    the next morning when the otis family met at breakfast they discussed the ghost at some length  the united states minister was naturally a little annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted  i have no wish he said to do the ghost any personal injury and i must say that considering the length of time he has been in the house i dont think it is at all polite to throw pillows at hima very just remark at which i am sorry to say the twins burst into shouts of laughter  upon the other hand he continued if he really declines to use the rising sun lubricator we shall have to take his chains from him  it would be quite impossible to sleep with such a noise going on outside the bedrooms  for the rest of the week however they were undisturbed the only thing that excited any attention being the continual renewal of the bloodstain on the library floor  this certainly was very strange as the door was always locked at night by mr otis and the windows kept closely barred  the chameleonlike colour also of the stain excited a good deal of comment  some mornings it was a dull almost indian red then it would be vermilion then a rich purple and once when they came down for family prayers according to the simple rites of the free american reformed episcopalian church they found it a bright emeraldgreen  these kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party very much and bets on the subject were freely made every evening  the only person who did not enter into the joke was little virginia who for some unexplained reason was always a good deal distressed at the sight of the bloodstain and very nearly cried the morning it was emeraldgreen  the second appearance of the ghost was on sunday night  shortly after they had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the hall  rushing downstairs they found that a large suit of old armour had become detached from its stand and had fallen on the stone floor while seated in a highbacked chair was the canterville ghost rubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face  the twins having brought their peashooters with them at once discharged two pellets on him with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained by long and careful practice on a writingmaster while the united states minister covered him with his revolver and called upon him in accordance with californian etiquette to hold up his hands  the ghost started up with a wild shriek of rage and swept through them like a mist extinguishing washington otiss candle as he passed and so leaving them all in total darkness  on reaching the top of the staircase he recovered himself and determined to give his celebrated peal of demoniac laughter  this he had on more than one occasion found extremely useful  it was said to have turned lord rakers wig grey in a single night and had certainly made three of lady cantervilles french governesses give warning before their month was up  he accordingly laughed his most horrible laugh till the old vaulted roof rang and rang again but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door opened and mrs otis came out in a light blue dressing gown  i am afraid you are far from well she said and have brought you a bottle of dr dobells tincture  if it is indigestion you will find it a most excellent remedy  the ghost glared at her in fury and began at once to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog an accomplishment for which he was justly renowned and to which the family doctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of lord cantervilles uncle the hon thomas horton  the sound of approaching footsteps however made him hesitate in his fell purpose so he contented himself with becoming faintly phosphorescent and vanished with a deep churchyard groan just as the twins had come up to him  on reaching his room he entirely broke down and became a prey to the most violent agitation  the vulgarity of the twins and the gross materialism of mrs otis were naturally extremely annoying but what really distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit of mail  he had hoped that even modern americans would be thrilled by the sight of a spectre in armour if for no more sensible reason at least out of respect for their national poet longfellow over whose graceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary hour when the cantervilles were up in town  besides it was his own suit  he had worn it with great success at the kenilworth tournament and had been highly complimented on it by no less a person than the virgin queen herself  yet when he had put it on he had been completely overpowered by the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque and had fallen heavily on the stone pavement barking both his knees severely and bruising the knuckles of his right hand  for some days after this he was extremely ill and hardly stirred out of his room at all except to keep the bloodstain in proper repair  however by taking great care of himself he recovered and resolved to make a third attempt to frighten the united states minister and his family  he selected friday the 17th of august for his appearance and spent most of that day in looking over his wardrobe ultimately deciding in favour of a large slouched hat with a red feather a windingsheet frilled at the wrists and neck and a rusty dagger  towards evening a violent storm of rain came on and the wind was so high that all the windows and doors in the old house shook and rattled  in fact it was just such weather as he loved his plan of action was this  he was to make his way quietly to washington otiss room gibber at him from the foot of the bed and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound of slow music he bore washington a special grudge being quite aware that it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous canterville blood stain by means of pinkertons paragon detergent  having reduced the reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror he was then to proceed to the room occupied by the united states minister and his wife and there to place a clammy hand on mrs otiss forehead while he hissed into her trembling husbands ear the awful secrets of the charnelhouse  with regard to little virginia he had not quite made up his mind  she had never insulted him in any way and was pretty and gentle  a few hollow groans from the wardrobe he thought would be more than sufficient or if that failed to wake her he might grabble at the counterpane with palsy twitching fingers  as for the twins he was quite determined to teach them a lesson  the first thing to be done was of course to sit upon their chests so as to produce the stifling sensation of nightmare  then as their beds were quite close to each other to stand between them in the form of a green icycold corpse till they became paralysed with fear and finally to throw off the windingsheet and crawl round the room with white bleached bones and one rolling eyeball in the character of dumb daniel or the suicides skeleton a role in which he had on more than one occasion produced a great effect and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of martin the maniac or the masked mystery  at halfpast ten he heard the family going to bed  for some time he was disturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins who with the lighthearted gaiety of schoolboys were evidently amusing themselves before they retired to rest but at a quarter past eleven all was still and as midnight sounded he sallied forth  the owl beat against the window panes the raven croaked from the old yew tree and the wind wandered moaning round the house like a lost soul but the otis family slept unconscious of their doom and high above the rain and storm he could hear the steady snoring of the minister for the united states  he stepped stealthily out of the wainscoting with an evil smile on his cruel wrinkled mouth and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole past the great oriel window where his own arms and those of his murdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold  on and on he glided like an evil shadow the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed  once he thought he heard something call and stopped but it was only the baying of a dog from the red farm and he went on muttering strange sixteenthcentury curses and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger in the midnight air  finally he reached the corner of the passage that led to luckless washingtons room  for a moment he paused there the wind blowing his long grey locks about his head and twisting into grotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead mans shroud  then the clock struck the quarter and he felt the time was come  he chuckled to himself and turned the corner but no sooner had he done so than with a piteous wail of terror he fell back and hid his blanched face in his long bony hands  right in front of him was standing a horrible spectre motionless as a carven image and monstrous as a madmans dream its head was bald and burnished its face round and fat and white and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its features into an eternal grin  from the eyes streamed rays of scarlet light the mouth was a wide well of fire and a hideous garment like to his own swathed with its silent snows the titan form  on its breast was a placard with strange writing in antique characters some scroll of shame it seemed some record of wild sins some awful calendar of crime and with its right hand it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel  never having seen a ghost before he naturally was terribly frightened and after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom he fled back to his room tripping up in his long windingsheet as he sped down the corridor and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the ministers jackboots where it was found in the morning by the butler  once in the privacy of his own apartment he flung himself down on a small palletbed and hid his face under the clothes  after a time however the brave old canterville spirit asserted itself and he determined to go and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight  accordingly just as the dawn was touching the hills with silver he returned towards the spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom feeling that after all two ghosts were better than one and that by the aid of his new friend he might safely grapple with the twins  on reaching the spot however a terrible sight met his gaze  something had evidently happened to the spectre for the light had entirely faded from its hollow eyes the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand and it was leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude  he rushed forward and seized it in his arms when to his horror the head slipped off and rolled on the floor the body assumed a recumbent posture and he found himself clasping a white dimity bedcurtain with a sweepingbrush a kitchen cleaver and a hollow turnip lying at his feet  unable to understand this curious transformation he clutched the placard with feverish haste and there in the grey morning light he read these fearful words   ye olde ghoste  ye onlie true and originale spook beware of ye imitationes all others are counterfeite   the whole thing flashed across him  he had been tricked foiled and outwitted  the old canterville look came into his eyes he ground his toothless gums together and raising his withered hands high above his head swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique school that when chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn deeds of blood would be wrought and murder walk abroad with silent feet  hardly had he finished this awful oath when from the redtiled roof of a distant homestead a cock crew  he laughed a long low bitter laugh and waited  hour after hour he waited but the cock for some strange reason did not crow again  finally at halfpast seven the arrival of the housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil and he stalked back to his room thinking of his vain hope and baffled purpose  there he consulted several books of ancient chivalry of which he was exceedingly fond and found that on every occasion on which his oath had been used chanticleer had always crowed a second time  perdition seize the naughty fowl he muttered i have seen the day when with my stout spear i would have run him through the gorge and made him crow for me an twere in death  he then retired to a comfortable lead coffin and stayed there till evening    chapter iv    the next day the ghost was very weak and tired  the terrible excitement of the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect his nerves were completely shattered and he started at the slightest noise  for five days he kept his room and at last made up his mind to give up the point of the bloodstain on the library floor  if the otis family did not want it they clearly did not deserve it  they were evidently people on a low material plane of existence and quite incapable of appreciating the symbolic value of sensuous phenomena  the question of phantasmic apparitions and the development of astral bodies was of course quite a different matter and really not under his control  it was his solemn duty to appear in the corridor once a week and to gibber from the large oriel window on the first and third wednesday in every month and he did not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations  it is quite true that his life had been very evil but upon the other hand he was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural  for the next three saturdays accordingly he traversed the corridor as usual between midnight and three oclock taking every possible precaution against being either heard or seen he removed his boots trod as lightly as possible on the old worm eaten boards wore a large black velvet cloak and was careful to use the rising sun lubricator for oiling his chains  i am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good deal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of protection  however one night while the family were at dinner he slipped into mr otiss bedroom and carried off the bottle  he felt a little humiliated at first but afterwards was sensible enough to see that there was a great deal to be said for the invention and to a certain degree it served his purpose  still in spite of everything he was not left unmolested  strings were continually being stretched across the corridor over which he tripped in the dark and on one occasion while dressed for the part of black isaac or the huntsman of hogley woods he met with a severe fall through treading on a butterslide which the twins had constructed from the entrance of the tapestry chamber to the top of the oak staircase this last insult so enraged him that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and social position and determined to visit the insolent young etonians the next night in his celebrated character of reckless rupert or the headless earl  he had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years in fact not since he had so frightened pretty lady barbara modish by means of it that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present lord cantervilles grandfather and ran away to gretna green with handsome jack castleton declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at twilight  poor jack was afterwards shot in a duel by lord canterville on wandsworth common and lady barbara died of a broken heart at tunbridge wells before the year was out so in every way it had been a great success  it was however an extremely difficult makeup if i may use such a theatrical expression in connection with one of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural or to employ a more scientific term the highernatural world and it took him fully three hours to make his preparations  at last everything was ready and he was very pleased with his appearance  the big leather ridingboots that went with the dress were just a little too large for him and he could only find one of the two horsepistols but on the whole he was quite satisfied and at a quarter past one he glided out of the wainscoting and crept down the corridor  on reaching the room occupied by the twins which i should mention was called the blue bed chamber on account of the colour of its hangings he found the door just ajar  wishing to make an effective entrance he flung it wide open when a heavy jug of water fell right down on him wetting him to the skin and just missing his left shoulder by a couple of inches  at the same moment he heard stifled shrieks of laughter proceeding from the fourpost bed  the shock to his nervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he could go and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold  the only thing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he had not brought his head with him for had he done so the consequences might have been very serious  he now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude american family and contented himself as a rule with creeping about the passages in list slippers with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of draughts and a small arquebuse in case he should be attacked by the twins  the final blow he received occurred on the 19th of september  he had gone downstairs to the great entrance hall feeling sure that there at any rate he would be quite unmolested and was amusing himself by making satirical remarks on the large saroni photographs of the united states minister and his wife which had now taken the place of the canterville family pictures  he was simply but neatly clad in a long shroud spotted with churchyard mould had tied up his jaw with a strip of yellow linen and carried a small lantern and a sextons spade  in fact he was dressed for the character of jonas the graveless or the corpsesnatcher of chertsey barn one of his most remarkable impersonations and one which the cantervilles had every reason to remember as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their neighbour lord rufford  it was about a quarter past two oclock in the morning and as far as he could ascertain no one was stirring as he was strolling towards the library however to see if there were any traces left of the bloodstain suddenly there leaped out on him from a dark corner two figures who waved their arms wildly above their heads and shrieked out boo in his ear  seized with a panic which under the circumstances was only natural he rushed for the staircase but found washington otis waiting for him there with the big gardensyringe and being thus hemmed in by his enemies on every side and driven almost to bay he vanished into the great iron stove which fortunately for him was not lit and had to make his way home through the flues and chimneys arriving at his own room in a terrible state of dirt disorder and despair  after this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition  the twins lay in wait for him on several occasions and strewed the passages with nutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the servants but it was of no avail  it was quite evident that his feelings were so wounded that he would not appear mr otis consequently resumed his great work on the history of the democratic party on which he had been engaged for some years mrs otis organised a wonderful clambake which amazed the whole county the boys took to lacrosse euchre poker and other american national games and virginia rode about the lanes on her pony accompanied by the young duke of cheshire who had come to spend the last week of his holidays at canterville chase  it was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away and in fact mr otis wrote a letter to that effect to lord canterville who in reply expressed his great pleasure at the news and sent his best congratulations to the ministers worthy wife  the otises however were deceived for the ghost was still in the house and though now almost an invalid was by no means ready to let matters rest particularly as he heard that among the guests was the young duke of cheshire whose granduncle lord francis stilton had once bet a hundred guineas with colonel carbury that he would play dice with the canterville ghost and was found the next morning lying on the floor of the cardroom in such a helpless paralytic state that though he lived on to a great age he was never able to say anything again but double sixes  the story was well known at the time though of course out of respect to the feelings of the two noble families every attempt was made to hush it up and a full account of all the circumstances connected with it will be found in the third volume of lord tattles recollections of the prince regent and his friends  the ghost then was naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence over the stiltons with whom indeed he was distantly connected his own first cousin having been married en secondes noces to the sieur de bulkeley from whom as every one knows the dukes of cheshire are lineally descended  accordingly he made arrangements for appearing to virginias little lover in his celebrated impersonation of the vampire monk or the bloodless benedictine a performance so horrible that when old lady startup saw it which she did on one fatal new years eve in the year 1764 she went off into the most piercing shrieks which culminated in violent apoplexy and died in three days after disinheriting the cantervilles who were her nearest relations and leaving all her money to her london apothecary  at the last moment however his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room and the little duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the royal bedchamber and dreamed of virginia    chapter v    a few days after this virginia and her curlyhaired cavalier went out riding on brockley meadows where she tore her habit so badly in getting through a hedge that on her return home she made up her mind to go up by the back staircase so as not to be seen  as she was running past the tapestry chamber the door of which happened to be open she fancied she saw some one inside and thinking it was her mothers maid who sometimes used to bring her work there looked in to ask her to mend her habit  to her immense surprise however it was the canterville ghost himself  he was sitting by the window watching the ruined gold of the yellowing trees fly through the air and the red leaves dancing madly down the long avenue  his head was leaning on his hand and his whole attitude was one of extreme depression  indeed so forlorn and so much out of repair did he look that little virginia whose first idea had been to run away and lock herself in her room was filled with pity and determined to try and comfort him  so light was her footfall and so deep his melancholy that he was not aware of her presence till she spoke to him  i am so sorry for you she said but my brothers are going back to eton tomorrow and then if you behave yourself no one will annoy you  it is absurd asking me to behave myself he answered looking round in astonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him quite absurd  i must rattle my chains and groan through keyholes and walk about at night if that is what you mean it is my only reason for existing  it is no reason at all for existing and you know you have been very wicked  mrs umney told us the first day we arrived here that you had killed your wife  well i quite admit it said the ghost petulantly but it was a purely family matter and concerned no one else  it is very wrong to kill any one said virginia who at times had a sweet puritan gravity caught from some old new england ancestor  oh i hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics  my wife was very plain never had my ruffs properly starched and knew nothing about cookery  why there was a buck i had shot in hogley woods a magnificent pricket and do you know how she had it sent up to table  however it is no matter now for it is all over and i dont think it was very nice of her brothers to starve me to death though i did kill her  starve you to death  oh mr ghost i mean sir simon are you hungry  i have a sandwich in my case  would you like it  no thank you i never eat anything now but it is very kind of you all the same and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid rude vulgar dishonest family  stop cried virginia stamping her foot it is you who are rude and horrid and vulgar and as for dishonesty you know you stole the paints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous bloodstain in the library  first you took all my reds including the vermilion and i couldnt do any more sunsets then you took the emeraldgreen and the chromeyellow and finally i had nothing left but indigo and chinese white and could only do moonlight scenes which are always depressing to look at and not at all easy to paint  i never told on you though i was very much annoyed and it was most ridiculous the whole thing for who ever heard of emerald green blood  well really said the ghost rather meekly what was i to do it is a very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays and as your brother began it all with his paragon detergent i certainly saw no reason why i should not have your paints  as for colour that is always a matter of taste  the cantervilles have blue blood for instance the very bluest in england but i know you americans dont care for things of this kind  you know nothing about it and the best thing you can do is to emigrate and improve your mind  my father will be only too happy to give you a free passage and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind there will be no difficulty about the custom house as the officers are all democrats  once in new york you are sure to be a great success  i know lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to have a grandfather and much more than that to have a family ghost  i dont think i should like america  i suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities said virginia satirically  no ruins no curiosities answered the ghost you have your navy and your manners  good evening i will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra weeks holiday  please dont go miss virginia he cried i am so lonely and so unhappy and i really dont know what to do  i want to go to sleep and i cannot  thats quite absurd  you have merely to go to bed and blow out the candle  it is very difficult sometimes to keep awake especially at church but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping  why even babies know how to do that and they are not very clever  i have not slept for three hundred years he said sadly and virginias beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder for three hundred years i have not slept and i am so tired  virginia grew quite grave and her little lips trembled like rose leaves  she came towards him and kneeling down at his side looked up into his old withered face  poor poor ghost she murmured have you no place where you can sleep  far away beyond the pinewoods he answered in a low dreamy voice there is a little garden  there the grass grows long and deep there are the great white stars of the hemlock flower there the nightingale sings all night long  all night long he sings and the cold crystal moon looks down and the yewtree spreads out its giant arms over the sleepers  virginias eyes grew dim with tears and she hid her face in her hands  you mean the garden of death she whispered  yes death  death must be so beautiful  to lie in the soft brown earth with the grasses waving above ones head and listen to silence  to have no yesterday and no tomorrow  to forget time to forgive life to be at peace  you can help me  you can open for me the portals of deaths house for love is always with you and love is stronger than death is  virginia trembled a cold shudder ran through her and for a few moments there was silence  she felt as if she was in a terrible dream  then the ghost spoke again and his voice sounded like the sighing of the wind  have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window  oh often cried the little girl looking up i know it quite well  it is painted in curious black letters and it is difficult to read  there are only six lines   when a golden girl can win prayer from out the lips of sin when the barren almond bears and a little child gives away its tears then shall all the house be still and peace come to canterville   but i dont know what they mean  they mean he said sadly that you must weep for me for my sins because i have no tears and pray with me for my soul because i have no faith and then if you have always been sweet and good and gentle the angel of death will have mercy on me  you will see fearful shapes in darkness and wicked voices will whisper in your ear but they will not harm you for against the purity of a little child the powers of hell cannot prevail  virginia made no answer and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as he looked down at her bowed golden head  suddenly she stood up very pale and with a strange light in her eyes  i am not afraid she said firmly and i will ask the angel to have mercy on you  he rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy and taking her hand bent over it with oldfashioned grace and kissed it  his fingers were as cold as ice and his lips burned like fire but virginia did not falter as he led her across the dusky room  on the faded green tapestry were broidered little huntsmen  they blew their tasselled horns and with their tiny hands waved to her to go back  go back little virginia they cried go back but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly and she shut her eyes against them  horrible animals with lizard tails and goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece and murmured beware little virginia beware we may never see you again but the ghost glided on more swiftly and virginia did not listen  when they reached the end of the room he stopped and muttered some words she could not understand  she opened her eyes and saw the wall slowly fading away like a mist and a great black cavern in front of her  a bitter cold wind swept round them and she felt something pulling at her dress  quick quick cried the ghost or it will be too late and in a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them and the tapestry chamber was empty    chapter vi    about ten minutes later the bell rang for tea and as virginia did not come down mrs otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her after a little time he returned and said that he could not find miss virginia anywhere  as she was in the habit of going out to the garden every evening to get flowers for the dinnertable mrs otis was not at all alarmed at first but when six oclock struck and virginia did not appear she became really agitated and sent the boys out to look for her while she herself and mr otis searched every room in the house  at halfpast six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace of their sister anywhere  they were all now in the greatest state of excitement and did not know what to do when mr otis suddenly remembered that some few days before he had given a band of gypsies permission to camp in the park  he accordingly at once set off for blackfell hollow where he knew they were accompanied by his eldest son and two of the farm servants  the little duke of cheshire who was perfectly frantic with anxiety begged hard to be allowed to go too but mr otis would not allow him as he was afraid there might be a scuffle  on arriving at the spot however he found that the gypsies had gone and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden as the fire was still burning and some plates were lying on the grass having sent off washington and the two men to scour the district he ran home and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the county telling them to look out for a little girl who had been kidnapped by tramps or gypsies  he then ordered his horse to be brought round and after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down to dinner rode off down the ascot road with a groom he had hardly however gone a couple of miles when he heard somebody galloping after him and looking round saw the little duke coming up on his pony with his face very flushed and no hat im awfully sorry mr otis gasped out the boy but i cant eat any dinner as long as virginia is lost  please dont be angry with me if you had let us be engaged last year there would never have been all this trouble  you wont send me back will you  i cant go  i wont go  the minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace and was a good deal touched at his devotion to virginia so leaning down from his horse he patted him kindly on the shoulders and said well cecil if you wont go back i suppose you must come with me but i must get you a hat at ascot  oh bother my hat  i want virginia cried the little duke laughing and they galloped on to the railway station  there mr otis inquired of the stationmaster if any one answering the description of virginia had been seen on the platform but could get no news of her  the stationmaster however wired up and down the line and assured him that a strict watch would be kept for her and after having bought a hat for the little duke from a linen draper who was just putting up his shutters mr otis rode off to bexley a village about four miles away which he was told was a wellknown haunt of the gypsies as there was a large common next to it  here they roused up the rural policeman but could get no information from him and after riding all over the common they turned their horses heads homewards and reached the chase about eleven oclock deadtired and almost heartbroken  they found washington and the twins waiting for them at the gatehouse with lanterns as the avenue was very dark  not the slightest trace of virginia had been discovered  the gypsies had been caught on brockley meadows but she was not with them and they had explained their sudden departure by saying that they had mistaken the date of chorton fair and had gone off in a hurry for fear they might be late  indeed they had been quite distressed at hearing of virginias disappearance as they were very grateful to mr otis for having allowed them to camp in his park and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search  the carppond had been dragged and the whole chase thoroughly gone over but without any result  it was evident that for that night at any rate virginia was lost to them and it was in a state of the deepest depression that mr otis and the boys walked up to the house the groom following behind with the two horses and the pony  in the hall they found a group of frightened servants and lying on a sofa in the library was poor mrs otis almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety and having her forehead bathed with eaudecologne by the old housekeeper  mr otis at once insisted on her having something to eat and ordered up supper for the whole party  it was a melancholy meal as hardly any one spoke and even the twins were awestruck and subdued as they were very fond of their sister  when they had finished mr otis in spite of the entreaties of the little duke ordered them all to bed saying that nothing more could be done that night and that he would telegraph in the morning to scotland yard for some detectives to be sent down immediately  just as they were passing out of the diningroom midnight began to boom from the clock tower and when the last stroke sounded they heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry a dreadful peal of thunder shook the house a strain of unearthly music floated through the air a panel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise and out on the landing looking very pale and white with a little casket in her hand stepped virginia  in a moment they had all rushed up to her  mrs otis clasped her passionately in her arms the duke smothered her with violent kisses and the twins executed a wild wardance round the group  good heavens child where have you been said mr otis rather angrily thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them  cecil and i have been riding all over the country looking for you and your mother has been frightened to death  you must never play these practical jokes any more  except on the ghost except on the ghost shrieked the twins as they capered about  my own darling thank god you are found you must never leave my side again murmured mrs otis as she kissed the trembling child and smoothed the tangled gold of her hair  papa said virginia quietly i have been with the ghost  he is dead and you must come and see him  he had been very wicked but he was really sorry for all that he had done and he gave me this box of beautiful jewels before he died  the whole family gazed at her in mute amazement but she was quite grave and serious and turning round she led them through the opening in the wainscoting down a narrow secret corridor washington following with a lighted candle which he had caught up from the table  finally they came to a great oak door studded with rusty nails  when virginia touched it it swung back on its heavy hinges and they found themselves in a little low room with a vaulted ceiling and one tiny grated window  imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring and chained to it was a gaunt skeleton that was stretched out at full length on the stone floor and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers an oldfashioned trencher and ewer that were placed just out of its reach  the jug had evidently been once filled with water as it was covered inside with green mould  there was nothing on the trencher but a pile of dust  virginia knelt down beside the skeleton and folding her little hands together began to pray silently while the rest of the party looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now disclosed to them  hallo suddenly exclaimed one of the twins who had been looking out of the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was situated  hallo the old withered almondtree has blossomed  i can see the flowers quite plainly in the moonlight  god has forgiven him said virginia gravely as she rose to her feet and a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face  what an angel you are cried the young duke and he put his arm round her neck and kissed her    chapter vii    four days after these curious incidents a funeral started from canterville chase at about eleven oclock at night  the hearse was drawn by eight black horses each of which carried on its head a great tuft of nodding ostrichplumes and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich purple pall on which was embroidered in gold the canterville coatofarms  by the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the servants with lighted torches and the whole procession was wonderfully impressive  lord canterville was the chief mourner having come up specially from wales to attend the funeral and sat in the first carriage along with little virginia  then came the united states minister and his wife then washington and the three boys and in the last carriage was mrs umney  it was generally felt that as she had been frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life she had a right to see the last of him  a deep grave had been dug in the corner of the churchyard just under the old yewtree and the service was read in the most impressive manner by the rev augustus dampier  when the ceremony was over the servants according to an old custom observed in the canterville family extinguished their torches and as the coffin was being lowered into the grave virginia stepped forward and laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almondblossoms  as she did so the moon came out from behind a cloud and flooded with its silent silver the little churchyard and from a distant copse a nightingale began to sing  she thought of the ghosts description of the garden of death her eyes became dim with tears and she hardly spoke a word during the drive home  the next morning before lord canterville went up to town mr otis had an interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given to virginia  they were perfectly magnificent especially a certain ruby necklace with old venetian setting which was really a superb specimen of sixteenthcentury work and their value was so great that mr otis felt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them  my lord he said i know that in this country mortmain is held to apply to trinkets as well as to land and it is quite clear to me that these jewels are or should be heirlooms in your family  i must beg you accordingly to take them to london with you and to regard them simply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you under certain strange conditions  as for my daughter she is merely a child and has as yet i am glad to say but little interest in such appurtenances of idle luxury  i am also informed by mrs otis who i may say is no mean authority upon arthaving had the privilege of spending several winters in boston when she was a girlthat these gems are of great monetary worth and if offered for sale would fetch a tall price  under these circumstances lord canterville i feel sure that you will recognise how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain in the possession of any member of my family and indeed all such vain gauds and toys however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the british aristocracy would be completely out of place among those who have been brought up on the severe and i believe immortal principles of republican simplicity  perhaps i should mention that virginia is very anxious that you should allow her to retain the box as a memento of your unfortunate but misguided ancestor  as it is extremely old and consequently a good deal out of repair you may perhaps think fit to comply with her request  for my own part i confess i am a good deal surprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with mediaevalism in any form and can only account for it by the fact that virginia was born in one of your london suburbs shortly after mrs otis had returned from a trip to athens  lord canterville listened very gravely to the worthy ministers speech pulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile and when mr otis had ended he shook him cordially by the hand and said my dear sir your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky ancestor sir simon a very important service and i and my family are much indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck  the jewels are clearly hers and egad i believe that if i were heartless enough to take them from her the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave in a fortnight leading me the devil of a life  as for their being heirlooms nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or legal document and the existence of these jewels has been quite unknown i assure you i have no more claim on them than your butler and when miss virginia grows up i daresay she will be pleased to have pretty things to wear  besides you forget mr otis that you took the furniture and the ghost at a valuation and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at once into your possession as whatever activity sir simon may have shown in the corridor at night in point of law he was really dead and you acquired his property by purchase  mr otis was a good deal distressed at lord cantervilles refusal and begged him to reconsider his decision but the goodnatured peer was quite firm and finally induced the minister to allow his daughter to retain the present the ghost had given her and when in the spring of 1890 the young duchess of cheshire was presented at the queens first drawingroom on the occasion of her marriage her jewels were the universal theme of admiration  for virginia received the coronet which is the reward of all good little american girls and was married to her boylover as soon as he came of age  they were both so charming and they loved each other so much that every one was delighted at the match except the old marchioness of dumbleton who had tried to catch the duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters and had given no less than three expensive dinnerparties for that purpose and strange to say mr otis himself  mr otis was extremely fond of the young duke personally but theoretically he objected to titles and to use his own words was not without apprehension lest amid the enervating influences of a pleasureloving aristocracy the true principles of republican simplicity should be forgotten  his objections however were completely overruled and i believe that when he walked up the aisle of st georges hanover square with his daughter leaning on his arm there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of england  the duke and duchess after the honeymoon was over went down to canterville chase and on the day after their arrival they walked over in the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pinewoods there had been a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on sir simons tombstone but finally it had been decided to engrave on it simply the initials of the old gentlemans name and the verse from the library window  the duchess had brought with her some lovely roses which she strewed upon the grave and after they had stood by it for some time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey  there the duchess sat down on a fallen pillar while her husband lay at her feet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes  suddenly he threw his cigarette away took hold of her hand and said to her virginia a wife should have no secrets from her husband  dear cecil  i have no secrets from you  yes you have he answered smiling you have never told me what happened to you when you were locked up with the ghost  i have never told any one cecil said virginia gravely  i know that but you might tell me  please dont ask me cecil i cannot tell you  poor sir simon  i owe him a great deal  yes dont laugh cecil i really do  he made me see what life is and what death signifies and why love is stronger than both  the duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly  you can have your secret as long as i have your heart he murmured  you have always had that cecil  and you will tell our children some day wont you  virginia blushed     the sphinx without a secret     one afternoon i was sitting outside the cafe de la paix watching the splendour and shabbiness of parisian life and wondering over my vermouth at the strange panorama of pride and poverty that was passing before me when i heard some one call my name  i turned round and saw lord murchison  we had not met since we had been at college together nearly ten years before so i was delighted to come across him again and we shook hands warmly  at oxford we had been great friends  i had liked him immensely he was so handsome so highspirited and so honourable  we used to say of him that he would be the best of fellows if he did not always speak the truth but i think we really admired him all the more for his frankness  i found him a good deal changed  he looked anxious and puzzled and seemed to be in doubt about something  i felt it could not be modern scepticism for murchison was the stoutest of tories and believed in the pentateuch as firmly as he believed in the house of peers so i concluded that it was a woman and asked him if he was married yet  i dont understand women well enough he answered  my dear gerald i said women are meant to be loved not to be understood  i cannot love where i cannot trust he replied  i believe you have a mystery in your life gerald i exclaimed tell me about it  let us go for a drive he answered it is too crowded here  no not a yellow carriage any other colourthere that dark green one will do and in a few moments we were trotting down the boulevard in the direction of the madeleine  where shall we go to i said  oh anywhere you like he answeredto the restaurant in the bois we will dine there and you shall tell me all about yourself  i want to hear about you first i said  tell me your mystery  he took from his pocket a little silverclasped morocco case and handed it to me  i opened it  inside there was the photograph of a woman  she was tall and slight and strangely picturesque with her large vague eyes and loosened hair  she looked like a clairvoyante and was wrapped in rich furs  what do you think of that face he said is it truthful  i examined it carefully  it seemed to me the face of some one who had a secret but whether that secret was good or evil i could not say  its beauty was a beauty moulded out of many mysteriesthe beauty in fact which is psychological not plasticand the faint smile that just played across the lips was far too subtle to be really sweet  well he cried impatiently what do you say  she is the gioconda in sables i answered  let me know all about her  not now he said after dinner and began to talk of other things  when the waiter brought us our coffee and cigarettes i reminded gerald of his promise  he rose from his seat walked two or three times up and down the room and sinking into an armchair told me the following story  one evening he said i was walking down bond street about five oclock  there was a terrific crush of carriages and the traffic was almost stopped  close to the pavement was standing a little yellow brougham which for some reason or other attracted my attention  as i passed by there looked out from it the face i showed you this afternoon  it fascinated me immediately  all that night i kept thinking of it and all the next day  i wandered up and down that wretched row peering into every carriage and waiting for the yellow brougham but i could not find ma belle inconnue and at last i began to think she was merely a dream  about a week afterwards i was dining with madame de rastail  dinner was for eight oclock but at halfpast eight we were still waiting in the drawingroom  finally the servant threw open the door and announced lady alroy  it was the woman i had been looking for  she came in very slowly looking like a moonbeam in grey lace and to my intense delight i was asked to take her in to dinner  after we had sat down i remarked quite innocently i think i caught sight of you in bond street some time ago lady alroy  she grew very pale and said to me in a low voice pray do not talk so loud you may be overheard  i felt miserable at having made such a bad beginning and plunged recklessly into the subject of the french plays  she spoke very little always in the same low musical voice and seemed as if she was afraid of some one listening  i fell passionately stupidly in love and the indefinable atmosphere of mystery that surrounded her excited my most ardent curiosity  when she was going away which she did very soon after dinner i asked her if i might call and see her  she hesitated for a moment glanced round to see if any one was near us and then said yes tomorrow at a quarter to five  i begged madame de rastail to tell me about her but all that i could learn was that she was a widow with a beautiful house in park lane and as some scientific bore began a dissertation on widows as exemplifying the survival of the matrimonially fittest i left and went home  the next day i arrived at park lane punctual to the moment but was told by the butler that lady alroy had just gone out  i went down to the club quite unhappy and very much puzzled and after long consideration wrote her a letter asking if i might be allowed to try my chance some other afternoon  i had no answer for several days but at last i got a little note saying she would be at home on sunday at four and with this extraordinary postscript  please do not write to me here again i will explain when i see you  on sunday she received me and was perfectly charming but when i was going away she begged of me if i ever had occasion to write to her again to address my letter to mrs knox care of whittakers library green street  there are reasons she said why i cannot receive letters in my own house  all through the season i saw a great deal of her and the atmosphere of mystery never left her  sometimes i thought that she was in the power of some man but she looked so unapproachable that i could not believe it  it was really very difficult for me to come to any conclusion for she was like one of those strange crystals that one sees in museums which are at one moment clear and at another clouded  at last i determined to ask her to be my wife  i was sick and tired of the incessant secrecy that she imposed on all my visits and on the few letters i sent her  i wrote to her at the library to ask her if she could see me the following monday at six she answered yes and i was in the seventh heaven of delight  i was infatuated with her  in spite of the mystery i thought thenin consequence of it i see now  no it was the woman herself i loved the mystery troubled me maddened me  why did chance put me in its track  you discovered it then i cried  i fear so he answered  you can judge for yourself  when monday came round i went to lunch with my uncle and about four oclock found myself in the marylebone road  my uncle you know lives in regents park  i wanted to get to piccadilly and took a short cut through a lot of shabby little streets  suddenly i saw in front of me lady alroy deeply veiled and walking very fast on coming to the last house in the street she went up the steps took out a latchkey and let herself in  here is the mystery i said to myself and i hurried on and examined the house  it seemed a sort of place for letting lodgings  on the doorstep lay her handkerchief which she had dropped  i picked it up and put it in my pocket  then i began to consider what i should do  i came to the conclusion that i had no right to spy on her and i drove down to the club  at six i called to see her  she was lying on a sofa in a teagown of silver tissue looped up by some strange moonstones that she always wore  she was looking quite lovely  i am so glad to see you she said i have not been out all day  i stared at her in amazement and pulling the handkerchief out of my pocket handed it to her  you dropped this in cumnor street this afternoon lady alroy  i said very calmly  she looked at me in terror but made no attempt to take the handkerchief  what were you doing there i asked  what right have you to question me she answered  the right of a man who loves you i replied i came here to ask you to be my wife  she hid her face in her hands and burst into floods of tears  you must tell me i continued  she stood up and looking me straight in the face said lord murchison there is nothing to tell youyou went to meet some one i cried this is your mystery  she grew dreadfully white and said i went to meet no onecant you tell the truth i exclaimed  i have told it she replied  i was mad frantic i dont know what i said but i said terrible things to her  finally i rushed out of the house  she wrote me a letter the next day i sent it back unopened and started for norway with alan colville after a month i came back and the first thing i saw in the morning post was the death of lady alroy  she had caught a chill at the opera and had died in five days of congestion of the lungs  i shut myself up and saw no one  i had loved her so much i had loved her so madly  good god how i had loved that woman  you went to the street to the house in it i said  yes he answered  one day i went to cumnor street  i could not help it i was tortured with doubt  i knocked at the door and a respectable looking woman opened it to me  i asked her if she had any rooms to let  well sir she replied the drawingrooms are supposed to be let but i have not seen the lady for three months and as rent is owing on them you can have themis this the lady i said showing the photograph  thats her sure enough she exclaimed and when is she coming back sirthe lady is dead i replied oh sir i hope not said the woman she was my best lodger  she paid me three guineas a week merely to sit in my drawingrooms now and then  she met some one here i said but the woman assured me that it was not so that she always came alone and saw no one what on earth did she do here i cried  she simply sat in the drawingroom sir reading books and sometimes had tea the woman answered  i did not know what to say so i gave her a sovereign and went away  now what do you think it all meant  you dont believe the woman was telling the truth  i do  then why did lady alroy go there  my dear gerald i answered lady alroy was simply a woman with a mania for mystery  she took these rooms for the pleasure of going there with her veil down and imagining she was a heroine  she had a passion for secrecy but she herself was merely a sphinx without a secret  do you really think so  i am sure of it i replied  he took out the morocco case opened it and looked at the photograph  i wonder he said at last     the model millionaire     unless one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow romance is the privilege of the rich not the profession of the unemployed  the poor should be practical and prosaic  it is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating  these are the great truths of modern life which hughie erskine never realised poor hughie  intellectually we must admit he was not of much importance  he never said a brilliant or even an illnatured thing in his life  but then he was wonderfully goodlooking with his crisp brown hair his clearcut profile and his grey eyes  he was as popular with men as he was with women and he had every accomplishment except that of making money  his father had bequeathed him his cavalry sword and a history of the peninsular war in fifteen volumes  hughie hung the first over his lookingglass put the second on a shelf between ruffs guide and baileys magazine and lived on two hundred a year that an old aunt allowed him  he had tried everything  he had gone on the stock exchange for six months but what was a butterfly to do among bulls and bears  he had been a teamerchant for a little longer but had soon tired of pekoe and souchong  then he had tried selling dry sherry that did not answer the sherry was a little too dry  ultimately he became nothing a delightful ineffectual young man with a perfect profile and no profession  to make matters worse he was in love  the girl he loved was laura merton the daughter of a retired colonel who had lost his temper and his digestion in india and had never found either of them again  laura adored him and he was ready to kiss her shoestrings they were the handsomest couple in london and had not a pennypiece between them  the colonel was very fond of hughie but would not hear of any engagement  come to me my boy when you have got ten thousand pounds of your own and we will see about it he used to say and hughie looked very glum in those days and had to go to laura for consolation  one morning as he was on his way to holland park where the mertons lived he dropped in to see a great friend of his alan trevor trevor was a painter  indeed few people escape that nowadays  but he was also an artist and artists are rather rare  personally he was a strange rough fellow with a freckled face and a red ragged beard  however when he took up the brush he was a real master and his pictures were eagerly sought after  he had been very much attracted by hughie at first it must be acknowledged entirely on account of his personal charm  the only people a painter should know he used to say are people who are bete and beautiful people who are an artistic pleasure to look at and an intellectual repose to talk to  men who are dandies and women who are darlings rule the world at least they should do so  however after he got to know hughie better he liked him quite as much for his bright buoyant spirits and his generous reckless nature and had given him the permanent entree to his studio  when hughie came in he found trevor putting the finishing touches to a wonderful lifesize picture of a beggarman  the beggar himself was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio  he was a wizened old man with a face like wrinkled parchment and a most piteous expression  over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak all tears and tatters his thick boots were patched and cobbled and with one hand he leant on a rough stick while with the other he held out his battered hat for alms  what an amazing model whispered hughie as he shook hands with his friend  an amazing model shouted trevor at the top of his voice i should think so  such beggars as he are not to be met with every day  a trouvaille mon cher a living velasquez  my stars what an etching rembrandt would have made of him  poor old chap said hughie how miserable he looks  but i suppose to you painters his face is his fortune  certainly replied trevor you dont want a beggar to look happy do you  how much does a model get for sitting asked hughie as he found himself a comfortable seat on a divan  a shilling an hour  and how much do you get for your picture alan  oh for this i get two thousand  pounds  guineas  painters poets and physicians always get guineas  well i think the model should have a percentage cried hughie laughing they work quite as hard as you do  nonsense nonsense  why look at the trouble of laying on the paint alone and standing all day long at ones easel  its all very well hughie for you to talk but i assure you that there are moments when art almost attains to the dignity of manual labour but you mustnt chatter im very busy  smoke a cigarette and keep quiet  after some time the servant came in and told trevor that the framemaker wanted to speak to him  dont run away hughie he said as he went out i will be back in a moment  the old beggarman took advantage of trevors absence to rest for a moment on a wooden bench that was behind him  he looked so forlorn and wretched that hughie could not help pitying him and felt in his pockets to see what money he had  all he could find was a sovereign and some coppers  poor old fellow he thought to himself he wants it more than i do but it means no hansoms for a fortnight and he walked across the studio and slipped the sovereign into the beggars hand  the old man started and a faint smile flitted across his withered lips  thank you sir he said thank you  then trevor arrived and hughie took his leave blushing a little at what he had done  he spent the day with laura got a charming scolding for his extravagance and had to walk home  that night he strolled into the palette club about eleven oclock and found trevor sitting by himself in the smokingroom drinking hock and seltzer  well alan did you get the picture finished all right he said as he lit his cigarette  finished and framed my boy answered trevor and by the bye you have made a conquest  that old model you saw is quite devoted to you  i had to tell him all about youwho you are where you live what your income is what prospects you have  my dear alan cried hughie i shall probably find him waiting for me when i go home  but of course you are only joking  poor old wretch  i wish i could do something for him  i think it is dreadful that any one should be so miserable  i have got heaps of old clothes at homedo you think he would care for any of them why his rags were falling to bits  but he looks splendid in them said trevor  i wouldnt paint him in a frock coat for anything  what you call rags i call romance what seems poverty to you is picturesqueness to me  however ill tell him of your offer  alan said hughie seriously you painters are a heartless lot  an artists heart is his head replied trevor and besides our business is to realise the world as we see it not to reform it as we know it  a chacun son metier  and now tell me how laura is the old model was quite interested in her  you dont mean to say you talked to him about her said hughie  certainly i did  he knows all about the relentless colonel the lovely laura and the 10000 pounds  you told that old beggar all my private affairs cried hughie looking very red and angry  my dear boy said trevor smiling that old beggar as you call him is one of the richest men in europe  he could buy all london tomorrow without overdrawing his account  he has a house in every capital dines off gold plate and can prevent russia going to war when he chooses  what on earth do you mean exclaimed hughie  what i say said trevor  the old man you saw today in the studio was baron hausberg  he is a great friend of mine buys all my pictures and that sort of thing and gave me a commission a month ago to paint him as a beggar  que voulezvous  la fantaisie dun millionnaire  and i must say he made a magnificent figure in his rags or perhaps i should say in my rags they are an old suit i got in spain  baron hausberg cried hughie  good heavens  i gave him a sovereign and he sank into an armchair the picture of dismay  gave him a sovereign shouted trevor and he burst into a roar of laughter  my dear boy youll never see it again  son affaire cest largent des autres  i think you might have told me alan said hughie sulkily and not have let me make such a fool of myself  well to begin with hughie said trevor it never entered my mind that you went about distributing alms in that reckless way  i can understand your kissing a pretty model but your giving a sovereign to an ugly oneby jove no  besides the fact is that i really was not at home today to any one and when you came in i didnt know whether hausberg would like his name mentioned  you know he wasnt in full dress  what a duffer he must think me said hughie  not at all  he was in the highest spirits after you left kept chuckling to himself and rubbing his old wrinkled hands together  i couldnt make out why he was so interested to know all about you but i see it all now  hell invest your sovereign for you hughie pay you the interest every six months and have a capital story to tell after dinner  i am an unlucky devil growled hughie  the best thing i can do is to go to bed and my dear alan you mustnt tell any one  i shouldnt dare show my face in the row  nonsense  it reflects the highest credit on your philanthropic spirit hughie  and dont run away  have another cigarette and you can talk about laura as much as you like  however hughie wouldnt stop but walked home feeling very unhappy and leaving alan trevor in fits of laughter  the next morning as he was at breakfast the servant brought him up a card on which was written monsieur gustave naudin de la part de m le baron hausberg  i suppose he has come for an apology said hughie to himself and he told the servant to show the visitor up  an old gentleman with gold spectacles and grey hair came into the room and said in a slight french accent have i the honour of addressing monsieur erskine  hughie bowed  i have come from baron hausberg he continued  the baron  i beg sir that you will offer him my sincerest apologies stammered hughie  the baron said the old gentleman with a smile has commissioned me to bring you this letter and he extended a sealed envelope  on the outside was written a wedding present to hugh erskine and laura merton from an old beggar and inside was a cheque for 10000 pounds  when they were married alan trevor was the best man and the baron made a speech at the wedding breakfast  millionaire models remarked alan are rare enough but by jove model millionaires are rarer still     the portrait of mr w h     chapter i    i had been dining with erskine in his pretty little house in birdcage walk and we were sitting in the library over our coffee and cigarettes when the question of literary forgeries happened to turn up in conversation  i cannot at present remember how it was that we struck upon this somewhat curious topic as it was at that time but i know that we had a long discussion about macpherson ireland and chatterton and that with regard to the last i insisted that his socalled forgeries were merely the result of an artistic desire for perfect representation that we had no right to quarrel with an artist for the conditions under which he chooses to present his work and that all art being to a certain degree a mode of acting an attempt to realise ones own personality on some imaginative plane out of reach of the trammelling accidents and limitations of real life to censure an artist for a forgery was to confuse an ethical with an aesthetical problem  erskine who was a good deal older than i was and had been listening to me with the amused deference of a man of forty suddenly put his hand upon my shoulder and said to me what would you say about a young man who had a strange theory about a certain work of art believed in his theory and committed a forgery in order to prove it  ah that is quite a different matter i answered  erskine remained silent for a few moments looking at the thin grey threads of smoke that were rising from his cigarette  yes he said after a pause quite different  there was something in the tone of his voice a slight touch of bitterness perhaps that excited my curiosity  did you ever know anybody who did that i cried  yes he answered throwing his cigarette into the firea great friend of mine cyril graham  he was very fascinating and very foolish and very heartless  however he left me the only legacy i ever received in my life  what was that i exclaimed  erskine rose from his seat and going over to a tall inlaid cabinet that stood between the two windows unlocked it and came back to where i was sitting holding in his hand a small panel picture set in an old and somewhat tarnished elizabethan frame  it was a fulllength portrait of a young man in late sixteenth century costume standing by a table with his right hand resting on an open book  he seemed about seventeen years of age and was of quite extraordinary personal beauty though evidently somewhat effeminate  indeed had it not been for the dress and the closely cropped hair one would have said that the face with its dreamy wistful eyes and its delicate scarlet lips was the face of a girl in manner and especially in the treatment of the hands the picture reminded one of francois clouets later work  the black velvet doublet with its fantastically gilded points and the peacockblue background against which it showed up so pleasantly and from which it gained such luminous value of colour were quite in clouets style and the two masks of tragedy and comedy that hung somewhat formally from the marble pedestal had that hard severity of touch so different from the facile grace of the italianswhich even at the court of france the great flemish master never completely lost and which in itself has always been a characteristic of the northern temper  it is a charming thing i cried but who is this wonderful young man whose beauty art has so happily preserved for us  this is the portrait of mr w h said erskine with a sad smile it might have been a chance effect of light but it seemed to me that his eyes were quite bright with tears  mr w h i exclaimed who was mr w h  dont you remember he answered look at the book on which his hand is resting  i see there is some writing there but i cannot make it out i replied  take this magnifyingglass and try said erskine with the same sad smile still playing about his mouth  i took the glass and moving the lamp a little nearer i began to spell out the crabbed sixteenthcentury handwriting  to the onlie begetter of these insuing sonnets    good heavens i cried is this shakespeares mr w h  cyril graham used to say so muttered erskine  but it is not a bit like lord pembroke i answered  i know the penshurst portraits very well  i was staying near there a few weeks ago  do you really believe then that the sonnets are addressed to lord pembroke he asked  i am sure of it i answered  pembroke shakespeare and mrs mary fitton are the three personages of the sonnets there is no doubt at all about it  well i agree with you said erskine but i did not always think so  i used to believewell i suppose i used to believe in cyril graham and his theory  and what was that i asked looking at the wonderful portrait which had already begun to have a strange fascination for me  it is a long story said erskine taking the picture away from me rather abruptly i thought at the timea very long story but if you care to hear it i will tell it to you  i love theories about the sonnets i cried but i dont think i am likely to be converted to any new idea  the matter has ceased to be a mystery to any one  indeed i wonder that it ever was a mystery  as i dont believe in the theory i am not likely to convert you to it said erskine laughing but it may interest you  tell it to me of course i answered  if it is half as delightful as the picture i shall be more than satisfied  well said erskine lighting a cigarette i must begin by telling you about cyril graham himself  he and i were at the same house at eton  i was a year or two older than he was but we were immense friends and did all our work and all our play together  there was of course a good deal more play than work but i cannot say that i am sorry for that  it is always an advantage not to have received a sound commercial education and what i learned in the playing fields at eton has been quite as useful to me as anything i was taught at cambridge  i should tell you that cyrils father and mother were both dead  they had been drowned in a horrible yachting accident off the isle of wight  his father had been in the diplomatic service and had married a daughter the only daughter in fact of old lord crediton who became cyrils guardian after the death of his parents  i dont think that lord crediton cared very much for cyril  he had never really forgiven his daughter for marrying a man who had not a title  he was an extraordinary old aristocrat who swore like a costermonger and had the manners of a farmer  i remember seeing him once on speechday  he growled at me gave me a sovereign and told me not to grow up a damned radical like my father  cyril had very little affection for him and was only too glad to spend most of his holidays with us in scotland  they never really got on together at all  cyril thought him a bear and he thought cyril effeminate  he was effeminate i suppose in some things though he was a very good rider and a capital fencer  in fact he got the foils before he left eton  but he was very languid in his manner and not a little vain of his good looks and had a strong objection to football  the two things that really gave him pleasure were poetry and acting  at eton he was always dressing up and reciting shakespeare and when we went up to trinity he became a member of the adc his first term  i remember i was always very jealous of his acting  i was absurdly devoted to him i suppose because we were so different in some things  i was a rather awkward weakly lad with huge feet and horribly freckled freckles run in scotch families just as gout does in english families  cyril used to say that of the two he preferred the gout but he always set an absurdly high value on personal appearance and once read a paper before our debating society to prove that it was better to be goodlooking than to be good  he certainly was wonderfully handsome  people who did not like him philistines and college tutors and young men reading for the church used to say that he was merely pretty but there was a great deal more in his face than mere prettiness  i think he was the most splendid creature i ever saw and nothing could exceed the grace of his movements the charm of his manner  he fascinated everybody who was worth fascinating and a great many people who were not  he was often wilful and petulant and i used to think him dreadfully insincere  it was due i think chiefly to his inordinate desire to please  poor cyril  i told him once that he was contented with very cheap triumphs but he only laughed  he was horribly spoiled all charming people i fancy are spoiled  it is the secret of their attraction  however i must tell you about cyrils acting  you know that no actresses are allowed to play at the adc  at least they were not in my time  i dont know how it is now  well of course cyril was always cast for the girls parts and when as you like it was produced he played rosalind  it was a marvellous performance  in fact cyril graham was the only perfect rosalind i have ever seen it would be impossible to describe to you the beauty the delicacy the refinement of the whole thing  it made an immense sensation and the horrid little theatre as it was then was crowded every night  even when i read the play now i cant help thinking of cyril  it might have been written for him  the next term he took his degree and came to london to read for the diplomatic  but he never did any work  he spent his days in reading shakespeares sonnets and his evenings at the theatre  he was of course wild to go on the stage  it was all that i and lord crediton could do to prevent him  perhaps if he had gone on the stage he would be alive now  it is always a silly thing to give advice but to give good advice is absolutely fatal  i hope you will never fall into that error  if you do you will be sorry for it  well to come to the real point of the story one day i got a letter from cyril asking me to come round to his rooms that evening he had charming chambers in piccadilly overlooking the green park and as i used to go to see him every day i was rather surprised at his taking the trouble to write  of course i went and when i arrived i found him in a state of great excitement  he told me that he had at last discovered the true secret of shakespeares sonnets that all the scholars and critics had been entirely on the wrong tack and that he was the first who working purely by internal evidence had found out who mr w h really was  he was perfectly wild with delight and for a long time would not tell me his theory finally he produced a bundle of notes took his copy of the sonnets off the mantelpiece and sat down and gave me a long lecture on the whole subject  he began by pointing out that the young man to whom shakespeare addressed these strangely passionate poems must have been somebody who was a really vital factor in the development of his dramatic art and that this could not be said either of lord pembroke or lord southampton  indeed whoever he was he could not have been anybody of high birth as was shown very clearly by the 25th sonnet in which shakespeare contrasting himself with those who are great princes favourites says quite frankly    let those who are in favour with their stars of public honour and proud titles boast whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars unlookd for joy in that i honour most   and ends the sonnet by congratulating himself on the mean state of him he so adored   then happy i that love and am beloved where i may not remove nor be removed   this sonnet cyril declared would be quite unintelligible if we fancied that it was addressed to either the earl of pembroke or the earl of southampton both of whom were men of the highest position in england and fully entitled to be called great princes and he in corroboration of his view read me sonnets cxxiv and cxxv in which shakespeare tells us that his love is not the child of state that it suffers not in smiling pomp but is builded far from accident  i listened with a good deal of interest for i dont think the point had ever been made before but what followed was still more curious and seemed to me at the time to dispose entirely of pembrokes claim  we know from meres that the sonnets had been written before 1598 and sonnet civ informs us that shakespeares friendship for mr w h had been already in existence for three years  now lord pembroke who was born in 1580 did not come to london till he was eighteen years of age that is to say till 1598 and shakespeares acquaintance with mr w h must have begun in 1594 or at the latest in 1595  shakespeare accordingly could not have known lord pembroke till after the sonnets had been written  cyril pointed out also that pembrokes father did not die till 1601 whereas it was evident from the line   you had a father let your son say so   that the father of mr w h was dead in 1598  besides it was absurd to imagine that any publisher of the time and the preface is from the publishers hand would have ventured to address william herbert earl of pembroke as mr w h the case of lord buckhurst being spoken of as mr sackville being not really a parallel instance as lord buckhurst was not a peer but merely the younger son of a peer with a courtesy title and the passage in englands parnassus where he is so spoken of is not a formal and stately dedication but simply a casual allusion  so far for lord pembroke whose supposed claims cyril easily demolished while i sat by in wonder  with lord southampton cyril had even less difficulty southampton became at a very early age the lover of elizabeth vernon so he needed no entreaties to marry he was not beautiful he did not resemble his mother as mr w h did    thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee calls back the lovely april of her prime   and above all his christian name was henry whereas the punning sonnets cxxxv and cxliii show that the christian name of shakespeares friend was the same as his ownwill  as for the other suggestions of unfortunate commentators that mr w h is a misprint for mr w s meaning mr william shakespeare that mr w h all should be read mr w hall that mr w h is mr william hathaway and that a full stop should be placed after wisheth making mr w h the writer and not the subject of the dedicationcyril got rid of them in a very short time and it is not worth while to mention his reasons though i remember he sent me off into a fit of laughter by reading to me i am glad to say not in the original some extracts from a german commentator called barnstorff who insisted that mr w h was no less a person than mr william himself  nor would he allow for a moment that the sonnets are mere satires on the work of drayton and john davies of hereford  to him as indeed to me they were poems of serious and tragic import wrung out of the bitterness of shakespeares heart and made sweet by the honey of his lips  still less would he admit that they were merely a philosophical allegory and that in them shakespeare is addressing his ideal self or ideal manhood or the spirit of beauty or the reason or the divine logos or the catholic church  he felt as indeed i think we all must feel that the sonnets are addressed to an individualto a particular young man whose personality for some reason seems to have filled the soul of shakespeare with terrible joy and no less terrible despair  having in this manner cleared the way as it were cyril asked me to dismiss from my mind any preconceived ideas i might have formed on the subject and to give a fair and unbiassed hearing to his own theory  the problem he pointed out was this  who was that young man of shakespeares day who without being of noble birth or even of noble nature was addressed by him in terms of such passionate adoration that we can but wonder at the strange worship and are almost afraid to turn the key that unlocks the mystery of the poets heart  who was he whose physical beauty was such that it became the very cornerstone of shakespeares art the very source of shakespeares inspiration the very incarnation of shakespeares dreams  to look upon him as simply the object of certain lovepoems is to miss the whole meaning of the poems  for the art of which shakespeare talks in the sonnets is not the art of the sonnets themselves which indeed were to him but slight and secret things it is the art of the dramatist to which he is always alluding and he to whom shakespeare said    thou art all my art and dost advance as high as learning my rude ignorance   he to whom he promised immortality   where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men    was surely none other than the boyactor for whom he created viola and imogen juliet and rosalind portia and desdemona and cleopatra herself  this was cyril grahams theory evolved as you see purely from the sonnets themselves and depending for its acceptance not so much on demonstrable proof or formal evidence but on a kind of spiritual and artistic sense by which alone he claimed could the true meaning of the poems be discerned  i remember his reading to me that fine sonnet    how can my muse want subject to invent while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse thine own sweet argument too excellent for every vulgar paper to rehearse o give thyself the thanks if aught in me worthy perusal stand against thy sight for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee when thou thyself dost give invention light be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate and he that calls on thee let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date    and pointing out how completely it corroborated his theory and indeed he went through all the sonnets carefully and showed or fancied that he showed that according to his new explanation of their meaning things that had seemed obscure or evil or exaggerated became clear and rational and of high artistic import illustrating shakespeares conception of the true relations between the art of the actor and the art of the dramatist  it is of course evident that there must have been in shakespeares company some wonderful boyactor of great beauty to whom he intrusted the presentation of his noble heroines for shakespeare was a practical theatrical manager as well as an imaginative poet and cyril graham had actually discovered the boyactors name  he was will or as he preferred to call him willie hughes  the christian name he found of course in the punning sonnets cxxxv and cxliii the surname was according to him hidden in the seventh line of the 20th sonnet where mr w h is described as    a man in hew all hews in his controwling   in the original edition of the sonnets hews is printed with a capital letter and in italics and this he claimed showed clearly that a play on words was intended his view receiving a good deal of corroboration from those sonnets in which curious puns are made on the words use and usury  of course i was converted at once and willie hughes became to me as real a person as shakespeare  the only objection i made to the theory was that the name of willie hughes does not occur in the list of the actors of shakespeares company as it is printed in the first folio  cyril however pointed out that the absence of willie hughess name from this list really corroborated the theory as it was evident from sonnet lxxxvi that willie hughes had abandoned shakespeares company to play at a rival theatre probably in some of chapmans plays  it is in reference to this that in the great sonnet on chapman shakespeare said to willie hughes    but when your countenance filld up his line then lackd i matter that enfeebled mine    the expression when your countenance filled up his line referring obviously to the beauty of the young actor giving life and reality and added charm to chapmans verse the same idea being also put forward in the 79th sonnet    whilst i alone did call upon thy aid my verse alone had all thy gentle grace but now my gracious numbers are decayd and my sick muse doth give another place   and in the immediately preceding sonnet where shakespeare says    every alien pen has got my use and under thee their poesy disperse   the play upon words usehughes being of course obvious and the phrase under thee their poesy disperse meaning by your assistance as an actor bring their plays before the people  it was a wonderful evening and we sat up almost till dawn reading and rereading the sonnets  after some time however i began to see that before the theory could be placed before the world in a really perfected form it was necessary to get some independent evidence about the existence of this young actor willie hughes  if this could be once established there could be no possible doubt about his identity with mr w h but otherwise the theory would fall to the ground  i put this forward very strongly to cyril who was a good deal annoyed at what he called my philistine tone of mind and indeed was rather bitter upon the subject  however i made him promise that in his own interest he would not publish his discovery till he had put the whole matter beyond the reach of doubt and for weeks and weeks we searched the registers of city churches the alleyn mss at dulwich the record office the papers of the lord chamberlaineverything in fact that we thought might contain some allusion to willie hughes  we discovered nothing of course and every day the existence of willie hughes seemed to me to become more problematical  cyril was in a dreadful state and used to go over the whole question day after day entreating me to believe but i saw the one flaw in the theory and i refused to be convinced till the actual existence of willie hughes a boyactor of elizabethan days had been placed beyond the reach of doubt or cavil  one day cyril left town to stay with his grandfather i thought at the time but i afterwards heard from lord crediton that this was not the case and about a fortnight afterwards i received a telegram from him handed in at warwick asking me to be sure to come and dine with him that evening at eight oclock  when i arrived he said to me the only apostle who did not deserve proof was st thomas and st thomas was the only apostle who got it  i asked him what he meant  he answered that he had not merely been able to establish the existence in the sixteenth century of a boyactor of the name of willie hughes but to prove by the most conclusive evidence that he was the mr w h of the sonnets  he would not tell me anything more at the time but after dinner he solemnly produced the picture i showed you and told me that he had discovered it by the merest chance nailed to the side of an old chest that he had bought at a farmhouse in warwickshire  the chest itself which was a very fine example of elizabethan work he had of course brought with him and in the centre of the front panel the initials w h were undoubtedly carved  it was this monogram that had attracted his attention and he told me that it was not till he had had the chest in his possession for several days that he had thought of making any careful examination of the inside  one morning however he saw that one of the sides of the chest was much thicker than the other and looking more closely he discovered that a framed panel picture was clamped against it  on taking it out he found it was the picture that is now lying on the sofa  it was very dirty and covered with mould but he managed to clean it and to his great joy saw that he had fallen by mere chance on the one thing for which he had been looking  here was an authentic portrait of mr w h with his hand resting on the dedicatory page of the sonnets and on the frame itself could be faintly seen the name of the young man written in black uncial letters on a faded gold ground master will hews  well what was i to say  it never occurred to me for a moment that cyril graham was playing a trick on me or that he was trying to prove his theory by means of a forgery  but is it a forgery i asked  of course it is said erskine  it is a very good forgery but it is a forgery none the less  i thought at the time that cyril was rather calm about the whole matter but i remember he more than once told me that he himself required no proof of the kind and that he thought the theory complete without it  i laughed at him and told him that without it the theory would fall to the ground and i warmly congratulated him on the marvellous discovery  we then arranged that the picture should be etched or facsimiled and placed as the frontispiece to cyrils edition of the sonnets and for three months we did nothing but go over each poem line by line till we had settled every difficulty of text or meaning  one unlucky day i was in a printshop in holborn when i saw upon the counter some extremely beautiful drawings in silverpoint  i was so attracted by them that i bought them and the proprietor of the place a man called rawlings told me that they were done by a young painter of the name of edward merton who was very clever but as poor as a church mouse  i went to see merton some days afterwards having got his address from the printseller and found a pale interesting young man with a rather commonlooking wifehis model as i subsequently learned  i told him how much i admired his drawings at which he seemed very pleased and i asked him if he would show me some of his other work  as we were looking over a portfolio full of really very lovely thingsfor merton had a most delicate and delightful touchi suddenly caught sight of a drawing of the picture of mr w h  there was no doubt whatever about it  it was almost a facsimilethe only difference being that the two masks of tragedy and comedy were not suspended from the marble table as they are in the picture but were lying on the floor at the young mans feet  where on earth did you get that i said  he grew rather confused and saidoh that is nothing  i did not know it was in this portfolio  it is not a thing of any value  it is what you did for mr cyril graham exclaimed his wife and if this gentleman wishes to buy it let him have it  for mr cyril graham i repeated  did you paint the picture of mr w h  i dont understand what you mean he answered growing very red well the whole thing was quite dreadful  the wife let it all out i gave her five pounds when i was going away  i cant bear to think of it now but of course i was furious  i went off at once to cyrils chambers waited there for three hours before he came in with that horrid lie staring me in the face and told him i had discovered his forgery  he grew very pale and saidi did it purely for your sake  you would not be convinced in any other way it does not affect the truth of the theory  the truth of the theory i exclaimed the less we talk about that the better  you never even believed in it yourself  if you had you would not have committed a forgery to prove it  high words passed between us we had a fearful quarrel  i dare say i was unjust  the next morning he was dead  dead i cried  yes he shot himself with a revolver  some of the blood splashed upon the frame of the picture just where the name had been painted by the time i arrivedhis servant had sent for me at oncethe police were already there  he had left a letter for me evidently written in the greatest agitation and distress of mind  what was in it i asked  oh that he believed absolutely in willie hughes that the forgery of the picture had been done simply as a concession to me and did not in the slightest degree invalidate the truth of the theory and that in order to show me how firm and flawless his faith in the whole thing was he was going to offer his life as a sacrifice to the secret of the sonnets  it was a foolish mad letter  i remember he ended by saying that he intrusted to me the willie hughes theory and that it was for me to present it to the world and to unlock the secret of shakespeares heart  it is a most tragic story i cried but why have you not carried out his wishes  erskine shrugged his shoulders  because it is a perfectly unsound theory from beginning to end he answered  my dear erskine i said getting up from my seat you are entirely wrong about the whole matter  it is the only perfect key to shakespeares sonnets that has ever been made  it is complete in every detail  i believe in willie hughes  dont say that said erskine gravely i believe there is something fatal about the idea and intellectually there is nothing to be said for it  i have gone into the whole matter and i assure you the theory is entirely fallacious  it is plausible up to a certain point  then it stops  for heavens sake my dear boy dont take up the subject of willie hughes  you will break your heart over it  erskine i answered it is your duty to give this theory to the world  if you will not do it i will  by keeping it back you wrong the memory of cyril graham the youngest and the most splendid of all the martyrs of literature  i entreat you to do him justice  he died for this thingdont let his death be in vain  erskine looked at me in amazement  you are carried away by the sentiment of the whole story he said  you forget that a thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it  i was devoted to cyril graham  his death was a horrible blow to me  i did not recover it for years  i dont think i have ever recovered it  but willie hughes  there is nothing in the idea of willie hughes  no such person ever existed  as for bringing the whole thing before the worldthe world thinks that cyril graham shot himself by accident  the only proof of his suicide was contained in the letter to me and of this letter the public never heard anything  to the present day lord crediton thinks that the whole thing was accidental  cyril graham sacrificed his life to a great idea i answered and if you will not tell of his martyrdom tell at least of his faith  his faith said erskine was fixed in a thing that was false in a thing that was unsound in a thing that no shakespearean scholar would accept for a moment  the theory would be laughed at  dont make a fool of yourself and dont follow a trail that leads nowhere  you start by assuming the existence of the very person whose existence is the thing to be proved  besides everybody knows that the sonnets were addressed to lord pembroke  the matter is settled once for all  the matter is not settled i exclaimed  i will take up the theory where cyril graham left it and i will prove to the world that he was right  silly boy said erskine  go home  it is after two and dont think about willie hughes any more  i am sorry i told you anything about it and very sorry indeed that i should have converted you to a thing in which i dont believe  you have given me the key to the greatest mystery of modern literature i answered and i shall not rest till i have made you recognise till i have made everybody recognise that cyril graham was the most subtle shakespearean critic of our day  as i walked home through st jamess park the dawn was just breaking over london  the white swans were lying asleep on the polished lake and the gaunt palace looked purple against the palegreen sky i thought of cyril graham and my eyes filled with tears    chapter ii    it was past twelve oclock when i awoke and the sun was streaming in through the curtains of my room in long slanting beams of dusty gold  i told my servant that i would be at home to no one and after i had had a cup of chocolate and a petitpain i took down from the bookshelf my copy of shakespeares sonnets and began to go carefully through them  every poem seemed to me to corroborate cyril grahams theory  i felt as if i had my hand upon shakespeares heart and was counting each separate throb and pulse of passion  i thought of the wonderful boyactor and saw his face in every line  two sonnets i remember struck me particularly  they were the 53rd and the 67th  in the first of these shakespeare complimenting willie hughes on the versatility of his acting on his wide range of parts a range extending from rosalind to juliet and from beatrice to ophelia says to him    what is your substance whereof are you made that millions of strange shadows on you tend since every one hath every one one shade and you but one can every shadow lend    lines that would be unintelligible if they were not addressed to an actor for the word shadow had in shakespeares day a technical meaning connected with the stage  the best in this kind are but shadows says theseus of the actors in the midsummer nights dream and there are many similar allusions in the literature of the day these sonnets evidently belonged to the series in which shakespeare discusses the nature of the actors art and of the strange and rare temperament that is essential to the perfect stageplayer  how is it says shakespeare to willie hughes that you have so many personalities and then he goes on to point out that his beauty is such that it seems to realise every form and phase of fancy to embody each dream of the creative imaginationan idea that is still further expanded in the sonnet that immediately follows where beginning with the fine thought   o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem by that sweet ornament which truth doth give   shakespeare invites us to notice how the truth of acting the truth of visible presentation on the stage adds to the wonder of poetry giving life to its loveliness and actual reality to its ideal form and yet in the 67th sonnet shakespeare calls upon willie hughes to abandon the stage with its artificiality its false mimic life of painted face and unreal costume its immoral influences and suggestions its remoteness from the true world of noble action and sincere utterance   ah wherefore with infection should he live and with his presence grace impiety that sin by him advantage should achieve and lace itself with his society why should false painting imitate his cheek and steal dead seeming of his living hue why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow since his rose is true   it may seem strange that so great a dramatist as shakespeare who realised his own perfection as an artist and his humanity as a man on the ideal plane of stagewriting and stageplaying should have written in these terms about the theatre but we must remember that in sonnets cx and cxi shakespeare shows us that he too was wearied of the world of puppets and full of shame at having made himself a motley to the view  the 111th sonnet is especially bitter   o for my sake do you with fortune chide the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds that did not better for my life provide than public means which public manners breeds thence comes it that my name receives a brand and almost thence my nature is subdued to what it works in like the dyers hand pity me then and wish i were renewd    and there are many signs elsewhere of the same feeling signs familiar to all real students of shakespeare  one point puzzled me immensely as i read the sonnets and it was days before i struck on the true interpretation which indeed cyril graham himself seems to have missed  i could not understand how it was that shakespeare set so high a value on his young friend marrying  he himself had married young and the result had been unhappiness and it was not likely that he would have asked willie hughes to commit the same error  the boyplayer of rosalind had nothing to gain from marriage or from the passions of real life the early sonnets with their strange entreaties to have children seemed to me a jarring note  the explanation of the mystery came on me quite suddenly and i found it in the curious dedication  it will be remembered that the dedication runs as follows    to the onlie begetter of   these insuing sonnets   mr w h all happinesse  and that eternitie  promised  by  our everliving poet  wisheth  the wellwishing  adventurer in  setting  forth  t t   some scholars have supposed that the word begetter in this dedication means simply the procurer of the sonnets for thomas thorpe the publisher but this view is now generally abandoned and the highest authorities are quite agreed that it is to be taken in the sense of inspirer the metaphor being drawn from the analogy of physical life  now i saw that the same metaphor was used by shakespeare himself all through the poems and this set me on the right track  finally i made my great discovery  the marriage that shakespeare proposes for willie hughes is the marriage with his muse an expression which is definitely put forward in the 82nd sonnet where in the bitterness of his heart at the defection of the boyactor for whom he had written his greatest parts and whose beauty had indeed suggested them he opens his complaint by saying    i grant thou wert not married to my muse   the children he begs him to beget are no children of flesh and blood but more immortal children of undying fame  the whole cycle of the early sonnets is simply shakespeares invitation to willie hughes to go upon the stage and become a player  how barren and profitless a thing he says is this beauty of yours if it be not used   when forty winters shall besiege thy brow and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field thy youths proud livery so gazed on now will be a tatterd weed of small worth held then being askd where all thy beauty lies where all the treasure of thy lusty days to say within thine own deepsunken eyes were an alleating shame and thriftless praise   you must create something in art  my verse is thine and born of thee only listen to me and i will bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date and you shall people with forms of your own image the imaginary world of the stage  these children that you beget he continues will not wither away as mortal children do but you shall live in them and in my plays  do but    make thee another self for love of me that beauty still may live in thine or thee   i collected all the passages that seemed to me to corroborate this view and they produced a strong impression on me and showed me how complete cyril grahams theory really was  i also saw that it was quite easy to separate those lines in which he speaks of the sonnets themselves from those in which he speaks of his great dramatic work this was a point that had been entirely overlooked by all critics up to cyril grahams day  and yet it was one of the most important points in the whole series of poems  to the sonnets shakespeare was more or less indifferent  he did not wish to rest his fame on them they were to him his slight muse as he calls them and intended as meres tells us for private circulation only among a few a very few friends  upon the other hand he was extremely conscious of the high artistic value of his plays and shows a noble selfreliance upon his dramatic genius  when he says to willie hughes   but thy eternal summer shall not fade nor lose possession of that fair thou owest nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade when in eternal lines to time thou growst so long as men can breathe or eyes can see so long lives this and this gives life to thee    the expression eternal lines clearly alludes to one of his plays that he was sending him at the time just as the concluding couplet points to his confidence in the probability of his plays being always acted  in his address to the dramatic muse sonnets c and ci we find the same feeling   where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long to speak of that which gives thee all thy might spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song darkening thy power to lend base subjects light   he cries and he then proceeds to reproach the mistress of tragedy and comedy for her neglect of truth in beauty dyed and says    because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb excuse not silence so for t lies in thee to make him much outlive a gilded tomb and to be praised of ages yet to be then do thy office muse i teach thee how to make him seem long hence as he shows now   it is however perhaps in the 55th sonnet that shakespeare gives to this idea its fullest expression  to imagine that the powerful rhyme of the second line refers to the sonnet itself is to mistake shakespeares meaning entirely  it seemed to me that it was extremely likely from the general character of the sonnet that a particular play was meant and that the play was none other but romeo and juliet   not marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time when wasteful wars shall statues overturn and broils root out the work of masonry nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn the living record of your memory gainst death and alloblivious enmity shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom so till the judgement that yourself arise you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes   it was also extremely suggestive to note how here as elsewhere shakespeare promised willie hughes immortality in a form that appealed to mens eyesthat is to say in a spectacular form in a play that is to be looked at  for two weeks i worked hard at the sonnets hardly ever going out and refusing all invitations  every day i seemed to be discovering something new and willie hughes became to me a kind of spiritual presence an everdominant personality  i could almost fancy that i saw him standing in the shadow of my room so well had shakespeare drawn him with his golden hair his tender flowerlike grace his dreamy deepsunken eyes his delicate mobile limbs and his white lily hands  his very name fascinated me  willie hughes  willie hughes  how musically it sounded  yes who else but he could have been the mastermistress of shakespeares passion 1 the lord of his love to whom he was bound in vassalage 2 the delicate minion of pleasure 3 the rose of the whole world 4 the herald of the spring 5 decked in the proud livery of youth 6 the lovely boy whom it was sweet music to hear 7 and whose beauty was the very raiment of shakespeares heart 8 as it was the keystone of his dramatic power  how bitter now seemed the whole tragedy of his desertion and his shameshame that he made sweet and lovely 9 by the mere magic of his personality but that was none the less shame yet as shakespeare forgave him should not we forgive him also  i did not care to pry into the mystery of his sin  his abandonment of shakespeares theatre was a different matter and i investigated it at great length  finally i came to the conclusion that cyril graham had been wrong in regarding the rival dramatist of the 80th sonnet as chapman  it was obviously marlowe who was alluded to  at the time the sonnets were written such an expression as the proud full sail of his great verse could not have been used of chapmans work however applicable it might have been to the style of his later jacobean plays  no  marlowe was clearly the rival dramatist of whom shakespeare spoke in such laudatory terms and that   affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence   was the mephistopheles of his doctor faustus  no doubt marlowe was fascinated by the beauty and grace of the boyactor and lured him away from the blackfriars theatre that he might play the gaveston of his edward ii  that shakespeare had the legal right to retain willie hughes in his own company is evident from sonnet lxxxvii where he says   farewell thou art too dear for my possessing and like enough thou knowst thy estimate the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing my bonds in thee are all determinate for how do i hold thee but by thy granting and for that riches where is my deserving the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting and so my patent back again is swerving thyself thou gayest thy own worth then not knowing or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking so thy great gift upon misprision growing comes home again on better judgement making thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter in sleep a king but waking no such matter   but him whom he could not hold by love he would not hold by force willie hughes became a member of lord pembrokes company and perhaps in the open yard of the red bull tavern played the part of king edwards delicate minion  on marlowes death he seems to have returned to shakespeare who whatever his fellowpartners may have thought of the matter was not slow to forgive the wilfulness and treachery of the young actor  how well too had shakespeare drawn the temperament of the stage player  willie hughes was one of those   that do not do the thing they most do show who moving others are themselves as stone   he could act love but could not feel it could mimic passion without realising it   in manys looks the false hearts history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange   but with willie hughes it was not so  heaven says shakespeare in a sonnet of mad idolatry    heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell   in his inconstant mind and his false heart it was easy to recognise the insincerity and treachery that somehow seem inseparable from the artistic nature as in his love of praise that desire for immediate recognition that characterises all actors  and yet more fortunate in this than other actors willie hughes was to know something of immortality  inseparably connected with shakespeares plays he was to live in them  your name from hence immortal life shall have though i once gone to all the world must die the earth can yield me but a common grave when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie your monument shall be my gentle verse which eyes not yet created shall oerread and tongues to be your being shall rehearse when all the breathers of this world are dead   there were endless allusions also to willie hughess power over his audiencethe gazers as shakespeare calls them but perhaps the most perfect description of his wonderful mastery over dramatic art was in a lovers complaint where shakespeare says of him   in him a plenitude of subtle matter applied to cautels all strange forms receives of burning blushes or of weeping water or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves in eithers aptness as it best deceives to blush at speeches rank to weep at woes or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows           so on the tip of his subduing tongue all kind of arguments and questions deep all replication prompt and reason strong for his advantage still did wake and sleep to make the weeper laugh the laugher weep he had the dialect and the different skill catching all passions in his craft of will   once i thought that i had really found willie hughes in elizabethan literature  in a wonderfully graphic account of the last days of the great earl of essex his chaplain thomas knell tells us that the night before the earl died he called william hewes which was his musician to play upon the virginals and to sing  play said he my song will hewes and i will sing it to myself  so he did it most joyfully not as the howling swan which still looking down waileth her end but as a sweet lark lifting up his hands and casting up his eyes to his god with this mounted the crystal skies and reached with his unwearied tongue the top of highest heavens surely the boy who played on the virginals to the dying father of sidneys stella was none other but the will hews to whom shakespeare dedicated the sonnets and who he tells us was himself sweet music to hear  yet lord essex died in 1576 when shakespeare himself was but twelve years of age  it was impossible that his musician could have been the mr w h of the sonnets  perhaps shakespeares young friend was the son of the player upon the virginals  it was at least something to have discovered that will hews was an elizabethan name  indeed the name hews seemed to have been closely connected with music and the stage  the first english actress was the lovely margaret hews whom prince rupert so madly loved  what more probable than that between her and lord essexs musician had come the boyactor of shakespeares plays  but the proofs the links where were they  alas i could not find them  it seemed to me that i was always on the brink of absolute verification but that i could never really attain to it  from willie hughess life i soon passed to thoughts of his death  i used to wonder what had been his end  perhaps he had been one of those english actors who in 1604 went across sea to germany and played before the great duke henry julius of brunswick himself a dramatist of no mean order and at the court of that strange elector of brandenburg who was so enamoured of beauty that he was said to have bought for his weight in amber the young son of a travelling greek merchant and to have given pageants in honour of his slave all through that dreadful famine year of 16067 when the people died of hunger in the very streets of the town and for the space of seven months there was no rain  we know at any rate that romeo and juliet was brought out at dresden in 1613 along with hamlet and king lear and it was surely to none other than willie hughes that in 1615 the deathmask of shakespeare was brought by the hand of one of the suite of the english ambassador pale token of the passing away of the great poet who had so dearly loved him  indeed there would have been something peculiarly fitting in the idea that the boyactor whose beauty had been so vital an element in the realism and romance of shakespeares art should have been the first to have brought to germany the seed of the new culture and was in his way the precursor of that aufklarung or illumination of the eighteenth century that splendid movement which though begun by lessing and herder and brought to its full and perfect issue by goethe was in no small part helped on by another actorfriedrich schroederwho awoke the popular consciousness and by means of the feigned passions and mimetic methods of the stage showed the intimate the vital connection between life and literature  if this was soand there was certainly no evidence against itit was not improbable that willie hughes was one of those english comedians mimae quidam ex britannia as the old chronicle calls them who were slain at nuremberg in a sudden uprising of the people and were secretly buried in a little vineyard outside the city by some young men who had found pleasure in their performances and of whom some had sought to be instructed in the mysteries of the new art  certainly no more fitting place could there be for him to whom shakespeare said thou art all my art than this little vineyard outside the city walls  for was it not from the sorrows of dionysos that tragedy sprang  was not the light laughter of comedy with its careless merriment and quick replies first heard on the lips of the sicilian vinedressers  nay did not the purple and red stain of the winefroth on face and limbs give the first suggestion of the charm and fascination of disguisethe desire for selfconcealment the sense of the value of objectivity thus showing itself in the rude beginnings of the art  at any rate wherever he laywhether in the little vineyard at the gate of the gothic town or in some dim london churchyard amidst the roar and bustle of our great city no gorgeous monument marked his restingplace  his true tomb as shakespeare saw was the poets verse his true monument the permanence of the drama  so had it been with others whose beauty had given a new creative impulse to their age  the ivory body of the bithynian slave rots in the green ooze of the nile and on the yellow hills of the cerameicus is strewn the dust of the young athenian but antinous lives in sculpture and charmides in philosophy    chapter iii    after three weeks had elapsed i determined to make a strong appeal to erskine to do justice to the memory of cyril graham and to give to the world his marvellous interpretation of the sonnetsthe only interpretation that thoroughly explained the problem  i have not any copy of my letter i regret to say nor have i been able to lay my hand upon the original but i remember that i went over the whole ground and covered sheets of paper with passionate reiteration of the arguments and proofs that my study had suggested to me  it seemed to me that i was not merely restoring cyril graham to his proper place in literary history but rescuing the honour of shakespeare himself from the tedious memory of a commonplace intrigue  i put into the letter all my enthusiasm  i put into the letter all my faith  no sooner in fact had i sent it off than a curious reaction came over me  it seemed to me that i had given away my capacity for belief in the willie hughes theory of the sonnets that something had gone out of me as it were and that i was perfectly indifferent to the whole subject  what was it that had happened  it is difficult to say  perhaps by finding perfect expression for a passion i had exhausted the passion itself  emotional forces like the forces of physical life have their positive limitations perhaps the mere effort to convert any one to a theory involves some form of renunciation of the power of credence  perhaps i was simply tired of the whole thing and my enthusiasm having burnt out my reason was left to its own unimpassioned judgment  however it came about and i cannot pretend to explain it there was no doubt that willie hughes suddenly became to me a mere myth an idle dream the boyish fancy of a young man who like most ardent spirits was more anxious to convince others than to be himself convinced  as i had said some very unjust and bitter things to erskine in my letter i determined to go and see him at once and to make my apologies to him for my behaviour  accordingly the next morning i drove down to birdcage walk and found erskine sitting in his library with the forged picture of willie hughes in front of him  my dear erskine i cried i have come to apologise to you  to apologise to me he said  what for  for my letter i answered  you have nothing to regret in your letter he said  on the contrary you have done me the greatest service in your power  you have shown me that cyril grahams theory is perfectly sound  you dont mean to say that you believe in willie hughes i exclaimed  why not he rejoined  you have proved the thing to me  do you think i cannot estimate the value of evidence  but there is no evidence at all i groaned sinking into a chair when i wrote to you i was under the influence of a perfectly silly enthusiasm  i had been touched by the story of cyril grahams death fascinated by his romantic theory enthralled by the wonder and novelty of the whole idea  i see now that the theory is based on a delusion  the only evidence for the existence of willie hughes is that picture in front of you and the picture is a forgery dont be carried away by mere sentiment in this matter  whatever romance may have to say about the willie hughes theory reason is dead against it  i dont understand you said erskine looking at me in amazement why you yourself have convinced me by your letter that willie hughes is an absolute reality  why have you changed your mind  or is all that you have been saying to me merely a joke  i cannot explain it to you i rejoined but i see now that there is really nothing to be said in favour of cyril grahams interpretation  the sonnets are addressed to lord pembroke  for heavens sake dont waste your time in a foolish attempt to discover a young elizabethan actor who never existed and to make a phantom puppet the centre of the great cycle of shakespeares sonnets  i see that you dont understand the theory he replied  my dear erskine i cried not understand it  why i feel as if i had invented it  surely my letter shows you that i not merely went into the whole matter but that i contributed proofs of every kind the one flaw in the theory is that it presupposes the existence of the person whose existence is the subject of dispute  if we grant that there was in shakespeares company a young actor of the name of willie hughes it is not difficult to make him the object of the sonnets  but as we know that there was no actor of this name in the company of the globe theatre it is idle to pursue the investigation further  but that is exactly what we dont know said erskine  it is quite true that his name does not occur in the list given in the first folio but as cyril pointed out that is rather a proof in favour of the existence of willie hughes than against it if we remember his treacherous desertion of shakespeare for a rival dramatist  we argued the matter over for hours but nothing that i could say could make erskine surrender his faith in cyril grahams interpretation  he told me that he intended to devote his life to proving the theory and that he was determined to do justice to cyril grahams memory  i entreated him laughed at him begged of him but it was of no use  finally we parted not exactly in anger but certainly with a shadow between us  he thought me shallow i thought him foolish  when i called on him again his servant told me that he had gone to germany  two years afterwards as i was going into my club the hallporter handed me a letter with a foreign postmark  it was from erskine and written at the hotel dangleterre cannes  when i had read it i was filled with horror though i did not quite believe that he would be so mad as to carry his resolve into execution  the gist of the letter was that he had tried in every way to verify the willie hughes theory and had failed and that as cyril graham had given his life for this theory he himself had determined to give his own life also to the same cause  the concluding words of the letter were these  i still believe in willie hughes and by the time you receive this i shall have died by my own hand for willie hughess sake  for his sake and for the sake of cyril graham whom i drove to his death by my shallow scepticism and ignorant lack of faith the truth was once revealed to you and you rejected it  it comes to you now stained with the blood of two livesdo not turn away from it  it was a horrible moment  i felt sick with misery and yet i could not believe it  to die for ones theological beliefs is the worst use a man can make of his life but to die for a literary theory it seemed impossible  i looked at the date  the letter was a week old  some unfortunate chance had prevented my going to the club for several days or i might have got it in time to save him  perhaps it was not too late i drove off to my rooms packed up my things and started by the nightmail from charing cross  the journey was intolerable  i thought i would never arrive  as soon as i did i drove to the hotel langleterre  they told me that erskine had been buried two days before in the english cemetery  there was something horribly grotesque about the whole tragedy  i said all kinds of wild things and the people in the hall looked curiously at me  suddenly lady erskine in deep mourning passed across the vestibule  when she saw me she came up to me murmured something about her poor son and burst into tears  i led her into her sittingroom  an elderly gentleman was there waiting for her  it was the english doctor  we talked a great deal about erskine but i said nothing about his motive for committing suicide  it was evident that he had not told his mother anything about the reason that had driven him to so fatal so mad an act  finally lady erskine rose and said george left you something as a memento  it was a thing he prized very much  i will get it for you  as soon as she had left the room i turned to the doctor and said what a dreadful shock it must have been to lady erskine  i wonder that she bears it as well as she does  oh she knew for months past that it was coming he answered  knew it for months past i cried  but why didnt she stop him why didnt she have him watched  he must have been mad  the doctor stared at me i dont know what you mean he said  well i cried if a mother knows that her son is going to commit suicide  suicide he answered  poor erskine did not commit suicide  he died of consumption  he came here to die  the moment i saw him i knew that there was no hope  one lung was almost gone and the other was very much affected  three days before he died he asked me was there any hope  i told him frankly that there was none and that he had only a few days to live  he wrote some letters and was quite resigned retaining his senses to the last  at that moment lady erskine entered the room with the fatal picture of willie hughes in her hand  when george was dying he begged me to give you this she said  as i took it from her her tears fell on my hand  the picture hangs now in my library where it is very much admired by my artistic friends  they have decided that it is not a clouet but an oudry  i have never cared to tell them its true history but sometimes when i look at it i think that there is really a great deal to be said for the willie hughes theory of shakespeares sonnets    footnotes  1  sonnet xx 2  2  sonnet xxvi 1  3  sonnet cxxvi 9  4  sonnet cix 14  5  sonnet i 10  6  sonnet ii 3  7  sonnet viii 1  8  sonnet xxii 6  9  sonnet xcv 1
