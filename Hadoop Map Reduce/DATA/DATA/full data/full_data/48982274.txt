48982274	illustration he was a noticeably handsome figure as he sat alone in the box  see p 31     the  light of the star   a novel   by  hamlin garland  author of hesper  the captain of the grayhorse troop  etc etc   new york and london  harper  brothers  publishers mcmiv     the light of the star  published may 1904     the light of the star     i   after the appointment with miss merival reached him through the hand of her manager young douglass grew feverishly impatient of the long days which lay between waiting became a species of heroism each morning he reread his manuscript and each evening found him at the theatre partly to while away the time but mainly in order that he might catch some clew to the real woman behind the shining mask his brain was filled with the light of the starher radiance dazzled him  by day he walked the streets seeing her name on every billboard catching the glow of her subtle and changeful beauty in every window she gazed out at him from brows weary with splendid barbaric jewels her eyes bitter and disdainful and hopelessly sad she smiled at him in framework of blue and ermine and pearlsthe bedecked heartless coquette of the pleasureseeking world she stood in the shadow of gray walls a grating over her head with deep soulful girlish eyes lifted in piteous appeal and in each of these characters an unfathomed depth remained to vex and to allure him  magnified by these reflections on the walls haloed by the teeming praise and censure of the press she seemed to dominate the entire city as she had come to absorb the best of his own life what her private character really was no one seemed to know in spite of the special articles and interviews with her managers which fed the almost universal adulation of her dark and changeful face her savage and sovereign beauty there was insolence in her tread and mad allurement in the rounded beauty of her powerful white armand at his weakest the young playwright admitted that all else concerning her was of no account  at the same time he insisted that he was not involved with the womanonly with the actress i am not a loveri am a playwright eager to have my heroine adequately portrayed he contended with himself in the solitude of his room high in one of the great apartment buildings of the middle city nevertheless the tremor in his nerves caused him thought  her voice yes that too was mysterious whence came that undertone like the moan of a weary wastrel tortured with dreams of idyllic innocence long lost why did her utterance like her glorious face always suggest some inner darker meaning there were times when she seemed oldold as vice and cruelty hoarse with complaints with curses and then again her lips were childishly sweet and her voice carried only the wistful accents of adolescence or the melody of girlish awe  on the night before his appointment she played the baroness telka a lurid lustful remorseless womana creature with a vampires heart and the glamour of helen of troya woman whose cheeks were still round and smooth but whose eyes were alight with the flame of insanitya frightful hungry soulless wretch and as he sat at the play and watched that glittering inexplicable woman and thought of her rôles douglass asked himself how will she meet me tomorrow what will be the light in her eyes when she turns them upon me will she meet me alonehaughty weary with praise or will she be surrounded by those who bow to her as to a queen this latter thing he feared  he had not been without experience with womeneven with actresses but no woman he had ever met had appealed to his imagination beyond the first meeting would it be so with helen merival he had loved twice in his life but not well enough to say so to either of his sweethearts around myras name clung the perfume and moonlight of summer evenings in the faroff midcontinent village where he was born while violet recalled the music the comfort and the security of a beautiful eastern home neither of these sweet and lovely girls had won his heart completely how was it that this woman of the blazoning billboards had already put more of passion into his heart than they of the pure and sheltered life  he did not deceive himself it was because helen could not be understood at a glance she appealed to his imagination as some strange birdalien voyagerfled from distant islands in dim purple seas she typed the dreams of adventuring youth seeking the princesses of other and more romantic lands  at times he shuddered with a fear that some hidden decay of helen merivals own soul enabled her to so horrify her audience with these desolating rôles and when the curtain fell on the baroness he was resolved to put aside the chance of meeting the actress was it worth while to be made ashamed and bitter she might stand revealed as a coarse and selfish courtesana worn and haggard enchantress whose failing life blazed back to youth only when on the stage why be disenchanted but in the end he rose above this boyish doubt what does it matter whether she be true or false she has genius and genius i need for my playgenius and power and in the delusion he rested  he climbed to his den in the tower as physically wearied as one exhausted with running a race and fell asleep with his eyelids fluttering in a feverish dream  the hour of his appointment with her fell upon sunday and as he walked up the street towards her hotel the bells in a church on a side street were ringing and their chimes filled his mind with memories of the small town from which he came how peaceful and sweet the life of woodstock seemed now the little meetinghouse whose shingled spire still pointed at the stars would always be sweet with the memory of myra thurber whose timid clasp upon his arm troubled him then and pained him now he had so little to give in return for her devotiontherefore he had given nothing he had said goodbye almost harshlyhis ambition hardening his heart to her appeal  around him in his dream of those faroff days moved other agile formsyoung lovers like myra and himself their feet creaking on the glittering snow they stepped slowly though the bells called and called the moonlight was not more clear and untouched of baleful fire than myras sweet eyes looking up at him and now he was walking the wet pavement of the great metropolis with the clang and grind of cars all about him on his way to meet a woman whose life was spent in simulating acts as destructive as myras had been serene and trustful at the moment he saw his own life as a thread in some mysterious drama  to what does it lead he asked as he drew under the overhanging portal of the great hotel where the star made her home it was to the man of the west a splendid place its builders had been lavish of highly colored marbles and mosaics spendthrift of light and gilding on every side shone the signs and seals of predatory wealth its walls were like costly confectionery its ornaments insolent its waste criminal every decorative feature was hot restless irreverent and cruel quite the sort of avenue one might expect to find in his walk towards the glittering woman of the false and ribald drama  she chose her abode with instinctive bad taste he said bitterly and again his weakness his folly turned him cold for with all his physical powers he was shy to the point of fear  he made a sober and singular spot in the blaze of the rotunda so sombre was his look so intent his gaze youths in high hats and shining shirtfronts stood in groups conversing loudly and in the resplendent dininghall bediamonded women and their sleekhaired heavyjewelled partners were eating leisurely attended by swarms of waiters so eager they trod upon one anothers feet  the clerk eyed him in impassible silence as he took out his worn cardcase saying please send my card to miss merival  miss merival is not receiving any one this evening the clerk answered with a tone which was like the slap of a wet glove in the face  douglass faced him with a look which made him reflect you will let her be the judge of that he said and his tone was that of one accustomed to be obeyed  the little man bowed oh certainly mr douglass but as she left orders  when the boy with his card had disappeared into the candycolored distances the playwright found himself again studying the face of his incomprehensible sorceress who looked down upon him even at that moment from a bulletinboard on the hotel wall oriental savage and sullensad too as though alone in her solitary splendor she cant be all of her partswhich one of them will i find as i enter her room he asked himself for the hundredth time  miss merival will see mr douglass said the bellboy this way sir  as he stepped into the elevator the young mans face grew stern and his lips straightened out into a grim line it was absurd to think he should be so deeply moved by any woman alive he who prided himself on his selfpossession  down a long hall on the tenth floor the boy led him and tapped at a door which was opened after a pause by a quiet woman who greeted him with outstretched hand kindly cordial  how do you do mr douglass it is very good of you to come she said with the simplest inflection  this must be an elder sister he thought and followed her into a large sittingroom where a grayhaired woman and a young man were sipping afterdinner coffee  mother this is mr douglass the author of the modern stage the little book of essays we liked so well the elderly lady greeted him cordially but with a timid air and this is my brother hugh the young man gave douglasss hand a firm and cordial grip  sit down pleasenot thereover here where the light will fall on you i want to see how you look she added in smiling candor and with that smile he recognized in his hostess the great actress  he was fairly dazed and for the moment entirely wordless from the very moment the door had opened to him the glittering woman had been receding into remote and ever remoter distances for the helen merival before him was as simple candid and cordial as his own sister her voice had the home inflection she displayed neither paint nor powder her hair was plainly brushedbeautiful hair it was tooand her dress was lovely and in quiet taste  her face seemed plain at first just as her stature seemed small she was dark but not so dark as she appeared on the stage and her face was thinner a little careworn it seemed to him and her eyesthose leering wicked eyeswere large and deep and soft her figure was firm compact womanly and modest in every line no wife could have seemed more of the home than this famous actress who faced him with hands folded in her lap  he was stupefied suddenly he perceived the injustice and the crass folly of his estimate of her character and with this perception came a broader and deeper realization of her greatness as an actress her real self now became more complex than his wildest imagined ideal of her that this sweet and reflective girl should be the actress was as difficult to understand as that the baroness should be at heart a good woman for five minutes he hardly heard what she said so busy was his mind readjusting itself to this abrupt displacement of values with noiseless suddenness all the lurid light which the advertiser had thrown around the star died away the faces which mocked and mourned the clutching hands the lines of barbaric ornaments the golden goblets of debauchery the jewelled daggers the poison phialsall those accessories designed to produce the siren of the posters faded out and he found himself face to face with a human being like himself a thoughtful selfcontained and rather serious american girl of twentysix or twentyeight years of age  not merely this but her attitude towards him was that of a pupil she lifted eyes to him as to one occupying an intellectual height she began to tell him how much she enjoyed his little book on the drama which a friend had recommended to her but as soon as he had fairly recovered himself he led her away from his own work i am supposed to be an architect he explained i write of the stage because i love itand because i am a failure in my profession my book is a very slight and unambitious attempt  but you know the stage and its principles she insisted and your view of the future is an inspiration to those of us who wish to do good work your letter was very helpful to me for i am deeply discouraged just now i am disgusted with the drama in which i work i am weary of these unwholesome parts you are quite right i shall never do my best work so long as i am forced to assume such uncongenial rôles they are all false every one of them they are good acting rôles as acting goes but i want plays that i can live as well as act but my manager tells me that the public will not have me in anything else do you think they would is he right she ended in appeal  i think the public will take you at your best in anything you do he replied with grave gallantry i dont know that managers are omniscient they are only men like the rest of us  she smiled that is high treason but im very much inclined to believe it is true i am willing to concede that a theatre must be made to pay but i am not content to think that this splendid art is always to be measured by the number of dollars which fall into the boxoffice take westervelt as a type what ideals has he none whatever save to find a play that will run forever and advertise itself  she had dreams too it seemed she glowed with her plans and as she timidly presented them douglass perceived that the woman was entirely unconscious of the false glamour the whirling light and tumult which outsiders connected with her name at the centre of the illumination she sat looking out upon the glorified billboards the gay shop windows the crowded auditoriums a wholesome kindly intelligent woman subject to moods of discouragement like himself unwilling to be a slave to a moneygrubber something in his face encouraged the story of her struggles she passed to her personal history while he listened as one enthralled  the actress fled and the woman drew near she looked into the mans eyes frankly unshrinkingly with humor with appeal she leaned towards him and her face grew exquisitely tender and beautiful oh it was a struggle mother kept boarders in order that hugh and i might go to schooldidnt you dear old muz she laid her hand on her mothers knee and the mother clasped it fathers health grew worse and worse and at last he died and then i had to leave school to help earn our living i began to read for entertainments of various sorts father was a grand army man and the posts took an interest in my reading i really earned a thousand dollars the second year i doubled that the next year and considered myself a great public success she smiled mother may i let mr douglass see how i looked then  the mother nodded consent and the great actress after a few moments search returned with a package of circulars each bearing a piquant girlish face  there she said as she handed them to douglass i felt the full ecstasy of power when that picture was taken in this i wore a new gown and a new hat and i was earning fifty dollars at each reading my success fairly bewildered me but oh wasnt it glorious i took mother out of a tenement and put her in a lovely little home i sent hugh to college i refurnished the house i bought pictures and rugs for you know i continued to earn over two thousand a year and what fun we had in spending all that money  but how did you reach the stage he asked  she laughed by way of the kerosene circuit if you know what that means  ive heard the phrase he answered it corresponds to the oldtime barnstorming doesnt it  it does  hugh interposed i wouldnt go into that sis  why not its great funnow i used to think it pretty tragic sometimes yes i was nineteen when i went on the new england rural circuitto give it a better name oh ive been through all the steps as soon as i felt a little secure about mother i ventured to new york in answer to advertisements in the reflector and went out on the road at fifteen per these slang phrases seemed humorous as they came from her smiling lips but douglass knew some little part of the toil and discomfort they stood for  her eyes danced with fun i played the lady of lyons in a kitchen set and the deathscene in east lynne before a wood drop and my costumes were something marvellous werent they mother well this lasted two seasonssummer seasons while i continued to read in winter in order to indulge my passion for the stage in summer and early autumn then i secured a small part in a real company and at a salary that permitted me to send some money home i knocked about the country this way two seasons morethat makes me twentytwo i knew the office of every manager in new york by this time but had been able to reach an audience with but one or two they were kind enough but failed to see anything in me as the phrase goes and i was quite disheartened oh the rialto her face clouded and her voice softened it is a brilliant and amusing place to the successful but to the girl who walks it seeking a theatrical engagement it is a heartless and cruel place you can see them there todaygirls eager and earnest and ready to work hard and conscientiouslyhaunting the agencies and the anterooms of the managers just as i did in those daysonly five years ago  it seems incredible exclaimed douglass i thought you came here from a london success  so i did and that is the miraculous chapter of my story i went to london with farnumwith only a little partbut mclennan saw me and liked my work and asked me to take the american adventuress in his new play and thenmy fortune was made the play was only a partial success but my own position was established i continued to play the gay and evilminded french and russian woman of the english stage till i was tired of them then i tried joan of arc and charlotte corday the public forced me back to the baroness telka and to wealth and great fame and then i read your little book which seemed directed straight to me and i asked hugh to write younow you have the story of me life i have had no struggle sinceonly hard work and great acclaim she faced her mother with a proud smile then her face darkened butthere is always a buti want new york to know me in some better way im tired of these women with cigarettes and spangled dinnergowns  she laid her hand again on her mothers knee and the gentle old fingers closed around the firm smooth wrist  ive told mother that i will cut these rôles out we are at last in a position to do as we please i am now waiting for something worth while to come to me that is my present situation mr douglass i dont know why ive been so frank now let me hear your play  he flushed a little to tell the truth i find it rather hard to begin i feel as though i were reenacting a wornout scene in some way every other man in the car writes plays nowadays and torments his friends by reading to them which i admit is an abominable practice however as i came here for that express purpose i will at least outline my scenario  didnt you bring the play itself  yes but really i hesitate it may bore you to death  you could not write a play that would bore mei am sure of that  very well he soberly answered and drew forth his manuscript as if upon signal the mother and her son rose to withdraw you are entirely justified said douglass with some humor i quite understand your feelings  we should like very much to hear it but  no excuses i beg of you i wonder at miss merivals hardihood i am quite sure she will live to repent her temerity  in this spirit of banter the playwright and the star were left alone with the manuscript of the play as he read on douglass was carried out of his own impassivity by the changes in the face before him it became once more elusive duskily mysterious in its lines a reflective shadow darkened the glorious eyes veiled by drooping lids without knowing it the actress took on from moment to moment the hearttrials of the woman of the play in a subconscious way even as he read douglass analyzed and understood her power hers was a soul of swift and subtle sympathy a word a mere inflection was sufficient to set in motion the most complicate and obscure conceptions in her brain permitting her to comprehend with equal clarity the egyptian queen of pleasure and the austere devotee to whom joy is a snare from time to time she uttered little exclamations of pleasure and at the end of each act motioned him to proceed as if eager to get a unified impression  it was after eleven oclock when he threw down the manuscript and white with emotion awaited her verdict she was tense with the strain and her lashes were wet with tears but her eyes were bright and her mind alert she had already entered upon a new part having been swept up into a region of resolution as far away from the pleasant hostess as from the heartless adventuress whose garments she had worn but the night before with hands clasped between her knees and shoulders laxly drooping she brooded on the sorrows of his mimic world  i will do your play she said at last i will do it because i believe in its method and because i think it worthy of my highest powers  the blood rushed to the playwrights throat and a smarting heat dimmed his eyes he spoke with difficulty i thank you he said hoarsely it is more than i expected and now that you have promised to do it i feel you ought not to take the risk he could say no more overcome by the cordial emphasis of her decision  there is a risk i will be frank with you but your play is worth it i have not been so powerfully moved in years you have thrilled me really i cannot tell you how deeply your theme has sunk into my heart you have the northern conscienceso have i that is why i rebel at being merely the plaything of a careless public yes i will do your play it is a work of genius i hope you wrote it in a garret its the kind of thing to come from a diet of black bread and water  he smiled i live in a sort of garret and my meals are frequently beans and brown bread i hope that will do  i am glad the bread is at least brown but you are tired leave the manuscript with me he rose and she moved towards him with a gesture of confidence which made words impossible to him when we meet again i want you to tell me something of yourself goodnight you will hear from me soon she was regal as she said thisregal in her own proper person and he went away rapt with wonder and admiration of the real helen merival as she now stood revealed to him  she is greater than my dreams of her he said in a sort of rapture as he walked the street she is greater than she herself can know for her genius is of the subtle unspeakable deepsbelow her own consciousness beyond her own analysis how much greater her art seems now that i have seen her it is marvellous she will do my play and she will succeedher power as an actress would carry it to a success if it were a bad play which it is not my day has dawned at last                                       helen went to bed that night with a consciousness that something new and powerful had come into her life not merely the play and her determination to do it moved herthe man himself profoundly impressed her his seriousness his decision and directness of utterance and the idealism which shone from his rugged boyish face remained with her to the verge of sleep he was very handsome and his voice singularly beautiful but his power to charm lay over and beyond these his sincere eyes his freedom from flippant slang these impressed her with a sense of his reliability his moral worth  he is stern and harsh but he is fine she said to her mother next morning and his play is very strong i am going to do it you will like the part of lillian it has the scotch sense of moral responsibility in it     ii   douglass rose next morning with a bound as if life had somehow become surcharged with fresh significance fresh opportunity his professional career seemed dull and prosaichis critical work of small avail his whole mind centred on his play  his was a moody sensitive nature stern as he looked and strong as he really was he could be depressed by a trifle or exalted by a word and reviewing his meeting with helen in the light of the morning he had more than a suspicion that he had allowed himself to talk too freely in the presence of the brother and mother and that he had been overenthusiastic not to say egotistic but he was saved from dejection by the memory of the stars great brownblack eyes there was no pretence in them she had been raptcarried out of conventional words and graces by something which rose from the lines he had written the characters he had depicted  the deeper his scrutiny went the more important she became to him she was not simpleshe was very complex and an artist of wonderful range and certainty of appeal he liked the plain and simple almost angular gestures and attitudes she used when talking to him they were so broadly indicative of the real helen merival and so far from the affectations he had expected to see of course she was the actressthe mobility of her face her command of herself was far beyond that of any untrained woman no matter how versatile but she was nobly the actress broadened and deepened by her art  he was very eager to see her again and as the day wore on this desire grew to be an ache at his heart most disturbing he became very restless at last and did little but walk around the park returning occasionally as the hour for the postman came i dont know why i should expect a letter from her i know well the dilatory methods of theatrical peopleand today is rehearsal too i am unreasonable if i hear from her in a week i may count myself lucky  a message from the dramatic editor of the blazon asking him to do a special study of an english actor opening that night at the broadway annoyed him i cant do it he answered i have another engagement and recklessly put aside the opportunity to earn a weeks board so exalted was he by reason of the word of the woman  at dinner he lacked appetite entirely and as he had taken but an egg and a cup of coffee for breakfast and had missed luncheon altogether he began to question himself as to the meaning of his ailment with sad attempt at humor it isnt exactly as serious as dying even if she reconsiders and returns my play i can still make a living he would not admit that any other motive was involved  he had barely returned to his room before a knock at the door announced a boy with a note as he took it in his hand his nerves tingled as though he had touched the wondrous womans hand the note was brief yet fateful       i enclose a ticket for the managers box i hope you can come i      want to talk about your play i will send my brother to bring you      in back to see me i have been rehearsing all the afternoon but i      reread the play this morning while in bed i like it better and      better but you can do more with iti feel that you have      suppressed the poetry here and there my quarrel with you realists      is that you are afraid to put into your representations of life the      emotions that make life a dynamic thing but it is stirring and      suggestive as it is come in and talk with me for i am full of it      and see great possibilities in the final act  his hands were tremulous and his eyes glowing as he put the note down and faced himself in the glass the pleasure of meeting her again under such conditions made him forget for the moment the rôle she was to playa part he particularly detested truly he was the most fortunate and distinguished of mento be thus taken by the hand and lifted from nameless obscurity to the most desired position beside a great star  he dressed with unusual care and was a noticeably handsome figure as he sat alone in the box and elated tense selfconscious when she came on and walked close down to the footlights nearest him flashing a glance of recognition into his eyes his breath quickened and his face flushed a swift interchange of light and fire took place at the moment her eyelids fell she recoiled as if in dismay then turned and apparently forgot him and every one else in the fervor of her art  a transforming readjustment of all the lines of her face took place she became sinister mocking and pitiless an exultant cruelty croaked in her voice minute repulsive remodellings of her neck and cheeks changed her to a harpy and seeing these evidences of her great genius douglass grew bitterly resentful and when she laughed with the action of a vulture thrusting her head forward from the shoulders he sickened and turned away it was marvellous work but how desecrating to her glorious womanhood coming so close on that moment of mystic tenderness it was horrible my god she must not play such parts they will leave their mark upon her  when the curtain fell he did not applaud but drew back into the shadow sullen brooding sorrowful in the tableau which followed the recall her eyes again sought for him though she still moved in character and the curtain fell upon the scene while yet she was seeking him  here now began a transformation in the man he had come to the theatre tremulous with eagerness to look upon her face to touch her hand but when her brother entered the box saying mr douglass this is the best time to see my sister he rose slowly with a curious reluctance  through devious passages beneath the theatre hugh led the way while with greater poignancy than ever before the young playwright sensed the vulgarity the immodesty and the dirt of the world behind and below the scenes it was all familiar enough to him for he had several friends among the actors but the thought of one so sovereign as helen in the midst of a region so squalid stung him he was jealous of the actors the sceneshifters who were permitted to see her come and go  he was reserved and rather pale but perfectly selfcontained as he entered the little receptionhall leading to her dressingroom he faced her with a sense of dreadapprehensive of some disenchantment she met him cordially without the slightest reference to her makeup which was less offensive than he had feared but he winced nevertheless at the vulgarity of her part so skilfully suggested by paint and powder she gave him her hand with a frank gesture you didnt applaud my scenes tonight she said with a smile as enigmatic as the one she used in the baroness  his voice was curt with emotion as he replied no i did not i couldnt they saddened me  what do you mean she asked with a startled anxious paling beneath her rouge  his voice was low but fiercely reproachful in answer i mean you should treat your beautiful self and your splendid art with greater consideration  you mean i should not be playing such women i know iti hate them but no one ever accused me of taking my art lightly i work harder on these uncongenial rôles than upon any other they require infinitely more effort because i loathe them so  i mean more than that i am afraid to have you simulate such passions they will leave their mark on you it is defilement your womanhood is too fine too beautiful to be so degraded  she put her hand to her bosom and looked about her restlessly his intensity scared her i know what you mean but let us not talk of that now let us discuss your play i want to suggest something for your third act but i must dress now you will wait wont you we will have a few minutes before i go on please sit here and wait for me  he acquiesced silently as was his fashion there was little of the courtier about him but he became very ill at ease as he realized how significant his waiting must seem to those who saw him there deeply in the snare as he was this sitting beside an actresss dressingroom door became intolerable to his arrogant soul and he was about to flee when hugh came back and engaged him in conversation so gratified was douglass for this kindness he made himself agreeable till such time as helen in brilliant eveningdress came out and when hugh left them together he was less assertive and brusque in manner  she was so luminous so queenly she dissipated his cloud of doubts and scruples and the tremor of the boyish lover came back into his limbs as he turned to meet her his voice all but failed him as he answered to her question  for some ten minutes from behind her mask she talked of the play with enthusiasmher sweet eyes untouched of the part she was about to resume at last she said there is my cue goodbye can you breakfast with us tomorrow at eleventhirty its really a luncheon i know you are an early riser but we will have something substantial will you come  her smooth strong fingers closed cordially on his hand as she spoke and he answered quickly with the greatest pleasure in the world  we can talk at our leisure then goodbye and as she opened the canvas door in the boxscene he heard her say with high cool insulting voice ah my dear countess you are early she was the baroness again after the fall of the curtain at the end douglass slipped out upon the pavement his eyes blinded by the radiant picture she made in her splendid bridal robes it was desolating to see her represent such a rôle such agony such despair and yet his feet were reluctant to carry him away  he was like a famishing man who has been politely turned from the glittering savory diningroom into the streetonly his hunger immaterial as light was a thousand times keener than that of the one who lacks only bread and meat he demanded her face her voice as one calls for sunlight for air he knew that this day this night marked a new era in his life old things were passed awaynew things sweet incredible things were now happening  nothing like this unrest and deepseated desire had ever come into his life and the realization troubled him as a dangerous weakness it enslaved him and he resented it he secured a new view on his play also with its accusing defiance of dramatic law and custom in this moment of clear vision he was permitted a prevision of helen struggling with the rebellious critics now that he had twice taken her hand he was no longer so indifferent to the warfare of the critics though he knew they could not harm one so powerful as she  in the end of his tumult he wrote her a letter wherein he began by begging her pardon for seeming to interfere in the slightest degree with her work in the world his letter continued       i have back of me the conscience of my scotch forebears and      though my training in college and in my office has covered my      conscience with a layer of office dust it is still there of course      and obviously you are not touched by the words and deeds of the      women you represent but i somehow feel that it is a desecration of      your face and voice to put them to such uses that is the reason i      dreaded to go back and see you tonight if you were seeking praise      of your own proper self the sincerity of this compliment is      unquestionable i ought to say i hope my words tonight did not      disturb you but i will not for i hope to see you speedily drop      all such hideous characters as the baroness telka i felt as an      artist might upon seeing a glorious statue befouled with mire i      say this not because i wish you to do lillian in the light of      last nights performance my own play is a gray autumn day with a      touch of frost in the air it is inconceivable that you should be      vitally interested in it i fear no play that i care to write will      please a sufficient number of people to make its production worth      your while i release you from your promise believe me i am      shaken in my confidence tonight your audience seemed so      heartless so debased of taste they applauded most loudly the      things most revolting to me since i have come to know you i cannot      afford to have you make a sacrifice of yourself to produce my play      much as i desire to see you in new characters  as he dropped this letter into the box a stormwave of his former bitterness and selfaccusation swept over him  that ends another attempt to get my play staged her manager will unquestionably refuse to consider it     iii   helen read douglasss letter next morning while still in bed and its forthright assault made her shiver she did not attempt to deceive herself she acknowledged the singular power of this young man to shake her to change her course of action from the first she acknowledged something almost terrifying in the appeal of his eyes a power which he seemed unconscious of his words of condemnation of solicitude troubled her as the praise of no other man in all her life had done he had spoken to her soul making her triumph over the vast audience loathsomealmost criminal  he was handsomea manly manbut so were dozens of others of her wide acquaintance his talent was undeniable but he was still obscure undeveloped a failure as an architect unambitious as a critic though that was his best point his articles in the blazon possessed unusual insight and candor beyond this she knew as little of him as of any other of the young newspaper men who sought her acquaintance and yet he had somehow changed her world for her in these two meetings  she let the letter fall on her breast and lay with her eyes fastened upon a big rose in a pot on the windowsillthe gift of another admirer i do know more of him i know that he is strong sincere he does not flatter menot even to win me to his play he does not hasten to send me flowers and i like him for that if i were to take his point of view all my rôles and half my triumphs would drop from me but is there not a subtle lettingdown a disintegration may he not be right after all  she went over once more the talk of the few moments they had spent together finding each time in all his words less to criticise and more to admire he does not conceal his hate she said and she might have added or his love for she was aware of her dominion and divined though she did not whisper it even to herself that his change of attitude with regard to her rôles came from his change of feeling towards her he has a great career i will not allow him to spoil his own future she decided at length in her own largeminded way and there were sweet girlish lines about her mouth when her mother came in to inquire how she felt  very much like work mamma and im going to catch up on my correspondence mr douglass is coming to take breakfast with us to talk about his play i wish you would see that there is something that a big man can eat                                       the note she sent in answer to his was like herselffirm assured but gentle       mr douglasswhat came you out for to seea reed shaken with      the wind i know my own mind and i am not afraid of my future i      should be sorry to fail of course especially on your account but      a succès destime is certain in your case and my own personal      following is large enoughjoined with the actual lovers of good      dramato make the play pay for itself please come to my      combination breakfast and luncheon as you promised and we can      arrange dates and other details of the production for my mind is      made up i am going to do your play come what will i thank you      for having started all my dormant resolutions into life again i      shall expect you at twelvethirty  having despatched this note by special messenger she serenely set to work on less important matters and met him in modish street dresstrim and neat and very far from the meretricious glitter of the baroness he was glad of this he would have disliked her in négligée no matter how artistic  her greeting was frank and unstudied im glad youve come there are oceans of things to talk over  there was nothing else for me to do but come he replied with a meaning light in his eyes your letter was a command  im sorry it takes a command to bring you to breakfast with us true this is not the breakfast to be given in your honorthat will come later  it would be safer to have it before the play is produced he replied grimly  helen turned to her brother hugh we have in mr douglass a man not sanguine of the success of his play what does that argue  a big hit he promptly replied  the servants came and went deftly and douglass quite lost sight of the fact that the breakfastroom was high in a towerlike hotel for helens long engagement in the city had enabled her to make herself exceedingly comfortable even amid the hectic color and insistent gilt of the hotel embric the apartment not only received the sun a royal privilege in new york but it was gay with flowers both potted and in vases and the walls were decorated with drawings of her own choosing only the furniture remained uncompromisingly of the hotel tone  i did intend to refurnish but mother who retains a little of her old scotch training talked me out of it helen explained in answer to a query is there anything more hopelessly handsome and shining than these chairs theres so little to find fault with and so little to really admire  theyre like a readymade suitunobjectionable but not fit  they have no soul how could they have they were made by machines for undistinguished millions she broke off this discussion i am eager for a run through the park wont you go hugh is my engineer reckless as he looks i find him quite reliable as a tinker and you know the auto is still in the tinkery stage  i have a feeling that it is still in the dangerous stage he said but i will go he said this in a tone of desperation which amused them all very much  it was impossible for him to remain glum in the midst of the good cheer of that luxurious little breakfast with the promise of a ride in the park in prospect a few moments later a young girl miss fanny cummings came in with a young man who looked like an actor but was in fact hughs collegemate and advance man for helen and together they went down to the autocar  there was a welldefined sense of luxury in being in helen merivals party the attendants in the hotel were so genuinely eager to serve her and the carefully considered comfort of everything she possessed was very attractive to a man like george douglass son of a village doctor who had toiled from childhood to earn every dollar he spent to ride in such swift and shining state with any one would have had extraordinary interest and to sit beside helen in the comparative privacy of the rear seat put a boyish glow of romance into his heart her buoyant and sunny spirit reacted on his moody and supersensitive nature till his face shone with pleasure he forgot his bitter letter of the night before and for the moment work and worry were driven from his world he entered upon a dreamlandthe city of menace disappeared  the avenue was gay with promenaders and thick with carriages other autos met them with cordial clamor of gongs and now and then some driver more lawless than hugh dashed past them in reckless race towards the park the playwright had never seen so many of new yorks glittering carriages and the growing arrogance of its wealth took on a new aspect from his newly acquired viewpoint here were rapidly centring the great leaders of art of music of finance here the social climbers were clustering eager to be great in a city of greatness here the chief ones in literature and the drama must come as to a marketplace and with this thought came a mighty uplift surely success is now mine he thought exultantly for here i sit the favored dramatist of this wondrous woman  there was little connected conversationonly short volleys of jests as they whizzed along the splendid drives of the parkbut douglass needed little more than helens shining face to put him at peace with all the world each moment increased their intimacy  he told her of his stern old father a country doctor in the west of the way in which his brother and sisters were scattered from north to south and how he came to set his face eastward while all the others went west  how handsome he is thought helen  how beautiful you are his glances said in answer and both grew young beneath the touch of love  when they were once more in the hotel helen cried out  there isnt your brain washed clear of all doubts come lets to work at the play  he looked down at her with eyes whose glow made her eyelids fall in maidenly defence i am capable of anything you ask he said with quiet power  after a long and spirited discussion of the last act she said well now well put it in rehearsal as soon as you feel that it is ready i believe in doing a part while the spell of its newness is on me i shall put this on in place of the revival of rachel endicott she rose on the wave of her enthusiasm i feel the part taking hold of me i will make lillians duty the greatest success of my life and the lions share of both honor and money shall be yours  he left the hotel quite as exalted as he had been previously depressed the pleasure of sitting by her side for four blessed hours enriched him to the point of being sorry for all the rest of the world the prince of wales had been denied an introduction to her he had read therefore the prince was poor     iv   the reading of the play took place on the monday morning following and was an exceedingly formal and dignified function the principal players came prepared to be politely interested while some of the lesser minds were actually curious to taste the quality of the play as a piece of writing  as there was no greenroom in the westervelt the reading took place on the open stage which was bleak and draughty the company sat in a funereal semicircle with the author the star and the manager in a short line facing them all the men retained their overcoats for the morning was miserably raw and at helens positive command kept their heads covered and the supernumerary women sat shivering in their jackets helen was regal in a splendid cloak of sable otherwise there was little of the successful actress in her dress at her suggestion a boxscene was set around them to keep off at least a part of the draught and under these depressing conditions the reading proceeded  douglass was visibly disheartened by the surroundings but set manfully to work and soon controlled the attention of all the players except two who made it a boast that they had never read a play or listened to one i am interested only in me lines me boy said one of them  and your acting shows it replied douglass with quiet sarcasm and proceeded to the second act  you read that with greater power here than to me said helen i wish we could give it the same unity and sweep of expression as we act it she addressed the company in her calm clear voice i hope you will all observe carefully mr douglasss reading he is giving us most valuable advice in every inflection  her attitude towards her company was admirable in its simplicity and reserve it was plain that she respected their personalities and expected the same high courtesy from them some of the men were of the kind who say my deah to every woman and my deah boy to the most casual acquaintancevain egotistical wordy and pompous but one glance from helen was sufficient to check an overfamiliar hand in midair the boldest of them did not clap her on the shoulder but once  the reading passed to a rather enthusiastic finish and douglass then said i have read the play to you carefully because i believei knowthat an intelligent rendition of your individual parts is impossible without a clear knowledge of the whole drama my theories of a play and its representation are these as an author i see every detail of a scene as if it were a section of life i know where all my people are at each moment of time and their positions must be determined by the logic of the picture without any reference to those who wish to hold the centre of the stage in a certain sense you are only differentcolored pigments in my hands to be laid on to form a unified painting you must first of all learn to subordinate yourselves to the designs of the author i know this sounds harshseems to reduce you to a very low level of intelligence but as a matter of fact the most highly gifted of our actors today are those who are able to do this very thingto carry in their minds a conception of the unity of a scene never thrusting their personalities through it or out of it i mention these points because i intend to assist in the rehearsals and i dont want to be misunderstood  helen interposed a word i need not say that i consider this a very powerful playwith that opinion you all agree i am surebut i want to say further that mr douglass has the right to demand of each of us subordination to the inner design of his work i am personally very glad always to avail myself of the authors criticism and suggestion i hope you will all feel the same willingness to carry out mr douglasss scenes as he has written them mr saunders will you please give out the parts and call a rehearsal for tomorrow at ten oclock sharp  at this point all rose saunders a plain little man highly pleased with his authority began to bustle about bellowing boisterously here you are noweverybody come letterperfect tomorrow sharp at ten no lagging  the players accustomed to his sounding assumption of command paid no attention other than to clutch their rolls of typewritten manuscript each withdrew into the street with an air of haste  as helen received her portion saunders said here miss merival is a fat partmust be yours jeerusalem the golden id hate to tackle that rôle  douglass was ready to collar the ass for his impudent tone but helen seemed to consider it no more than the harmless howl of a chair sliding across the floor she was inured to the oldtime assistant stagemanager  turning to douglass she said do you realize mr author that we are now actually begun upon your play  no i do not i confess it all seems a makebelievea joke  youll not think it a joke at the end of the week its terribly hard work to put on a big piece like this if i seem apathetic in my part i beg you not to worry i must save myself all i can i never begin to act at rehearsal till i have thought the business all out in my mind but come you are to lunch with us in honor of the first rehearsal and it is late  it seems a deplorable thing that you must come every morning to this gloomy and repellent place  ah this is a part of our life the public knows nothing of they all come to itthe divine sarah dusenone are exempt the glamour of the footlights at night does not warm the theatre at eleven of the morning  i see it does not he answered lightly but in reality he felt that something sweet and something regal was passing out of his conception of her to see her even seated with these commonplace men and women detracted even from her glory subjected her to the same laws it was a relief to get out into the gay streetto her carriage and to the hotel where the attendants hovered about her as bees about their queen  she was in high spirits all through the luncheon and douglass was carried out of his dark gravity by her splendid vitality her humor and her hopefulness  all you need is a hearing she said and you shall have that oh but there is a wilderness of work before us can you design the scenes i like to do that its like playing with dollhouses ill show you how well leave the financial side of it to you hugh she said to her brother come mr playwright and they set to work with paste and cardboard like a couple of children and soon had models of all the sets they seemed childish things indeed but helen was mistress of even the mechanical side of the stage and these pastepot sketches were of the greatest value to the scenepainter and the carpenter     v   these three weeks of rehearsal formed the happiest time douglass had ever known for all things conspired to make each day brim with mingled work and worship first of all and above all he was permitted to meet helen each day and for hours each day without fear of gossip and without seeking for an excuse  each morning a little before ten he left his room and went directly to the theatre to meet the company and the manager the star prompt as a clock arrived soon after and douglass beforehand as a lover was always there to help her from her carriage and to lead the way through the dark passage to the stage where the pompous little saunders was forever marshalling his uneasy vassals in joyous exercise of sovereignty  helen was happy as a child during these days and glowing with new ideas of business and stagesetting we will spare no work and no expense she said buoyantly to mr westervelt her manager we have a drama worthy of us i want every one of mr douglasss ideas carried out  the manager did not know as douglass did that some of the ideas were her own and so took a melancholy view of every innovation  you cant do that he gloomily repeated the public wont stand for new things they want the old scenes rehashed the public dont want to think it wants to laugh this story is all right for a book but wont do for a play i dont see why you quit a good thing for a risk like this it is foolish and will lose money he added as a climax  croak you old ravenyoull be embarrassed when we fill your moneybox she replied gayly you should have an ideal mr westervelt  an ideal what should i do with that  like most men douglass knew nothing about gowns in their constituent parts but he had a specially keen eye for the fitting and beautiful in a womans toilet and helen was a constant delight to him because of the distinction of her dresses they were refined yet not weakly sosimple yet always alluring under the influence of her optimism and also because he did not wish to have her apologize for him he drew on his slender bankaccount for funds to provide himself with a carefully tailored suit of clothes and a new hat  how well you are looking she said in soft aside as he met her one morning soon after your hat is very becoming  i am made all over new insideso i hastened to typify the change exteriorly i am rejoiced if you like me in my glad rags he replied  you are really splendid she answered with admiring fervor let us hurry through today i am tired and want a spin in the park  that is for you to say he answered  you are never tired she sighed i wish i had your endurance  it is the endurance of desperation i am staking all i have on this venture then in lowtoned intensity he added it hurts me to have you forced to go over and over these lines because of the stupidity of a bunch of cheap little people why dont you let me read your part  that would not be fair she answered quicklyneither to them nor to you no i am an actress and this is a part of my life we are none of us exempt from the universal curse  royleston is our curse please let me kick him out the stagedoorhe is an insufferable ass and a bad actor besides  he is an ass but he can act no its too late to change him now wait be patient hell pull up and surprise you at the final rehearsal  at four oclock they were spinning up fifth avenue which resounded with the hoofstrokes of stately horses and glittered with the light of varnished leather the rehearsal was put far behind them the day was glorious november and the air sparkling without being chill a sudden exaltation seized helen it certainly is a beautiful worlddont you think so she asked  i do now i didnt two weeks ago he replied soberly  what has brought the change  you have he looked at her steadily  she chose to be evasive i had a friend some years ago who was in the deeps of despair because no one would publish her book once she had secured the promise of a real publisher that he would take it she was radiant she thought the firm had been wondrously kind they made thirty thousand dollars from the sale of her book i am selfishdont you think im notim going to make fame and lots of money on your play  i hope you may for am i not to share in all your gold and glory i have greater need of both than you you already have all that mortal could desire i dont believe ive told you what i called you before i met youhave i  no what was it her eyes widened with interest  the glittering woman  she looked puzzled why that  because of the glamour the mystery which surrounded your name  even now i dont see  he looked amused and cried out on my life i believe you dont being at the source of the light you cant see it of course its like wearing a crown of electric lampsothers see you as a dazzling thing you are in the dark it is my trade to use words to express my meaning but i confess my hesitation in trying to make you see yourself as i saw you you were like a baleful purple star something monstrous yet beautiful your fame filled the world and fell into my garret chamber like a lurid sunrise with your coming mysterious posters bloomed and crimson letters blazed on streetwalls praiseful paragraphs appeared in the newspapers gowns and hats named after you and beltbuckles and shoes and cigarettes arranged themselves in the windows each bearing your name  what a load of tinsel for a poor little woman to carry around how it must have shocked you to find me so commonplace none of us escape the common fates it is always a surprise to me to discover how simple the men of great literary fame are a friend of mine once spent a whole evening with a great novelist without discovering who he was she said to him when she found him out i couldnt believe that any one i could meet could be great really i hope you will forgive me for not being as superhuman as my posters it was the mystery of the unknown if you knew all about me i would be entirely commonplace she was more concerned about his opinion of her than she expressed in words her eagerness appeared in her voice  i found you infinitely more womanly than i had supposed and simpler even yet i dont see how you can carry this oppressive weight of advertising glory and still bewhat you are  you seem to hesitate to tell me what i am  i do he gravely answered and for a moment she sat in silence  theres one objection to your assisting at rehearsals she said irrelevantly you will lose all the intoxication of seeing your play freshly bodied forth it will be a poor old ragged story for you at the end of the three weeks  ive thought of that but there are other compensations  you mean the pleasure of having the work go right  yes partly thatpartly the suggestion that comes from a daily study of it  but the greatest compensation of allthe joy in her daily companionshiphe did not have the courage to mention and though she divined other and deeper emotions she too was silent     vi   in the wearisome grind of rehearsal douglass was deeply touched and gratified by helens efforts to aid him she was always willing to try again and remained selfcontained even when the author flung down the book and paced the stage in a breathless rage ah the stupidity of these people he exclaimed after one of these interruptions they are impossible they havent the brains of a rabbit take royleston youd think he ought to know enough to read a simple line like that but he doesnt he cant even imitate my way of reading it theyre all so absorbed in their plans to make a hit  like their star she answered with a gleam in her eyes and the author  but our aims are larger  but not more vital their board and washing hang on their success  he refused to smile they are geese i hate to have you giving time and labor to such numskulls you should give your time to your own part  im a quick study please dont worry about me come lets go on well forget all about it tomorrow and with a light hand on his arm she led him back to the front of the stage and the rehearsal proceeded  it was the hardest work he ever did and he showed it some of the cast had to be changed two dropped outallured by a better wageand all the work on their characterizations had to be done over others were always late or sick and royleston was generally thickheaded from carousal at his club then there were innumerable details of printing and scenery to be decided upon and certain overzealous minor actors came to him to ask about their wigs and their facial makeup  in desperation over the smallfry he took the stage himself helping them in their groupings and exits which kept him on his feet and keyed to high nervous tension for hours at a time so that each day his limbs ached and his head swam at the close of the last act  he marvelled at helens endurance and at her selfrestraint she was always ready to interpose gently when hot shot began to fly and could generally bring about a laugh and a temporary truce by some pacific word  hugh and westervelt both came to her to say tell douglass to let up he expects too much of these people hes got em rattled tell him to go and slide downhill somewhere  i cant do that she answered its his playhis first playandhes right he has an ideal and it will do us all good to live up to it  to this hugh replied with bitterness youre too good to him i wish you werent quite so he hesitated theyre beginning to talk about it  about what she asked quickly  about his infatuation  her eyes grew steady and penetrating but a slow faint flush showed her selfconsciousness who are talking  westerveltthe whole company he knew his sister and wished he had not spoken but he added the fellows on the street have noticed it how could they help it when you walk with him and eat with him and ride with him  well she asked with defiant inflection what is to follow am i to govern my life to suit westervelt or the street i admire and respect mr douglass very much he has more than one side to him i am sick of the slang of the rialto and the greenroom im tired of cheap witticisms and of gossip with mr douglass i can discuss calmly and rationally many questions which trouble me he helps me to talk with him enables me to take a deep breath and try again he enables me to forget the stage for a few hours  hugh remained firm but theres your own questionwhats to be the end of it you cant do this without getting talked about  she smiled and the glow of her humor disarmed him sufficient unto the end is the evil thereof i dont think you need to worry  hugh was indeed greatly troubled he began to dislike and suspect douglass they had been antipathetic from the start and no advance on the authors part could bring the manager nearer it was indeed true that the young playwright was becoming a marked figure on the street and the paragrapher of the saucy swells spoke of him not too obscurely as the lucky winner of our modern helen which was considered a smart allusion this paragraph was copied by the leading paper of his native city and his father wrote to know if it were really true that he was about to marry a playactress  this gave a distinct shock to douglass for it made definite and very moving the vague dreams which had possessed him in his hours of reflection his hands clinched and while his heart beat fast and his breath shortened he said yes i will win her if i can but he was not elated the success of his play was still in the future and till he had won his wreath he had no right to address her in any terms but those of friendship  in spite of the flood of advance notices and personal paragraphs in spite of envious gossip he lived on quietly in his atticroom at the roanoke he had few friends and no intimates in the city and cared little for the social opportunities which came to him confident of success he gave up his connection with the blazon whose editor valued his special articles on the drama so much as to pay him handsomely for them the editor of this paper mr anderson his most intimate acquaintance was of the middle west and from the first strongly admired the robust thought of the young architect whose notions concerning the american drama made him trouble among his fellowcraftsmen  youre not an architect youre a critic he said to him early in their accidental acquaintance now i want to experiment on you i want you to see irving tonight and write your impressions of it i have a notion youll startle my readers  he did his point of view so modern so uncompromising so unshaded by tradition delighted anderson and thereafter he was able to employ the young playwright regularly these articles came to have a special value to the thoughtful artists of the stage and were at last made into a little book which sold several hundred copies besides bringing him to the notice of a few congenial cranks and comeouters who met in an old tavern far down in the old city  these articlesthis assumption of the superior air of the criticled naturally to the determination to write a play to prove his theories and now that the play was written and the trial about to be made his anxiety to win the public was very keen he had a threefold reason for toiling like madto prove his theories to gain bread and to win helen and his concentration was really destructive he could think of nothing else all his correspondence ceased he read no more he went no more to his club his only diversions were the rides and the lunches which he took with helen  with her in the park he was a man transformed his heaviness left him his tongue loosened and together they rose above the toilsome level of the rehearsal and abandoned themselves to the pure joy of being young together they visited the exhibitions of painting and sculpture and to helen these afternoons were a heavenly release from her own world  it made no difference to her who objected to her friendship with douglass after years of incredible solitude and seclusion and hard work in the midst of multitudes of admirers and in the swiftbeating heart of cities with every inducement to take pleasure she had remained the selfdenying student of acting her summers had been spent in england or france where she saw no one socially and met only those who were interested in her continued business success now she abandoned this policy of reserve and permitted herself the joys of a young girl in company with a handsome and honorable man denying herself even to the few  she played badly during these three weeks and westervelt was both sad and furious her joyous companionship with douglass her work on his sane and wholesome drama their discussions of what the stage should be and do unfitted her for the factitious parts she was playing  i am going to drop all of these characters into the nearest abyss she repeated each time with greater intensity i shall never play them again after your drama is ready my contract with westervelt has really expired so far as his exclusive control over me is concerned and i will not be coerced into a return to such work  her eyes were opened also to the effect of her characters on the audiences that assembled night after night to hear her and she began to be troubled by the thousands of young girls who flocked to her matinées is it possible that what i call my art is debasing to their bright young souls she asked herself is mr douglass right am i responsible  it was the depression of these moods which gave her corresponding elation as she met her lovers clear calm eyes of a morning and walked into the atmosphere of his drama whose every line told for joy and right living as well as for serious art  those were glorious days for herthe delicious surprise of her surrender came back each morning she had loved once with the sweet singleheartedness of a girl shaken with sweet and yielding joy of a boyish face and a slim and graceful figure what he had said she could not remember what he was no longer counted but what that love had been to her mattered a great deal for when he passed out of her life the glow of his worship remained in her heart enabling her to keep a jealous mastery of her art and to remain untouched by the admiration of those who sought her favor in every city she visited douglass was amazed to find how restricted her social circle was eagerly sought by many of the great drawingrooms of the city she seldom went to even the house of a friend  her art is a jealous master her intimates were accustomed to say implying that she had remained single in order that she might climb higher on the shining ladder of fame and in a sense this was true but she was not sordid in her ambitionsshe was a child of nature she loved rocks hills trees and clouds and it was this elemental simplicity of taste which made douglass the conquering hero that he was she felt in him concrete rugged strength and honesty of purpose as wide as the sky from the polished courtesy and the conventional evasions of her urban admirers  no i am not a bit in society she confessed in answer to some remark from him i couldnt give up my time and strength to it if i wished and i dont wish id rather have a few friends in for a quiet little evening after the play than go to the swellest reception  during all this glorious time no shadow of approaching failure crossed their horizon the weather might be cold and gray their inner sky remained unspotted of any vapor if it rained they lunched at the hotel if the day was clear they ran out into the country or through the park in delightful comradeship gay yet thoughtful full of brisk talk even argument but not on the drama she had said once for all i do not intend to talk shop when i am out for pleasure and he respected her wishes he had read widely though haphazardly and his memory was tenacious and all he had his whole mind his best thought was at her command during those hours of recreation  he began to see the city from the angle of the successful man it no longer menaced him he even began to dream of dominating it by sheer force of genius when at her side he was invincible her buoyant nature transformed him her faith her joy in life was a steady flame nothing seemed to disturb her or make her afraid and she attributed this strength this joyous calm to his innate sense of powerand admired him for it that he drew from her relied upon her never entered her conception of their relations to each other  nevertheless as the play was nearing its initial production the critics loomed larger together they ran over the list there is the man who resembles shakespeare she asked  he will be kindly  and the fat man with shifty gray eyes  he will slate us unless  and the big man with the grizzled beard  well furnish him a joke or two  and the man who comes in on crutches  hell slaughter us he hates the modern  then the man who looks like lincoln  he is on our side but how about the man with the waxed mustache  hell praise me  and slit the playwrights ears well i will not complain what will the free lance dothe one who accepts bribes and cares for his crippled daughter like an angelwhat will he do  well that depends do you know him  i do not and dont care to that exhausts the list of the notables the rest are bright young fellows who are ready to welcome a good thing some of them i know slightly but i do not intend to do one thing aside from my work to win their support  that is right of course westervelt may take a different course and in this confident way they approached the day of trial  westervelt watching with uneasy eyes the growing intimacy of his star and her playwright began to hint his displeasure to hugh and at last openly to protest what does she mean he asked explosively does she dream of marrying the man that would be madness death tell her so my boy  hugh concealed his own anxiety oh dont worry theyre only good comrades  westervelt grunted with infinite contempt comrades if he is not making love to her im a greek  hugh was much more uneasy than the manager but he had more sense than to rush in upon his famous sister with a demand he made his complaint to the gentle mother i wish she would drop this social business with douglass hes a good fellow but she oughtnt to encourage him in this way whats the sense of having him on the string every blessed afternoon do you imagine shes in earnest what does she mean it would be fatal to have her marry anybody nowit would ruin her with the public besides douglass is only a poor grub of a journalist and a failure in his own line of business cant we do something  the mother stood in awe of her shining daughter and shook her head she is old enough to know her own mind hugh i darena speak to her besides i like mr douglass  yes he won you by claiming scotch blood i dont like it she is completely absorbed in him all i can hope is it wont last  if she loves him i canna interfere and if she doesna there is no need to interfere replied mrs macdavitt with sententious wisdom     vii   at the last moment when face to face with the public young douglass lost courage the stake for which he played was so great like a man who has put his last dollar upon the hazard he was ready to snatch his gold from the boards the whole thing seemed weakly tenuous at dressrehearsal and royleston halfdrunk as usual persistently bungled his lines the children in the second act squeaked like nervous pollparrots and even helens sunny brow was darkened by a frown as her leading man stumbled along to a dead halt again and again  mr royleston she said with dismay and anger in her voice i beg of you to remember that this is a most serious matter  her tone steadied the man for he was a really brilliant and famous actor beginning to break he grew courtly miss merival i assure you i shall be all right tonight  at this douglass tense and hot shouted an angry word and rushed into the semidarkness of the side aisle there helen found him when she came off his face black with anger and disgust its all off he said that conceited fool will ruin us  dont take things too seriously she pleaded royleston isnt half so hopeless as he seems he will come on tonight alert as a sparrow and astonish you we have worked very hard and the whole company needs rest now rather than more drill to show your own worry would make them worse than they are  in the end he went back to his seat ashamed of his outburst of temper and the rehearsal came to an end almost triumphantly due entirely to the spirit and example of the star who permitted herself to act for the first time  it was a marvellous experience to see her transformed by the mere putting aside of her cloak from the sweetfaced thoughtful girl to the stern accusing dark and tense woman of the play her voice took on the quivering intonation of the seeress and her spread hand seemed to clutch at the hearts of her perfidious friends at such moments douglass sat entranced afraid to breathe for fear of breaking the spell and when she dropped her rôle and resumed her cloak he shivered with pain  it hurt him also to have her say to royleston now tomorrow night i shall be here at the mirror when you enter i will turn and walk towards you till i reach this little stand i will move around this to the right etc it seemed to belittle her art to render it mechanical and yet he admitted the necessity for those who were to play with her were entitled to know within certain limits where to find her in the scene he began to regret having had anything to do with the rehearsal it would have been so much more splendid to see the finished product of her art with no vexing memory of the prosaic processes of its upbuilding  she seemed to divine his feelings and explained up to a certain point every art is mechanical the outlines of my acting are fixed but within those limits i am guided by impulse even if i dared to rely on the inspiration of the moment my support cannot they must know what i am going to do i sincerely wish now that you had left us to our struggle and yet weve had a good time havent we  the best of my whole life he answered fervently  now lets rest lets go to the opera tonight for tomorrow i cannot see youno nor monday either i shall remain in seclusion all day in a darkened room i must think my part all out alone there in the dark i shall sleep as much as possible helens unconscious cerebration must now get in its work she ended laughingly  they all dined together at her table and sat together in the box while the vast harmonies of siegfried rose like sunshot mist from beneath them  helen was rapt swept out of herself and douglass with delicate consideration left her alone with her musings whose depth and intensity appeared in the lines of her sensitive face he had begun to understand the sources of her powerthat is to say her fluid and instant imagination which permitted her to share in the joy of every art under the spell of a great master she was able to divine the passion which directed him she understood the sense of power the supreme ease and dignity of ternina of de reszke just as she was able to partake in the pride of the great athlete who wrestled upon the mat she touched life through her marvellous intuition at a hundred points  he was not discouraged therefore when as they were going out she said with a quick clasp of her hand on his arm this matchless music makes our venture seem very small he understood her mood and to a lesser degree shared it  i dont want to talk she said at the door of her carriage goodbye till monday night courage     viii   deprivation of helens companionship even for a day produced in douglass such longing that his hours were misery and though sunday was long and lonely monday stretched to an intolerable length he became greatly disturbed and could neither work nor sit still so active was his imagination he tried to sleep but could not even though his nerves were twitching for want of it and at last in desperate resolution he set himself the task of walking to grants tomb and back in the hope that physical weariness would benumb his restless brain this good result followed he was in deep slumber when the bellboy rapped at his door and called halfpast six sir  he sprang up moved by the thought in two hours helen will be entering upon that first great scene and for the first time gave serious consideration to the question of an audience i hope westervelt has neglected nothing it would be shameful if helen played to a single empty seat i will give tickets away on the sidewalk rather than have it so but good heavens such a condition is impossible  after dressing with great care he hastened directly to the theatre it was early and as he stepped into the entrance he found only the attendants smiling expectant in their places a doubt of success filled him with sudden weakness and he slipped out on the street again not caring to be recognized by any one at that hour they will laugh at my boyish excitement he said shamefacedly  broadway the chief thoroughfare of the pleasureseekers of all america was just beginning to thicken with life the cafés were sending forth gayly dressed groups of diners jovially crowding into their waiting carriages automobiles and cabs were rushing northward to meet the theatregoers of the uptown streets while the humbler patrons of the family circles and galleries of the playhouses lower down were moving southward on foot sharing for a few moments in the brilliancy and wealth of the upper avenue the surface cars clamorous irritable and timid jammed at the crossings like sheep at a riverford while overhead the electric trains thundered to and fro crowded with other citizens also theatrebound it seemed that the whole metropolis alert to the drama had flung its health and wealth into one narrow stream and yet in all these thousands of careless citizens who thinks of lillians duty thought the unnerved playwright  what do these laughing insatiate amusementseekers care about any ones duty they are out to enjoy life they are the welltodo the wellfed the careless livers many of them are keen relentless businessmen wearied by the days toil they are now seeking relaxation and not at all concerned with acquiring wisdom or grace they are indeed the very kind of men to whom my play sets the cold steel and their wives of higher purpose of gentler wills are nevertheless quite as incapable of steady and serious thought not one of them has any interest in the problem i have set myself to delineate  he was saved from utter rout by remembrance of helen he recalled the wondrous woman as she had seemed to him of old striving to regain his former sense of her power her irresistible fascination he assured himself that her indirect influence over the city had been proven to be enormous almost fantastic though her worshippers knew the real woman not at all allured only by the aureoled actress yes she would triumph even if the play failed for they would see her at last in a congenial rôle wherein her nobility her intellectual power would be given full and free expression her appeal to her worshippers would be doubled  when he returned to the theatre a throng of people filled the entranceway and he was emboldened to pass ineven bowed to the attendants and to hugh who stood in the lobby in shining raiment a boutonnière in his coat his face radiating confidence and pride  weve got em coming he announced with glee we are all sold outnot a seat left and only the necessary paper out theyre curious to see her in a new rôle you are made  i hope so replied the playwright weakly tuesday night tells the story  hugh laughed why man i believe youre scared were all right i can sniff victory in the air  this confidence so far from inspiriting douglass still further depressed him and he passed in and on up into the second gallery where he had privately purchased a reserved seat with intent to sense for himself the feeling of the upper part of the house during the first act keeping his muffler pinned close so that his evening dress escaped notice he found his way down to the railing quite secure from recognition by any one at the peephole of the curtain or in the boxes and there took his seat to watch the latecomers ripple down the aisles he was experienced enough to know that firstnighters do not always count and that they are sometimes false prophets and yet he could not suppress a growing exaltation as the beautiful auditorium filled with men and women such as he had himself often called representative and best of all many of the citys artists and literarians were present  he knew also that the dramatic critics were assembling jaded and worn with ceaseless attendance on worthless dramas a condition which should have fitted them for the keener enjoyment of any fresh original work but he did not deceive himself he knew from their snarling onslaughts on plays he had praised that they were not to be pleased with anythingat least not all of them at the same time that they were friendly to helen he knew that they would praise her he was assured but that they would slate his play he was beginning to find inevitable  as the curtain rose on the first scene he felt the full force of helens words you wont enjoy the performance at all he began now to pay for the joy he had taken in her companionship he knew the weakness of every actor and suffered with them and for them royleston from the first tortured him by mumbling his lines palpably faking at times the idiot hell fail to give his cues muttered douglass hell ruin the play the children scared him also they were so important to helen at the close of the act  at last the star came onso quietly that the audience did not at the moment recognize her but when those nearest the stage started a greeting to her it was taken up all over the shining housea magnificent hand  never before had helen merival appeared before an audience in character so near her own good self and the lovely simplicity of her manner came as a revelation to those of her admirers who had longed to know more of her private character for several minutes they applauded while she smilingly bowed but at last the clapping died away and each auditor shrugged himself into an easy posture in his chair waiting for the great star to take up her rôle  this she did with a security and repose of manner which thrilled douglass in spite of his intimate knowledge of her work at rehearsals the subtlety of her reading the quiet controlled precision and grace of her action restored his confidence in her power she has them in her hand she cannot fail  the act closed triumphantly though some among the audience began to wince helen came before the curtain several times and each time with eyes that searched for some one and douglass knew with definiteness that she sought her playwright in order that she might share her triumph with him but a perverse mood had seized him this is all very well but wait till the men realize the message of the play he muttered and lifted the programme to hide his face  a buzz of excited comment rose from below and though he could not hear a word beyond the waterboys call he was able to imagine the comment  why how lovely i didnt suppose helen merival could do a sweet domestic thing like that  isnt her gown exquisite ive heard she is a dainty dresser in real life quite removed from the kind of thing she wears on the stage i wish she were not so seclusive id like to know her  but do you suppose this is her real self  it must be she doesnt seem to be acting at all i must say i prefer her in her usual parts  shes wonderful as the baroness  i never let my daughters see her in those dreadful charactersthey are too bold but they are both here tonight i understood it was to be quite a departure  douglass knowing well that hugh and the manager were searching for him sat with face bent low until the lights were again lowered now comes the first assault now we will see them wince  the second act was distinctly less pleasing to those who sat below him in the orchestra and dress circle applause was still hearty but it lacked the fervor of the first act he could see men turn and whisper to one another now and then they laughed of course and remarked each to the other brown youre getting a slat tonight  they are cheering the actress not the play observed the author  the gallery less sensitive or more genuinely patriotic thundered on applauding the lines as well as the growing power of helens impersonation royleston was at last beginning to play the fumes of his heavy dinner having cleared away he began to grip his lines and that gave the star her first opportunity to forget his weakness and throw herself into her part all in all only a very discriminating ear could have detected a fallingoff of favor in this act the curtain was lifted four times and a few feeble cries for the author were heard chiefly from the first balcony  here was the point whereat his hopedfor triumph was to have begun but it did not he was touched by an invisible hand which kept him to his seat though he knew that helen was waiting for him to receive handinhand with her the honors of the act  some foreknowledge of defeat clarified the young authors vision and a bitter melancholy crept over him as the third act unrolled they will go out he said to himself and they will not come back for the last act the play is doomed to disaster and a flame of hatred rose in his heart against the audience they are brutes he muttered  the scenes were deeply exciting the clash of interest upon interest was swift novel in sequence and most dramatic in outcome but the applause was sharp and spasmodic not long continued and hearty as before some of the men who had clapped loudest at the opening now sat gnawing their mustaches in sullen resentment  douglass divined their thought this is a confidence game we came to be amused and this fellow instructs in sociology we didnt cough up two dollars to listen to a sermon we came to be rested theres trouble enough in the street without displaying it in a place of amusement the fellow ought to be cut out  others ceased to cheer because both acting and play had mounted beyond their understanding its grim humor its pitiless characterdrawing wearied them audience and play speaking generally were at crosspurposes a minority it was true caught every point shouting with great joy and a few who disapproved of the play but were most devoted admirers of helens art joined halfheartedly in their applause but the act closed dismally notwithstanding its tremendous climax a chill east wind had swept over the auditorium and a few sensitive souls shivered what right has helen merival to do a thing like this what possesses her it must be true that she is infatuated with this young man and produces his dreadful plays to please him  they say she is carried away with him hes very handsome they tell me i wish theyd call him out  a buzz of complaining talk on the part of those aggrieved filled in the interlude the few who believed in the drama were valiant in its defence but their arguments did not add to the goodwill of those who loved the actress but detested the play  this wont do said the most authoritative critic as a detachment lined up at the bar of the neighboring saloon merival must lop off this young dramatist or hell queer her with her best friends she mustnt attempt to force this kind of thing down our throats  he wont last a week said another  their finality of tone resembled that of emperors and sultans in counsel  douglass sitting humped and motionless among his gallery auditors was clearly aware that helen was weary and agitated yet he remained in his seat his brain surging with rebellious passion  his perverse pride was now joined by shame who seized him by the other arm and held him prisoner he felt like fleeing down the fireescape the thought of running the gauntlet of the smirking attendants the possibility of meeting some of the exultant dramatic critics most of whom were there to cut him to pieces revolted him their joyous grins were harder to face than cannon therefore he cowered in his place during the long wait his mind awhirl his teeth set hard  there were plenty of empty seats in the orchestra when the curtain lifted on the last act several of the critics failed to return the playwright dared not look at his watch for the scenes were dragging interminably his muscles ached with the sort of fatigue one feels when riding in a slow train and he detected himself pushing with his feet as if to hurry the action the galleries did not display an empty bench but he took small comfort in this for he was not a believer in the oldtime theory of pleasing the gallery in this city the twodollar seats must be filled he said helen is ruined if she loses them  he began to pity her and to blame himself what right had i to force my ferocious theories upon her he asked himself and at the moment it seemed that he had completely destroyed her prestige she was plainly dispirited and her auditors looked at one another in astonishment can this sad woman in gray struggling with a cold audience and a group of dismayed actors be the brilliant and beautiful helen merival  that a part of this effectmost of it in factlay in the rôle of lillian they had not penetration enough to distinguish they began to doubt whether she had ever been the very great success and the powerful woman they had supposed her to be  the play did not really close the audience began to dribble out before the last half of the act began and the curtain went down on the final scene while scores of women were putting on their wraps a loyal few called helen before the curtain and her brave attempt to smile made every friendly heart bleed  douglass stiff and sore as one who has been cudgelled rose with the crowd and made his way to one of the outside exits eager to escape recognition to become one of the indistinguishable figures of the street  a couple of tousledheaded students going down the stairway before him tossed him his first and only crumb of comfort it wont go of course said one in a tone of conviction but its a great play all the same  right old man replied the other with the decision of a master its too good for this town what new york wants is a continuous variety show  douglass knew keenly deeply that helen needed himwas looking for himbut the thought of those who would be near at their meeting made his entrance of the stage door impossible he walked aimlessly drifting with the current up the street throbbing tense and hot with anger shame and despair at the moment all seemed losthis play his own position and helen helen would surely drop him the incredible had happenedhe had not merely defeated himself he had brought battle and pain and a stinging reproof to a splendid triumphant woman the enormous egotism involved in this he did not at the moment apprehend he was like a wounded animal content merely to escape  he longed to reach her to beg her pardon to absolve her from any promise and yet he could not face westervelt he revolted at the thought of meeting royleston and miss carmichael and hugh no it is impossible i will wait for her at the hotel  at this word he was filled with a new terror the clerks and the bellboys will have learned of my failure i cannot face them tonight and he turned and fled as if confronted by serpents and yet i must send a message i must thank helen and set her free she must not go through another such night for my sake  he ended by dropping into another hotel to write her a passionate note which he sent by a messenger       forgive me for the part i have played in bringing this disaster      upon you i had no idea that anything i could say or do would so      deeply injure youyou the wondrous one it was incredibletheir      disdain of you i was a fool a selfish boaster to allow you to go      into this thing the possible loss of money we both discussed but      that any words of mine could injure you as an artist never came to      me believe me my dearest friend i am astounded i am crushed      with the thought and i dare not show my face among your friends i      feel like an assassin i will call tomorrowi cant do it      tonight i am bleeding at the heart because i have made you share      the shame and failure which i feel tonight are always to be mine      i was born to be of the minority please dont give another thought      to me or my play go your own way get back to the plays that      please people be happy you have the right to be happy and i am a      selfish unthinking criminal whom you would better forget dont      waste another dollar or another moment on my playit is madness      i am overwhelmed with my debt to you but i shall repay it some      day     ix   helen was more deeply hurt and humiliated by her playwrights flight than by the apparent failure of the play but the two experiences coming together fairly stunned her to have the curtain go down on her final scenes to feeble and hesitating applause was a new and painful experience never since her first public reading had she failed to move and interest her audience what had happened what had so swiftly weakened her hold on her admirers up to that moment she had been sure that she could make any character successful  for a few moments she stood in the middle of the stage stifling with a sense of mortification and defeat then turned and without a word or look to any one went to her dressingroom  her maid was deeply sympathetic and by sudden impulse stooped and kissed her cheek saying never mind miss merival it was beautiful  this unexpected caress brought the tears to the proud girls eyes thank you nora some of the audience will agree with you i hope  im sure of it miss dont be downcast  hugh knocked at the door can you come out  not now hugh in a few moments  there are some people here to see you  she wanted to say i dont want to see them but she only said please ask them to wait  she knew by the tone of her brothers voice that he too was choking with indignation and she dreaded the meeting with him and with westervelt she was sustained by the hope that douglass would be there to share her punishment why had he not shown himself she asked again with growing resentment  when she came out fully dressed she looked tired and pale but her head was high and her manner proudly selfcontained  westervelt surrounded by a small group of depressed auditors among whom were mrs macdavitt hugh and royleston was holding forth in a kind of bellow it proves what simply that they will not have her in these preachy domestic parts thats all every time she tries it she gets a knock i complain i advise to the contrary does it do any good no she must chance it all to please this crank this reformer  the mother reading the disappointment and suffering in helens white face reached for her tremulously and drew her to her bosom never mind what they say nellie it was beautiful and it was true  even westervelt was awed by the calm look helen turned on the group you are very sure of yourself mr westervelt but to my mind this night only proves that this audience came to hear me without intelligent design she faced the silent group with white and weary face certainly mr douglasss play is not for such an audience as that which has been gathering to see me as the baroness but that does not mean that i have no other audience there is a public for me in this higher work if there isnt i will retire  westervelt threw his hands in the air with a tragic gesture retire my gott that would be insanity  helen turned come mother you are tired and so am i mr westervelt this is no place for this discussion goodnight she bowed to the friends who had loyally gathered to greet her i am grateful to you for your sympathy  there was up to this time no word of the author but hugh as he walked by her side broke out resentfully do you know that beggar playwright  not a word of him hugh she said you dont know what that poor fellow is suffering our disappointment is nothing in comparison with his think of what he has lost  nonsense he has lost nothing because he had nothing to lose he gets us involved  hugh there was something in her utterance of his name which silenced him more effectually than a blow i produced this play of my own free will she added a moment later and i will take the responsibility of it  in the carriage the proud girl leaned back against the cushions and pressed her two hands to her aching eyes from which the tears streamed it was all so tragically different from their anticipations they were to have had a little supper of jubilation together to talk it all over to review the evenings triumph and now here she sat chill with disappointment while he was away somewhere in the great heartless city suffering tortures alone and despairing  the sweet old mother put her arm about her daughters waist  dont cry dearie it will all come right you can endure one failure tis not as bad as it seems  helen did not reply as she was tempted to do by saying it isnt my defeat it is his failure to stand beside me and receive his share of the disaster and they rode the rest of the way in sad silence  as she entered her room a maid handed her a letter which she knew to be from douglass even before she saw the handwriting and without opening it passed on into her room his message is too sacred for any other to see she said to herself with instant apprehension of the bitter selfaccusation with which he had written  the suffering expressed by the scrawling lines softened her heart her anger died away and only big tears of pity filled her glorious eyes poor boy his heart is broken and a desire to comfort him swelled her bosom with a passion almost maternal in its dignity now that his pride was humbled his strong figure bowed his clear brain in turmoil her womans tenderness sought him and embraced him without shame her own strength and resolution came back to her i will save you from yourself she said softly  when she returned to the receptionroom she found westervelt and hugh and several of the leading actors who took the evenings frost as a reflection on themselves an injury to their reputations all in excited clamor but when they saw their star enter they fell silent and westervelt sweating with excitement turned to meet her  you must not go on it is not the money alone it will ruin you with the public it is not for you to lecture the people they will not have it such a failure i have never seen it was not a frost it was a frozen solid we will announce the baroness for tomorrow the pressmen are waiting below i shall tell them his voice rose in question  mr westervelt this is my answer and it is final i will not take the play off and i shall expect you to work with your best energy to make it a success one night does not prove lillian a failure the audience tonight was not up to it but that condemns the auditors not the play i do not wish to hear any more argument goodnight  the astounded and crestfallen manager bowed his head and went out  helen turned to the others i am tired of this discussion one would think the sky had fallenfrom all this tumult i am sorry for you mr royleston but you are no deeper in the slough than miss collins and the rest and they are not complaining now let us sit down to our supper and talk of something else  royleston excused himself and went away and only hugh miss collins miss carmichael and the old mother drank with the star to celebrate the first performance of lillians duty  i have had a letter from mr douglass helen said softly when they were alone poor fellow he is absolutely prostrate in the dust and asks me to throw him overboard as our jonah put yourself in his place hugh before speaking harshly of him  i dont like a coward he replied contemptuously why didnt he face the music tonight i never so much as set eyes on him after he came in he must have been hiding in the gallery he leads you into this crazy venture and then deserts you a man who does that is a puppy  a spark of amusement lit helens eyes you might call him that when you meet him next  hugh with a sudden remembrance of the playwrights powerful frame replied a little less truculently ill call him something more fit than that when i see him but we wont see him again hes out of the running  helen laid her cheek on her folded hands and with a smile which cleared the air like a burst of sunshine said laughingly hugh youre a big bad boy you should be out on the ice skating instead of managing a theatre you have no more idea of george douglass than a bear has of a lion this mood of depression is only a cloud it will pass and you will be glad to beg his pardon my faith in him and in lillians duty is unshaken he has the artistic temperament but he has also the pertinacity of genius come lets all go to bed and forget our hurts  and with this she rose and kissed her mother goodnight  hugh still moody replied with sudden tenderness it hurt me to see them go out on your last scene i cant forgive douglass for that  she patted his cheek never mind that hughie this too shall pass away     x   at two oclock when douglass returned to his hotel tired and reckless of any mans scorn the night clerk smiled and said as he handed him a handful of letters i hear you had a great audience mr douglass  the playwright did not discover helens note among his letters till he had reached his room and then without removing his overcoat he stood beneath the gasjet and read       my dear authormy heart bleeds for you i know how you must      suffer but you must not despair a first night is not conclusive      do not blame yourself i took up your play with my eyes open to      consequences you are wrong if you think even the failure of this      play which i do not grant can make any difference in my feeling      towards you the power of the lines your high purpose remain      suppose it does fail you are young and fertile of imagination you      can write another and better play in a month and i will produce      it my faith in you is not weakened for i know your work is good      i have turned my back on the old art and the old rôles i need you      to supply me with new ones this is no light thing with me i      confess to surprise and dismay tonight but i should not have been      depressed had you been there beside me i was deeply hurt and      puzzled by your absence but i think i understand how sore and      wounded you were come in to see me tomorrow as usual and we      will consider what can be done with this play and plan for a new      one come you are too strong and too proud to let a single      unfriendly audience dishearten you we will read the papers      together at luncheon and laugh at the critics dont let your      enemies think they have driven you into retirement forget them in      some new work and remember my faith in you is not shaken  this letter so brave so gravely tender and so generous filled him with love choked him with grateful admiration you are the noblest woman in the world the bravest the most forgiving i will not disappoint you  his bitterness and shame vanished his fists clinched in new resolution you are right i can write another play and i will my critics shall laugh from the other side of their mouths they shall not have the satisfaction of knowing that they have even wounded me i will justify your faith in my powers i will set to work tomorrowthis very nighton a new play i will make you proud of me yet helen my queen my love with that word all his doubts vanished yes i love her and i will win her  in the glow of his loveborn resolution he began to search among his papers for an unfinished scenario called enids choice when he had found it he set to work upon it with a concentration that seemed uncanny in the light of his days distraction and dismay lillians duty and the evenings bitter failure had already grown dim in his mind  helens understanding of him was precise he was of those who never really capitulate to the storm no matter how deeply they may sink at times in the trough of the sea as everything had been against him up to that moment he was not really taken by surprise all his life he had gone directly against the advice and wishes of his family he had studied architecture rather than medicine and had set his face towards the east rather than the west every dollar he had spent he had earned by toil and the things he loved had always seemed the wasteful and dangerous things he wrote plays in secret when he should have been soliciting commissions for warehouses and read novels when he should have been intent upon his business  it was impossible that i should succeed so quickly so easily even with the help of one so powerful as helen merival it is my fate to work for what i get and with this return of his belief that to himself alone he must look for victory his selfpoise and selfconfidence came back  he looked strong happy and very handsome next morning as he greeted the clerk of the embric who had no guile in his voice as he said  goodmorning mr douglass i hear that your play made a big hit last night  i reckon it hit something he replied with easy evasion  the clerk continued my wifes sister was there she liked it very much  i am very glad she did replied douglass heartily as he walked over towards the elevator a couple of young men accosted him  goodmorning mr douglass we are from the blazon we would like to get a little talk out of you about last nights performance how do you feel about the verdict  it was a frost replied douglass with engaging candor but i dont consider the verdict final i am not at all discouraged you see its all in getting a hearing miss merival gave my play a superb production and her impersonation ought to fill the theatre even if lillians duty were an indifferent play which it is not miss merival in changing the entire tone and character of her work must necessarily disappoint a certain type of admirer last nights audience was very largely made up of those who hate serious drama and naturally they did not like my text all that is a detail we will create our own audience  the reporters carried away a vivid impression of the authors youth strength and confidence and one of them sat down to convey to the public his admiration in these words       mr douglass is a western man and boldly shies his buckskin into      the arena and invites the keenest of his critics to take it up if      any one thinks the roast of his play has even singed the authors      wings he is mistaken he is very much pleased with himself as he      says a hearing is a great thing he may be a choppingblock but      he dont look it  helen met her playwright with an anxious tired look upon her face but when he touched her fingers to his lips and said at your service my lady she laughed in radiant sudden relief  oh but im glad to see you looking so gay and strong i was heartsore for you last night i fancied you in all kinds of torture  his face darkened i was my blue devils assailed me but i vanquished them thanks to your note he added with a burning glance deepsent and his voice fell to a tenderness which betrayed his heart i think you are the most tolerant star that ever put out a hand to a poor author what a beast i was to run away but i couldnt help it then i wanted to see you but i couldnt face westervelt and royleston i couldnt endure to hear them say i told you so you understood im sure of it  she studied him with admiring eyes yes i understoodlater at first i was crushed it shook my faith in you for a little while she put off this mood whose recollected shadows translated into her face filled douglasss throat with remorse and a smile disclosed her returning sense of humor oh hugh and westervelt are angryperfectly purple with indignation against you for leading me into a trap  i feared that that is why i begged you to throw my play  she laid a finger on her lips for mrs macdavitt came in mother here is mr douglass i told you he would come i hope you are hungry let us take our places hugh is fairly used up this morning do you see that bunch of papers she asked pointing at a ragged pile after breakfast we take our medicine  no he said firmly i have determined not to read a line of them to every word you speak i will listen but i will not be harrowed up by a hodgepodge of personal prejudices written by my enemies before the play was produced or in a hurried hour between the fall of the curtain and going to press i know too much about how these judgments are cooked up i saw the faults of the play a good deal clearer than did any of those sleepy gentlemen who came to the theatre surfeited and weary and resentful of your change of programme  she looked thoughtful perhaps you are right she said at last i will not read them i know what they will say  i thought the play was very beautiful said mrs macdavitt and my nellie was grand  helen patted her mothers hand we have one loyal supporter mr douglass  yeve many more if the truth were known said the old mother stoutly for she liked young douglass  i believe that cried helen did you consider that as i change my rôles and plays i must also to a large extent change my audience the people who like me as baroness telka are amazed and angered by your play they will not come to see me but there are others she added with a smile at the slang phrase  i thought of that but not till last night  it will take longer to inform and interest our new public than any of us realized i am determined to keep lillian on for at least four weeks meanwhile you can prune it and set to work on a new one have you a theme  i have a scenario he triumphantly answered i worked it out this morning between two oclock and four  she reached her hand to him impulsively and as he took it a warm flush came into her face and her eyes were suffused with happy tears  thats brave she said i told them you could not be crushed i knew you were of those who fight hardest when closest pressed you must tell me about it at oncenot this minute of course but when we are alone  when hugh came in a few minutes later he found them discussing a new automobile which had just made a successful trial run the play became the topic of conversation again but on a different plane  hugh was blunt but not so abusive as he had declared his intention to be theres nothing in lillian he saidnot a dollar were throwing our money away we might better close the theatre we wont have fifty dollars in the house tonight its all right as a story but it wont do for the stage  douglass kept his temper it was too long but i can better that in a few hours ill have a much closerknit action by wednesday night  as they were rising from the table westervelt entered with a face like a horse so long and lax was it they have burned us alive he exclaimed as he sank into a chair and mopped his red neck he shook like a gelatine pudding and helen could not repress a smile  your mistake was in reading them we burned the critics  the manager stared in vast amaze you didnt read the papers  not one  well they say  she stopped him dont tell me what they saynot a word we did our best and we did good work and will do better tonight so dont come here like a bird of illomen herr westervelt go kill the critics if you feel like it but dont worry us with tales of woe our duty is to the play we cannot afford to waste nervous energy writhing under criticism what is said is said and repeating it only hurts us all her tone became friendly really you take it too hard it is only a matter of a few thousand dollars at the worst and to free you from all further anxiety i will assume the entire risk i will rent your theatre  no no cried hugh we cant afford to do that  we cant afford to do less i insist she replied firmly  the manager lifted his fat shoulders in a convulsive shrug his face indicated despair of her folly good gott well you are the doctor only remember there will not be one hundred people in the house tonight he began to recover speech think of that helen merival playing to empty chairsin my theatre himmel  it is sad i confess but not hopeless herr westervelt we must work the harder to let the thoughtful people of the city know what we are trying to do  thoughtful people again his scorn ran beyond his words for a moment and his tongue grew german doughtful beople dey dondt bay dwo tollors fer seats our pusiness iss to attract the richthe gay theatregoers who is going to pring a theatrebarty to see a sermon on the stagehay  you are unjust to lillians duty it is not a sermon it is a powerful acting playthe best part from a purely acting standpoint i have ever undertaken to do but we will not discuss that now the venture is my own and you will be safeguarded i will instruct my brother to make the new arrangement at once  with a final despairing shrug the manager rose and went out and helen turning an amused face to douglass asked humorously isnt he the typical managerin the clouds today stuck in the mud tomorrow sometimes he is excruciatingly funny and then he disgusts me theyre almost all alike if business should be unexpectedly good tonight he would be a man transformed his face would shine he would grasp every actor by the hand he would fairly fall upon your neck but if business went down ten dollars on wednesday night then look for the icy mitt again big as he is he curls up like a sensitive plant when touched by adversity he cant help it hes really a childa big fat boy but come we must now consider the cuts for lillian then to our scenario  as the attendants whisked away the breakfast things helen brought out the original manuscript of lillians duty and took a seat beside her playwright now what is the matter with the first act  nothing  i agree what is out in the second  needs cutting  where  here and here and here he answered turning the leaves rapidly  i felt it i couldnt hold them there roylestons part wants the knife badly now the third act  it is too diffuse and the sociologic background gets obstinately into the foreground as i sat there last night i saw that the interest was too abstract too impersonal for the ordinary playgoer i can better that the fourth act must be entirely rewritten i will do that this afternoon  she faced him glowing with recovered joy and recovered confidence now you are richard once again upon his horse  a hobby horse he answered with a laugh then sobered in truth my strength comes from you at least you roused me i was fairly in the grasp of the evil one when your note came your splendid confidence set me free it was beautiful of you to write me after i had sneaked away like a wounded coyote i cannot tell you what your letter was to me  she held up a finger hush no more of that we are forgetting and you are becoming personal she said this in a tone peculiarly at variance with the words now read me the scenario of the new play i am eager to know what has moved you set you on high again  the creative fire began to glow in his eyes this is to be as individual as poetic as the other was sociologic the character you are to play is that of a young girl who knows nothing of life but a great deal of books enids whole world is revealed by the light which streams from the window of a convent librarya gray cold light with deep shadows she is tall and pale and severe of line but her blue eyes are deep and brooding her father a western mineowner losing his second wife calls on his daughter to return from the canadian convent in which she has spent seven years she takes her position as an heiress in his great house she is plunged at once into the midst of a pleasureseeking thoughtless throng of young people whose interests in life seem to her to be grossly material she becomes the prey of adventurers male and female and has nothing but her innate purity to defend her ultimately there come to her two men who type the forces at war around her and she is forced to choose between them  as he outlined this new drama the mind of the actress took hold of enids character so opposite in energy to lillian and its great possibilities exalted her filled her with admiration for the mind which could so quickly create a new character  i see i shall never want for parts while you are my playwright she said when he had finished  oh i can writeso long as i have you to write for and to work for he replied you are the greatest woman in the world your faith in me your forgiveness of my cowardice have given me a sense of power  she spoke quickly and with an effort to smile we are getting personal again  he bowed to the reminder i beg your pardon i will not offend again     xi   helens warning was not as playful as it seemed to her lover for something in the glow of his eyes and something vibrant in the tones of his voice had disturbed her profoundly the fear of something which he seemed perilously near saying filled her with unrest bringing up questions which had thus far been kept in the background of her scheme of life  some time i shall marry i suppose she had said to one of her friends but not now my art will not permit it wedlock to an actress she added is almost as significant as death it may mean an end of her playinga death to her ambitions when i decide to marry i shall also decide to give up the stage  oh i dont know replied the other there are plenty who do not in fact mary anderson is the exception when the conquering one comes along youll marry him and make him your leading man the way so many others do  when the conquering one comes along i shall despise the stage retorted helen with laughing eyesat least im told i will  pish youd give a dozen husbands for the joy of facing a big firstnight audience i tell horace that if it comes to a matter of choice for me hell have to go gracious goodness i could no more live without the applause of the stage  how about the children  the children oh thats different the dear tots well luckily theyre not absolutely barred its hard to leave the darlings behind when i go on the road i miss their sweet little caresses but i have to earn their bread you see and what better career is open to me  helen grew grave also i dont like to think of myself as an old actress i want to have a fixed abidingplace when i am fortyfive gray hairs should shine in the light of a fireside  theres always peroxide put in the other and their little mood of seriousness vanished  it was indeed a very unusual situation for a young and charming actress the hotel embric stood just where three great streams of wealth and power and fashion met and mingled its halls rustled with the spread silks of pride and glittered with the jewels of spendthrift vanity and yet few knew that high in the building one of the most admired women of the city lived in almost monastic seclusion the few men who recognized her in the elevator or in the hall bowed with deferential admiration she was never seen in the diningrooms and it was known that she denied herself to all callers except a very few intimate friends  this seclusionthis close adherence to her workadded to her mystery and her allurement in the eyes of her suitors increased as they sought vainly for an introduction it was reported that this way of life was all a matter of business a cold managerial proposition a method of advertising but so far as helen herself was implicated it was a method of protection  she had an instinctive dislike almost a fear of those who sought her acquaintance and when westervelt with blundering tactlessness or impudent design brought round some friends she froze them both with a single glance  furthermore by denying herself to one she was able to escape the other and thus save herself for her work for though she had grown to hate the plays through which she reached the public she believed in the power and the dignity of her art it was a means of livelihood it gratified her vanity but it was more than this in a dim way she felt herself in league with a mighty force and the desire to mark an epoch in the american drama came to her this too was a form of egotism but a high form  i do not care to return to the old she said there are plenty of women to do beatrice and viola and lady macbeth i am modern i believe in the modern and i believe in america i dont care to start a fad for ibsen or shaw i would like to develop our own drama  you will have to eliminate the tired businessman and his fat wife and their late dinners said a cynical friend  all businessmen are not tired and all wives are not fat i believe there is a public ready to pay their money to see good american drama i have found a man who can write  beware of that man said the cynic with a twofold meaning in his tone he is a dreamer let him pass  i do not fear him she replied with a gay smile     xii   douglass now set to work on his second play with teeth clinched i will win out in spite of them he said they think i am beaten but i am just beginning to fight as the days wore on his selfabsorption became more and more marked all his morning hours were spent at his writing and when he came to helen he was cold and listless and talked of nothing but enid and her troubles even as they rode in the park his mind seemed forever revolving lines and scenes in the midst of her attempt to amuse him to divert him he returned to his theme he invited her judgments and immediately forgot to listen so morbidly selfcentred was he  he made no further changes in the book of lillians duty but put aside westervelts request with a wave of his hand i leave all that to miss merival he said i cant give it any thought now  from one point of view helen could not but admire this power of concentration but when she perceived that her playwrights work had filled his mind to the exclusion of herself she began to suffer her pride resented his indifference and she was saved from anger and disgust only by the beauty of the writing he brought to her  the fury of the poet is on him i must not complain she thought and yet a certain regret darkened her face all that was so sweet and fine has passed out of our intercourse she sadly admitted to herself i am no longer even the great actress to him once he worshipped mei felt it now i am a commonplace friend is the fault in me am i one whom familiarity lessens in value  she did not permit herself to think that this was a lasting change that he had forever passed beyond the lover and that she would never again fill his world with mystery and light and longing  and yet this monstrous recession was the truth in the stress of his work the glamour had utterly died out of douglasss conception of helen just as the lurid light of her oldtime advertising had faded from the billboards and from the window displays of broadway as cold black and gray instantaneous photographs had taken the place of the gorgeous jewelbedecked elaborate lithographs of the old plays so now his thought of her was without warmth  helen became aware too of an outside change her friends used this as a further warning  you are becoming commonplace to the public one said with a touch of bitterness your admirers no longer wonder go back to the glitter and the glory  no she replied i will regain my place and with my own unaided characterand my lines she added with a return to her faith in douglass  and yet her meetings with him were now a species of torture her selfrespect suffered with every glance of his eyes he resembled a man suffering from a fever at times he talked with tiresome intensity about some new situation quoting his own characters beating and hammering at his scenes until helen closed her eyes for very weariness only at wide intervals did he return to some dim realization of his indebtedness to her one day he gratified her by saying with a note of tenderness in his voice you are keeping the old play on dont do it throw it away it is a tracta sermon then spoiled it all by bitterly adding go back to your old successes  you used to dislike me in such rôles she answered with pain and reproach in face and voice  it will only be for a little while he replied with a swift return to his enthusiasm in two weeks ill have the new part ready for you but the sting of his advice remained long in the proud womans heart  he went no more to the theatre i cant bear to see you playing to empty seats he declared in explanation but in reality he had a horror of the scene of his defeat  he came to lunch less often and when they went driving or visiting the galleries all the oldtime joyous companionship was gone not infrequently as they stood before some picture or sat at a concert he would whisper i have it the act will end with enid doing soandso and not infrequently he hurried away from her to catch some fugitive illumination which he feared to lose he came to her receptionroom only once of a saturday afternoon just before the play closed  how is the house he asked with indifference  bad  very bad  oh yes  i must work the harder he replied and sank into a sombre silence he never came inside again  helen was deeply wounded by this visit and was sorely tempted to take him at his word and end the production but she did not she could not so deep had her interest in him become loyal to him she must remain loyal to his work  as his bank account grew perilously small douglass fell into deeps of black despair wherein all imaginative power left him at such times the lack of depth and significance in his work appalled him it is hopelessly poor and weak it does not deserve to succeed ive a mind to tear it in rags but he resisted this spirit partly restrained by some hidden power traceable to the influence of helen and partly by his desire to retrieve himself in the estimation of the world but mainly because of some hidden force in his own brain and set to work each time filing and polishing with renewed care of word and phrase  slowly the second drama took on form and quality developing a web of purpose not unlike that involved in a strain of solemn music and at the last the authors attention was directed towards eliminating minute inharmonies or to the insertion of cacophony with design to make the andante passages the more enthrallingly sweet as the play neared completion his absorption began to show results he lost vigor and helens eyes took anxious note of his weariness you are growing thin and white mr author she said to him with solicitude in her voice you dont look like the rugged western scotchman you were when i found you am i to be your vampire  on the contrary i am to destroy you to judge from the money you are losing on my wretched play i begin to fear i can never repay you not even with a great success i have days when i doubt my power to write a successful drama  you work too hard you must not ruin your health by undue haste a week or two will not make a killing difference with us i dont mind playing lillian another month if you need the time it is good discipline and besides i enjoy the part  that is because you are good and loyal to a poor writer he answered with a break to humble appreciation of her bounty and her bravery be patient with me he pleaded enid will recoup you for all you have suffered it will win back all your funds i have made it as near pure poetry as our harsh definite life and our elliptical speech will permit and straightway his mind was filled with dreams of conquering even while he faced his love so strangely are courtship and ambition mingled in the heart of man  at last he began to exult to boast to call attention to the beauty of the lines spoken by enid see how her simplicity and virginal charm are enhanced by the rugged remorseless strength and by the conscienceless greed of the men surrounding her and yet she sees in them something admirable they are like soldiers to her they are the heroes who tunnel mountains and bridge cataracts when she looks from her slender white hands to their gross and powerful bodies she shudders with a sort of fearsome admiration  can all that appear in the lines  yes in the lines and in the acting it must appear in your acting he added with a note of admonition  her face clouded with pain he begins to doubt my ability to delineate his work she thought and turned away in order that he might not know how deeply he had wounded her     xiii   helens pride contended unceasingly with her love during the weeks of her lovers alienation for with all her sweet dispraise of herself she was very proud of her place in the world and it was not easy to bow her head to neglect sometimes when he forgot to answer her or rushed away to his room with a hasty goodbye she raged with a perfectly justifiable anger you are selfish and brutal she cried out after him on one occasion you think only of yourself you are vain egotistical all that i have done is forgotten the moment you are stung by criticism and she tried to put him aside what do his personal traits matter to me she said as if in answer to her own charge he is my dramatist not my husband  but when he came back to her an absentminded smile upon his handsome lips holding in his hands some pages of exquisite dialogue she humbled herself before him after all what am i beside him he is a poet a creative mind while i am only a mimic and straightway she began to make excuses for him have i not always had the same selfish desperate concentration am i always a sweet and lovely companion certainly the artistic temperament is not a strange thing to me  nevertheless she suffered it was hard to be the one optimist in the midst of so many pessimists the nightly performance to an empty house wore on her most distressingly and no wonder she who had never hitherto given a moments troubled thought to such matters now sat in her dressingroom listening to the infrequent hollow clang of the falling chair seats attempting thus to estimate the audience straggling sparsely desolately in to reenter the stage after an exit was like an icy showerbath each night she hoped to find the receipts larger and indeed they did from time to time advance suddenly only to drop back to desolating driblets the following night these gains were due to the work of the loyal hugh as advertising agent or to some desperate discount sale to a club on the part of westervelt who haunted the front of the house a pale and flabby wraith of himself racking his brain swearing strange german oaths and perpetually conjuring up new advertising devices his suffering approached the tragic  his theatre which had once rustled with gay and cheerful people was now cold echoing empty repellent nothing came from the balcony wherein helens sweet voice wandered save a faint halfhearted handclapping no one sat in the boxes and only here and there a man wore eveningdress the women were always intense but undemonstrative under these sad conditions the music of the orchestra became factitious a brazen clatter raised to reinforce the courage of the ushers who flitted about like uneasy spirits there were no carriages in waiting and the audience returned to the street in silence like funeral guests from a church  hugh remained bravely at his post in front each night after a careful toilet he took his stand in the lobby watching with calculating eye and impassive face the stream of people rushing by his door if we could only catch one in a hundred he said to westervelt i never expected to see helen merival left like this i didnt think it possible i thought she could make any piece go to play to fifty dollars was out of my reckoning it is slaughter  once his disgust topped all restraint and he burst forth to helen look at this man douglass he bamboozles us into producing his play then runs off and leaves us to sink or swim he wont even change the linessays hes working on a new one that will make us all barrels of money thats the way of these dramatistsalways full of some new pipedream meanwhile were going into the hole every night i cant stand it we were making all kinds of money with the baroness come lets go back to it his voice filled with love for she was his ideal sis i hate to see you doing this it cuts me to the heart why some of these newspaper shads actually pretend to pity youyou the greatest romantic actress in america this man douglass has got you hypnotized honestly theres something uncanny about the way he has queered you brace up send him whirling he isnt worth a minute of your time nellienow thats the fact hes a crazy freak say the word and ill fire him and his misbegotten plays tonight  to this helen made simple reply no hugh i intend to stand to my promise we will keep lillian on till the new play is ready it would be unfair to mr douglass  but he has lost all interest in it himself he never shows up in front never makes a suggestion  he is saving all his energy for the new play  hughs lips twisted in scorn the new play yes hes filled with a lot of paleblue moonshine now hes got another idea thats the trouble with these literary chaps theyre so swelled by their own notions they cant write what the common audience wants his new play will be a worse frost than this youll ruin us all if you dont drop him we stand to lose forty thousand dollars on lillian already  nevertheless i shall give the new play a production she replied and hugh turned away in speechless dismay and disgust  the papers were filled with stinging allusions to her failure a shrewd friend from boston met her with commiseration in her face its a good play and a fine part she said but they dont want you in such work they like you when you look wicked  i know that but im tired of playing the wanton adventuress for such people i want to appeal to a more thoughtful public for the rest of my stage career  why not organize a church like mrs allinger sneered another less friendly critic the stage is no place for sermons  you are horribly unjust lillians duty is a powerful acting drama and has its audience if i could reach it perhaps im not the one to do mr douglasss work after all she added humbly  deep in her heart helen macdavitt the woman was hungry for some one to tell her that he loved her she longed to put her head down on a strong mans breast to weep if douglass would only open his arms to me i would go to him i would not care what the world says  she wished to see him reinstate himself not merely with the public but in her own estimate of him as she believed that by means of his pen he would conquer she comprehended that his present condition was fevered unnatural and she hopedshe believedit to be temporary success will bring back the old brave sanguine selfcontained douglass whose forthright power and selfconfidence won my admiration she said and with this secret motive to sustain her she went to her nightly delineation of lillian  she had lived long without love and her heart now sought for it with an intensity which made her art of the highest account only as served the man she loved praise and publicity were alike of no value unless they brought success and happiness to him whose eyes called her with growing power     xiv   at last the new play was finished and the author brought it and laid it in the hands of the actress as if it were a newborn child and her heart leaped with joy he was no longer the stern and selfabsorbed writer his voice was tender as he said i give this to you in the hope that it may regain for you what you have lost  the tears sprang to helens eyes and a word of love rose to her lips it is very beautiful and we will triumph in it  he seemed about to speak some revealing sealing word but the presence of the mother restrained him helen recognizing the returning tide of his love to which she related no selfseeking was radiant  come we will put it in rehearsal at once she said i know you are as eager to have it staged as i i will not read it i will wait till you read it for the company tomorrow morning  i do not go to that ordeal with the same joy as before he admitted  the company met him with far less of interest in this reading of the second play and his own manner was distinctly less confident hugh and westervelt maintained silence but their opposition was as palpable as a cold wind roylestons cynical face expressed an open contempt the lesser people were anxious to know the kind of characters they were to play and a few were sympathetically eager to hear the play itself  he read the manuscript with some assurance of manner but made no suggestion as to the stage business contenting himself with producing an effect on the minds of the principals but as the girlish charm of enids character made itself felt the women of the company began to glow  why its very beautiful they exclaimed  hugh on the scent for another problem began to relax and even westervelt grunted a few words of approval qualified at once by the whispered words not a cent in itnot a cent royleston between his acts regarded the air with dreamy gaze i dont see myself in that part yet but its very goodvery good  the reading closed rather well producing the desired effect of happy tears on the faces of several of the feminine members of the cast and helen again spoke of her pleasure in such work and asked them to lend themselves to the lines this play is a kind of poem she said and makes a direct appeal to women and yet i believe it will also win its way to the hearts of the men  as they rose douglass returned the manuscript to helen with a bow i renounce all rights hereafter i am but a spectator  i think you are right in not attempting rehearsals you are worn and tired why dont you go away for a time a sea voyage would do you good  no i must stay and face the music as my father used to say i do not wish to seem to run away and besides i may be able to offer a suggestion now and then  oh i didnt mean to have you miss the first night you could come back for that if you stay we will be glad of any suggestion at any timewont we hugh  hugh refused to be brought into any marked agreement of course the authors advice is valuable but with a man like olquest  i dont want to see a single rehearsal replied douglass i want to have the joy this time of seeing my characters on the opening night fully embodied if the success of the play depended upon my personal supervision the case would be different but it doesnt i trust you and olquest i will keep away  again they went to lunch together but the oldtime elation was sadly wanting hugh was silent and douglass gloomy helen cut the luncheon for a ride in the park which did them good for the wind was keen and inspiriting and the landscape wintry white and blue and gold she succeeded in provoking her playwright to a smile now and then by some audacious sally against the sombre silence of her cavaliers  they halted for half an hour in the upper park while she called the squirrels to her and fed them from her own handsthose wonderful hands that had so often lured with jewels and threatened with steel no one seeing this refined sweet woman in tasteful furs would have related her with the gismonda and istar but douglass thrilled with sudden accession of confidence how beautiful she will be as enid he thought as with a squirrel on her shoulder she turned with shining face to softly call this is david isnt he a dear  she waited until the keeneyed rascals had taken her last nut then slowly returned to the carriage side i like to win animals like that it thrills my heart to have them set their fearless little feet on my arm  hugh uttered a warning you want to be careful how you handle them they bite like demons  oh now dont spoil it she exclaimed im sure they know me and trust me  douglass was moved to their defence and strove during the remainder of the ride to add to helens pleasure and this effort on his part made her eyes shine with joya joy almost pathetic in its intensity  as they parted at the door of his hotel he said if you do not succeed this time i will utterly despair of the public i know how sweet you will be as enid they must bow down before you as i do  i will give my best powers to thisbe sure nothing will be neglected at rehearsal  i know you will he answered feelingly  she was better than her promise laboring tirelessly in the effort to embody through her company the poetry the charm which lay even in the smaller rôles of the play that one so big and brusque as douglass should be able to define so many and such fugitive feminine emotions was a constant source of wonder and delight to her the discovery gave her trust and confidence in him and to her admiration of his power was added something which stole into her mind like music causing foolish dreams and moments of reckless exaltation wherein she asked herself whether to be a great actress was not after all a thing of less profit than to be a wife and mother  she saw much less of him than she wished for hugh remained coldly unresponsive in his presence and threw over their meetings a restraint which prevented the joyous companionship of their first acquaintanceship  more than this helen was conscious of being watched and commented upon not merely by hugh and westervelt but by guests of the hotel and representatives of the society press douglass in order to shield her and also because his position in the world was less secure than ever returned to his selfabsorbed impersonal manner of speech he took no part in the rehearsals except to rush in at the close with some changes which he wished embodied at once regardless of the vexation and confusion resulting his brain was still perilously active and not only cut and refined the dialogue but made most radical modifications of the business  helen began to show the effects of the strain upon her for she was not merely carrying the burden of lillians duty and directing rehearsals of the new pieceshe was deeply involved in the greatest problem than can come to a woman she loved douglass but did she love him strongly enough to warrant her in saying sowhen he should ask her  his present poverty she put aside as of no serious account a man so physically powerful so mentally alert was rich in possibilities the work which he had already done entitled him to rank above millionaires but that his very forcefulness his strong will his dominating idealism would make him her masterwould inevitably change her relation to the worldhad already changed it in factshe was not ready to acknowledge  up to this time her love for the stage had been singleminded no man had touched her heart with sufficient fire to disturb her serenity but now she was not merely following where he led she was questioning the value and morality of her avocation  if i cannot play high rôles if the public will not have me in work like this i am now rehearsing then i will retire to private life i will no longer be a plaything for the manheaded monster she said one day  you should have retired before sinking your good money in these douglass plays hugh bitterly rejoined it looks now as though we might end in the police station  i have no fear of that hugh i am perfectly certain that enid is to regain all our losses  i wish i had your beautiful faith he made answer and walked away  westervelt said little to her during these days he only looked and his doleful gestures his lugubrious grimaces were comic he stood to lose nothing except possible profits for helen she was paying him full rental but he claimed that his house was being ruined it will get the reputation of doing nothing but failures he said to her once in a last despairing appeal and to this she replied  very well if at the end of four weeks enid does not pull up to paying business i will release you from your contract i will free your house of helen merival  no no i dont want that i want you but i do not want this crazy man douglass you must not leave me his voice grew husky with appeal return to the old plays sign a fiveyear contract and i will make you again rich  there will be time to consider that four weeks hence  yes but the season is passing  courage mein herr she said with a smile and left him almost in tears     xv   as the opening night of enids choice drew near douglass suffered greater anxiety but experienced far less of nervous excitement than before he was shaking rather than tense of limb and did not find it necessary to walk the streets to calm his physical excitement he was depressed by the knowledge that a second defeat would leave him not merely discredited but practically penniless nevertheless he did not hide on the contrary he took a seat in one of the boxes  the audience he at once perceived was of totally different character and temper from that which greeted lillian it was quiet and moderate in size rather less than the capacity of the orchestra seats for helen had asked that no paper be distributed very few were in the gallery and those who were had the quietly expectant air of students only three of the boxes were occupied the fashionables were entirely absent  plainly these people were in their seats out of interest in the play or because of the known power of the actress they were not flushed with wine nor heavy with late dinners  the critics were out again in force and this gave the young author a little satisfaction for their presence was indisputable evidence of the interest excited by the literary value of his work i have made a gain he said grimly such men do not go gunning for small deer but that they were after blood was shown by the sardonic grins with which they greeted one another as they strolled in at the door or met in the aisles they expected another killing and were resolute to be thorough  from the friendly shelter of the curtain douglass could study the house without being seen and a little glow of fire warmed his heart as he recognized five or six of the bestknown literary men of the city seated well down towards the front and the fifteen minutes wait before the orchestra leader took his seat was rendered less painful by his pride in the really high character of his audience but when the music blared forth and the curtain began to rise his blood chilled with a return of the fear and doubt which had assailed him at the opening of lillians duty it is impossible that i should succeed was his thought  however his high expectation of pleasure from the performance came back for he had resolutely kept away from even the dress rehearsal and the entire creative force of his lines was about to come to him in a few moments my characters will step forth from the world of the disembodied into the mellow glow of the footlights he thought and the anticipated joy of welcoming them warmed his brain and the chill clutch of fear fell away from his throat the dignity and the glow the possibilities of the theatre as a temple of literature came to him with almost humbling force  he knew that hugh and the actors had worked night and day towards this eventnot for him he realized how little they cared for him but for helen she dear girl thought of everybody and forgot herself in the event that westervelt and hugh had no confidence in the play even after dress rehearsal and that they had ignored him as he came into the theatre he knew but he put these slights aside westervelt was busy incessantly explaining to his intimates and to the critics that he no longer shared in merivals grazy schemes she guarantees me orderwise i would glose my theatre he said with wheezy reiteration  the first scene opened brilliantly in the home of calvin wentworth a millionaire mineowner into the garish and vulgarly ostentatious receptionroom a pale sweet slip of a girl drifted with big eyes shining with joy of her homecoming some of the auditors again failed to recognize the great actress so wonderful was her transformation in look and manner the critics themselves dazed for a moment led in the cheer which rose this warmed the house to a genial glow and the play started with spirit  helen deeply relieved to see douglass in the box advanced towards him and their eyes met for an instant in a lovers greeting again that subtle interchange of fire took place she looked marvellously young and lighthearted it was hard to believe that she was worn with work and weakened by anxiety her eyes were bright and her hands like lilies  the act closed with a very novel piece of business and some very unusual lines passing between enid and sidney her lover towards this passage douglass now leaned uplifted by a sense of power exulting in helens discernment which had enabled her to realize almost perfectly his principal characters he had not begun to perceive and suffer from the shortcomings of her support but when enid left the stage for a few minutes the fumbling of the subordinate actors stung and irritated him they had the wrong accent they roared where they should have been strong and quiet and the man who played sidney stuttered and drawled utterly unlike the character of the play  oh the wooden ass groaned douglass hell ruin the piece a burning rage swept over him so much depended on this performance and nowi should have directed the rehearsals i was a fool to neglect them why does she keep the sot and part of his anger flowed out towards the star  helen returning restored the illusion so complete was her assumption of the part and the current set swiftly towards that unparalleled ending those deeply significant lines which had come to the author only late in the week but which formed indeed the very key to sidneys characterthey were his chief enthusiasm in this act suggesting as they did so much tingling aching with pleasurable suspense the author waited  the curtain fell on a totally different effectwith sidney reading utterly different lines  for a moment the author sat stunned unable to comprehend what had happened at last the revelation came they have failed to incorporate the changes i made they have gone back to the weak trashy ending which i discarded they have ruined the scene utterly and looking at two of the chief critics he caught them in the act of laughing evilly even as they applauded  with face set in rage he made his way back of the curtain towards helens room she met him at the door her face shining with joy its going its going she cried out gleefully  his reply was like a blow in the face why didnt you incorporate that new ending of the act he asked with bitter harshness  helen staggered and her hands rose as if to shield herself from violence she stammered iiicouldnt you see the lines came so late they would have thrown us all out i will do so tomorrow she added  tomorrow he answered through his set teeth why tomorrow tonight is the time dont you see im staking my reputation on tonight tonight we win or lose the house is full of critics they will write of what we do not of what we are going to do he began to pace up and down trembling with disappointment and fury he turned suddenly how about the second act did you make those changes in sidneys lines i infer not he added with a sneer  helen spoke with difficulty her bosom heaving her eyes fixed in wonder and pain on his face no how could i you brought them only yesterday morning they would have endangered the whole act then as the indignity the injustice the burning shame of his assault forced themselves into her mind she flamed out in reproach why did you come back here at all why didnt you stay away as you did before you are cruel heartless the tears dimmed her eyes youve ruined my whole performance youve broken my heart have you no soulno sense of honor go away i hate you ill never speak to you again i hate you and she turned leaving him dumb and staring in partial realization of his selfish brutal demands  hugh approached him with lowering brows and clinched hands youve done it now youve broken her nerve and shell fail in her part havent you any sense we pick you off the street and feed you and clothe youand do your miserable playsand you rush in here and strike my sister helen merival in the face i ought to kick you into the street  douglass stood through this like a man whose brain is benumbed by the crashing echoes of a thunderbolt hardly aware of the fury of the speaker but this final threat cleared his mind and stung him into reply  you are at liberty to try that he answered and an answering ferocity shone in his eyes i gave you this play its good work and properly done would succeed ruin it if you want to i am done with it and you  thank god exclaimed the brother as the playwright turned away good riddance to a costly acquaintance  hardly had the street door clapped behind the blinded author when helen white and agitated reappeared breathlessly asking where is he has he gone  yes i am glad to say he has  call him backquick dont let him go away angry i must see him again go bring him back  hugh took her by the arm what do you intend to dogive him another chance to insult you he isnt worth another thought from you let him go and his plays with him  the orchestra roaring on its finale ended with a crash hugh lifted his hand in warning there goes the curtain helen go on dont let him kill your performance go on and he took her by the arm  the training as well as the spirit and quality of the actress reasserted their dominion and as she walked out upon the stage not even the searching glare of the footlights could reveal the cold shadow which lay about her heart  when the curtain fell on the final picture she fairly collapsed refusing to take the curtain call which a goodly number of her auditors insisted upon im too tired she made answer to hugh too heartsick she admitted to herself for douglass was gone with angry lights in his eyes bearing bitter and accusing words in his ears the temple of amusement was at the moment a place of sorrow of despair     xvi   douglass knew before he had set foot upon the pavement that his life was blasted that his chance of success and helens love were gone forfeited by his own egotism his insane selfishness but it was only a halfsurrender something very stark and unyielding rose within him preventing his return to ask forgiveness the scorn the contempt of hughs words and the lines of loathing appearing for the first time in helens wonderfully sensitive face burned each moment deeper into his soul the sorrows of enids world rose like pale clouds above the immovable mountains of his shame and black despair  he did not doubt for a moment but that this separation was final after such a revelation of my character he confessed she can do nothing else but refuse to see me i have only myself to blame i was insane and he groaned with his torment she is right hugh is right in defending his household against me my action was that of a foola hideous egotistic fool  seeking refuge in his room he faced his future in nerveless dejection his little store of money was gone and his profession long abandoned seemed at the moment a broken staffhis place on the press in doubt what would his good friend say to him now when he asked for a chance to earn his bread he had flouted the critics the dramatic departments of all the papers in his besotted selfconfidence he had cast away all his best friends and with these reflections came the complete revelation of helens kindnessand her glittering power back upon him swept a realization of the paradise in which he had lived in whose air his egotism had expanded like a mushroom  leagued with her enjoying her bounty and sharing in the power which her success had brought her he had imagined himself a great writer a man with a compelling message to his fellows it seemed only necessary to reach out his hand in order to grasp a chapleta crown with her the world seemed his debtor now he was a thing cast off a broken boy grovelling at the foot of the ladder of fame  while he withered over his defeat the electric cars gigantic insects of the dawn began to howl and the trains on the elevated railway thundered by the citys voice which never ceases but which had sunk to a sleepy murmur suddenly awoke and with clattering snarling crescendo roar announced the coming of the tides of toilers i am facing the day he said to himself and the papers containing the contemptuous judgments of my critics are being delivered in millions to my fellowcitizens this thing i have gainedi am rapidly becoming infamous  his weakness his shuddering fear made his going forth a torture even the bellboy who brought his papers seemed to exult over his misery but by sternly sending him about an errand the worn playwright managed to overawe and silence him and then with the citys leading papers before him he sat down to his bitter medicine as he had put aside the judgments of lillians duty with contemptuous gesture so now he searched out every line humbly admitting the truth of every criticism instructed even by the lash of those who hated him  the play had closed unexpectedly well one paper admitted but it could never succeed it was not dramatic of construction another admitted that it was a novel and pretty entertainment a kind of prose poem a fantasy of the present but without wide appeal others called it a moonshine monologuethat a girl at once so naïve and so powerful was impossible all united in praise of helen however and as though by agreement bewailed her desertion of the rôles in which she won great renown our advice given in the friendliest spirit is this go back to the twilight of the past to the costume play get out of the garish light of today the present is suited only for a kind of crass comedy or bowery melodrama only the past the foreign affords setting for the large play of human passion which helen merivals great art demands  you are cheating us wrote another there are a thousand little ingénues who can play acceptably this goodygoody enid but the best of them would be lost in the large folds of your cloak in the baroness telka  only one wrote in almost unmeasured praise and his words so well chosen salved the smarting wounds of the dramatist those who have seen miss merival only as the melodrama queen or the adventuress in jetblack evening dress have a surprise in store for them her enid is a dream of cold chaste girlhooda lily with heart of firein whose tender virginal eyes the lust and cruelty of the world arouse only pity and wonder so complete was miss merivals investiture of herself in this part that no one recognized her as she stepped on the stage for a moment even her best friends sat silent and yet this friend ended like the rest in predicting defeat the play is away over the heads of any audience likely to come to see it the beringed and complacent wives of new york and their winebefuddled husbands will find little to entertain them in this idyl of modern life as for the author george douglass we have only this to say he is twenty years ahead of his time let him go on writing his best and be patient byandby when we have time to think of other things than money when our wives have ceased to struggle for social success when the reaction to a simpler and truer life comesand it is comingthen the quality of such a play as enids choice will give its author the fame and the living he deserves  the tears came to douglasss eyes good old jim he knows i need comfort this morning hes prejudiced in my favoreverybody will see that and yet there is truth in what he says i will go to him and ask for work for i must get back to earning a weekly wage  he went down and out into the street the city seemed unusually brilliant and uncaring from every quarter of the suburbs floods of people were streaming in to work or to shop quite unknowing of any ones misfortunes but their own each intent on earning a living or securing a bargain how can i appeal to these motes he asked himself by what magic can i lift myself out of this press to earn a livingout of this common drudgery he studied the faces in the coffeehouse where he sat how many of these citizens are capable of understanding for a moment enids choice is there any subject holding an interest common to them and to me which would not in a sense be degrading in me to dramatize for their pleasure  this was the question and though his breakfast and a walk on the avenue cleared his brain it did not solve his problem they dont want my ideas on architecture my dramatic criticism interests but a few my plays are a proved failure what is to be done  mingled with these gloomy thoughts constantly recurring like the dull faroff boom of a sombre bell was the consciousness of his loss of helen he did not think of returning to ask forgiveness i do not deserve it he repeated each time his heart prompted a message to her she is well rid of me i have been a source of loss of trouble and vexation to her she will be glad of my selfrevelation nevertheless when he found her letter waiting for him in his box at the office he was smitten with sudden weakness what would she say she has every reason to hate me to cast me and my play to the winds has she done so i cannot blame her  safe in his room he opened the letter the most fateful that had ever come to him in all his life the very lines showed the agitation of the writer       my dear authorpardon me for my harshness last night and come      to see me at once i was nervous and anxious as you were i should      have made allowances for the strain you were under please forgive      me come and lunch as usual and talk of the play i believe in      it in spite of all it must make its own public but i believe it      will do so come and let me hear you say you have forgotten my      words of last night i didnt really mean them you must have known      that  his throat filled with tenderness and his head bowed in humility as he read these good sweet womanly lines and for the moment he was ready to go to her and receive pardon kneeling but as he thought of the wrong he had done her the misfortune he had brought upon her a stubborn unaccountable resolution hardened his heart no i will not go back till i can go as her equal i am broken and in disgrace now i will not burden her generosity further  the thought of making his peace with hugh of meeting westervelts hard stare aided this resolution and sitting at his desk he wrote a long and passionate letter wherein he delineated with unsparing hand his miserable failure he took a pride and a sort of morbid pleasure in punishing himself in denying himself any further joy in her company       it is better for you and better for me that we do not meet      againat least till i have won the tolerance of your brother and      manager and my own selfrespect the work i have done is honest      work i will not admit that it is wholly bad but i cannot meet      hugh again till i can demand consideration it was not so much the      words he used as the tone i was helpless in resenting it that i      am a beggar a dangerous influence i admit i am appalled at the      thought of what i have done to injure you cast me overboard not      even your beauty your great fame can make my work vital to the      public i am too perverse too individual there is good in me but      it is evil to you i no longer care what they say of me but i feel      every word derogatory of you as if it were a redhot point of      steel i did not sleep last night i spent the time in      reconstructing myself i confessed my grievous sins and i long to      do penance this play is also a failure i grew cold with hate of      myself last night as i thought of the irreparable injury i had done      to you i here relinquish all claim to both pieces they are yours      to do with as you like take them rewrite them play them or burn      them as you will       you see i am very very humble i have put my foolish pride      underfoot i am not broken i am still very proud and i fear      selfconceited in spite of my severe lesson enid is beautiful      and i know it and it helps me write this letter but i have no      right to ask even friendship from you my proved failure as a      playwright robs me of every chance of meeting you on equal terms i      want to repay you i must repay you for what you have done if i      could write now it would be not to please myself but to please      you to help you regain your dominion i want to see you the      radiant one again speaking to throngs of happy people if i could      by any sacrifice of myself call back the homage of the critics and      place you where i found you the acknowledged queen of american      actresses i would do it but i am helpless i shall not speak or      write to you again till i can come with some gift in my handsome      recompense for your losses through me i have been a malign      influence in your life i am in mad despair when i think of you      playing to cold and empty houses i am going back to the west to      do sash factories and wheat elevators these are my métier you      are the one to grant pardon i am the malefactor i am taking      myself out of your world forgive me andforget me hugh was      right my very presence is a curse to you goodbye     xvii   this letter came to helen with her coffee and the reading of it blotted out the glory of the morning filling her eyes with smarting tears it put a sudden ache into her heart a fierce resentment at the moment his assumed humbleness his selfderision his confession of failure irritated her  i dont want you to bend and bow she thought as if speaking to him id rather you were fierce and hard as you were last night she read on to the end so deeply moved that she could scarcely see the lines her resentment melted away and a pity profound and almost maternal filled her heart poor boy what could hugh have said to him i will know it has been a bitter experience for him and is this the end of our good days  with this internal question a sense of vital loss took hold upon her for the first time in her life the future seemed desolate and her past futile back upon her a throng of memories came rushingmemories of the high and splendid moments they had spent together first of all she remembered him as the cold stern handsome stranger of that first nightthat night when she learned that his coldness was assumed his sternness a mask she realized once again that at this first meeting he had won her by his voice by his handclasp by the swiftness and fervor of his speech he had dominated her swept her from her feet  and now this was the end of all their plans their dreams of conquest there could be no doubt of his meaning in this letter he had cut himself off from her perversely bitterly in despair and deep humiliation she did not doubt his ability to keep his word there was something inexorable in him she had felt it beforea sort of blind selftorturing obstinacy which would keep him to his vow though he bled for every letter  and yet she wrote again patiently sweetly asking him to come to her i dont know what hugh said to youno matter forgive him we were all at high tension last night i know you didnt intend to hurt me and i have put it all away i will forget your reproach but i cannot have you go out of my life in this way it is too cruel too hopeless come to me again your good strong buoyant self and let us plan for the future  this message so high so divinely forgiving came back to her unopened with a line from the clerk on the backmr douglass left the city this evening no address  this laconic message struck her like a blow it was as if douglass himself had refused her outstretched hand her nerves tense and quivering gave way her resentment flamed up again  very well she tore the note in small pieces slowly with painful precision as if by so doing she were tearing and blowing away the great passion which had grown up in her heart i was mistaken in you you are unworthy of my confidence after all you are only a weak egotistical geniusmorbid selfish hugh is right you have proved my evil genius you skulked the night of your first play you alternately ignored and made use of meas you pleasedand after all i had done for you you flouted me in the face of my company she flung the fragments of the note into the fire there are your wordsall counting for nothing  and she rose and walked out to her brother and her manager determined that no sign of her suffering and despair should be written upon her face  the day dragged wearily forward and when westervelt came in with a sorrowful tale of diminishing demand for seats she gave her consent to a return to baroness telka on the following monday morning  the manager was jubilant now we will see a theatre once more i tought i vas running a church or a school now we will see carriages at the door again and some dresssuits pefore the orchestra eh hugh  im glad to see you come to your senses said hugh ignoring westervelt that chap had us all  she stopped him not a word of that mr douglass was right and his plays are right but the public is not yet risen to such work i admire his work just as much now as ever i am only doubting the public if there is no sign of increasing interest on saturday we will take enid off that is all i will say now  it seemed a pitiful a monstrous thing hugh made no further protest but that his queenly sister after walking untouched through swarms of rich and talented suitors should fall a victim to a poor and unknown architect who was a failure at his own business as well as a playwright  mrs macdavitt who stood quite in awe of her daughter and who feared the sudden hot temper of her son passed through some trying hours as the days went by helen was plainly suffering and the mother cautioned the son to speak gently i fear she prized him highlythe young douglass she said and i confess i had a kin o liking for the lad he was so keen and resolved  he was keen to do us mother and when he found he couldnt he pulled his freight he could write ill admit that but he wouldnt write what people wanted to hear he was too badly stuck on his own genius  helen went to her task at the theatre without heart though she pretended to a greater enthusiasm than ever but each time she entered upon the second act of the play a mysterious and solacing pleasure came to her she enjoyed the words with which enid questions the life of her richest and most powerful suitor the mingled shrewdness simplicity and sweetness of this scene always filled her with a new sense of douglasss power of divination indeed she closed the play each night with a sense of being more deeply indebted to him as well as a feeling of having been near him once she saw a face strangely like his in the upper gallery and the blood tingled round her heart and she played the remainder of the act with mind distraught can it be possible that he is still in the city she asked herself     xviii   it was indeed the playwright each night he left his boardingplace drawn by an impulse he could not resist to walk slowly to and fro opposite the theatre entrance calculating with agonized eye the meagre numbers of those who entered at times he took his stand near the door in a shadowy nook with coatcollar rolled high about his ears in order to observe the passing stream hoping exulting and suffering alternately as groups from the crowd paused for a moment to study the displayed photographs only to pass on to other amusement with some careless allusion to the fallen star  this hurt him worst of allthat these motes these cheap little boys and girls could now sneer at or pity helen merival i brought her to this he repeated with morbid sense of power when she met me she was queen of the city now she is an object of pity  this feeling of guilt this egotism deepened each night as he watched the citys pleasureseekers pace past the door it was of no avail to say that the few who entered were of higher type than the many who passed the profession which helen serves cannot live on the wishes of the few the many must be pleased to become exclusive in appeal is to die of hunger this is why the sordid commonplace playwrights and the businesslike managers succeed while the idealists fail there is an iron law of limitation here  that is why my influence is destructive he added and was reassured in the justice of his resolution to take himself out of helens life everything i stand for is inimical to her interests to follow my path is to eat dry crusts to be without comfort to amuse this great moiling crowd to dance for them like a monkey to pander to their base passions this means success and so long as her acting does not smirch her own soul what does it matter in such wise he sometimes argued in his bitterness and wrath  from the brilliant street from the gay crowds rolling on in search of witless farcecomedy and trite melodrama the brooding idealist climbed one night to the gallery to overlook a gloomy empty auditorium concealing himself as best he could he sat through the performance tortured by some indefinable appeal in helens voice hearing with cold and sinking heart the faint applause from the orchestra chairs which used to roar with bravos and sparkle with the clapping of white and jewelled hands  there was something horrifying in this change in his morbid and overwrought condition it seemed murderous at last a new resolution set his lips in a stern line and when the curtain fell on the last act his mind was made up i will write one more play for the sensationloving fools for these flabby business men and their caponstuffed wives i will mix them a dramatic cocktail that will make them sit up i will create a dazzling rôle for helen one that will win back all her oldtime admirers they shall come like a roaring tide and she shall recoup herself for every lossin purse and prestige  it was this night when his face was white with suffering that helen caught a glimpse of him hanging across the railing of the upper balcony  he went no more to see her play in his small shabby room in a musty house on one of the old side streets he set to work on his new plan he wrote now without fervor without elation plodding along hour after hour erasing interlining destroying rewriting he toiled terribly he permitted himself no fancy flights he calculated now i must have a young and beautiful duchess or countess he mused bitterly our democratic public loves to see nobility she must peril her honor for a lovera wonderful fellow of the middleclass not royal but near it the princess must masquerade in a mans clothing for some high purpose there must be a lord high chamberlain or the like who discovers her on this mission to save her lover and who uses his discovery to demand her hand in marriage for his son  in this cynical mood he worked sustained only by the memory of the glittering woman whose power and beauty had once dazzled him slowly the new play took shape and try as he might he could not keep out of it a line now and then of real dramaof literature each act was designed to end with a clarion call to the passions and he was perfectly certain that the curtain would rise again and again at the close at every point was glitter and the rush of heroics  he lived sparely seeing no one going out only at night for a walk in the square to send to his brother or his father for money he would not not even to write his wonderworking drama his letters home while brief were studiedly confident of tone the playacting business and all those connected with it stood very remote from the farming village in which dr donald douglass lived and when he read from his sons letters references to his dramas his mind took but slight hold upon the words his replies were brief and to the point go back to your building and leave the playactors to themselves theyre a poor uneasy lot at the best to him an architect was a man who built houses and barns with a personal share in the physical labor a wholesome manly business the son understood his fathers prejudices and they formed a barrier to his approach when in need  on the morning of the fifteenth day alessandra went to the typewriter and the weary playwright lifted his head and took a full free breath he was convinced beyond any question that this melodrama would please it had all the elements which he despised therefore it must succeed his desire to see helen now overpowered him worn with his toil and exultant in his freedom he went out into the street to see what the world was doing  enids choice was still running a slight gain at the end of the first week had enabled helen to withhold her surrender to mammon the second week increased the attendance but the loss on the two plays was now very heavy and hugh and westervelt and all her friends as well urged her to give way to the imperious public but some deep loyalty to douglass some reason which she was not free to give made her say no while there is the slightest hope i am going to keep on to her mother she said they are associated in my mind with something sweet and finea mans aspiration they taste good in my mouth after all these years of rancid melodrama  to herself she said if they succeedif they win the publicmy lover will come back he can then come as a conqueror and the hope of this the almost certain happiness and honor which awaited them both led her to devise new methods of letting the great nontheatregoing public know that in george douglasss enid they might be comfortedthat it was indeed a dramatic sign of promise we will give it a faithful trial here then go on the road life is less strenuous in the smaller townsthey have time to think  hugh and westervelt counselled against any form of advertising that would seem to set the play in a class by itself but helen made keen by her suffering bluntly replied you are both wrong utterly wrong our only possible chance of success lies in reaching that vast sane thoughtful public which seldom or never goes to the theatre this public very properly holds a prejudice against the theatrical world but it will welcome a play which is high and poetic without being dull this public is so vast it makes the ordinary theatregoing public seem but a handful we must change all our methods of printing  these ideas were sourly adopted in the third week just when a note from douglass reached her by the hand of a special messenger in this letter he said i have completed another play i have been grubbing night and day with incessant struggle to put myself and all my ideals asideto give the public what it wantsto win your old admirers back in order that i might see you playing once more to crowded and brilliant houses it will succeed because it is diametrically opposed to all i have expressed it is my sacrifice will you accept it will you read my play shall i send it to you  something went out from this letter which hurt helen deeply first of all there was a certain humble aloofness in his attitude which troubled her but more significant still was his confessed departure from his ideals her brave and splendid lover had surrendered to the enemyfor her sake her first impulse was to write refusing to accept his sacrifice but on second thought she craftily wrote i do not like to think of you writing to please the public which i have put aside but come and bring your play i cannot believe that you have really written down to a melodramatic audience what i will do i cannot say till i have seen your piece where have you kept yourself have you been west come and tell me all about it  to this selfcontained note he replied by sending the drama no i cannot come till hugh and you have read and accepted this play i want your manager to pass on alessandra you know what i mean you are an idealist like myself you will condemn this drama but westervelt may see in it a chance to restore the glitter to his theatre ask them both to read itwithout letting them know who wrote it if they accept it then i can meet them again on equal terms i long to see you but i am in disgrace and infinitely poorer than when i first met you  over this letter helen pondered long her first impulse was to send the play back without reading it but her love suggested another subterfuge i will do his will and if hugh and westervelt find the play acceptable i will share in his triumph but i will not do the play except as a last resortfor his sake enid is more than holding its own so long as it does i will not permit him to lower his splendid powers  to hugh she carelessly said here is another playa melodrama to judge from the title look it over and see if there is anything in it  as plays were constantly coming in to them hugh took this one quite as a matter of routine with expectation of being bored he was a little surprised next morning when she asked did you look into that manuscript  he answered no i didnt get time  she could hardly conceal her impatience i wish youd go over it this morning from the title its one of those middleage italian things that costume well  oh is it he exclaimed well ill get right at it her interest in it more than the title moved him it was a most hopeful sign of weakening on her part  he came to lunch full of enthusiasm say sis that play is a corker there is a part in it that sees the baroness and goes her one better if the last act keeps up weve got a prizewinner whos edwin baxter anyhow  helen quietly stirred her tea i never heard the name before a new man in the theatrical world apparently  well hes all right im going over the whole thing again have you read it  no i thought best to let you and westervelt decide this time i merely glanced at it  well it looks like the thing to pull us out of our hole  that night westervelt came behind the scenes with shining face i hope you will consent to do this new piece it is a crackerjack he grew cautious it really is an immensely better piece of work than the baroness and yet it has elements of popularity i have read it hastily i shall study it tonight if it looks as big to me tomorrow morning as now i will return to the old arrangement with youif you wish  how is the house tonight she asked  his face dropped no better than last night he shrugged his shoulders oh ten or fifteen dollars maybe we can play all winter to two hundred dollars a night with this play i do not understand such audiences apparently each man sends just one to take his place there is no increase  well report to me tomorrow about alessandra then i will decide upon the whole matter  in spite of herself she shared in the glow which shone on the faces of her supports for the word had been passed to the leading members that they were going back to the old drama theyve found a new playa corking melodrama  royleston straightened whats the subject  middleage italian intrigue so hugh saysbully costumesa wonder of a part for merival  then we are on velvet again said royleston  the influence of the news ran through the action on the stage the performance took on spirit and gusto the audience immediately felt the glow of the players enthusiasm and warmed to both actress and playwright and the curtain went down to the most vigorous applause of the entire run but westervelt did not perceive this so engrossed was he in the new manuscript reading was prodigious labor for himrequired all his attention  he was at the hotel early the next morning impatient to see his star as he waited he figured on a little pad his face was flushed as if with drink his eyes swam with tears of joy and when helen appeared he took her hand in both his fat pads crying out  my dear lady we have found you a new play it is to be a big production it will cost a barrel of money to put it on but it is a winner tell the writer to come on and talk terms  helen remained quite cool you go too fast herr westervelt i have not read the piece i may not like the title rôle  the manager winced you will like ityou must like it it is a wonderful part the costuming is magnificentthe scenes superb  is there any text  westervelt did not feel the sarcasm excellent text it is not sardouof course notbut it is of his school and very well done indeed the situations are not new but they are powerfully worked out i am anxious to secure it if not for you for some one else  very well i will read the manuscript if i like it i will send for the author  with this show of tepid interest on the part of his star westervelt had to be content to hugh he complained the influence of that crazy douglass is strong with her yet im afraid she will turn down this part  hugh was also alarmed by her indifference and at frequent intervals during the day asked how she was getting on with the reading  to this query she each time replied slowly im giving it careful thought  she was indeed struggling with her tempted self she was more deeply curious to read the manuscript than any one else could possibly be and yet she feared to open the envelope which contained it she did not wish to be in any sense a party to her lovers surrender she knew that he must have written falsely and without conviction to have made such a profound impression on westervelt the very fact that the theme was italian and of the middle ages was a proof of his abandonment of a cardinal principle for he had often told her how he hated all that sort of thing what kind of a national drama would that be which dealt entirely with french or italian mediæval heroes he had once asked with vast scorn  it would win back her former worshippers she felt sure of that the theatre would fill again with men whose palates required the highly seasoned the farfetched the critics would rejoice in their victory and welcome helen merival to her rightful place with added fervor the billboards would glow again with magnificent posters of helen merival as alessandra stooping with wild eyes and streaming hair over her slain paramour on the marble stairway a dagger in her hand people would crowd again behind the scenes at the close of the play the magazines would add their chorus of praise  and over against this stood the slim poetic figure of enid so white of soul so simple so elemental of appeal a whole world lay between the two parts all that each stood for was diametrically opposed to the other one was modern as the telephone true sound and revealing the other false from beginning to end belonging to a world that never existed a brilliant flashing pageant a struggle of beasts in robes of gold and velvetassassins dancing in jewelled garters every scene every motion was worn with use on the stage and yet her own romance her happiness seemed to depend upon her capitulation as well as his  if they accept alessandra he will come back to me proudlyat least with a sense of victory over his ignoble enemies if i return it he will know i am right but will still be left so deeply in my debt that he will never come to see me again and with this thought she determined upon a course of action which led at least to a meeting and to a reconciliation between the author and the manager and with the thought of seeing him again her heart grew light  when she came to the theatre at night westervelt was waiting at the door  well he asked anxiously what do you think of it  i have sent for the author she answered coldly he will meet me tomorrow at eleven come to the hotel and i will introduce him to you  splendid splendid exclaimed the manager you found it suited to you a great part eh  i like it better than the baroness she replied and left him broadfaced with joy  she is coming sensible again he chuckled now that that crank is out of the way we shall see her as she wastriumphant  again the audience responded to every line she spoke and as she played something reassuring came up to her from the faces below the house was perceptibly less empty but the comfort arose from something more intangible than an increase of filled chairs i believe the tide has turned she thought exultantly but dared not say so to hugh  that night she sent a note to douglass and the words of her message filled him with mingled feelings of exultation and bitterness  you have won westervelt and hugh are crazy to meet the author of alessandra they see a great success for you for me for all of us westervelt is ready to pour out his money to stage the thing gorgeously come tomorrow to meet them come proudly you will find them both ready to take your handeager to acknowledge that they have misjudged you we have both made a fight for good work and failed no one can blame us if we yield to necessity  the thought of once more meeting her of facing her managers with confident gaze on equal terms made douglass tremble with excitement he dressed with care attempting as best he could to put away all the dust and odors of his miserable tenement and went forth looking much like the oldtime selfconfident youth who faced down the clerk his mind ran over every word in helens note a dozen times extracting each time new and hidden meanings  if it is the great success they think it my fortune is made his spirits began to overleap all bounds it will enable me to meet her as an equalnot in worth he acknowledgedshe is so much finer and nobler than any man that ever livedbut i will at least be something more than a tramp kennelled in a musty hole his mind took another flight i can go home with pride also oh success is a sovereign thing think of hugh and westervelt waiting to welcome meand helen  when he thought of her his confident air failed him his face flushed his hands felt numb she shone now like a faroff violet star she had recovered her aloofness her allurement in his mind and it was difficult for him to realize that he had once known her intimately and that he had treated her inconsiderately i must have been mad he exclaimed it seemed months since he had looked into her face  the clerk he dreaded to meet was off duty and as the elevator boy knew him he did not approach the desk but went at once to helens apartments  she did not meet him at the door as he had foolishly expected delia the maid greeted him with a smile and led him back to the receptionroom and left him alone  he heard helens voice the rustle of her dress and then she stood before him as he looked into her face and read love and pity in her eyes he lost all fear all doubt and caught her hand in both of his unable to speak a word in his defenceunable even to tell her of his gratitude and love  she recovered herself first and drawing back looked at him searchingly you poor fellow youve been working like mad you are ill  no i am not illonly tired i have had only one thought one aim since i saw you last that was to write something to restore you to your old place  i do not want to be restored now listen lord douglass if i do alessandra it is because we both need the money and the prestige but i do not despair and you must not please let me manage this whole affair will you  i am your slave  dont say such things i dont want you to be humble i want you to be as brave as proud as before  she said this in such a tone that he rose to it his face reset in lines of resolution i will not be humble with any other human being but you i worship you  she stood for a moment looking at him fixedly a smile of pride and tender dream on her lips then said you must not say such things to menot now the bell rang here comes your newfound admirers she exclaimed gleefully now you sit here a little in the shadow and i will bring them in  douglass heard hugh ask eagerly is he here  yes he is waiting for you a moment later she reentered followed closely by westervelt herr westervelt let me introduce mr george douglass author of alessandra lillians duty and enids choice  for an instant westervelts face was a confused lumpy mass of amazement and resentment then he capitulated quick to know on which side his bread was buttered and flinging out a fat hand he roared  very good joke ha ha you have fooled me completely mr douglass i congratulate you you have now given helen merival the best part she has ever had you found we were right eh  douglass remained a little stiff yes for the present well say you are right but the time is coming  hugh came forward with less of enthusiasm but his wall of reserve was melting im mighty glad to know that you wrote alessandra douglass it is worthy of sardou and it will win back every dollar weve lost in the other plays  thats what i wrote it for said douglass sombrely  westervelt had no further scruplesno reservations well now as to terms and date of production lets get to business  helen interposed no more of that for today mr douglass is tired and needs recreation leave business till tomorrow come let us go to mother she is anxious to see youand you are to breakfast with us in the good old spirit  it was sweet to sit with them again on the old footingto be released from his load of guilty responsibility to face the shining table the dear old motherand helen something indefinably domestic and tender came from her hesitating speech and shone in her liquid beaming eyes  the room swam in vivid sunshine and seemed thus to typify the toilers escape from poverty and defeat  dont expect me to talk he said slowly strangely im too dazed too happy to think clearly i cant believe it i have lived two months in a horrible nightmare but now that the business men the practical ones say you are to be saved by me i must believe it i would be perfectly happy if only i had won the success on my own lines without compromise  put that aside she commanded softly the fuller success will come we have that to work towards     xix   helen insisted that her playwright should go back to the west for a months rest  i do not need rest i need you he answered recklessly it fills me with content merely to see you  nevertheless you must go we dont need you here and besides you interfere with my plans  is that true his eyes searched deep as he questioned  i am speaking as the actress to the playwright she pointed tragically to the door go your poor old lonely mother awaits you  there are six in the family shes my stepmother and we dont get on smoothly  your father is waiting to congratulate you  on the contrary he thinks actresses and playwrights akin to popery  she laughed well then go on my accounton your account you are tired and so am i  that is why i should remain to relieve you to help you or do you mean youre tired of me  i wont say that but i must not see you i must not see any one if i do this big part right i must rest i intend to sleep a good part of the time i have sent for henry olquest and i intend to put the whole of the stage end of this play in his hands our ideals are not concerned in this alessandra you remember  his face clouded that is true i wish it were otherwise but can you get olquest  yes his new play has failed too good westervelt said  oh what blasphemy to think harry olquests plays are rejected and on such grounds you are rightas always i will go  thank you  i am a little frazled i admit and a breath of mountainair will do me good i will visit my brother walt in darien its hard to go my heart begins to ache already with prospective hunger you have been my world my one ambition for three monthsmy incessant care and thought  all the more reason why you should forget me and things dramatic for a while there is nothing so destructive to peace and tranquillity as the stage  dont i know that when i was a youth in a western village i became in some way the possessor of two small photographs of elsie melville she was my ideal till i saw her fifteen years later  helen laughed poor elsie she took on flesh dreadfully in her later years  nevertheless those photographs started me on the road to the stage i used to fancy myself as macbeth but i soon got switched into the belief that i could write plays now that i have demonstrated thathis tone was a little bitter againi think i would better return to architecture  she silenced him all that we will discuss when you come back reinvigorated from the mountains she turned to her desk i have something here for you here is a small check from westervelt on account dont hesitate to take it he was glad to give it  it is the price of my intellectual honesty  by no means she laughed but her heart sickened with a sense of the truth of his phrase its only a very small part payment you can at least know that the bribe they offer is large  yeshe looked at her meaninglythe prize was too great for my poor resolution all they can give will remain part payment i wonder if you will be compassionate enough to complete the purchase  that too is in the future she answered still struggling to be gayly reassuring though she knew perfectly well that she was face to face with a most momentous decision and that an insistent determined lover was about to be restored to confidence and pride and now goodbye and she gave him her hand in positive dismissal  he took the hand and pressed it hard then turned and went away without speaking                                       there was a hint of spring in the air the afternoon of his leaving the wind came from the southwest brisk and powerful in the pale misty blue of the sky a fleet of small white clouds swam like ships with wide and bellying sails low down in the eastern horizon and the sight of them somehow made it harder for douglass to leave the city of his adoption he was powerfully minded to turn back to remain on the ferryboat and land again on the towering island so heavily freighted with human sorrows so brilliant with human joys and only a realization that his presence might trouble and distract helen kept him to his journeys westward course  as he looked back at the monstrous hive of men the wonder of helens personality came to him that she alone and unaided save by her own inborn genius and her beauty should have succeeded in becoming distinguished even regnant among so many eager and striving souls overwhelmed him with love and admiration  he wondered how he could have assumed even for an instant the tone of a lover the gesture of a master i a poor restless penniless vagabond on the face of the earthi presumed to complain of her he exclaimed and shuddered with guilty disgust at thought of that night behind the scenes  in this mood he rode out into the west which was bleak with winter winds and piled high with snow he paused but a day with his father whom he found busy prolonging the lives of the old people with whom the town was filled it was always a shock to the son this contrast between the outward peace and wellseeming of his native town and the inner mortality and swift decay even in a days visit he felt the grim destroyers presence palpable as the shadow of a cloud  he hastened on to darien that curious mixture of spanishmexican indolence and bustling american enterprise a town wherein his brother walt had established himself some years before  walter douglass was shocked by the change in his brother i cant understand how fourteen months in new york can reduce a lusty youth to the color of a cabbage and the consistency of a gelatine pudding i reckon youd better key yourself down to my pace for a while look at me  the playwright smiled i havent indulged myself too much you cant hit a very high pace on twelve dollars a week  oh i dont know there are cheap brands of whiskey and you can breathe the bad air of a theatre every night if you climb high enough i know youve been too strenuous at some point now whats the meaning of it all  ive been working very hard  shouldnt do it look at me i never work and never worry i play i weigh two hundred pounds eat well sleep like a doorknob make about three thousand dollars a year and educate my children i dont want to seem conceited but my way of life appeals to me as philosophic yours is too wasteful come now youre keeping back something you might as well fess up what were you doing  the playwright remained on his guard well as i wrote you i had a couple of plays accepted and helped to produce them theres nothing more wearing than producing a play the anxiety is killing  i believe you i think the writing of one act would finish me yes i can see that would be exciting business but whats all this about your engagement to some big actress  this brought the blood to the younger mans cheek but he was studiedly careless in reply all newspaper talk of course in rehearsing the play i saw a great deal of miss merival butthats all she is one of the most successful and brilliant women on the stage while iwell i am only a writing architect earning my board by doing a little dramatic criticism now and then you need not put any other two things together to know how foolish such reports are  walt seemed satisfied well my advice is slow down to darien time eat and sleep and ride a bronco to make you eat more and sleep harder and in two weeks youll be like your oldtime self  this advice so obviously sound was hard to follow for each day brought a letter from helen studiously brief and very sparing of any terms of affectionfrank good letters kindly but no moreand young douglass was dissatisfied and said so he spent a large part of each morning pouring out upon paper the thoughts and feelings surging within him he told her of the town of the delicious crisp climatelike october in the eastof the great snowpeaks to the west of his rides far out on the plain of his plans for the coming year  i dug an old play out of my trunk today he wrote towards the end of the first week its the first one i ever attempted it is very boyish i had no problems in my mind then but it is worth while i am going to rewrite it and send it on to you for i cant be idle i believe youll like it it is a love drama pure and simple  to this she replied i am interested in what you say of your first play but dont workrest and enjoy your vacation  a few days later he wrote in exultation i got a grip on the play yesterday and rewrote two whole acts i think ive put some of the glory of this land and sky into iti mean the exultation of health and youth i am putting you into it tooi mean the adoration i feel for you my queen  do you know all the old wonder of you is coming back to me when i think of you as the great actress my nerves are shaken is it possible that the mysterious helen merival is my helen i am mad to rush back to you to prove it isnt it presumptuous of me to say my helen but at this distance you cannot reprove me i came across some pictures of you in a magazine today and was thrilled and awed by them i have not said anything of helen macdavitt to my people but of the good and great actress helen merival i speak copiously they all feel very grateful to you for helping me father thinks you at least forty he could not understand how a woman under thirty could rise to such eminence as you have attained walt also takes it for granted you are middleaged he knows how long the various maggies and ethels and annies have been in public life he saw something in a paper about us the other day but took it as a joke if this fourth play of mine comes off and you find it worth producing i shall be happy it might counteract the baleful influence of alessandra i began to wonder how i ever did such a melodrama is it as bad as it seems to me now  i darent ask how enid is doing it makes me turn cold to think of the money you are losing wouldnt it pay to let the theatre go dark till the new thing is ready  i am amazed at my temerity with you serene lady if i had not been filled with the colossal conceit of the young author i never would have dared to approachwhat i did during those mad weeks you know the ones i mean gives me such shame and suffering as i have never known and my whole life is now ordered to make you forget that side of my character i ask myself now what would helen have me do i dont say this humble mood will last if alessandra should make a barrel of money i am capable of soaring to such heights of audacity that you will be startled  to this she replied i am not working at rehearsal more than is necessary mr olquest is a jewel he has taken the whole burden of the stage direction off my hands i lie in bed till noon each morning and go for a drive each pleasant afternoon our spring weather is gone winter has returned upon us again i miss you very much for all the worry you gave us we found entertainment in you dont trouble about the money we are losing westervelt is putting up all the cash for the new production and is angelic of manneror means to be i prefer him when in the dumps he attends every rehearsal and is greatly excited over my part he now thinks you great and calls you the american sardou  i have put all our dismal hours behind me all this too shall pass away  i care not to what audacity you wing your way if only you come back to us your good sane undaunted self once more  in this letter as in all her intercourse with him there was restraint as though love were being counselled by prudence and this was indeed the case a foreboding of all that an acknowledgment of a mans domination might mean to her troubled helen the question how would marriage affect my plans beset her though she tried to thrust it away to retire it to the indefinite future  her love grew steadily feeding upon his letters which became each day more buoyant and manly bringing to her again the sense of unbounded ambition and sane power with which his presence had filled her at their first meeting  you are not of the city she wrote you belong to the country think how near new york came to destroying you you ought not to come back why dont you settle out there and take up public life  his answer was definite you need not fear the city will never again dominate me i have found myselfthrough you with you to inspire me i cannot fail public life do you mean politics i am now fit for only one thingto write i have found my work and do you think i could live anywhere without hope of seeing you my whole life is directed towards youto be worthy of you to be justified in asking you to join your life to mine these are my ambitions my audacious desires i love you and you must know that i cannot be content with your friendshipyour affectionwhich i know i have i want your love in return not nownot while i am a man of words merely as i now feel alessandra is a little thing compared with the sacrifice you have made for me i have stripped away all my foolish egotism and when i return to see you on the opening night i shall rejoice in your success without a tinge of bitterness it isnt as if the melodrama were degrading in its appeal it does not represent my literary ideals of course but it is not contemptible it is merely conventional my mind has cleared since i came here i see myself in proper relation to you and to the public i see now that with the large theatre with the long run ideals a play must be very general in its appeal and with such conditions it is folly for us to quarrel we must have our own little theatre wherein we can play the subtler phases of american lifethe phases we both rejoice in if alessandra should pay my debt to you you see how my mind comes back to that thoughtwe will use it to build our own temple of art as i think of you there toiling without me i am wild with desire to return to be doing something i am ready now to turn my hand to any humble thingto direct rehearsals to design costumes anything only to be near you one word from you and i will come  to this she replied no on the contrary you must stay a week longer we have postponed the production on account of some extra scenic effect which hugh wishes to perfect they profess wonder now at your knowledge of scenic effect as well as your eye for costume and stagesetting your last letter disturbed me greatly while it pleased me i liked its tone of boyish enthusiasm but your directness of speech scared me im almost afraid to meet you you men are so literal so insistent in your demands a woman doesnt know what she wantssometimes she doesnt like to be brought to bay so roundly you have put so much at stake on alessandra that i am atremble with fear of consequences if it succeeds you will be insufferably conceited and assured if it fails we will never see you again truly the life of a star is not all glitter  this letter threw him into a panic he hastened to disclaim any wish to disturb her if you will forgive me this time i will not offend again i did not mean to press for an answer i distinctly said that at present i have no right to do so i darent do so in fact i send you under another cover the youthful play which i call the morning isnt that fanciful enough it means of course that i am now just reaching the point in my life where the man of thirtyodd looks back upon the boy of eighteen with a wistful tenderness feeling that the mystery of the world has in some sense departed with the morning of a certainty this idea is not new but i took a joy in writing this little idyl and i would like to see you do the wonderful lady i see in my dreams can you find an actor who can do my lad of the poetic fancy  she replied to this your play made me cry for i too am leaving the dewy morning behind i like this play it is very tender and beautiful and do you know i believe it would touch more hearts than your gorgeous melodrama mr howells somewhere beautifully says that when he is most intimate in the disclosures of his own feelings he finds himself most widely responded toor something like that i really am eager to do this play it has increased my wonder of your powers i really begin to feel that i know only part of you first lillians duty taught me some of your stern scotch morality then enids choice revealed to me your conception of the integrity of a good womans soulthat nothing can debase it alessandra disclosed your learning and your imaginative power now here i feel the poet the imaginative boy i will not say this has increased my faith in youit has added to my knowledge of you but i must confess to you it has made it very difficult for me to go on with alessandra all the other plays are in line of a national drama alessandra is a bitter and ironical concession the morning makes its splendor almost tawdry it hurt me to go to rehearsal today westervelts presence was a gloating presence and i hated him hughs report of the exultant i told you sos of the dramatic critics sickened me her letter ended abruptly almost at this point  his reply contained these words it is not singular that you feel irritated by alessandra while i am growing resigned for you are in daily contact with the sordid business tell me i may come back i want to be at the opening i know you will secure a great personal triumph i want to see you shining again amid a shower of roses i want to help take your horses from your carriage and wheel you in glory through the streets as they used to do in olden times as tribute to their great favorites i havent seen a new york paper since i came west i hope you have put enid away what is the use wearing yourself out playing a disastrous rôle while forced to rehearse a new one my longing to see you is so great that the sight of your picture on my desk is a sweet torture write me that you want me dearest  she replied very simply you may come our opening night is now fixed for monday next you will have just time to get here all is well  to this he wired reply i start tonight arrive on monday at grand central eleventhirty                                       helen was waiting for him at the gate of the station in a beautiful spring hat her face abloom her eyes dancing and the sight of her robbed him of all caution dropping his valise he rushed towards her intent to take her in his arms  she stopped him with one outstretched hand how well you look her voice so rich so vibrant moved him like song  and youyou are the embodiment of spring then in a low voice close to her ear he added i love you i love you how beautiful you are  hush she lifted a finger in a gesture of warning you must not say such things to mehere with the addition of that final word her face grew arch then in a louder tone i was right was i not to send you away  i am a new being he answered morally and physically but tell me what is the meaning of these notices have you put the morning on in place of alessandra  hugh interposed thats what shes done and offered his hand with unexpected cordiality  you take my breath away said douglass i cant follow your reckless campaigns  well explain were not as reckless as we seem  they began to move towards the street hugh leading the way with the playwrights bag  helen laughed at her lovers perplexity and dismay you look befoozled  i am i cant understand after all that work and expenseafter all my toilsome grindmy sacrifice of principles  she was close to his shoulder as she said looking up at him with beaming tender eyes  thats just it i couldnt accept your offering after the morning came in my soul revolted i ordered the alessandra manuscript brought in do you know what i did with it  rewrote it i hope  her face expressed daring humor triumph but the hand lifted to the chin expressed a little apprehension as she replied rewrote it no i didnt think of that i burned it  he stopped unconscious of the streaming crowds burned it i cant believe you my greatest work  it is gone the smile died out of her eyes her face became very grave and very sweet i couldnt bear to have you bow your head to please a public not worthy of you the play was unamerican and should not have been written by you  he was dazed by the enormous consequences of this action and his mind flashed from point to point before he answered in a single word westervelt  thereat they both laughed and she explained it was dreadful he raged he shook the whole block as he trotted to and fro tearing his hair i think he wished to tear my hair he really resembled the elder salvini as othelloyou know the scene i mean i gave him a check to compensate him he tore it up and blew it into the air with a curse oh it was beautiful comedy i told him our interview would make a hit as a turn on the vaudeville stage nothing could calm him i was firm and alessandra was in ashes  they moved on out upon the walk and into the hideous clamor of fortysecond street his mind still busy with the significance of her news henry olquest in an auto sat waiting for them after a quick handshake douglass lifted helen to her place followed her with a leap and they were off on a ride which represented to him more than an association with successit seemed a triumphal progress something in helens eyes exalted him filled his throat with an emotion nigh to tears his eyes were indeed smarting as she turned to say you are just in time for dress rehearsal do you want to see it  no i leave it all to you i want to be the author if i can i want to get the thrill  i think you will like our production mr olquest has done marvels with it youll enjoy it i know you will it will restore your lost youth to you  i hope it will restore some of your lost dollars i saw by the papers that you were still struggling with enid i shudder to think what that means the other poor little play will never be able to lift that huge debt  im not so sure about that she gayly answered the rehearsals have almost resignedshe pointed at hughs backhim to the change  i confess i was surprised by his cordial greeting  oh hes quite shifted his point of view he thinks the morning may catch em on other grounds  and youyou are radiant i expected to find you worn out you dazzle me  you mustnt look at me then look at the avenue isnt it fine this morning  he took her hint it is glorious i feel that i am again at the centre of things after all this is our one great city the only place where life is diverse enough to give the dramatist his material i begin to understand the attitude of actors when they land from the ferryboat draw a long breath and say thank god im in new york again  its the only city in america where an artist can be judged by his peers i suppose that is one reason why we love it  yes its worth conquering and ill make my mark upon it yet and his tone was a note of selfmastery as well as of resolution it is a city set on a hill to take it brings great glory and lasting honor  she smiled up at him again a proud light in her eyes now you are your good rugged self the man who hypnotized me into taking lillians duty youll need all your courage the critics are to be out in force  i do not fear them he answered as they whirled into the plaza and up to the side entrance of the hotel  ive engaged a room for you here douglass said hugh and the new note of almost comradeship struck the playwright with wonder he was a little sceptical of it  very well he answered i am reckless i will stay one day  mother will be waiting to see you said helen as they entered the hall she is your stanch supporter  she is a dear mother i wish she were my own  each word he uttered now carried a hidden meaning and some inner relenting some sweet secret concession which he dimly felt but dared not presume upon gave her a girlish charm which she had never before worn in his eyes  they took lunch together seated at the same table in the same way and yet not in the same spirit he was less selfcentred less insistent his winter of proved inefficiency his sense of indebtedness to her his allcontrolling love for her gave him a new appeal he was at once tender and humorous as he referred again to alessandra  well now that my chief work of art is destroyed i must begin again at the bottom i have definitely given up all idea of following my profession i am going to do specials for one of the weeklies anderson has interceded for me i am to enter the ranks of the enemy i am not sure but i ought to do a criticism of my own play tomorrow night  she was thinking of other things tell me of your people did you talk of me to them what did they say of me  they all think of you as a kind middleaged lady who has been very good to a poor country boy  she laughed how funny why should they think me so old  they cant conceive how a mere girl can be so rich and powerful how could they realize the reckless outpouring of gold which flows from those who seek pleasure to those who give it  she grew instantly graver they would despise me if they knew i dont like being a mere toy of the publica pleasuregiver and nothing else of course there are different ways of pleasing that is why i couldnt do alessandra tell me of your brother i liked what you wrote of him he is our direct opposite isnt he does he talk as well as you reported or were you polishing him a little  no walt has a remarkable taste in words he has always been the literary member of our family but is too lazy to write he is content to grow fat in his little round of daily duties  i wonder if we havent lost something by becoming enslaved to the great city our pleasures are more intense but they do wear us out think of you and me tomorrow nightour anxiety fairly cancelling our pleasureand then think of your brother going leisurely home to his wife his babies and his books i dont knowsometimes when i think of growing old in a flat or a hotel i am appalled i hate to keep mother here sometimes i think of giving it all up for a year or two and going back to the country just to see how it would affect me i dont want to get artificial and slangy with no interests but the stage like so many good actresses i know its such a horribly egotistic business  there are others he said  writers are bad enough but actors and operasingers are infinitely worse mother has helped me she put her soft palm on her mothers wrinkled hand nothing can spoil mother nothing can take away the home atmospherenot even the hotel well now i must go to our final rehearsal i will not see you again till the close of the second act you must be in your place tonight she said with tender warning i want to see your face whenever i look for it  i am done with running away he answered as he slowly released her hand i shall pray for your successnot my own  fortunately my success is yours  in the deepest sense that is true he answered     xx   as douglass entered the theatre that night westervelt met him with beaming smile i am glad to see you looking so well mr douglass he nodded and winked you are all right now my boy you have them coming i was all wrong  what do you mean  didnt she tell you  you mean about the advance saleno  westervelt grew cautious ohwell then i will be quiet she wants to tell you she will do so  advance sale must be good thought the playwright as he walked on into the auditorium the ushers smiled and the old gatekeeper greeted him shortly  yeve won out mr douglass  can it be that this play is to mark the returning tide of helens popularity he asked himself and a tremor of excitement ran over him the first thrill of the evening up to this moment he had a curious sense of aloofness indifference as if the play were not his own but that of a stranger he began now to realize that this was his third attempt to win the favor of the public and according to an old boyish superstition should be successful  helen had invited a great american writera gracious and inspiring personalityto occupy her box to meet her playwright and once within his seat douglass awaited the coming of the great man with impatience and concern he was conscious of a great change in himself and his attitude towards helen since he last sat waiting for the curtain to rise  nothingnot even the dropping of an actcould rouse in me the slightest resentment towards her he flushed with torturing shame at the recollection of his rage his selfish demoniacal egotistic fury over the omission of his pet lines  i was insane he muttered pressing a hand to his eyes as if to shut out the memory of helens face as she looked that night and she forgave me she must have known i was demented and her sweetness her largeness of sympathy again overwhelmed him dare i ask her to marry me he no longer troubled himself about her wealth nor with the difference between them as to achievement but he comprehended at last that her superiority lay in her ability to forgive in her power to inspire love and confidence in her tact her consideration for others her wondrous unselfishness  what does the public know of her real greatness capable of imagining the most diverse types of feminine character living each night on the stage in an atmosphere of heartless and destructive intrigue she yet retains a divine integrity an inalienable graciousness dare i a moody selfish brute touch the hem of her garment  in this mood he watched the audience gathera smiling cheerfulvoiced neighborly throng there were many young girls among them and their graceful bared heads gave to the orchestra chairs a brilliant and charmingly intimate effect the roué the puffed and beefy man of sensual type was absent the middleaged bespangled gluttonous woman was absent the faces were all refined and graciousan audience selected by a common interest from among the millions who dwell within an hours travel of the theatre  douglass fancied he could detect in these auditors the same feeling of security of satisfaction of comfort with which they were accustomed to sit down of an evening with a new book by a favorite author  if i could but win a place like that he exclaimed to himself i would be satisfied it can be done when the right man comes  a dinner engagement delayed the eminent author but he came in as the curtain was rising and shaking hands cordially presented mr rufus brown a visiting london critic  mr brown is deeply interested in your attempt to do an american play said the great novelist i hopei am sure he will witness your triumph tonight thereupon they took seats with flattering promptness in order not to miss a word of the play  helen coming on a moment after was given a greeting almost frenziedly cordial and when she bowed her eyes sought the box in which her lover sat and the audience seeing the distinguished novelist and feeling some connection between them renewed their applause douglass at the back of the box rose and stood with intent to express to helen the admiration the love and the respect which he felt for her she was indeed the beautiful goldenhaired lady of whom he had written as a boy and a singular timidity a wave of worship went over him  he became the imaginative lad of the play who stood in awe and worship of mature womanhood the familiar helen was gone the glittering woman was gone and in her place stood the ideal of the boythe author himself had returned to the land of morning glowto the time when the curl of a womans lip was greater than any war the boy on the stage chanted    where i shall find her i know not   but i trust in the future to me   she will come i am not forgot   out in the great world shes waiting   perhaps by the shore of the sea   by the fabulous sea where the white sand gleams   i shall meet her and know her and claim her   the beautiful stately lady i see in my dreams  i dare not claim her said the man humbled by her beauty i am not worthy of her  the applause continued to rise instant and cordial in support of players and play auditors actors and author seemed in singularly harmonious relation as the curtain fell cries of approval mingled with the handclapping  the novelist reached a kindly hand youve found your public my dear fellow these people are here after an intelligent study of your other plays this is a gallant beginning dont you think so brown  very interesting attempt to dramatize those boyish fancies the english critic replied but i dont quite see how you can advance on these idyllic lines its pretty but is it drama  he will show us replied the novelist i have great faith in mr douglass he is helping to found an american drama you must see his other plays  westervelt came to the box wheezing with excitement my boy you are made the critics are disarmed they begin to sing of you  douglass remained calm there is plenty of time for them to turn bitter he answered i am most sceptical when they are gracious  the second act left the idyllic ground and by force of stern contrast held the audience enthralled the boy was being disillusioned the morning had grown gray doubt of his ideal beset the poet the worlds forces began to benumb and appall him his ideal woman passed to the possession of another he lost faith in himself the cloud deepened the sky overshadowed as by tempest let fall lightning and a crash of thunder so the act closed  the applause was unreservedly cordialno one failed to join in the fine roarand in the midst of it douglass true to his promise hurried back to the scenes to find helen  she met him radiant with excitement my brave boy you have won your victory they are calling for you he protested she insisted no no it is you ive been out hear them they want the author come  dazed and wordless weak from stagefright he permitted himself to be led forth into the terrifying glare of the footlight world there his guide left him abandoned him pitifully exposed to a thousand eyes helpless and awkward he turned to flee to follow her but the roguish smile on her face as she kissed her fingers towards him somehow roused his pride and gave him courage to face the tumult as he squared himself an awesome silence settled over the housea silence that inspired as well as appalled by its expectancy  friends i thank you the pale and resolute author weakly began i didnt know i had so many friends in the world two minutes ago i was so scared my teeth chattered now i am entirely at my easeyou notice that the little ripple of laughter which followed this remark really gave him time to thinkgave him courage i feel that i am at last face to face with an audience that knows my workthat is ready to support a serious attempt at playwriting i claim that a play may do something more than amuseit may interest there is a wide difference you will see to be an amusement merely is to degrade our stage to the level of a punchandjudy show i am sorry for tired men and weary women but as a dramatist i cant afford to take their troubles into account i am writing for those who are mentally alert and willing to support plays that have at least the dignity of intention which lies in our best novels this does not mean gloomy plays or problem plays but it does mean conscientious study of american life if you like me as well after the close of the playhe made dramatic pausewell i shall not be able to sleep tonight i sincerely thank you you have given me a fair hearingthat is all i can askand i am very grateful  this little speech seemed to please his auditors but his real reward came when helen met him at the wings and caught his arm to her side in an ecstatic little hug you did beautifully you make me afraid of you when you stand tall and grand like that you were scared though i could see that  you deserted me he answered in mock accusation you led me into the crackling musketry and ran away  i wanted to see of what metal you were made she answered and fled to her dressingroom to prepare for the final act  now for the real test said the novelist with a kindly smile i think we could all write plays if it were not for the difficulty of ending them  i begin to tremble for my climax douglass answered it is so important to leave a sweet and sonorous sound in the ear at the last it must die on the sense like the sound of a bell  its a remarkable achievement do you know began the english critic to carry a parable along with a realistic study of life i cant really see how youre coming out  i dont know myself replied douglass  the play closed quietly with a subjective climax so deep so true to human nature that it laid hold upon every heart the applause was slow in rising but grew in power till it filled the theatre like some great anthem no one rose no one was putting on wraps the spell lasted till the curtain rose three times on the final picture  douglass could not speak as the critic shook his hand it was so much more affecting than he had dared to hope to sit there while his ideals his hopes his best thoughts his finest conceptions were thus gloriously embodied was the greatest pleasure of his life all his doubt and bitterness was lost in a flood of gratitude to helen and to the kindly audience  as soon as he could decently escape he hurried again to helen the stage this time was crowded with people the star was hid as of old in a mob of her admirers but they were of finer quality than ever before the grateful acknowledgment of these good people was an inspiration every one smiled and yet in the eyes of many of the women tears sparkled  helen catching sight of her lover lifted her hand and called to him and though he shrank from entering the throng he obeyed those who recognized him fell back with a sort of awe of his goodfortune helen reached her hand saying huskily i am tiredtake me away  he took her arm and turned to the people still crowding to speak to her friends miss merival is very weary i beg you to excuse her it has been a very hard week for her  and with an air of mastery as significant as it was unconscious he led her to her room  safely inside the door she turned and with a finger to her lips a roguish light in her eyes she said i want to tell you something i cant wait any longer enids choice ran to the capacity of the house last week  for a moment he did not realize the full significance of this what enids choice why how can that be i thought  we had twelve hundred and eighty dollars at the saturday matinée and eleven hundred at night of course part of this was due to the knowledge that it was the last day of the piece but there is no doubt of its success  a choking came to his throat his eyes grew dim i cant believe it such success is impossible to me  it is true and that is the reason i was able to burn alessandra  and that is the reason hugh and westervelt were so cordial and i thought it was all on account of the advance sale of the morning  and this is only the beginning i intend to play all your plays in a repertoire and youre to write me others as i need them and finallyand this i hate to acknowledgeyou are no longer in my debt  that i know is not true he said everything i am tonight i owe to you  the resplendent author has made the wondrous woman very proud and yet very humble tonight she ended softly with eyelashes drooping  she has reared a giant that seeks to devour her he caught her to his side do you know what all this means to you and to me it means that we are to be something more than playwright and star it means that i will not be satisfied till your life and mine are one  she put him away in such wise that her gesture of dismissal allured you must go dearest our friends are waiting and i must dress some time i will tell you how muchyou have become to mebut not now  he turned away exultant for her eyes had already confessed the secret which her lips still shrank from uttering   the end
