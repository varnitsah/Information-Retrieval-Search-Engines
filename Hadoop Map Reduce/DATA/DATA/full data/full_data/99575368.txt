night of terror   24  home     1  belgian and arab   lieutenant albert werper had only the prestige of the name he had dishonored to thank for his narrow escape from being cashiered  at first he had been humbly thankful too that they had sent him to this godforsaken congo post instead of courtmartialing him as he had so justly deserved but now six months of the monotony the frightful isolation and the loneliness had wrought a change  the young man brooded continually over his fate  his days were filled with morbid selfpity which eventually engendered in his weak and vacillating mind a hatred for those who had sent him herefor the very men he had at first inwardly thanked for saving him from the ignominy of degradation  he regretted the gay life of brussels as he never had regretted the sins which had snatched him from that gayest of capitals and as the days passed he came to center his resentment upon the representative in congo land of the authority which had exiled himhis captain and immediate superior  this officer was a cold taciturn man inspiring little love in those directly beneath him yet respected and feared by the black soldiers of his little command  werper was accustomed to sit for hours glaring at his superior as the two sat upon the veranda of their common quarters smoking their evening cigarets in a silence which neither seemed desirous of breaking  the senseless hatred of the lieutenant grew at last into a form of mania  the captains natural taciturnity he distorted into a studied attempt to insult him because of his past shortcomings  he imagined that his superior held him in contempt and so he chafed and fumed inwardly until one evening his madness became suddenly homicidal he fingered the butt of the revolver at his hip his eyes narrowed and his brows contracted  at last he spoke  you have insulted me for the last time he cried springing to his feet  i am an officer and a gentleman and i shall put up with it no longer without an accounting from you you pig  the captain an expression of surprise upon his features turned toward his junior  he had seen men before with the jungle madness upon themthe madness of solitude and unrestrained brooding and perhaps a touch of fever  he rose and extended his hand to lay it upon the others shoulder quiet words of counsel were upon his lips but they were never spoken werper construed his superiors action into an attempt to close with him  his revolver was on a level with the captains heart and the latter had taken but a step when werper pulled the trigger  without a moan the man sank to the rough planking of the veranda and as he fell the mists that had clouded werpers brain lifted so that he saw himself and the deed that he had done in the same light that those who must judge him would see them  he heard excited exclamations from the quarters of the soldiers and he heard men running in his direction  they would seize him and if they didnt kill him they would take him down the congo to a point where a properly ordered military tribunal would do so just as effectively though in a more regular manner  werper had no desire to die  never before had he so yearned for life as in this moment that he had so effectively forfeited his right to live  the men were nearing him  what was he to do  he glanced about as though searching for the tangible form of a legitimate excuse for his crime but he could find only the body of the man he had so causelessly shot down  in despair he turned and fled from the oncoming soldiery  across the compound he ran his revolver still clutched tightly in his hand  at the gates a sentry halted him  werper did not pause to parley or to exert the influence of his commissionhe merely raised his weapon and shot down the innocent black  a moment later the fugitive had torn open the gates and vanished into the blackness of the jungle but not before he had transferred the rifle and ammunition belts of the dead sentry to his own person  all that night werper fled farther and farther into the heart of the wilderness  now and again the voice of a lion brought him to a listening halt but with cocked and ready rifle he pushed ahead again more fearful of the human huntsmen in his rear than of the wild carnivora ahead  dawn came at last but still the man plodded on  all sense of hunger and fatigue were lost in the terrors of contemplated capture  he could think only of escape  he dared not pause to rest or eat until there was no further danger from pursuit and so he staggered on until at last he fell and could rise no more  how long he had fled he did not know or try to know  when he could flee no longer the knowledge that he had reached his limit was hidden from him in the unconsciousness of utter exhaustion  and thus it was that achmet zek the arab found him  achmets followers were for running a spear through the body of their hereditary enemy but achmet would have it otherwise  first he would question the belgian  it were easier to question a man first and kill him afterward than kill him first and then question him  so he had lieutenant albert werper carried to his own tent and there slaves administered wine and food in small quantities until at last the prisoner regained consciousness  as he opened his eyes he saw the faces of strange black men about him and just outside the tent the figure of an arab  nowhere was the uniform of his soldiers to be seen  the arab turned and seeing the open eyes of the prisoner upon him entered the tent  i am achmet zek he announced  who are you and what were you doing in my country  where are your soldiers  achmet zek  werpers eyes went wide and his heart sank  he was in the clutches of the most notorious of cutthroatsa hater of all europeans especially those who wore the uniform of belgium  for years the military forces of belgian congo had waged a fruitless war upon this man and his followersa war in which quarter had never been asked nor expected by either side  but presently in the very hatred of the man for belgians werper saw a faint ray of hope for himself  he too was an outcast and an outlaw so far at least they possessed a common interest and werper decided to play upon it for all that it might yield  i have heard of you he replied and was searching for you  my people have turned against me  i hate them  even now their soldiers are searching for me to kill me  i knew that you would protect me from them for you too hate them  in return i will take service with you  i am a trained soldier  i can fight and your enemies are my enemies  achmet zek eyed the european in silence  in his mind he revolved many thoughts chief among which was that the unbeliever lied  of course there was the chance that he did not lie and if he told the truth then his proposition was one well worthy of consideration since fighting men were never over plentifulespecially white men with the training and knowledge of military matters that a european officer must possess  achmet zek scowled and werpers heart sank but werper did not know achmet zek who was quite apt to scowl where another would smile and smile where another would scowl  and if you have lied to me said achmet zek i will kill you at any time  what return other than your life do you expect for your services  my keep only at first replied werper  later if i am worth more we can easily reach an understanding werpers only desire at the moment was to preserve his life  and so the agreement was reached and lieutenant albert werper became a member of the ivory and slave raiding band of the notorious achmet zek  for months the renegade belgian rode with the savage raider  he fought with a savage abandon and a vicious cruelty fully equal to that of his fellow desperadoes  achmet zek watched his recruit with eagle eye and with a growing satisfaction which finally found expression in a greater confidence in the man and resulted in an increased independence of action for werper  achmet zek took the belgian into his confidence to a great extent and at last unfolded to him a pet scheme which the arab had long fostered but which he never had found an opportunity to effect  with the aid of a european however the thing might be easily accomplished  he sounded werper  you have heard of the man men call tarzan he asked  werper nodded  i have heard of him but i do not know him  but for him we might carry on our trading in safety and with great profit continued the arab  for years he has fought us driving us from the richest part of the country harassing us and arming the natives that they may repel us when we come to trade he is very rich  if we could find some way to make him pay us many pieces of gold we should not only be avenged upon him but repaid for much that he has prevented us from winning from the natives under his protection  werper withdrew a cigaret from a jeweled case and lighted it  and you have a plan to make him pay he asked  he has a wife replied achmet zek whom men say is very beautiful she would bring a great price farther north if we found it too difficult to collect ransom money from this tarzan  werper bent his head in thought  achmet zek stood awaiting his reply what good remained in albert werper revolted at the thought of selling a white woman into the slavery and degradation of a moslem harem  he looked up at achmet zek  he saw the arabs eyes narrow and he guessed that the other had sensed his antagonism to the plan  what would it mean to werper to refuse  his life lay in the hands of this semibarbarian  who esteemed the life of an unbeliever less highly than that of a dog  werper loved life  what was this woman to him anyway  she was a european doubtless a member of organized society he was an outcast  the hand of every white man was against him  she was his natural enemy and if he refused to lend himself to her undoing achmet zek would have him killed  you hesitate murmured the arab  i was but weighing the chances of success lied werper and my reward  as a european i can gain admittance to their home and table you have no other with you who could do so much  the risk will be great  i should be well paid achmet zek  a smile of relief passed over the raiders face  well said werper and achmet zek slapped his lieutenant upon the shoulder  you should be well paid and you shall  now let us sit together and plan how best the thing may be done and the two men squatted upon a soft rug beneath the faded silks of achmets once gorgeous tent and talked together in low voices well into the night both were tall and bearded and the exposure to sun and wind had given an almost arab hue to the europeans complexion  in every detail of dress too he copied the fashions of his chief so that outwardly he was as much an arab as the other  it was late when he arose and retired to his own tent  the following day werper spent in overhauling his belgian uniform removing from it every vestige of evidence that might indicate its military purposes  from a heterogeneous collection of loot achmet zek procured a pith helmet and a european saddle and from his black slaves and followers a party of porters askaris and tent boys to make up a modest safari for a big game hunter  at the head of this party werper set out from camp     2  on the road to opar   it was two weeks later that john clayton lord greystoke riding in from a tour of inspection of his vast african estate glimpsed the head of a column of men crossing the plain that lay between his bungalow and the forest to the north and west  he reined in his horse and watched the little party as it emerged from a concealing swale  his keen eyes caught the reflection of the sun upon the white helmet of a mounted man and with the conviction that a wandering european hunter was seeking his hospitality he wheeled his mount and rode slowly forward to meet the newcomer  a half hour later he was mounting the steps leading to the veranda of his bungalow and introducing m jules frecoult to lady greystoke  i was completely lost m frecoult was explaining  my head man had never before been in this part of the country and the guides who were to have accompanied me from the last village we passed knew even less of the country than we  they finally deserted us two days since  i am very fortunate indeed to have stumbled so providentially upon succor i do not know what i should have done had i not found you  it was decided that frecoult and his party should remain several days or until they were thoroughly rested when lord greystoke would furnish guides to lead them safely back into country with which frecoults head man was supposedly familiar  in his guise of a french gentleman of leisure werper found little difficulty in deceiving his host and in ingratiating himself with both tarzan and jane clayton but the longer he remained the less hopeful he became of an easy accomplishment of his designs  lady greystoke never rode alone at any great distance from the bungalow and the savage loyalty of the ferocious waziri warriors who formed a great part of tarzans followers seemed to preclude the possibility of a successful attempt at forcible abduction or of the bribery of the waziri themselves  a week passed and werper was no nearer the fulfillment of his plan in so far as he could judge than upon the day of his arrival but at that very moment something occurred which gave him renewed hope and set his mind upon an even greater reward than a womans ransom  a runner had arrived at the bungalow with the weekly mail and lord greystoke had spent the afternoon in his study reading and answering letters  at dinner he seemed distraught and early in the evening he excused himself and retired lady greystoke following him very soon after  werper sitting upon the veranda could hear their voices in earnest discussion and having realized that something of unusual moment was afoot he quietly rose from his chair and keeping well in the shadow of the shrubbery growing profusely about the bungalow made his silent way to a point beneath the window of the room in which his host and hostess slept  here he listened and not without result for almost the first words he overheard filled him with excitement  lady greystoke was speaking as werper came within hearing  i always feared for the stability of the company she was saying but it seems incredible that they should have failed for so enormous a sumunless there has been some dishonest manipulation  that is what i suspect replied tarzan but whatever the cause the fact remains that i have lost everything and there is nothing for it but to return to opar and get more  oh john cried lady greystoke and werper could feel the shudder through her voice is there no other way  i cannot bear to think of you returning to that frightful city  i would rather live in poverty always than to have you risk the hideous dangers of opar  you need have no fear replied tarzan laughing  i am pretty well able to take care of myself and were i not the waziri who will accompany me will see that no harm befalls me  they ran away from opar once and left you to your fate she reminded him  they will not do it again he answered  they were very much ashamed of themselves and were coming back when i met them  but there must be some other way insisted the woman  there is no other way half so easy to obtain another fortune as to go to the treasure vaults of opar and bring it away he replied  i shall be very careful jane and the chances are that the inhabitants of opar will never know that i have been there again and despoiled them of another portion of the treasure the very existence of which they are as ignorant of as they would be of its value  the finality in his tone seemed to assure lady greystoke that further argument was futile and so she abandoned the subject  werper remained listening for a short time and then confident that he had overheard all that was necessary and fearing discovery returned to the veranda where he smoked numerous cigarets in rapid succession before retiring  the following morning at breakfast werper announced his intention of making an early departure and asked tarzans permission to hunt big game in the waziri country on his way outpermission which lord greystoke readily granted  the belgian consumed two days in completing his preparations but finally got away with his safari accompanied by a single waziri guide whom lord greystoke had loaned him  the party made but a single short march when werper simulated illness and announced his intention of remaining where he was until he had fully recovered  as they had gone but a short distance from the greystoke bungalow werper dismissed the waziri guide telling the warrior that he would send for him when he was able to proceed  the waziri gone the belgian summoned one of achmet zeks trusted blacks to his tent and dispatched him to watch for the departure of tarzan returning immediately to advise werper of the event and the direction taken by the englishman  the belgian did not have long to wait for the following day his emissary returned with word that tarzan and a party of fifty waziri warriors had set out toward the southeast early in the morning  werper called his head man to him after writing a long letter to achmet zek  this letter he handed to the head man  send a runner at once to achmet zek with this he instructed the head man  remain here in camp awaiting further instructions from him or from me  if any come from the bungalow of the englishman tell them that i am very ill within my tent and can see no one  now give me six porters and six askaristhe strongest and bravest of the safariand i will march after the englishman and discover where his gold is hidden  and so it was that as tarzan stripped to the loin cloth and armed after the primitive fashion he best loved led his loyal waziri toward the dead city of opar werper the renegade haunted his trail through the long hot days and camped close behind him by night  and as they marched achmet zek rode with his entire following southward toward the greystoke farm  to tarzan of the apes the expedition was in the nature of a holiday outing  his civilization was at best but an outward veneer which he gladly peeled off with his uncomfortable european clothes whenever any reasonable pretext presented itself  it was a womans love which kept tarzan even to the semblance of civilizationa condition for which familiarity had bred contempt  he hated the shams and the hypocrisies of it and with the clear vision of an unspoiled mind he had penetrated to the rotten core of the heart of the thingthe cowardly greed for peace and ease and the safeguarding of property rights  that the fine things of lifeart music and literaturehad thriven upon such enervating ideals he strenuously denied insisting rather that they had endured in spite of civilization  show me the fat opulent coward he was wont to say who ever originated a beautiful ideal  in the clash of arms in the battle for survival amid hunger and death and danger in the face of god as manifested in the display of natures most terrific forces is born all that is finest and best in the human heart and mind  and so tarzan always came back to nature in the spirit of a lover keeping a long deferred tryst after a period behind prison walls  his waziri at marrow were more civilized than he  they cooked their meat before they ate it and they shunned many articles of food as unclean that tarzan had eaten with gusto all his life and so insidious is the virus of hypocrisy that even the stalwart apeman hesitated to give rein to his natural longings before them  he ate burnt flesh when he would have preferred it raw and unspoiled and he brought down game with arrow or spear when he would far rather have leaped upon it from ambush and sunk his strong teeth in its jugular but at last the call of the milk of the savage mother that had suckled him in infancy rose to an insistent demandhe craved the hot blood of a fresh kill and his muscles yearned to pit themselves against the savage jungle in the battle for existence that had been his sole birthright for the first twenty years of his life     3  the call of the jungle   moved by these vague yet allpowerful urgings the apeman lay awake one night in the little thorn boma that protected in a way his party from the depredations of the great carnivora of the jungle  a single warrior stood sleepy guard beside the fire that yellow eyes out of the darkness beyond the camp made imperative  the moans and the coughing of the big cats mingled with the myriad noises of the lesser denizens of the jungle to fan the savage flame in the breast of this savage english lord  he tossed upon his bed of grasses sleepless for an hour and then he rose noiseless as a wraith and while the waziris back was turned vaulted the boma wall in the face of the flaming eyes swung silently into a great tree and was gone  for a time in sheer exuberance of animal spirit he raced swiftly through the middle terrace swinging perilously across wide spans from one jungle giant to the next and then he clambered upward to the swaying lesser boughs of the upper terrace where the moon shone full upon him and the air was stirred by little breezes and death lurked ready in each frail branch  here he paused and raised his face to goro the moon  with uplifted arm he stood the cry of the bull ape quivering upon his lips yet he remained silent lest he arouse his faithful waziri who were all too familiar with the hideous challenge of their master  and then he went on more slowly and with greater stealth and caution for now tarzan of the apes was seeking a kill  down to the ground he came in the utter blackness of the closeset boles and the overhanging verdure of the jungle he stooped from time to time and put his nose close to earth  he sought and found a wide game trail and at last his nostrils were rewarded with the scent of the fresh spoor of bara the deer  tarzans mouth watered and a low growl escaped his patrician lips  sloughed from him was the last vestige of artificial casteonce again he was the primeval hunterthe first manthe highest caste type of the human race  up wind he followed the elusive spoor with a sense of perception so transcending that of ordinary man as to be inconceivable to us  through counter currents of the heavy stench of meat eaters he traced the trail of bara the sweet and cloying stink of horta the boar could not drown his quarrys scentthe permeating mellow musk of the deers foot  presently the body scent of the deer told tarzan that his prey was close at hand  it sent him into the trees againinto the lower terrace where he could watch the ground below and catch with ears and nose the first intimation of actual contact with his quarry  nor was it long before the apeman came upon bara standing alert at the edge of a moonbathed clearing  noiselessly tarzan crept through the trees until he was directly over the deer  in the apemans right hand was the long hunting knife of his father and in his heart the blood lust of the carnivore  just for an instant he poised above the unsuspecting bara and then he launched himself downward upon the sleek back  the impact of his weight carried the deer to its knees and before the animal could regain its feet the knife had found its heart  as tarzan rose upon the body of his kill to scream forth his hideous victory cry into the face of the moon the wind carried to his nostrils something which froze him to statuesque immobility and silence  his savage eyes blazed into the direction from which the wind had borne down the warning to him and a moment later the grasses at one side of the clearing parted and numa the lion strode majestically into view  his yellowgreen eyes were fastened upon tarzan as he halted just within the clearing and glared enviously at the successful hunter for numa had had no luck this night  from the lips of the apeman broke a rumbling growl of warning  numa answered but he did not advance  instead he stood waving his tail gently to and fro and presently tarzan squatted upon his kill and cut a generous portion from a hind quarter  numa eyed him with growing resentment and rage as between mouthfuls the apeman growled out his savage warnings  now this particular lion had never before come in contact with tarzan of the apes and he was much mystified  here was the appearance and the scent of a manthing and numa had tasted of human flesh and learned that though not the most palatable it was certainly by far the easiest to secure yet there was that in the bestial growls of the strange creature which reminded him of formidable antagonists and gave him pause while his hunger and the odor of the hot flesh of bara goaded him almost to madness  always tarzan watched him guessing what was passing in the little brain of the carnivore and well it was that he did watch him for at last numa could stand it no longer  his tail shot suddenly erect and at the same instant the wary apeman knowing all too well what the signal portended grasped the remainder of the deers hind quarter between his teeth and leaped into a nearby tree as numa charged him with all the speed and a sufficient semblance of the weight of an express train  tarzans retreat was no indication that he felt fear  jungle life is ordered along different lines than ours and different standards prevail  had tarzan been famished he would doubtless have stood his ground and met the lions charge  he had done the thing before upon more than one occasion just as in the past he had charged lions himself but tonight he was far from famished and in the hind quarter he had carried off with him was more raw flesh than he could eat yet it was with no equanimity that he looked down upon numa rending the flesh of tarzans kill  the presumption of this strange numa must be punished  and forthwith tarzan set out to make life miserable for the big cat  close by were many trees bearing large hard fruits and to one of these the apeman swung with the agility of a squirrel  then commenced a bombardment which brought forth earthshaking roars from numa  one after another as rapidly as he could gather and hurl them tarzan pelted the hard fruit down upon the lion  it was impossible for the tawny cat to eat under that hail of missileshe could but roar and growl and dodge and eventually he was driven away entirely from the carcass of bara the deer  he went roaring and resentful but in the very center of the clearing his voice was suddenly hushed and tarzan saw the great head lower and flatten out the body crouch and the long tail quiver as the beast slunk cautiously toward the trees upon the opposite side  immediately tarzan was alert  he lifted his head and sniffed the slow jungle breeze  what was it that had attracted numas attention and taken him softfooted and silent away from the scene of his discomfiture  just as the lion disappeared among the trees beyond the clearing tarzan caught upon the downcoming wind the explanation of his new interestthe scent spoor of man was wafted strongly to the sensitive nostrils  caching the remainder of the deers hind quarter in the crotch of a tree the apeman wiped his greasy palms upon his naked thighs and swung off in pursuit of numa  a broad wellbeaten elephant path led into the forest from the clearing  parallel to this slunk numa while above him tarzan moved through the trees the shadow of a wraith  the savage cat and the savage man saw numas quarry almost simultaneously though both had known before it came within the vision of their eyes that it was a black man  their sensitive nostrils had told them this much and tarzans had told him that the scent spoor was that of a strangerold and a male for race and sex and age each has its own distinctive scent  it was an old man that made his way alone through the gloomy jungle a wrinkled dried up little old man hideously scarred and tattooed and strangely garbed with the skin of a hyena about his shoulders and the dried head mounted upon his grey pate  tarzan recognized the earmarks of the witchdoctor and awaited numas charge with a feeling of pleasurable anticipation for the apeman had no love for witchdoctors but in the instant that numa did charge the white man suddenly recalled that the lion had stolen his kill a few minutes before and that revenge is sweet  the first intimation the black man had that he was in danger was the crash of twigs as numa charged through the bushes into the game trail not twenty yards behind him  then he turned to see a huge blackmaned lion racing toward him and even as he turned numa seized him  at the same instant the apeman dropped from an overhanging limb full upon the lions back and as he alighted he plunged his knife into the tawny side behind the left shoulder tangled the fingers of his right hand in the long mane buried his teeth in numas neck and wound his powerful legs about the beasts torso  with a roar of pain and rage numa reared up and fell backward upon the apeman but still the mighty manthing clung to his hold and repeatedly the long knife plunged rapidly into his side  over and over rolled numa the lion clawing and biting at the air roaring and growling horribly in savage attempt to reach the thing upon its back  more than once was tarzan almost brushed from his hold  he was battered and bruised and covered with blood from numa and dirt from the trail yet not for an instant did he lessen the ferocity of his mad attack nor his grim hold upon the back of his antagonist to have loosened for an instant his grip there would have been to bring him within reach of those tearing talons or rending fangs and have ended forever the grim career of this junglebred english lord where he had fallen beneath the spring of the lion the witchdoctor lay torn and bleeding unable to drag himself away and watched the terrific battle between these two lords of the jungle  his sunken eyes glittered and his wrinkled lips moved over toothless gums as he mumbled weird incantations to the demons of his cult  for a time he felt no doubt as to the outcomethe strange white man must certainly succumb to terrible simbawhoever heard of a lone man armed only with a knife slaying so mighty a beast  yet presently the old black mans eyes went wider and he commenced to have his doubts and misgivings  what wonderful sort of creature was this that battled with simba and held his own despite the mighty muscles of the king of beasts and slowly there dawned in those sunken eyes gleaming so brightly from the scarred and wrinkled face the light of a dawning recollection gropingly backward into the past reached the fingers of memory until at last they seized upon a faint picture faded and yellow with the passing years  it was the picture of a lithe whiteskinned youth swinging through the trees in company with a band of huge apes and the old eyes blinked and a great fear came into themthe superstitious fear of one who believes in ghosts and spirits and demons  and came the time once more when the witchdoctor no longer doubted the outcome of the duel yet his first judgment was reversed for now he knew that the jungle god would slay simba and the old black was even more terrified of his own impending fate at the hands of the victor than he had been by the sure and sudden death which the triumphant lion would have meted out to him  he saw the lion weaken from loss of blood  he saw the mighty limbs tremble and stagger and at last he saw the beast sink down to rise no more  he saw the forest god or demon rise from the vanquished foe and placing a foot upon the still quivering carcass raise his face to the moon and bay out a hideous cry that froze the ebbing blood in the veins of the witchdoctor     4  prophecy and fulfillment   then tarzan turned his attention to the man  he had not slain numa to save the negrohe had merely done it in revenge upon the lion but now that he saw the old man lying helpless and dying before him something akin to pity touched his savage heart  in his youth he would have slain the witchdoctor without the slightest compunction but civilization had had its softening effect upon him even as it does upon the nations and races which it touches though it had not yet gone far enough with tarzan to render him either cowardly or effeminate  he saw an old man suffering and dying and he stooped and felt of his wounds and stanched the flow of blood  who are you asked the old man in a trembling voice  i am tarzantarzan of the apes replied the apeman and not without a greater touch of pride than he would have said i am john clayton lord greystoke  the witchdoctor shook convulsively and closed his eyes  when he opened them again there was in them a resignation to whatever horrible fate awaited him at the hands of this feared demon of the woods  why do you not kill me he asked  why should i kill you inquired tarzan  you have not harmed me and anyway you are already dying  numa the lion has killed you  you would not kill me surprise and incredulity were in the tones of the quavering old voice  i would save you if i could replied tarzan but that cannot be done  why did you think i would kill you  for a moment the old man was silent  when he spoke it was evidently after some little effort to muster his courage  i knew you of old he said when you ranged the jungle in the country of mbonga the chief  i was already a witchdoctor when you slew kulonga and the others and when you robbed our huts and our poison pot  at first i did not remember you but at last i didthe whiteskinned ape that lived with the hairy apes and made life miserable in the village of mbonga the chiefthe forest godthe munangokeewati for whom we set food outside our gates and who came and ate it  tell me before i dieare you man or devil  tarzan laughed  i am a man he said  the old fellow sighed and shook his head  you have tried to save me from simba he said  for that i shall reward you  i am a great witchdoctor  listen to me white man  i see bad days ahead of you it is writ in my own blood which i have smeared upon my palm  a god greater even than you will rise up and strike you down  turn back munangokeewati  turn back before it is too late  danger lies ahead of you and danger lurks behind but greater is the danger before  i see he paused and drew a long gasping breath  then he crumpled into a little wrinkled heap and died  tarzan wondered what else he had seen  it was very late when the apeman reentered the boma and lay down among his black warriors  none had seen him go and none saw him return  he thought about the warning of the old witchdoctor before he fell asleep and he thought of it again after he awoke but he did not turn back for he was unafraid though had he known what lay in store for one he loved most in all the world he would have flown through the trees to her side and allowed the gold of opar to remain forever hidden in its forgotten storehouse  behind him that morning another white man pondered something he had heard during the night and very nearly did he give up his project and turn back upon his trail  it was werper the murderer who in the still of the night had heard far away upon the trail ahead of him a sound that had filled his cowardly soul with terrora sound such as he never before had heard in all his life nor dreamed that such a frightful thing could emanate from the lungs of a godcreated creature he had heard the victory cry of the bull ape as tarzan had screamed it forth into the face of goro the moon and he had trembled then and hidden his face and now in the broad light of a new day he trembled again as he recalled it and would have turned back from the nameless danger the echo of that frightful sound seemed to portend had he not stood in even greater fear of achmet zek his master  and so tarzan of the apes forged steadily ahead toward opars ruined ramparts and behind him slunk werper jackallike and only god knew what lay in store for each  at the edge of the desolate valley overlooking the golden domes and minarets of opar tarzan halted  by night he would go alone to the treasure vault reconnoitering for he had determined that caution should mark his every move upon this expedition  with the coming of night he set forth and werper who had scaled the cliffs alone behind the apemans party and hidden through the day among the rough boulders of the mountain top slunk stealthily after him  the boulderstrewn plain between the valleys edge and the mighty granite kopje outside the citys walls where lay the entrance to the passageway leading to the treasure vault gave the belgian ample cover as he followed tarzan toward opar  he saw the giant apeman swing himself nimbly up the face of the great rock  werper clawing fearfully during the perilous ascent sweating in terror almost palsied by fear but spurred on by avarice following upward until at last he stood upon the summit of the rocky hill  tarzan was nowhere in sight  for a time werper hid behind one of the lesser boulders that were scattered over the top of the hill but seeing or hearing nothing of the englishman he crept from his place of concealment to undertake a systematic search of his surroundings in the hope that he might discover the location of the treasure in ample time to make his escape before tarzan returned for it was the belgians desire merely to locate the gold that after tarzan had departed he might come in safety with his followers and carry away as much as he could transport  he found the narrow cleft leading downward into the heart of the kopje along wellworn granite steps  he advanced quite to the dark mouth of the tunnel into which the runway disappeared but here he halted fearing to enter lest he meet tarzan returning  the apeman far ahead of him groped his way along the rocky passage until he came to the ancient wooden door  a moment later he stood within the treasure chamber where ages since longdead hands had ranged the lofty rows of precious ingots for the rulers of that great continent which now lies submerged beneath the waters of the atlantic  no sound broke the stillness of the subterranean vault  there was no evidence that another had discovered the forgotten wealth since last the apeman had visited its hiding place  satisfied tarzan turned and retraced his steps toward the summit of the kopje  werper from the concealment of a jutting granite shoulder watched him pass up from the shadows of the stairway and advance toward the edge of the hill which faced the rim of the valley where the waziri awaited the signal of their master  then werper slipping stealthily from his hiding place dropped into the somber darkness of the entrance and disappeared  tarzan halting upon the kopjes edge raised his voice in the thunderous roar of a lion  twice at regular intervals he repeated the call standing in attentive silence for several minutes after the echoes of the third call had died away  and then from far across the valley faintly came an answering roaronce twice thrice  basuli the waziri chieftain had heard and replied  tarzan again made his way toward the treasure vault knowing that in a few hours his blacks would be with him ready to bear away another fortune in the strangely shaped golden ingots of opar  in the meantime he would carry as much of the precious metal to the summit of the kopje as he could  six trips he made in the five hours before basuli reached the kopje and at the end of that time he had transported fortyeight ingots to the edge of the great boulder carrying upon each trip a load which might well have staggered two ordinary men yet his giant frame showed no evidence of fatigue as he helped to raise his ebon warriors to the hill top with the rope that had been brought for the purpose  six times he had returned to the treasure chamber and six times werper the belgian had cowered in the black shadows at the far end of the long vault  once again came the apeman and this time there came with him fifty fighting men turning porters for love of the only creature in the world who might command of their fierce and haughty natures such menial service  fiftytwo more ingots passed out of the vaults making the total of one hundred which tarzan intended taking away with him  as the last of the waziri filed from the chamber tarzan turned back for a last glimpse of the fabulous wealth upon which his two inroads had made no appreciable impression  before he extinguished the single candle he had brought with him for the purpose and the flickering light of which had cast the first alleviating rays into the impenetrable darkness of the buried chamber that it had known for the countless ages since it had lain forgotten of man tarzans mind reverted to that first occasion upon which he had entered the treasure vault coming upon it by chance as he fled from the pits beneath the temple where he had been hidden by la the high priestess of the sun worshipers  he recalled the scene within the temple when he had lain stretched upon the sacrificial altar while la with highraised dagger stood above him and the rows of priests and priestesses awaited in the ecstatic hysteria of fanaticism the first gush of their victims warm blood that they might fill their golden goblets and drink to the glory of their flaming god  the brutal and bloody interruption by tha the mad priest passed vividly before the apemans recollective eyes the flight of the votaries before the insane blood lust of the hideous creature the brutal attack upon la and his own part of the grim tragedy when he had battled with the infuriated oparian and left him dead at the feet of the priestess he would have profaned  this and much more passed through tarzans memory as he stood gazing at the long tiers of dullyellow metal  he wondered if la still ruled the temples of the ruined city whose crumbling walls rose upon the very foundations about him  had she finally been forced into a union with one of her grotesque priests  it seemed a hideous fate indeed for one so beautiful  with a shake of his head tarzan stepped to the flickering candle extinguished its feeble rays and turned toward the exit  behind him the spy waited for him to be gone  he had learned the secret for which he had come and now he could return at his leisure to his waiting followers bring them to the treasure vault and carry away all the gold that they could stagger under  the waziri had reached the outer end of the tunnel and were winding upward toward the fresh air and the welcome starlight of the kopjes summit before tarzan shook off the detaining hand of reverie and started slowly after them  once again and he thought for the last time he closed the massive door of the treasure room  in the darkness behind him werper rose and stretched his cramped muscles  he stretched forth a hand and lovingly caressed a golden ingot on the nearest tier  he raised it from its immemorial resting place and weighed it in his hands  he clutched it to his bosom in an ecstasy of avarice  tarzan dreamed of the happy homecoming which lay before him of dear arms about his neck and a soft cheek pressed to his but there rose to dispel that dream the memory of the old witchdoctor and his warning  and then in the span of a few brief seconds the hopes of both these men were shattered  the one forgot even his greed in the panic of terrorthe other was plunged into total forgetfulness of the past by a jagged fragment of rock which gashed a deep cut upon his head     5  the altar of the flaming god   it was at the moment that tarzan turned from the closed door to pursue his way to the outer world  the thing came without warning  one instant all was quiet and stabilitythe next and the world rocked the tortured sides of the narrow passageway split and crumbled great blocks of granite dislodged from the ceiling tumbled into the narrow way choking it and the walls bent inward upon the wreckage  beneath the blow of a fragment of the roof tarzan staggered back against the door to the treasure room his weight pushed it open and his body rolled inward upon the floor  in the great apartment where the treasure lay less damage was wrought by the earthquake  a few ingots toppled from the higher tiers a single piece of the rocky ceiling splintered off and crashed downward to the floor and the walls cracked though they did not collapse  there was but the single shock no other followed to complete the damage undertaken by the first  werper thrown to his length by the suddenness and violence of the disturbance staggered to his feet when he found himself unhurt  groping his way toward the far end of the chamber he sought the candle which tarzan had left stuck in its own wax upon the protruding end of an ingot  by striking numerous matches the belgian at last found what he sought and when a moment later the sickly rays relieved the stygian darkness about him he breathed a nervous sigh of relief for the impenetrable gloom had accentuated the terrors of his situation  as they became accustomed to the light the man turned his eyes toward the doorhis one thought now was of escape from this frightful tomband as he did so he saw the body of the naked giant lying stretched upon the floor just within the doorway  werper drew back in sudden fear of detection but a second glance convinced him that the englishman was dead  from a great gash in the mans head a pool of blood had collected upon the concrete floor  quickly the belgian leaped over the prostrate form of his erstwhile host and without a thought of succor for the man in whom for aught he knew life still remained he bolted for the passageway and safety  but his renewed hopes were soon dashed  just beyond the doorway he found the passage completely clogged and choked by impenetrable masses of shattered rock  once more he turned and reentered the treasure vault  taking the candle from its place he commenced a systematic search of the apartment nor had he gone far before he discovered another door in the opposite end of the room a door which gave upon creaking hinges to the weight of his body  beyond the door lay another narrow passageway  along this werper made his way ascending a flight of stone steps to another corridor twenty feet above the level of the first  the flickering candle lighted the way before him and a moment later he was thankful for the possession of this crude and antiquated luminant which a few hours before he might have looked upon with contempt for it showed him just in time a yawning pit apparently terminating the tunnel he was traversing  before him was a circular shaft  he held the candle above it and peered downward  below him at a great distance he saw the light reflected back from the surface of a pool of water  he had come upon a well  he raised the candle above his head and peered across the black void and there upon the opposite side he saw the continuation of the tunnel but how was he to span the gulf  as he stood there measuring the distance to the opposite side and wondering if he dared venture so great a leap there broke suddenly upon his startled ears a piercing scream which diminished gradually until it ended in a series of dismal moans  the voice seemed partly human yet so hideous that it might well have emanated from the tortured throat of a lost soul writhing in the fires of hell  the belgian shuddered and looked fearfully upward for the scream had seemed to come from above him  as he looked he saw an opening far overhead and a patch of sky pinked with brilliant stars  his halfformed intention to call for help was expunged by the terrifying crywhere such a voice lived no human creatures could dwell  he dared not reveal himself to whatever inhabitants dwelt in the place above him  he cursed himself for a fool that he had ever embarked upon such a mission  he wished himself safely back in the camp of achmet zek and would almost have embraced an opportunity to give himself up to the military authorities of the congo if by so doing he might be rescued from the frightful predicament in which he now was  he listened fearfully but the cry was not repeated and at last spurred to desperate means he gathered himself for the leap across the chasm  going back twenty paces he took a running start and at the edge of the well leaped upward and outward in an attempt to gain the opposite side  in his hand he clutched the sputtering candle and as he took the leap the rush of air extinguished it  in utter darkness he flew through space clutching outward for a hold should his feet miss the invisible ledge  he struck the edge of the door of the opposite terminus of the rocky tunnel with his knees slipped backward clutched desperately for a moment and at last hung half within and half without the opening but he was safe  for several minutes he dared not move but clung weak and sweating where he lay  at last cautiously he drew himself well within the tunnel and again he lay at full length upon the floor fighting to regain control of his shattered nerves  when his knees struck the edge of the tunnel he had dropped the candle presently hoping against hope that it had fallen upon the floor of the passageway rather than back into the depths of the well he rose upon all fours and commenced a diligent search for the little tallow cylinder which now seemed infinitely more precious to him than all the fabulous wealth of the hoarded ingots of opar  and when at last he found it he clasped it to him and sank back sobbing and exhausted  for many minutes he lay trembling and broken but finally he drew himself to a sitting posture and taking a match from his pocket lighted the stump of the candle which remained to him with the light he found it easier to regain control of his nerves and presently he was again making his way along the tunnel in search of an avenue of escape  the horrid cry that had come down to him from above through the ancient wellshaft still haunted him so that he trembled in terror at even the sounds of his own cautious advance  he had gone forward but a short distance when to his chagrin a wall of masonry barred his farther progress closing the tunnel completely from top to bottom and from side to side  what could it mean  werper was an educated and intelligent man  his military training had taught him to use his mind for the purpose for which it was intended  a blind tunnel such as this was senseless  it must continue beyond the wall someone at some time in the past had had it blocked for an unknown purpose of his own  the man fell to examining the masonry by the light of his candle  to his delight he discovered that the thin blocks of hewn stone of which it was constructed were fitted in loosely without mortar or cement  he tugged upon one of them and to his joy found that it was easily removable  one after another he pulled out the blocks until he had opened an aperture large enough to admit his body then he crawled through into a large low chamber  across this another door barred his way but this too gave before his efforts for it was not barred  a long dark corridor showed before him but before he had followed it far his candle burned down until it scorched his fingers with an oath he dropped it to the floor where it sputtered for a moment and went out  now he was in total darkness and again terror rode heavily astride his neck  what further pitfalls and dangers lay ahead he could not guess but that he was as far as ever from liberty he was quite willing to believe so depressing is utter absence of light to one in unfamiliar surroundings  slowly he groped his way along feeling with his hands upon the tunnels walls and cautiously with his feet ahead of him upon the floor before he could take a single forward step  how long he crept on thus he could not guess but at last feeling that the tunnels length was interminable and exhausted by his efforts by terror and loss of sleep he determined to lie down and rest before proceeding farther  when he awoke there was no change in the surrounding blackness  he might have slept a second or a dayhe could not know but that he had slept for some time was attested by the fact that he felt refreshed and hungry  again he commenced his groping advance but this time he had gone but a short distance when he emerged into a room which was lighted through an opening in the ceiling from which a flight of concrete steps led downward to the floor of the chamber  above him through the aperture werper could see sunlight glancing from massive columns which were twined about by clinging vines  he listened but he heard no sound other than the soughing of the wind through leafy branches the hoarse cries of birds and the chattering of monkeys  boldly he ascended the stairway to find himself in a circular court just before him stood a stone altar stained with rustybrown discolorations  at the time werper gave no thought to an explanation of these stainslater their origin became all too hideously apparent to him  beside the opening in the floor just behind the altar through which he had entered the court from the subterranean chamber below the belgian discovered several doors leading from the enclosure upon the level of the floor  above and circling the courtyard was a series of open balconies  monkeys scampered about the deserted ruins and gaily plumaged birds flitted in and out among the columns and the galleries far above but no sign of human presence was discernible  werper felt relieved  he sighed as though a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders  he took a step toward one of the exits and then he halted wideeyed in astonishment and terror for almost at the same instant a dozen doors opened in the courtyard wall and a horde of frightful men rushed in upon him  they were the priests of the flaming god of oparthe same shaggy knotted hideous little men who had dragged jane clayton to the sacrificial altar at this very spot years before  their long arms their short and crooked legs their closeset evil eyes and their low receding foreheads gave them a bestial appearance that sent a qualm of paralyzing fright through the shaken nerves of the belgian  with a scream he turned to flee back into the lesser terrors of the gloomy corridors and apartments from which he had just emerged but the frightful men anticipated his intentions  they blocked the way they seized him and though he fell groveling upon his knees before them begging for his life they bound him and hurled him to the floor of the inner temple  the rest was but a repetition of what tarzan and jane clayton had passed through  the priestesses came and with them la the high priestess  werper was raised and laid across the altar  cold sweat exuded from his every pore as la raised the cruel sacrificial knife above him  the death chant fell upon his tortured ears  his staring eyes wandered to the golden goblets from which the hideous votaries would soon quench their inhuman thirst in his own warm lifeblood  he wished that he might be granted the brief respite of unconsciousness before the final plunge of the keen bladeand then there was a frightful roar that sounded almost in his ears  the high priestess lowered her dagger  her eyes went wide in horror  the priestesses her votaresses screamed and fled madly toward the exits  the priests roared out their rage and terror according to the temper of their courage  werper strained his neck about to catch a sight of the cause of their panic and when at last he saw it he too went cold in dread for what his eyes beheld was the figure of a huge lion standing in the center of the temple and already a single victim lay mangled beneath his cruel paws  again the lord of the wilderness roared turning his baleful gaze upon the altar  la staggered forward reeled and fell across werper in a swoon     6  the arab raid   after their first terror had subsided subsequent to the shock of the earthquake basuli and his warriors hastened back into the passageway in search of tarzan and two of their own number who were also missing  they found the way blocked by jammed and distorted rock  for two days they labored to tear a way through to their imprisoned friends but when after herculean efforts they had unearthed but a few yards of the choked passage and discovered the mangled remains of one of their fellows they were forced to the conclusion that tarzan and the second waziri also lay dead beneath the rock mass farther in beyond human aid and no longer susceptible of it  again and again as they labored they called aloud the names of their master and their comrade but no answering call rewarded their listening ears  at last they gave up the search  tearfully they cast a last look at the shattered tomb of their master shouldered the heavy burden of gold that would at least furnish comfort if not happiness to their bereaved and beloved mistress and made their mournful way back across the desolate valley of opar and downward through the forests beyond toward the distant bungalow  and as they marched what sorry fate was already drawing down upon that peaceful happy home  from the north came achmet zek riding to the summons of his lieutenants letter  with him came his horde of renegade arabs outlawed marauders these and equally degraded blacks garnered from the more debased and ignorant tribes of savage cannibals through whose countries the raider passed to and fro with perfect impunity  mugambi the ebon hercules who had shared the dangers and vicissitudes of his beloved bwana from jungle island almost to the headwaters of the ugambi was the first to note the bold approach of the sinister caravan  he it was whom tarzan had left in charge of the warriors who remained to guard lady greystoke nor could a braver or more loyal guardian have been found in any clime or upon any soil  a giant in stature a savage fearless warrior the huge black possessed also soul and judgment in proportion to his bulk and his ferocity  not once since his master had departed had he been beyond sight or sound of the bungalow except when lady greystoke chose to canter across the broad plain or relieve the monotony of her loneliness by a brief hunting excursion  on such occasions mugambi mounted upon a wiry arab had ridden close at her horses heels  the raiders were still a long way off when the warriors keen eyes discovered them  for a time he stood scrutinizing the advancing party in silence then he turned and ran rapidly in the direction of the native huts which lay a few hundred yards below the bungalow  here he called out to the lolling warriors  he issued orders rapidly in compliance with them the men seized upon their weapons and their shields  some ran to call in the workers from the fields and to warn the tenders of the flocks and herds  the majority followed mugambi back toward the bungalow  the dust of the raiders was still a long distance away  mugambi could not know positively that it hid an enemy but he had spent a lifetime of savage life in savage africa and he had seen parties before come thus unheralded  sometimes they had come in peace and sometimes they had come in warone could never tell  it was well to be prepared mugambi did not like the haste with which the strangers advanced  the greystoke bungalow was not well adapted for defense  no palisade surrounded it for situated as it was in the heart of loyal waziri its master had anticipated no possibility of an attack in force by any enemy  heavy wooden shutters there were to close the window apertures against hostile arrows and these mugambi was engaged in lowering when lady greystoke appeared upon the veranda  why mugambi she exclaimed  what has happened  why are you lowering the shutters  mugambi pointed out across the plain to where a whiterobed force of mounted men was now distinctly visible  arabs he explained  they come for no good purpose in the absence of the great bwana  beyond the neat lawn and the flowering shrubs jane clayton saw the glistening bodies of her waziri  the sun glanced from the tips of their metalshod spears picked out the gorgeous colors in the feathers of their war bonnets and reflected the highlights from the glossy skins of their broad shoulders and high cheek bones  jane clayton surveyed them with unmixed feelings of pride and affection  what harm could befall her with such as these to protect her  the raiders had halted now a hundred yards out upon the plain mugambi had hastened down to join his warriors  he advanced a few yards before them and raising his voice hailed the strangers  achmet zek sat straight in his saddle before his henchmen  arab cried mugambi  what do you here  we come in peace achmet zek called back  then turn and go in peace replied mugambi  we do not want you here  there can be no peace between arab and waziri  mugambi although not born in waziri had been adopted into the tribe which now contained no member more jealous of its traditions and its prowess than he  achmet zek drew to one side of his horde speaking to his men in a low voice  a moment later without warning a ragged volley was poured into the ranks of the waziri  a couple of warriors fell the others were for charging the attackers but mugambi was a cautious as well as a brave leader  he knew the futility of charging mounted men armed with muskets  he withdrew his force behind the shrubbery of the garden  some he dispatched to various other parts of the grounds surrounding the bungalow  half a dozen he sent to the bungalow itself with instructions to keep their mistress within doors and to protect her with their lives  adopting the tactics of the desert fighters from which he had sprung achmet zek led his followers at a gallop in a long thin line describing a great circle which drew closer and closer in toward the defenders  at that part of the circle closest to the waziri a constant fusillade of shots was poured into the bushes behind which the black warriors had concealed themselves  the latter on their part loosed their slim shafts at the nearest of the enemy  the waziri justly famed for their archery found no cause to blush for their performance that day  time and again some swarthy horseman threw hands above his head and toppled from his saddle pierced by a deadly arrow but the contest was uneven  the arabs outnumbered the waziri their bullets penetrated the shrubbery and found marks that the arab riflemen had not even seen and then achmet zek circled inward a half mile above the bungalow tore down a section of the fence and led his marauders within the grounds  across the fields they charged at a mad run  not again did they pause to lower fences instead they drove their wild mounts straight for them clearing the obstacles as lightly as winged gulls  mugambi saw them coming and calling those of his warriors who remained ran for the bungalow and the last stand  upon the veranda lady greystoke stood rifle in hand  more than a single raider had accounted to her steady nerves and cool aim for his outlawry more than a single pony raced riderless in the wake of the charging horde  mugambi pushed his mistress back into the greater security of the interior and with his depleted force prepared to make a last stand against the foe  on came the arabs shouting and waving their long guns above their heads  past the veranda they raced pouring a deadly fire into the kneeling waziri who discharged their volley of arrows from behind their long oval shieldsshields well adapted perhaps to stop a hostile arrow or deflect a spear but futile quite before the leaden missiles of the riflemen  from beneath the halfraised shutters of the bungalow other bowmen did effective service in greater security and after the first assault mugambi withdrew his entire force within the building  again and again the arabs charged at last forming a stationary circle about the little fortress and outside the effective range of the defenders arrows  from their new position they fired at will at the windows  one by one the waziri fell  fewer and fewer were the arrows that replied to the guns of the raiders and at last achmet zek felt safe in ordering an assault  firing as they ran the bloodthirsty horde raced for the veranda  a dozen of them fell to the arrows of the defenders but the majority reached the door  heavy gun butts fell upon it  the crash of splintered wood mingled with the report of a rifle as jane clayton fired through the panels upon the relentless foe  upon both sides of the door men fell but at last the frail barrier gave to the vicious assaults of the maddened attackers it crumpled inward and a dozen swarthy murderers leaped into the livingroom  at the far end stood jane clayton surrounded by the remnant of her devoted guardians  the floor was covered by the bodies of those who already had given up their lives in her defense  in the forefront of her protectors stood the giant mugambi  the arabs raised their rifles to pour in the last volley that would effectually end all resistance but achmet zek roared out a warning order that stayed their trigger fingers  fire not upon the woman he cried  who harms her dies  take the woman alive  the arabs rushed across the room the waziri met them with their heavy spears  swords flashed longbarreled pistols roared out their sullen death dooms  mugambi launched his spear at the nearest of the enemy with a force that drove the heavy shaft completely through the arabs body then he seized a pistol from another and grasping it by the barrel brained all who forced their way too near his mistress  emulating his example the few warriors who remained to him fought like demons but one by one they fell until only mugambi remained to defend the life and honor of the apemans mate  from across the room achmet zek watched the unequal struggle and urged on his minions  in his hands was a jeweled musket  slowly he raised it to his shoulder waiting until another move should place mugambi at his mercy without endangering the lives of the woman or any of his own followers  at last the moment came and achmet zek pulled the trigger  without a sound the brave mugambi sank to the floor at the feet of jane clayton  an instant later she was surrounded and disarmed  without a word they dragged her from the bungalow  a giant negro lifted her to the pommel of his saddle and while the raiders searched the bungalow and outhouses for plunder he rode with her beyond the gates and waited the coming of his master  jane clayton saw the raiders lead the horses from the corral and drive the herds in from the fields  she saw her home plundered of all that represented intrinsic worth in the eyes of the arabs and then she saw the torch applied and the flames lick up what remained  and at last when the raiders assembled after glutting their fury and their avarice and rode away with her toward the north she saw the smoke and the flames rising far into the heavens until the winding of the trail into the thick forests hid the sad view from her eyes  as the flames ate their way into the livingroom reaching out forked tongues to lick up the bodies of the dead one of that gruesome company whose bloody welterings had long since been stilled moved again  it was a huge black who rolled over upon his side and opened bloodshot suffering eyes  mugambi whom the arabs had left for dead still lived  the hot flames were almost upon him as he raised himself painfully upon his hands and knees and crawled slowly toward the doorway  again and again he sank weakly to the floor but each time he rose again and continued his pitiful way toward safety  after what seemed to him an interminable time during which the flames had become a veritable fiery furnace at the far side of the room the great black managed to reach the veranda roll down the steps and crawl off into the cool safety of some nearby shrubbery  all night he lay there alternately unconscious and painfully sentient and in the latter state watching with savage hatred the lurid flames which still rose from burning crib and hay cock  a prowling lion roared close at hand but the giant black was unafraid  there was place for but a single thought in his savage mindrevenge  revenge revenge     7  the jewelroom of opar   for some time tarzan lay where he had fallen upon the floor of the treasure chamber beneath the ruined walls of opar  he lay as one dead but he was not dead  at length he stirred  his eyes opened upon the utter darkness of the room  he raised his hand to his head and brought it away sticky with clotted blood  he sniffed at his fingers as a wild beast might sniff at the lifeblood upon a wounded paw  slowly he rose to a sitting posturelistening  no sound reached to the buried depths of his sepulcher  he staggered to his feet and groped his way about among the tiers of ingots  what was he  where was he  his head ached but otherwise he felt no ill effects from the blow that had felled him  the accident he did not recall nor did he recall aught of what had led up to it  he let his hands grope unfamiliarly over his limbs his torso and his head  he felt of the quiver at his back the knife in his loin cloth something struggled for recognition within his brain  ah  he had it there was something missing  he crawled about upon the floor feeling with his hands for the thing that instinct warned him was gone  at last he found itthe heavy war spear that in past years had formed so important a feature of his daily life almost of his very existence so inseparably had it been connected with his every action since the longgone day that he had wrested his first spear from the body of a black victim of his savage training  tarzan was sure that there was another and more lovely world than that which was confined to the darkness of the four stone walls surrounding him  he continued his search and at last found the doorway leading inward beneath the city and the temple  this he followed most incautiously  he came to the stone steps leading upward to the higher level  he ascended them and continued onward toward the well  nothing spurred his hurt memory to a recollection of past familiarity with his surroundings  he blundered on through the darkness as though he were traversing an open plain under the brilliance of a noonday sun and suddenly there happened that which had to happen under the circumstances of his rash advance  he reached the brink of the well stepped outward into space lunged forward and shot downward into the inky depths below  still clutching his spear he struck the water and sank beneath its surface plumbing the depths  the fall had not injured him and when he rose to the surface he shook the water from his eyes and found that he could see  daylight was filtering into the well from the orifice far above his head  it illumined the inner walls faintly  tarzan gazed about him  on the level with the surface of the water he saw a large opening in the dark and slimy wall  he swam to it and drew himself out upon the wet floor of a tunnel  along this he passed but now he went warily for tarzan of the apes was learning  the unexpected pit had taught him care in the traversing of dark passagewayshe needed no second lesson  for a long distance the passage went straight as an arrow  the floor was slippery as though at times the rising waters of the well overflowed and flooded it  this in itself retarded tarzans pace for it was with difficulty that he kept his footing  the foot of a stairway ended the passage  up this he made his way  it turned back and forth many times leading at last into a small circular chamber the gloom of which was relieved by a faint light which found ingress through a tubular shaft several feet in diameter which rose from the center of the rooms ceiling upward to a distance of a hundred feet or more where it terminated in a stone grating through which tarzan could see a blue and sunlit sky  curiosity prompted the apeman to investigate his surroundings several metalbound copperstudded chests constituted the sole furniture of the round room  tarzan let his hands run over these  he felt of the copper studs he pulled upon the hinges and at last by chance he raised the cover of one  an exclamation of delight broke from his lips at sight of the pretty contents  gleaming and glistening in the subdued light of the chamber lay a great tray full of brilliant stones  tarzan reverted to the primitive by his accident had no conception of the fabulous value of his find  to him they were but pretty pebbles  he plunged his hands into them and let the priceless gems filter through his fingers  he went to others of the chests only to find still further stores of precious stones  nearly all were cut and from these he gathered a handful and filled the pouch which dangled at his sidethe uncut stones he tossed back into the chests  unwittingly the apeman had stumbled upon the forgotten jewelroom of opar  for ages it had lain buried beneath the temple of the flaming god midway of one of the many inky passages which the superstitious descendants of the ancient sun worshipers had either dared not or cared not to explore  tiring at last of this diversion tarzan took up his way along the corridor which led upward from the jewelroom by a steep incline winding and twisting but always tending upward the tunnel led him nearer and nearer to the surface ending finally in a lowceiled room lighter than any that he had as yet discovered  above him an opening in the ceiling at the upper end of a flight of concrete steps revealed a brilliant sunlit scene  tarzan viewed the vinecovered columns in mild wonderment  he puckered his brows in an attempt to recall some recollection of similar things  he was not sure of himself  there was a tantalizing suggestion always present in his mind that something was eluding himthat he should know many things which he did not know  his earnest cogitation was rudely interrupted by a thunderous roar from the opening above him  following the roar came the cries and screams of men and women  tarzan grasped his spear more firmly and ascended the steps  a strange sight met his eyes as he emerged from the semidarkness of the cellar to the brilliant light of the temple  the creatures he saw before him he recognized for what they weremen and women and a huge lion  the men and women were scuttling for the safety of the exits  the lion stood upon the body of one who had been less fortunate than the others  he was in the center of the temple directly before tarzan a woman stood beside a block of stone  upon the top of the stone lay stretched a man and as the apeman watched the scene he saw the lion glare terribly at the two who remained within the temple  another thunderous roar broke from the savage throat the woman screamed and swooned across the body of the man stretched prostrate upon the stone altar before her  the lion advanced a few steps and crouched  the tip of his sinuous tail twitched nervously  he was upon the point of charging when his eyes were attracted toward the apeman  werper helpless upon the altar saw the great carnivore preparing to leap upon him  he saw the sudden change in the beasts expression as his eyes wandered to something beyond the altar and out of the belgians view  he saw the formidable creature rise to a standing position  a figure darted past werper  he saw a mighty arm upraised and a stout spear shoot forward toward the lion to bury itself in the broad chest  he saw the lion snapping and tearing at the weapons shaft and he saw wonder of wonders the naked giant who had hurled the missile charging upon the great beast only a long knife ready to meet those ferocious fangs and talons  the lion reared up to meet this new enemy  the beast was growling frightfully and then upon the startled ears of the belgian broke a similar savage growl from the lips of the man rushing upon the beast  by a quick side step tarzan eluded the first swinging clutch of the lions paws  darting to the beasts side he leaped upon the tawny back  his arms encircled the maned neck his teeth sank deep into the brutes flesh  roaring leaping rolling and struggling the giant cat attempted to dislodge this savage enemy and all the while one great brown fist was driving a long keen blade repeatedly into the beasts side  during the battle la regained consciousness  spellbound she stood above her victim watching the spectacle it seemed incredible that a human being could best the king of beasts in personal encounter and yet before her very eyes there was taking place just such an improbability  at last tarzans knife found the great heart and with a final spasmodic struggle the lion rolled over upon the marble floor dead leaping to his feet the conqueror placed a foot upon the carcass of his kill raised his face toward the heavens and gave voice to so hideous a cry that both la and werper trembled as it reverberated through the temple  then the apeman turned and werper recognized him as the man he had left for dead in the treasure room     8  the escape from opar   werper was astounded  could this creature be the same dignified englishman who had entertained him so graciously in his luxurious african home  could this wild beast with blazing eyes and bloody countenance be at the same time a man  could the horrid victory cry he had but just heard have been formed in human throat  tarzan was eyeing the man and the woman a puzzled expression in his eyes but there was no faintest tinge of recognition  it was as though he had discovered some new species of living creature and was marveling at his find  la was studying the apemans features  slowly her large eyes opened very wide  tarzan she exclaimed and then in the vernacular of the great apes which constant association with the anthropoids had rendered the common language of the oparians you have come back to me  la has ignored the mandates of her religion waiting always waiting for tarzanfor her tarzan  she has taken no mate for in all the world there was but one with whom la would mate  and now you have come back  tell me o tarzan that it is for me you have returned  werper listened to the unintelligible jargon  he looked from la to tarzan  would the latter understand this strange tongue  to the belgians surprise the englishman answered in a language evidently identical to hers  tarzan he repeated musingly  tarzan  the name sounds familiar  it is your nameyou are tarzan cried la  i am tarzan the apeman shrugged  well it is a good namei know no other so i will keep it but i do not know you  i did not come hither for you  why i came i do not know at all neither do i know from whence i came  can you tell me  la shook her head  i never knew she replied  tarzan turned toward werper and put the same question to him but in the language of the great apes  the belgian shook his head  i do not understand that language he said in french  without effort and apparently without realizing that he made the change tarzan repeated his question in french  werper suddenly came to a full realization of the magnitude of the injury of which tarzan was a victim  the man had lost his memoryno longer could he recollect past events  the belgian was upon the point of enlightening him when it suddenly occurred to him that by keeping tarzan in ignorance for a time at least of his true identity it might be possible to turn the apemans misfortune to his own advantage  i cannot tell you from whence you came he said but this i can tell youif we do not get out of this horrible place we shall both be slain upon this bloody altar  the woman was about to plunge her knife into my heart when the lion interrupted the fiendish ritual  come  before they recover from their fright and reassemble let us find a way out of their damnable temple  tarzan turned again toward la  why he asked would you have killed this man  are you hungry  the high priestess cried out in disgust  did he attempt to kill you continued tarzan  the woman shook her head  then why should you have wished to kill him tarzan was determined to get to the bottom of the thing  la raised her slender arm and pointed toward the sun  we were offering up his soul as a gift to the flaming god she said  tarzan looked puzzled  he was again an ape and apes do not understand such matters as souls and flaming gods  do you wish to die he asked werper  the belgian assured him with tears in his eyes that he did not wish to die  very well then you shall not said tarzan  come  we will go this she would kill you and keep me for herself  it is no place anyway for a mangani  i should soon die shut up behind these stone walls  he turned toward la  we are going now he said  the woman rushed forward and seized the apemans hands in hers  do not leave me she cried  stay and you shall be high priest  la loves you  all opar shall be yours  slaves shall wait upon you stay tarzan of the apes and let love reward you  the apeman pushed the kneeling woman aside  tarzan does not desire you he said simply and stepping to werpers side he cut the belgians bonds and motioned him to follow  pantingher face convulsed with rage la sprang to her feet  stay you shall she screamed  la will have youif she cannot have you alive she will have you dead and raising her face to the sun she gave voice to the same hideous shriek that werper had heard once before and tarzan many times  in answer to her cry a babel of voices broke from the surrounding chambers and corridors  come guardian priests she cried  the infidels have profaned the holiest of the holies  come  strike terror to their hearts defend la and her altar wash clean the temple with the blood of the polluters  tarzan understood though werper did not  the former glanced at the belgian and saw that he was unarmed  stepping quickly to las side the apeman seized her in his strong arms and though she fought with all the mad savagery of a demon he soon disarmed her handing her long sacrificial knife to werper  you will need this he said and then from each doorway a horde of the monstrous little men of opar streamed into the temple  they were armed with bludgeons and knives and fortified in their courage by fanatical hate and frenzy  werper was terrified  tarzan stood eyeing the foe in proud disdain slowly he advanced toward the exit he had chosen to utilize in making his way from the temple  a burly priest barred his way  behind the first was a score of others tarzan swung his heavy spear clublike down upon the skull of the priest  the fellow collapsed his head crushed  again and again the weapon fell as tarzan made his way slowly toward the doorway  werper pressed close behind casting backward glances toward the shrieking dancing mob menacing their rear  he held the sacrificial knife ready to strike whoever might come within its reach but none came  for a time he wondered that they should so bravely battle with the giant apeman yet hesitate to rush upon him who was relatively so weak  had they done so he knew that he must have fallen at the first charge  tarzan had reached the doorway over the corpses of all that had stood to dispute his way before werper guessed at the reason for his immunity  the priests feared the sacrificial knife willingly would they face death and welcome it if it came while they defended their high priestess and her altar but evidently there were deaths and deaths  some strange superstition must surround that polished blade that no oparian cared to chance a death thrust from it yet gladly rushed to the slaughter of the apemans flaying spear  once outside the temple court werper communicated his discovery to tarzan  the apeman grinned and let werper go before him brandishing the jeweled and holy weapon  like leaves before a gale the oparians scattered in all directions and tarzan and the belgian found a clear passage through the corridors and chambers of the ancient temple  the belgians eyes went wide as they passed through the room of the seven pillars of solid gold  with illconcealed avarice he looked upon the ageold golden tablets set in the walls of nearly every room and down the sides of many of the corridors  to the apeman all this wealth appeared to mean nothing  on the two went chance leading them toward the broad avenue which lay between the stately piles of the halfruined edifices and the inner wall of the city  great apes jabbered at them and menaced them but tarzan answered them after their own kind giving back taunt for taunt insult for insult challenge for challenge  werper saw a hairy bull swing down from a broken column and advance stifflegged and bristling toward the naked giant  the yellow fangs were bared angry snarls and barkings rumbled threateningly through the thick and hanging lips  the belgian watched his companion  to his horror he saw the man stoop until his closed knuckles rested upon the ground as did those of the anthropoid  he saw him circle stifflegged about the circling ape he heard the same bestial barkings and growlings issue from the human throat that were coming from the mouth of the brute  had his eyes been closed he could not have known but that two giant apes were bridling for combat  but there was no battle  it ended as the majority of such jungle encounters endone of the boasters loses his nerve and becomes suddenly interested in a blowing leaf a beetle or the lice upon his hairy stomach  in this instance it was the anthropoid that retired in stiff dignity to inspect an unhappy caterpillar which he presently devoured  for a moment tarzan seemed inclined to pursue the argument  he swaggered truculently stuck out his chest roared and advanced closer to the bull  it was with difficulty that werper finally persuaded him to leave well enough alone and continue his way from the ancient city of the sun worshipers  the two searched for nearly an hour before they found the narrow exit through the inner wall  from there the wellworn trail led them beyond the outer fortification to the desolate valley of opar  tarzan had no idea in so far as werper could discover as to where he was or whence he came  he wandered aimlessly about searching for food which he discovered beneath small rocks or hiding in the shade of the scant brush which dotted the ground  the belgian was horrified by the hideous menu of his companion beetles rodents and caterpillars were devoured with seeming relish tarzan was indeed an ape again  at last werper succeeded in leading his companion toward the distant hills which mark the northwestern boundary of the valley and together the two set out in the direction of the greystoke bungalow  what purpose prompted the belgian in leading the victim of his treachery and greed back toward his former home it is difficult to guess unless it was that without tarzan there could be no ransom for tarzans wife  that night they camped in the valley beyond the hills and as they sat before a little fire where cooked a wild pig that had fallen to one of tarzans arrows the latter sat lost in speculation  he seemed continually to be trying to grasp some mental image which as constantly eluded him  at last he opened the leathern pouch which hung at his side  from it he poured into the palm of his hand a quantity of glittering gems  the firelight playing upon them conjured a multitude of scintillating rays and as the wide eyes of the belgian looked on in rapt fascination the mans expression at last acknowledged a tangible purpose in courting the society of the apeman     9  the theft of the jewels   for two days werper sought for the party that had accompanied him from the camp to the barrier cliffs but not until late in the afternoon of the second day did he find clew to its whereabouts and then in such gruesome form that he was totally unnerved by the sight  in an open glade he came upon the bodies of three of the blacks terribly mutilated nor did it require considerable deductive power to explain their murder  of the little party only these three had not been slaves  the others evidently tempted to hope for freedom from their cruel arab master had taken advantage of their separation from the main camp to slay the three representatives of the hated power which held them in slavery and vanish into the jungle  cold sweat exuded from werpers forehead as he contemplated the fate which chance had permitted him to escape for had he been present when the conspiracy bore fruit he too must have been of the garnered  tarzan showed not the slightest surprise or interest in the discovery inherent in him was a calloused familiarity with violent death  the refinements of his recent civilization expunged by the force of the sad calamity which had befallen him left only the primitive sensibilities which his childhoods training had imprinted indelibly upon the fabric of his mind  the training of kala the examples and precepts of kerchak of tublat and of terkoz now formed the basis of his every thought and action  he retained a mechanical knowledge of french and english speech  werper had spoken to him in french and tarzan had replied in the same tongue without conscious realization that he had departed from the anthropoidal speech in which he had addressed la  had werper used english the result would have been the same  again that night as the two sat before their camp fire tarzan played with his shining baubles  werper asked him what they were and where he had found them  the apeman replied that they were gaycolored stones with which he purposed fashioning a necklace and that he had found them far beneath the sacrificial court of the temple of the flaming god  werper was relieved to find that tarzan had no conception of the value of the gems  this would make it easier for the belgian to obtain possession of them  possibly the man would give them to him for the asking  werper reached out his hand toward the little pile that tarzan had arranged upon a piece of flat wood before him  let me see them said the belgian  tarzan placed a large palm over his treasure  he bared his fighting fangs and growled  werper withdrew his hand more quickly than he had advanced it  tarzan resumed his playing with the gems and his conversation with werper as though nothing unusual had occurred  he had but exhibited the beasts jealous protective instinct for a possession  when he killed he shared the meat with werper but had werper ever by accident laid a hand upon tarzans share he would have aroused the same savage and resentful warning  from that occurrence dated the beginning of a great fear in the breast of the belgian for his savage companion  he had never understood the transformation that had been wrought in tarzan by the blow upon his head other than to attribute it to a form of amnesia  that tarzan had once been in truth a savage jungle beast werper had not known and so of course he could not guess that the man had reverted to the state in which his childhood and young manhood had been spent  now werper saw in the englishman a dangerous maniac whom the slightest untoward accident might turn upon him with rending fangs  not for a moment did werper attempt to delude himself into the belief that he could defend himself successfully against an attack by the apeman his one hope lay in eluding him and making for the far distant camp of achmet zek as rapidly as he could but armed only with the sacrificial knife werper shrank from attempting the journey through the jungle tarzan constituted a protection that was by no means despicable even in the face of the larger carnivora as werper had reason to acknowledge from the evidence he had witnessed in the oparian temple  too werper had his covetous soul set upon the pouch of gems and so he was torn between the various emotions of avarice and fear  but avarice it was that burned most strongly in his breast to the end that he dared the dangers and suffered the terrors of constant association with him he thought a mad man rather than give up the hope of obtaining possession of the fortune which the contents of the little pouch represented  achmet zek should know nothing of thesethese would be for werper alone and so soon as he could encompass his design he would reach the coast and take passage for america where he could conceal himself beneath the veil of a new identity and enjoy to some measure the fruits of his theft  he had it all planned out did lieutenant albert werper living in anticipation the luxurious life of the idle rich  he even found himself regretting that america was so provincial and that nowhere in the new world was a city that might compare with his beloved brussels  it was upon the third day of their progress from opar that the keen ears of tarzan caught the sound of men behind them  werper heard nothing above the humming of the jungle insects and the chattering life of the lesser monkeys and the birds  for a time tarzan stood in statuesque silence listening his sensitive nostrils dilating as he assayed each passing breeze  then he withdrew werper into the concealment of thick brush and waited  presently along the game trail that werper and tarzan had been following there came in sight a sleek black warrior alert and watchful  in single file behind him there followed one after another near fifty others each burdened with two dullyellow ingots lashed upon his back  werper recognized the party immediately as that which had accompanied tarzan on his journey to opar  he glanced at the apeman but in the savage watchful eyes he saw no recognition of basuli and those other loyal waziri  when all had passed tarzan rose and emerged from concealment  he looked down the trail in the direction the party had gone  then he turned to werper  we will follow and slay them he said  why asked the belgian  they are black explained tarzan  it was a black who killed kala they are the enemies of the manganis  werper did not relish the idea of engaging in a battle with basuli and his fierce fighting men  and again he had welcomed the sight of them returning toward the greystoke bungalow for he had begun to have doubts as to his ability to retrace his steps to the waziri country tarzan he knew had not the remotest idea of whither they were going by keeping at a safe distance behind the laden warriors they would have no difficulty in following them home  once at the bungalow werper knew the way to the camp of achmet zek  there was still another reason why he did not wish to interfere with the wazirithey were bearing the great burden of treasure in the direction he wished it borne  the farther they took it the less the distance that he and achmet zek would have to transport it  he argued with the apeman therefore against the latters desire to exterminate the blacks and at last he prevailed upon tarzan to follow them in peace saying that he was sure they would lead them out of the forest into a rich country teeming with game  it was many marches from opar to the waziri country but at last came the hour when tarzan and the belgian following the trail of the warriors topped the last rise and saw before them the broad waziri plain the winding river and the distant forests to the north and west  a mile or more ahead of them the line of warriors was creeping like a giant caterpillar through the tall grasses of the plain  beyond grazing herds of zebra hartebeest and topi dotted the level landscape while closer to the river a bull buffalo his head and shoulders protruding from the reeds watched the advancing blacks for a moment only to turn at last and disappear into the safety of his dank and gloomy retreat  tarzan looked out across the familiar vista with no faintest gleam of recognition in his eyes  he saw the game animals and his mouth watered but he did not look in the direction of his bungalow  werper however did  a puzzled expression entered the belgians eyes  he shaded them with his palms and gazed long and earnestly toward the spot where the bungalow had stood  he could not credit the testimony of his eyesthere was no bungalowno barnsno outhouses  the corrals the hay stacksall were gone  what could it mean  and then slowly there filtered into werpers consciousness an explanation of the havoc that had been wrought in that peaceful valley since last his eyes had rested upon itachmet zek had been there  basuli and his warriors had noted the devastation the moment they had come in sight of the farm  now they hastened on toward it talking excitedly among themselves in animated speculation upon the cause and meaning of the catastrophe  when at last they crossed the trampled garden and stood before the charred ruins of their masters bungalow their greatest fears became convictions in the light of the evidence about them  remnants of human dead half devoured by prowling hyenas and others of the carnivora which infested the region lay rotting upon the ground and among the corpses remained sufficient remnants of their clothing and ornaments to make clear to basuli the frightful story of the disaster that had befallen his masters house  the arabs he said as his men clustered about him  the waziri gazed about in mute rage for several minutes  everywhere they encountered only further evidence of the ruthlessness of the cruel enemy that had come during the great bwanas absence and laid waste his property  what did they with lady asked one of the blacks  they had always called lady greystoke thus  the women they would have taken with them said basuli  our women and his  a giant black raised his spear above his head and gave voice to a savage cry of rage and hate  the others followed his example  basuli silenced them with a gesture  this is no time for useless noises of the mouth he said  the great bwana has taught us that it is acts by which things are done not words  let us save our breathwe shall need it all to follow up the arabs and slay them  if lady and our women live the greater the need of haste and warriors cannot travel fast upon empty lungs  from the shelter of the reeds along the river werper and tarzan watched the blacks  they saw them dig a trench with their knives and fingers  they saw them lay their yellow burdens in it and scoop the overturned earth back over the tops of the ingots  tarzan seemed little interested after werper had assured him that that which they buried was not good to eat but werper was intensely interested  he would have given much had he had his own followers with him that he might take away the treasure as soon as the blacks left for he was sure that they would leave this scene of desolation and death as soon as possible  the treasure buried the blacks removed themselves a short distance up wind from the fetid corpses where they made camp that they might rest before setting out in pursuit of the arabs  it was already dusk werper and tarzan sat devouring some pieces of meat they had brought from their last camp  the belgian was occupied with his plans for the immediate future  he was positive that the waziri would pursue achmet zek for he knew enough of savage warfare and of the characteristics of the arabs and their degraded followers to guess that they had carried the waziri women off into slavery  this alone would assure immediate pursuit by so warlike a people as the waziri  werper felt that he should find the means and the opportunity to push on ahead that he might warn achmet zek of the coming of basuli and also of the location of the buried treasure  what the arab would now do with lady greystoke in view of the mental affliction of her husband werper neither knew nor cared  it was enough that the golden treasure buried upon the site of the burned bungalow was infinitely more valuable than any ransom that would have occurred even to the avaricious mind of the arab and if werper could persuade the raider to share even a portion of it with him he would be well satisfied  but by far the most important consideration to werper at least was the incalculably valuable treasure in the little leathern pouch at tarzans side  if he could but obtain possession of this  he must he would  his eyes wandered to the object of his greed  they measured tarzans giant frame and rested upon the rounded muscles of his arms  it was hopeless  what could he werper hope to accomplish other than his own death by an attempt to wrest the gems from their savage owner  disconsolate werper threw himself upon his side  his head was pillowed on one arm the other rested across his face in such a way that his eyes were hidden from the apeman though one of them was fastened upon him from beneath the shadow of the belgians forearm for a time he lay thus glowering at tarzan and originating schemes for plundering him of his treasureschemes that were discarded as futile as rapidly as they were born  tarzan presently let his own eyes rest upon werper  the belgian saw that he was being watched and lay very still  after a few moments he simulated the regular breathing of deep slumber  tarzan had been thinking  he had seen the waziri bury their belongings  werper had told him that they were hiding them lest some one find them and take them away  this seemed to tarzan a splendid plan for safeguarding valuables  since werper had evinced a desire to possess his glittering pebbles tarzan with the suspicions of a savage had guarded the baubles of whose worth he was entirely ignorant as zealously as though they spelled life or death to him  for a long time the apeman sat watching his companion  at last convinced that he slept tarzan withdrew his hunting knife and commenced to dig a hole in the ground before him  with the blade he loosened up the earth and with his hands he scooped it out until he had excavated a little cavity a few inches in diameter and five or six inches in depth  into this he placed the pouch of jewels  werper almost forgot to breathe after the fashion of a sleeper as he saw what the apeman was doinghe scarce repressed an ejaculation of satisfaction  tarzan become suddenly rigid as his keen ears noted the cessation of the regular inspirations and expirations of his companion  his narrowed eyes bored straight down upon the belgian  werper felt that he was losthe must risk all on his ability to carry on the deception he sighed threw both arms outward and turned over on his back mumbling as though in the throes of a bad dream  a moment later he resumed the regular breathing  now he could not watch tarzan but he was sure that the man sat for a long time looking at him  then faintly werper heard the others hands scraping dirt and later patting it down  he knew then that the jewels were buried  it was an hour before werper moved again then he rolled over facing tarzan and opened his eyes  the apeman slept  by reaching out his hand werper could touch the spot where the pouch was buried  for a long time he lay watching and listening  he moved about making more noise than necessary yet tarzan did not awaken  he drew the sacrificial knife from his belt and plunged it into the ground tarzan did not move  cautiously the belgian pushed the blade downward through the loose earth above the pouch  he felt the point touch the soft tough fabric of the leather  then he pried down upon the handle slowly the little mound of loose earth rose and parted  an instant later a corner of the pouch came into view  werper pulled it from its hiding place and tucked it in his shirt  then he refilled the hole and pressed the dirt carefully down as it had been before  greed had prompted him to an act the discovery of which by his companion could lead only to the most frightful consequences for werper  already he could almost feel those strong white fangs burying themselves in his neck  he shuddered  far out across the plain a leopard screamed and in the dense reeds behind him some great beast moved on padded feet  werper feared these prowlers of the night but infinitely more he feared the just wrath of the human beast sleeping at his side  with utmost caution the belgian arose  tarzan did not move  werper took a few steps toward the plain and the distant forest to the northwest then he paused and fingered the hilt of the long knife in his belt  he turned and looked down upon the sleeper  why not he mused  then i should be safe  he returned and bent above the apeman  clutched tightly in his hand was the sacrificial knife of the high priestess of the flaming god     10  achmet zek sees the jewels   mugambi weak and suffering had dragged his painful way along the trail of the retreating raiders  he could move but slowly resting often but savage hatred and an equally savage desire for vengeance kept him to his task  as the days passed his wounds healed and his strength returned until at last his giant frame had regained all of its former mighty powers  now he went more rapidly but the mounted arabs had covered a great distance while the wounded black had been painfully crawling after them  they had reached their fortified camp and there achmet zek awaited the return of his lieutenant albert werper  during the long rough journey jane clayton had suffered more in anticipation of her impending fate than from the hardships of the road  achmet zek had not deigned to acquaint her with his intentions regarding her future  she prayed that she had been captured in the hope of ransom for if such should prove the case no great harm would befall her at the hands of the arabs but there was the chance the horrid chance that another fate awaited her  she had heard of many women among whom were white women who had been sold by outlaws such as achmet zek into the slavery of black harems or taken farther north into the almost equally hideous existence of some turkish seraglio  jane clayton was of sterner stuff than that which bends in spineless terror before danger  until hope proved futile she would not give it up nor did she entertain thoughts of selfdestruction only as a final escape from dishonor  so long as tarzan lived there was every reason to expect succor  no man nor beast who roamed the savage continent could boast the cunning and the powers of her lord and master  to her he was little short of omnipotent in his native worldthis world of savage beasts and savage men  tarzan would come and she would be rescued and avenged of that she was certain  she counted the days that must elapse before he would return from opar and discover what had transpired during his absence  after that it would be but a short time before he had surrounded the arab stronghold and punished the motley crew of wrongdoers who inhabited it  that he could find her she had no slightest doubt  no spoor however faint could elude the keen vigilance of his senses  to him the trail of the raiders would be as plain as the printed page of an open book to her  and while she hoped there came through the dark jungle another terrified by night and by day came albert werper  a dozen times he had escaped the claws and fangs of the giant carnivora only by what seemed a miracle to him  armed with nothing more than the knife he had brought with him from opar he had made his way through as savage a country as yet exists upon the face of the globe  by night he had slept in trees  by day he had stumbled fearfully on often taking refuge among the branches when sight or sound of some great cat warned him from danger  but at last he had come within sight of the palisade behind which were his fierce companions  at almost the same time mugambi came out of the jungle before the walled village  as he stood in the shadow of a great tree reconnoitering he saw a man ragged and disheveled emerge from the jungle almost at his elbow  instantly he recognized the newcomer as he who had been a guest of his master before the latter had departed for opar  the black was upon the point of hailing the belgian when something stayed him  he saw the white man walking confidently across the clearing toward the village gate  no sane man thus approached a village in this part of africa unless he was sure of a friendly welcome  mugambi waited  his suspicions were aroused  he heard werper halloo he saw the gates swing open and he witnessed the surprised and friendly welcome that was accorded the erstwhile guest of lord and lady greystoke  a light broke upon the understanding of mugambi  this white man had been a traitor and a spy  it was to him they owed the raid during the absence of the great bwana  to his hate for the arabs mugambi added a still greater hate for the white spy  within the village werper passed hurriedly toward the silken tent of achmet zek  the arab arose as his lieutenant entered  his face showed surprise as he viewed the tattered apparel of the belgian  what has happened he asked  werper narrated all save the little matter of the pouch of gems which were now tightly strapped about his waist beneath his clothing  the arabs eyes narrowed greedily as his henchman described the treasure that the waziri had buried beside the ruins of the greystoke bungalow  it will be a simple matter now to return and get it said achmet zek first we will await the coming of the rash waziri and after we have slain them we may take our time to the treasurenone will disturb it where it lies for we shall leave none alive who knows of its existence  and the woman asked werper  i shall sell her in the north replied the raider  it is the only way now  she should bring a good price  the belgian nodded  he was thinking rapidly  if he could persuade achmet zek to send him in command of the party which took lady greystoke north it would give him the opportunity he craved to make his escape from his chief  he would forego a share of the gold if he could but get away unscathed with the jewels  he knew achmet zek well enough by this time to know that no member of his band ever was voluntarily released from the service of achmet zek most of the few who deserted were recaptured  more than once had werper listened to their agonized screams as they were tortured before being put to death  the belgian had no wish to take the slightest chance of recapture  who will go north with the woman he asked while we are returning for the gold that the waziri buried by the bungalow of the englishman  achmet zek thought for a moment  the buried gold was of much greater value than the price the woman would bring  it was necessary to rid himself of her as quickly as possible and it was also well to obtain the gold with the least possible delay  of all his followers the belgian was the most logical lieutenant to intrust with the command of one of the parties  an arab as familiar with the trails and tribes as achmet zek himself might collect the womans price and make good his escape into the far north  werper on the other hand could scarce make his escape alone through a country hostile to europeans while the men he would send with the belgian could be carefully selected with a view to preventing werper from persuading any considerable portion of his command to accompany him should he contemplate desertion of his chief  at last the arab spoke it is not necessary that we both return for the gold  you shall go north with the woman carrying a letter to a friend of mine who is always in touch with the best markets for such merchandise while i return for the gold  we can meet again here when our business is concluded  werper could scarce disguise the joy with which he received this welcome decision  and that he did entirely disguise it from the keen and suspicious eyes of achmet zek is open to question  however the decision reached the arab and his lieutenant discussed the details of their forthcoming ventures for a short time further when werper made his excuses and returned to his own tent for the comforts and luxury of a longdesired bath and shave  having bathed the belgian tied a small hand mirror to a cord sewn to the rear wall of his tent placed a rude chair beside an equally rude table that stood beside the glass and proceeded to remove the rough stubble from his face  in the catalog of masculine pleasures there is scarce one which imparts a feeling of greater comfort and refreshment than follows a clean shave and now with weariness temporarily banished albert werper sprawled in his rickety chair to enjoy a final cigaret before retiring his thumbs tucked in his belt in lazy support of the weight of his arms touched the belt which held the jewel pouch about his waist  he tingled with excitement as he let his mind dwell upon the value of the treasure which unknown to all save himself lay hidden beneath his clothing  what would achmet zek say if he knew  werper grinned  how the old rascals eyes would pop could he but have a glimpse of those scintillating beauties  werper had never yet had an opportunity to feast his eyes for any great length of time upon them  he had not even counted themonly roughly had he guessed at their value  he unfastened the belt and drew the pouch from its hiding place  he was alone  the balance of the camp save the sentries had retirednone would enter the belgians tent  he fingered the pouch feeling out the shapes and sizes of the precious little nodules within  he hefted the bag first in one palm then in the other and at last he wheeled his chair slowly around before the table and in the rays of his small lamp let the glittering gems roll out upon the rough wood  the refulgent rays transformed the interior of the soiled and squalid canvas to the splendor of a palace in the eyes of the dreaming man  he saw the gilded halls of pleasure that would open their portals to the possessor of the wealth which lay scattered upon this stained and dented table top  he dreamed of joys and luxuries and power which always had been beyond his grasp and as he dreamed his gaze lifted from the table as the gaze of a dreamer will to a far distant goal above the mean horizon of terrestrial commonplaceness  unseeing his eyes rested upon the shaving mirror which still hung upon the tent wall above the table but his sight was focused far beyond and then a reflection moved within the polished surface of the tiny glass the mans eyes shot back out of space to the mirrors face and in it he saw reflected the grim visage of achmet zek framed in the flaps of the tent doorway behind him  werper stifled a gasp of dismay  with rare selfpossession he let his gaze drop without appearing to have halted upon the mirror until it rested again upon the gems  without haste he replaced them in the pouch tucked the latter into his shirt selected a cigaret from his case lighted it and rose  yawning and stretching his arms above his head he turned slowly toward the opposite end of the tent  the face of achmet zek had disappeared from the opening  to say that albert werper was terrified would be putting it mildly  he realized that he not only had sacrificed his treasure but his life as well  achmet zek would never permit the wealth that he had discovered to slip through his fingers nor would he forgive the duplicity of a lieutenant who had gained possession of such a treasure without offering to share it with his chief  slowly the belgian prepared for bed  if he were being watched he could not know but if so the watcher saw no indication of the nervous excitement which the european strove to conceal  when ready for his blankets the man crossed to the little table and extinguished the light  it was two hours later that the flaps at the front of the tent separated silently and gave entrance to a darkrobed figure which passed noiselessly from the darkness without to the darkness within cautiously the prowler crossed the interior  in one hand was a long knife  he came at last to the pile of blankets spread upon several rugs close to one of the tent walls  lightly his fingers sought and found the bulk beneath the blanketsthe bulk that should be albert werper  they traced out the figure of a man and then an arm shot upward poised for an instant and descended  again and again it rose and fell and each time the long blade of the knife buried itself in the thing beneath the blankets but there was an initial lifelessness in the silent bulk that gave the assassin momentary wonder  feverishly he threw back the coverlets and searched with nervous hands for the pouch of jewels which he expected to find concealed upon his victims body  an instant later he rose with a curse upon his lips  it was achmet zek and he cursed because he had discovered beneath the blankets of his lieutenant only a pile of discarded clothing arranged in the form and semblance of a sleeping manalbert werper had fled  out into the village ran the chief calling in angry tones to the sleepy arabs who tumbled from their tents in answer to his voice  but though they searched the village again and again they found no trace of the belgian  foaming with anger achmet zek called his followers to horse and though the night was pitchy black they set out to scour the adjoining forest for their quarry  as they galloped from the open gates mugambi hiding in a nearby bush slipped unseen within the palisade  a score of blacks crowded about the entrance to watch the searchers depart and as the last of them passed out of the village the blacks seized the portals and drew them to and mugambi lent a hand in the work as though the best of his life had been spent among the raiders  in the darkness he passed unchallenged as one of their number and as they returned from the gates to their respective tents and huts mugambi melted into the shadows and disappeared  for an hour he crept about in the rear of the various huts and tents in an effort to locate that in which his masters mate was imprisoned one there was which he was reasonably assured contained her for it was the only hut before the door of which a sentry had been posted mugambi was crouching in the shadow of this structure just around the corner from the unsuspecting guard when another approached to relieve his comrade  the prisoner is safe within asked the newcomer  she is replied the other for none has passed this doorway since i came  the new sentry squatted beside the door while he whom he had relieved made his way to his own hut  mugambi slunk closer to the corner of the building  in one powerful hand he gripped a heavy knobstick  no sign of elation disturbed his phlegmatic calm yet inwardly he was aroused to joy by the proof he had just heard that lady really was within  the sentrys back was toward the corner of the hut which hid the giant black  the fellow did not see the huge form which silently loomed behind him  the knobstick swung upward in a curve and downward again  there was the sound of a dull thud the crushing of heavy bone and the sentry slumped into a silent inanimate lump of clay  a moment later mugambi was searching the interior of the hut  at first slowly calling lady in a low whisper and finally with almost frantic haste until the truth presently dawned upon himthe hut was empty     11  tarzan becomes a beast again   for a moment werper had stood above the sleeping apeman his murderous knife poised for the fatal thrust but fear stayed his hand  what if the first blow should fail to drive the point to his victims heart werper shuddered in contemplation of the disastrous consequences to himself  awakened and even with a few moments of life remaining the giant could literally tear his assailant to pieces should he choose and the belgian had no doubt but that tarzan would so choose  again came the soft sound of padded footsteps in the reedscloser this time  werper abandoned his design  before him stretched the wide plain and escape  the jewels were in his possession  to remain longer was to risk death at the hands of tarzan or the jaws of the hunter creeping ever nearer  turning he slunk away through the night toward the distant forest  tarzan slept on  where were those uncanny guardian powers that had formerly rendered him immune from the dangers of surprise  could this dull sleeper be the alert sensitive tarzan of old  perhaps the blow upon his head had numbed his senses temporarilywho may say  closer crept the stealthy creature through the reeds  the rustling curtain of vegetation parted a few paces from where the sleeper lay and the massive head of a lion appeared  the beast surveyed the apeman intently for a moment then he crouched his hind feet drawn well beneath him his tail lashing from side to side  it was the beating of the beasts tail against the reeds which awakened tarzan  jungle folk do not awaken slowlyinstantly full consciousness and full command of their every faculty returns to them from the depth of profound slumber  even as tarzan opened his eyes he was upon his feet his spear grasped firmly in his hand and ready for attack  again was he tarzan of the apes sentient vigilant ready  no two lions have identical characteristics nor does the same lion invariably act similarly under like circumstances  whether it was surprise fear or caution which prompted the lion crouching ready to spring upon the man is immaterialthe fact remains that he did not carry out his original design he did not spring at the man at all but instead wheeled and sprang back into the reeds as tarzan arose and confronted him  the apeman shrugged his broad shoulders and looked about for his companion  werper was nowhere to be seen  at first tarzan suspected that the man had been seized and dragged off by another lion but upon examination of the ground he soon discovered that the belgian had gone away alone out into the plain  for a moment he was puzzled but presently came to the conclusion that werper had been frightened by the approach of the lion and had sneaked off in terror  a sneer touched tarzans lips as he pondered the mans actthe desertion of a comrade in time of danger and without warning well if that was the sort of creature werper was tarzan wished nothing more of him  he had gone and for all the apeman cared he might remain awaytarzan would not search for him  a hundred yards from where he stood grew a large tree alone upon the edge of the reedy jungle  tarzan made his way to it clambered into it and finding a comfortable crotch among its branches reposed himself for uninterrupted sleep until morning  and when morning came tarzan slept on long after the sun had risen his mind reverted to the primitive was untroubled by any more serious obligations than those of providing sustenance and safeguarding his life  therefore there was nothing to awaken for until danger threatened or the pangs of hunger assailed  it was the latter which eventually aroused him  opening his eyes he stretched his giant thews yawned rose and gazed about him through the leafy foliage of his retreat  across the wasted meadowlands and fields of john clayton lord greystoke tarzan of the apes looked as a stranger upon the moving figures of basuli and his braves as they prepared their morning meal and made ready to set out upon the expedition which basuli had planned after discovering the havoc and disaster which had befallen the estate of his dead master  the apeman eyed the blacks with curiosity  in the back of his brain loitered a fleeting sense of familiarity with all that he saw yet he could not connect any of the various forms of life animate and inanimate which had fallen within the range of his vision since he had emerged from the darkness of the pits of opar with any particular event of the past  hazily he recalled a grim and hideous form hairy ferocious  a vague tenderness dominated his savage sentiments as this phantom memory struggled for recognition  his mind had reverted to his childhood daysit was the figure of the giant sheape kala that he saw but only half recognized  he saw too other grotesque manlike forms they were of terkoz tublat kerchak and a smaller less ferocious figure that was neeta the little playmate of his boyhood  slowly very slowly as these visions of the past animated his lethargic memory he came to recognize them  they took definite shape and form adjusting themselves nicely to the various incidents of his life with which they had been intimately connected  his boyhood among the apes spread itself in a slow panorama before him and as it unfolded it induced within him a mighty longing for the companionship of the shaggy lowbrowed brutes of his past  he watched the blacks scatter their cook fire and depart but though the face of each of them had but recently been as familiar to him as his own they awakened within him no recollections whatsoever  when they had gone he descended from the tree and sought food  out upon the plain grazed numerous herds of wild ruminants  toward a sleek fat bunch of zebra he wormed his stealthy way  no intricate process of reasoning caused him to circle widely until he was down wind from his preyhe acted instinctively  he took advantage of every form of cover as he crawled upon all fours and often flat upon his stomach toward them  a plump young mare and a fat stallion grazed nearest to him as he neared the herd  again it was instinct which selected the former for his meat  a low bush grew but a few yards from the unsuspecting two the apeman reached its shelter  he gathered his spear firmly in his grasp  cautiously he drew his feet beneath him  in a single swift move he rose and cast his heavy weapon at the mares side  nor did he wait to note the effect of his assault but leaped catlike after his spear his hunting knife in his hand  for an instant the two animals stood motionless  the tearing of the cruel barb into her side brought a sudden scream of pain and fright from the mare and then they both wheeled and broke for safety but tarzan of the apes for a distance of a few yards could equal the speed of even these and the first stride of the mare found her overhauled with a savage beast at her shoulder  she turned biting and kicking at her foe  her mate hesitated for an instant as though about to rush to her assistance but a backward glance revealed to him the flying heels of the balance of the herd and with a snort and a shake of his head he wheeled and dashed away  clinging with one hand to the short mane of his quarry tarzan struck again and again with his knife at the unprotected heart  the result had from the first been inevitable  the mare fought bravely but hopelessly and presently sank to the earth her heart pierced  the apeman placed a foot upon her carcass and raised his voice in the victory call of the mangani  in the distance basuli halted as the faint notes of the hideous scream broke upon his ears  the great apes he said to his companion  it has been long since i have heard them in the country of the waziri  what could have brought them back  tarzan grasped his kill and dragged it to the partial seclusion of the bush which had hidden his own near approach and there he squatted upon it cut a huge hunk of flesh from the loin and proceeded to satisfy his hunger with the warm and dripping meat  attracted by the shrill screams of the mare a pair of hyenas slunk presently into view  they trotted to a point a few yards from the gorging apeman and halted  tarzan looked up bared his fighting fangs and growled  the hyenas returned the compliment and withdrew a couple of paces  they made no move to attack but continued to sit at a respectful distance until tarzan had concluded his meal  after the apeman had cut a few strips from the carcass to carry with him he walked slowly off in the direction of the river to quench his thirst his way lay directly toward the hyenas nor did he alter his course because of them  with all the lordly majesty of numa the lion he strode straight toward the growling beasts  for a moment they held their ground bristling and defiant but only for a moment and then slunk away to one side while the indifferent apeman passed them on his lordly way a moment later they were tearing at the remains of the zebra  back to the reeds went tarzan and through them toward the river  a herd of buffalo startled by his approach rose ready to charge or to fly  a great bull pawed the ground and bellowed as his bloodshot eyes discovered the intruder but the apeman passed across their front as though ignorant of their existence  the bulls bellowing lessened to a low rumbling he turned and scraped a horde of flies from his side with his muzzle cast a final glance at the apeman and resumed his feeding his numerous family either followed his example or stood gazing after tarzan in mildeyed curiosity until the opposite reeds swallowed him from view  at the river tarzan drank his fill and bathed  during the heat of the day he lay up under the shade of a tree near the ruins of his burned barns  his eyes wandered out across the plain toward the forest and a longing for the pleasures of its mysterious depths possessed his thoughts for a considerable time  with the next sun he would cross the open and enter the forest  there was no hurrythere lay before him an endless vista of tomorrows with naught to fill them but the satisfying of the appetites and caprices of the moment  the apemans mind was untroubled by regret for the past or aspiration for the future  he could lie at full length along a swaying branch stretching his giant limbs and luxuriating in the blessed peace of utter thoughtlessness without an apprehension or a worry to sap his nervous energy and rob him of his peace of mind  recalling only dimly any other existence the apeman was happy  lord greystoke had ceased to exist  for several hours tarzan lolled upon his swaying leafy couch until once again hunger and thirst suggested an excursion  stretching lazily he dropped to the ground and moved slowly toward the river  the game trail down which he walked had become by ages of use a deep narrow trench its walls topped on either side by impenetrable thicket and densegrowing trees closely interwoven with thickstemmed creepers and lesser vines inextricably matted into two solid ramparts of vegetation tarzan had almost reached the point where the trail debouched upon the open river bottom when he saw a family of lions approaching along the path from the direction of the river  the apeman counted sevena male and two lionesses full grown and four young lions as large and quite as formidable as their parents  tarzan halted growling and the lions paused the great male in the lead baring his fangs and rumbling forth a warning roar  in his hand the apeman held his heavy spear but he had no intention of pitting his puny weapon against seven lions yet he stood there growling and roaring and the lions did likewise  it was purely an exhibition of jungle bluff  each was trying to frighten off the other  neither wished to turn back and give way nor did either at first desire to precipitate an encounter  the lions were fed sufficiently so as not to be goaded by pangs of hunger and as for tarzan he seldom ate the meat of the carnivores but a point of ethics was at stake and neither side wished to back down  so they stood there facing one another making all sorts of hideous noises the while they hurled jungle invective back and forth  how long this bloodless duel would have persisted it is difficult to say though eventually tarzan would have been forced to yield to superior numbers  there came however an interruption which put an end to the deadlock and it came from tarzans rear  he and the lions had been making so much noise that neither could hear anything above their concerted bedlam and so it was that tarzan did not hear the great bulk bearing down upon him from behind until an instant before it was upon him and then he turned to see buto the rhinoceros his little pig eyes blazing charging madly toward him and already so close that escape seemed impossible yet so perfectly were mind and muscles coordinated in this unspoiled primitive man that almost simultaneously with the sense perception of the threatened danger he wheeled and hurled his spear at butos chest  it was a heavy spear shod with iron and behind it were the giant muscles of the apeman while coming to meet it was the enormous weight of buto and the momentum of his rapid rush  all that happened in the instant that tarzan turned to meet the charge of the irascible rhinoceros might take long to tell and yet would have taxed the swiftest lens to record  as his spear left his hand the apeman was looking down upon the mighty horn lowered to toss him so close was buto to him  the spear entered the rhinoceros neck at its junction with the left shoulder and passed almost entirely through the beasts body and at the instant that he launched it tarzan leaped straight into the air alighting upon butos back but escaping the mighty horn  then buto espied the lions and bore madly down upon them while tarzan of the apes leaped nimbly into the tangled creepers at one side of the trail  the first lion met butos charge and was tossed high over the back of the maddened brute torn and dying and then the six remaining lions were upon the rhinoceros rending and tearing the while they were being gored or trampled  from the safety of his perch tarzan watched the royal battle with the keenest interest for the more intelligent of the jungle folk are interested in such encounters  they are to them what the racetrack and the prize ring the theater and the movies are to us they see them often but always they enjoy them for no two are precisely alike  for a time it seemed to tarzan that buto the rhinoceros would prove victor in the gory battle  already had he accounted for four of the seven lions and badly wounded the three remaining when in a momentary lull in the encounter he sank limply to his knees and rolled over upon his side  tarzans spear had done its work  it was the manmade weapon which killed the great beast that might easily have survived the assault of seven mighty lions for tarzans spear had pierced the great lungs and buto with victory almost in sight succumbed to internal hemorrhage  then tarzan came down from his sanctuary and as the wounded lions growling dragged themselves away the apeman cut his spear from the body of buto hacked off a steak and vanished into the jungle  the episode was over  it had been all in the days worksomething which you and i might talk about for a lifetime tarzan dismissed from his mind the moment that the scene passed from his sight     12  la seeks vengeance   swinging back through the jungle in a wide circle the apeman came to the river at another point drank and took to the trees again and while he hunted all oblivious of his past and careless of his future there came through the dark jungles and the open parklike places and across the wide meadows where grazed the countless herbivora of the mysterious continent a weird and terrible caravan in search of him there were fifty frightful men with hairy bodies and gnarled and crooked legs  they were armed with knives and great bludgeons and at their head marched an almost naked woman beautiful beyond compare  it was la of opar high priestess of the flaming god and fifty of her horrid priests searching for the purloiner of the sacred sacrificial knife  never before had la passed beyond the crumbling outer walls of opar but never before had need been so insistent  the sacred knife was gone  handed down through countless ages it had come to her as a heritage and an insignia of her religious office and regal authority from some longdead progenitor of lost and forgotten atlantis  the loss of the crown jewels or the great seal of england could have brought no greater consternation to a british king than did the pilfering of the sacred knife bring to la the oparian queen and high priestess of the degraded remnants of the oldest civilization upon earth  when atlantis with all her mighty cities and her cultivated fields and her great commerce and culture and riches sank into the sea long ages since she took with her all but a handful of her colonists working the vast gold mines of central africa  from these and their degraded slaves and a later intermixture of the blood of the anthropoids sprung the gnarled men of opar but by some queer freak of fate aided by natural selection the old atlantean strain had remained pure and undegraded in the females descended from a single princess of the royal house of atlantis who had been in opar at the time of the great catastrophe  such was la  burning with whitehot anger was the high priestess her heart a seething molten mass of hatred for tarzan of the apes  the zeal of the religious fanatic whose altar has been desecrated was triply enhanced by the rage of a woman scorned  twice had she thrown her heart at the feet of the godlike apeman and twice had she been repulsed  la knew that she was beautifuland she was beautiful not by the standards of prehistoric atlantis alone but by those of modern times was la physically a creature of perfection  before tarzan came that first time to opar la had never seen a human male other than the grotesque and knotted men of her clan  with one of these she must mate sooner or later that the direct line of high priestesses might not be broken unless fate should bring other men to opar  before tarzan came upon his first visit la had had no thought that such men as he existed for she knew only her hideous little priests and the bulls of the tribe of great anthropoids that had dwelt from time immemorial in and about opar until they had come to be looked upon almost as equals by the oparians  among the legends of opar were tales of godlike men of the olden time and of black men who had come more recently but these latter had been enemies who killed and robbed  and too these legends always held forth the hope that some day that nameless continent from which their race had sprung would rise once more out of the sea and with slaves at the long sweeps would send her carven goldpicked galleys forth to succor the longexiled colonists  the coming of tarzan had aroused within las breast the wild hope that at last the fulfillment of this ancient prophecy was at hand but more strongly still had it aroused the hot fires of love in a heart that never otherwise would have known the meaning of that allconsuming passion for such a wondrous creature as la could never have felt love for any of the repulsive priests of opar  custom duty and religious zeal might have commanded the union but there could have been no love on las part  she had grown to young womanhood a cold and heartless creature daughter of a thousand other cold heartless beautiful women who had never known love  and so when love came to her it liberated all the pent passions of a thousand generations transforming la into a pulsing throbbing volcano of desire and with desire thwarted this great force of love and gentleness and sacrifice was transmuted by its own fires into one of hatred and revenge  it was in a state of mind superinduced by these conditions that la led forth her jabbering company to retrieve the sacred emblem of her high office and wreak vengeance upon the author of her wrongs  to werper she gave little thought  the fact that the knife had been in his hand when it departed from opar brought down no thoughts of vengeance upon his head  of course he should be slain when captured but his death would give la no pleasureshe looked for that in the contemplated death agonies of tarzan  he should be tortured  his should be a slow and frightful death  his punishment should be adequate to the immensity of his crime  he had wrested the sacred knife from la he had lain sacreligious hands upon the high priestess of the flaming god he had desecrated the altar and the temple  for these things he should die but he had scorned the love of la the woman and for this he should die horribly with great anguish  the march of la and her priests was not without its adventures  unused were these to the ways of the jungle since seldom did any venture forth from behind opars crumbling walls yet their very numbers protected them and so they came without fatalities far along the trail of tarzan and werper  three great apes accompanied them and to these was delegated the business of tracking the quarry a feat beyond the senses of the oparians  la commanded  she arranged the order of march she selected the camps she set the hour for halting and the hour for resuming and though she was inexperienced in such matters her native intelligence was so far above that of the men or the apes that she did better than they could have done  she was a hard taskmaster too for she looked down with loathing and contempt upon the misshapen creatures amongst which cruel fate had thrown her and to some extent vented upon them her dissatisfaction and her thwarted love  she made them build her a strong protection and shelter each night and keep a great fire burning before it from dusk to dawn  when she tired of walking they were forced to carry her upon an improvised litter nor did one dare to question her authority or her right to such services in fact they did not question either  to them she was a goddess and each loved her and each hoped that he would be chosen as her mate so they slaved for her and bore the stinging lash of her displeasure and the habitually haughty disdain of her manner without a murmur  for many days they marched the apes following the trail easily and going a little distance ahead of the body of the caravan that they might warn the others of impending danger  it was during a noonday halt while all were lying resting after a tiresome march that one of the apes rose suddenly and sniffed the breeze  in a low guttural he cautioned the others to silence and a moment later was swinging quietly up wind into the jungle  la and the priests gathered silently together the hideous little men fingering their knives and bludgeons and awaited the return of the shaggy anthropoid  nor had they long to wait before they saw him emerge from a leafy thicket and approach them  straight to la he came and in the language of the great apes which was also the language of decadent opar he addressed her  the great tarmangani lies asleep there he said pointing in the direction from which he had just come  come and we can kill him  do not kill him commanded la in cold tones  bring the great tarmangani to me alive and unhurt  the vengeance is las  go but make no sound and she waved her hands to include all her followers  cautiously the weird party crept through the jungle in the wake of the great ape until at last he halted them with a raised hand and pointed upward and a little ahead  there they saw the giant form of the apeman stretched along a low bough and even in sleep one hand grasped a stout limb and one strong brown leg reached out and overlapped another  at ease lay tarzan of the apes sleeping heavily upon a full stomach and dreaming of numa the lion and horta the boar and other creatures of the jungle  no intimation of danger assailed the dormant faculties of the apemanhe saw no crouching hairy figures upon the ground beneath him nor the three apes that swung quietly into the  tree beside him  the first intimation of danger that came to tarzan was the impact of three bodies as the three apes leaped upon him and hurled him to the ground where he alighted half stunned beneath their combined weight and was immediately set upon by the fifty hairy men or as many of them as could swarm upon his person  instantly the apeman became the center of a whirling striking biting maelstrom of horror  he fought nobly but the odds against him were too great  slowly they overcame him though there was scarce one of them that did not feel the weight of his mighty fist or the rending of his fangs     13  condemned to torture and death   la had followed her company and when she saw them clawing and biting at tarzan she raised her voice and cautioned them not to kill him  she saw that he was weakening and that soon the greater numbers would prevail over him nor had she long to wait before the mighty jungle creature lay helpless and bound at her feet  bring him to the place at which we stopped she commanded and they carried tarzan back to the little clearing and threw him down beneath a tree  build me a shelter ordered la  we shall stop here tonight and tomorrow in the face of the flaming god la will offer up the heart of this defiler of the temple  where is the sacred knife  who took it from him  but no one had seen it and each was positive in his assurance that the sacrificial weapon had not been upon tarzans person when they captured him  the apeman looked upon the menacing creatures which surrounded him and snarled his defiance  he looked upon la and smiled  in the face of death he was unafraid  where is the knife la asked him  i do not know replied tarzan  the man took it with him when he slipped away during the night  since you are so desirous for its return i would look for him and get it back for you did you not hold me prisoner but now that i am to die i cannot get it back  of what good was your knife anyway  you can make another  did you follow us all this way for nothing more than a knife  let me go and find him and i will bring it back to you  la laughed a bitter laugh for in her heart she knew that tarzans sin was greater than the purloining of the sacrificial knife of opar yet as she looked at him lying bound and helpless before her tears rose to her eyes so that she had to turn away to hide them but she remained inflexible in her determination to make him pay in frightful suffering and in eventual death for daring to spurn the love of la  when the shelter was completed la had tarzan transferred to it  all night i shall torture him she muttered to her priests and at the first streak of dawn you may prepare the flaming altar upon which his heart shall be offered up to the flaming god  gather wood well filled with pitch lay it in the form and size of the altar at opar in the center of the clearing that the flaming god may look down upon our handiwork and be pleased  during the balance of the day the priests of opar were busy erecting an altar in the center of the clearing and while they worked they chanted weird hymns in the ancient tongue of that lost continent that lies at the bottom of the atlantic  they knew not the meanings of the words they mouthed they but repeated the ritual that had been handed down from preceptor to neophyte since that longgone day when the ancestors of the piltdown man still swung by their tails in the humid jungles that are england now  and in the shelter of the hut la paced to and fro beside the stoic apeman  resigned to his fate was tarzan  no hope of succor gleamed through the dead black of the death sentence hanging over him  he knew that his giant muscles could not part the many strands that bound his wrists and ankles for he had strained often but ineffectually for release  he had no hope of outside help and only enemies surrounded him within the camp and yet he smiled at la as she paced nervously back and forth the length of the shelter  and la  she fingered her knife and looked down upon her captive  she glared and muttered but she did not strike  tonight she thought tonight when it is dark i will torture him she looked upon his perfect godlike figure and upon his handsome smiling face and then she steeled her heart again by thoughts of her love spurned by religious thoughts that damned the infidel who had desecrated the holy of holies who had taken from the bloodstained altar of opar the offering to the flaming godand not once but thrice  three times had tarzan cheated the god of her fathers  at the thought la paused and knelt at his side  in her hand was a sharp knife  she placed its point against the apemans side and pressed upon the hilt but tarzan only smiled and shrugged his shoulders  how beautiful he was  la bent low over him looking into his eyes how perfect was his figure  she compared it with those of the knurled and knotted men from whom she must choose a mate and la shuddered at the thought  dusk came and after dusk came night  a great fire blazed within the little thorn boma about the camp  the flames played upon the new altar erected in the center of the clearing arousing in the mind of the high priestess of the flaming god a picture of the event of the coming dawn  she saw this giant and perfect form writhing amid the flames of the burning pyre  she saw those smiling lips burned and blackened falling away from the strong white teeth  she saw the shock of black hair tousled upon tarzans wellshaped head disappear in a spurt of flame  she saw these and many other frightful pictures as she stood with closed eyes and clenched fists above the object of her hateah  was it hate that la of opar felt  the darkness of the jungle night had settled down upon the camp relieved only by the fitful flarings of the fire that was kept up to warn off the maneaters  tarzan lay quietly in his bonds  he suffered from thirst and from the cutting of the tight strands about his wrists and ankles but he made no complaint  a jungle beast was tarzan with the stoicism of the beast and the intelligence of man  he knew that his doom was sealedthat no supplications would avail to temper the severity of his end and so he wasted no breath in pleadings but waited patiently in the firm conviction that his sufferings could not endure forever  in the darkness la stooped above him  in her hand was a sharp knife and in her mind the determination to initiate his torture without further delay  the knife was pressed against his side and las face was close to his when a sudden burst of flame from new branches thrown upon the fire without lighted up the interior of the shelter  close beneath her lips la saw the perfect features of the forest god and into her womans heart welled all the great love she had felt for tarzan since first she had seen him and all the accumulated passion of the years that she had dreamed of him  dagger in hand la the high priestess towered above the helpless creature that had dared to violate the sanctuary of her deity  there should be no torturethere should be instant death  no longer should the defiler of the temple pollute the sight of the lord god almighty a single stroke of the heavy blade and then the corpse to the flaming pyre without  the knife arm stiffened ready for the downward plunge and then la the woman collapsed weakly upon the body of the man she loved  she ran her hands in mute caress over his naked flesh she covered his forehead his eyes his lips with hot kisses she covered him with her body as though to protect him from the hideous fate she had ordained for him and in trembling piteous tones she begged him for his love for hours the frenzy of her passion possessed the burning handmaiden of the flaming god until at last sleep overpowered her and she lapsed into unconsciousness beside the man she had sworn to torture and to slay  and tarzan untroubled by thoughts of the future slept peacefully in las embrace  at the first hint of dawn the chanting of the priests of opar brought tarzan to wakefulness  initiated in low and subdued tones the sound soon rose in volume to the open diapason of barbaric blood lust  la stirred  her perfect arm pressed tarzan closer to hera smile parted her lips and then she awoke and slowly the smile faded and her eyes went wide in horror as the significance of the death chant impinged upon her understanding  love me tarzan she cried  love me and you shall be saved  tarzans bonds hurt him  he was suffering the tortures of longrestricted circulation  with an angry growl he rolled over with his back toward la  that was her answer  the high priestess leaped to her feet  a hot flush of shame mantled her cheek and then she went dead white and stepped to the shelters entrance  come priests of the flaming god she cried and make ready the sacrifice  the warped things advanced and entered the shelter  they laid hands upon tarzan and bore him forth and as they chanted they kept time with their crooked bodies swaying to and fro to the rhythm of their song of blood and death  behind them came la swaying too but not in unison with the chanted cadence  white and drawn was the face of the high priestesswhite and drawn with unrequited love and hideous terror of the moments to come  yet stern in her resolve was la  the infidel should die  the scorner of her love should pay the price upon the fiery altar  she saw them lay the perfect body there upon the rough branches  she saw the high priest he to whom custom would unite herbent crooked gnarled stunted hideousadvance with the flaming torch and stand awaiting her command to apply it to the faggots surrounding the sacrificial pyre  his hairy bestial face was distorted in a yellowfanged grin of anticipatory enjoyment  his hands were cupped to receive the life blood of the victimthe red nectar that at opar would have filled the golden sacrificial goblets  la approached with upraised knife her face turned toward the rising sun and upon her lips a prayer to the burning deity of her people  the high priest looked questioningly toward herthe brand was burning close to his hand and the faggots lay temptingly near  tarzan closed his eyes and awaited the end  he knew that he would suffer for he recalled the faint memories of past burns  he knew that he would suffer and die but he did not flinch  death is no great adventure to the jungle bred who walk handinhand with the grim specter by day and lie down at his side by night through all the years of their lives  it is doubtful that the apeman even speculated upon what came after death  as a matter of fact as his end approached his mind was occupied by thoughts of the pretty pebbles he had lost yet his every faculty still was open to what passed around him  he felt la lean over him and he opened his eyes  he saw her white drawn face and he saw tears blinding her eyes  tarzan my tarzan she moaned tell me that you love methat you will return to opar with meand you shall live  even in the face of the anger of my people i will save you  this last chance i give you  what is your answer  at the last moment the woman in la had triumphed over the high priestess of a cruel cult  she saw upon the altar the only creature that ever had aroused the fires of love within her virgin breast she saw the beastfaced fanatic who would one day be her mate unless she found another less repulsive standing with the burning torch ready to ignite the pyre yet with all her mad passion for the apeman she would give the word to apply the flame if tarzans final answer was unsatisfactory  with heaving bosom she leaned close above him  yes or no she whispered  through the jungle out of the distance came faintly a sound that brought a sudden light of hope to tarzans eyes  he raised his voice in a weird scream that sent la back from him a step or two  the impatient priest grumbled and switched the torch from one hand to the other at the same time holding it closer to the tinder at the base of the pyre  your answer insisted la  what is your answer to the love of la of opar  closer came the sound that had attracted tarzans attention and now the others heard itthe shrill trumpeting of an elephant  as la looked wideeyed into tarzans face there to read her fate for happiness or heartbreak she saw an expression of concern shadow his features  now for the first time she guessed the meaning of tarzans shrill screamhe had summoned tantor the elephant to his rescue  las brows contracted in a savage scowl  you refuse la she cried  then die  the torch she commanded turning toward the priest  tarzan looked up into her face  tantor is coming he said  i thought that he would rescue me but i know now from his voice that he will slay me and you and all that fall in his path searching out with the cunning of sheeta the panther those who would hide from him for tantor is mad with the madness of love  la knew only too well the insane ferocity of a bull elephant in must she knew that tarzan had not exaggerated  she knew that the devil in the cunning cruel brain of the great beast might send it hither and thither hunting through the forest for those who escaped its first charge or the beast might pass on without returningno one might guess which  i cannot love you la said tarzan in a low voice  i do not know why for you are very beautiful  i could not go back and live in opari who have the whole broad jungle for my range  no i cannot love you but i cannot see you die beneath the goring tusks of mad tantor  cut my bonds before it is too late  already he is almost upon us  cut them and i may yet save you  a little spiral of curling smoke rose from one corner of the pyrethe flames licked upward crackling  la stood there like a beautiful statue of despair gazing at tarzan and at the spreading flames  in a moment they would reach out and grasp him  from the tangled forest came the sound of cracking limbs and crashing trunkstantor was coming down upon them a huge juggernaut of the jungle  the priests were becoming uneasy  they cast apprehensive glances in the direction of the approaching elephant and then back at la  fly she commanded them and then she stooped and cut the bonds securing her prisoners feet and hands  in an instant tarzan was upon the ground  the priests screamed out their rage and disappointment he with the torch took a menacing step toward la and the apeman traitor he shrieked at the woman  for this you too shall die raising his bludgeon he rushed upon the high priestess but tarzan was there before her  leaping in to close quarters the apeman seized the upraised weapon and wrenched it from the hands of the frenzied fanatic and then the priest closed upon him with tooth and nail  seizing the stocky stunted body in his mighty hands tarzan raised the creature high above his head hurling him at his fellows who were now gathered ready to bear down upon their erstwhile captive  la stood proudly with ready knife behind the apeman  no faint sign of fear marked her perfect browonly haughty disdain for her priests and admiration for the man she loved so hopelessly filled her thoughts  suddenly upon this scene burst the mad bulla huge tusker his little eyes inflamed with insane rage  the priests stood for an instant paralyzed with terror but tarzan turned and gathering la in his arms raced for the nearest tree  tantor bore down upon him trumpeting shrilly  la clung with both white arms about the apemans neck  she felt him leap into the air and marveled at his strength and his ability as burdened with her weight he swung nimbly into the lower branches of a large tree and quickly bore her upward beyond reach of the sinuous trunk of the pachyderm  momentarily baffled here the huge elephant wheeled and bore down upon the hapless priests who had now scattered terrorstricken in every direction  the nearest he gored and threw high among the branches of a tree  one he seized in the coils of his trunk and broke upon a huge bole dropping the mangled pulp to charge trumpeting after another two he trampled beneath his huge feet and by then the others had disappeared into the jungle  now tantor turned his attention once more to tarzan for one of the symptoms of madness is a revulsion of affectionobjects of sane love become the objects of insane hatred peculiar in the unwritten annals of the jungle was the proverbial love that had existed between the apeman and the tribe of tantor  no elephant in all the jungle would harm the tarmanganithe whiteape but with the madness of must upon him the great bull sought to destroy his longtime playfellow  back to the tree where la and tarzan perched came tantor the elephant he reared up with his forefeet against the bole and reached high toward them with his long trunk but tarzan had foreseen this and clambered beyond the bulls longest reach  failure but tended to further enrage the mad creature  he bellowed and trumpeted and screamed until the earth shook to the mighty volume of his noise  he put his head against the tree and pushed and the tree bent before his mighty strength yet still it held  the actions of tarzan were peculiar in the extreme  had numa or sabor or sheeta or any other beast of the jungle been seeking to destroy him the apeman would have danced about hurling missiles and invectives at his assailant  he would have insulted and taunted them reviling in the jungle billingsgate he knew so well but now he sat silent out of tantors reach and upon his handsome face was an expression of deep sorrow and pity for of all the jungle folk tarzan loved tantor the best  could he have slain him he would not have thought of doing so  his one idea was to escape for he knew that with the passing of the must tantor would be sane again and that once more he might stretch at full length upon that mighty back and make foolish speech into those great flapping ears  finding that the tree would not fall to his pushing tantor was but enraged the more  he looked up at the two perched high above him his redrimmed eyes blazing with insane hatred and then he wound his trunk about the bole of the tree spread his giant feet wide apart and tugged to uproot the jungle giant  a huge creature was tantor an enormous bull in the full prime of all his stupendous strength  mightily he strove until presently to tarzans consternation the great tree gave slowly at the roots  the ground rose in little mounds and ridges about the base of the bole the tree tiltedin another moment it would be uprooted and fall  the apeman whirled la to his back and just as the tree inclined slowly in its first movement out of the perpendicular before the sudden rush of its final collapse he swung to the branches of a lesser neighbor it was a long and perilous leap  la closed her eyes and shuddered but when she opened them again she found herself safe and tarzan whirling onward through the forest  behind them the uprooted tree crashed heavily to the ground carrying with it the lesser trees in its path and then tantor realizing that his prey had escaped him set up once more his hideous trumpeting and followed at a rapid charge upon their trail     14  a priestess but yet a woman   at first la closed her eyes and clung to tarzan in terror though she made no outcry but presently she gained sufficient courage to look about her to look down at the ground beneath and even to keep her eyes open during the wide perilous swings from tree to tree and then there came over her a sense of safety because of her confidence in the perfect physical creature in whose strength and nerve and agility her fate lay  once she raised her eyes to the burning sun and murmured a prayer of thanks to her pagan god that she had not been permitted to destroy this godlike man and her long lashes were wet with tears  a strange anomaly was la of opara creature of circumstance torn by conflicting emotions  now the cruel and bloodthirsty creature of a heartless god and again a melting woman filled with compassion and tenderness  sometimes the incarnation of jealousy and revenge and sometimes a sobbing maiden generous and forgiving at once a virgin and a wanton but alwaysa woman  such was la  she pressed her cheek close to tarzans shoulder  slowly she turned her head until her hot lips were pressed against his flesh  she loved him and would gladly have died for him yet within an hour she had been ready to plunge a knife into his heart and might again within the coming hour  a hapless priest seeking shelter in the jungle chanced to show himself to enraged tantor  the great beast turned to one side bore down upon the crooked little man snuffed him out and then diverted from his course blundered away toward the south  in a few minutes even the noise of his trumpeting was lost in the distance  tarzan dropped to the ground and la slipped to her feet from his back call your people together said tarzan  they will kill me replied la  they will not kill you contradicted the apeman  no one will kill you while tarzan of the apes is here  call them and we will talk with them  la raised her voice in a weird flutelike call that carried far into the jungle on every side  from near and far came answering shouts in the barking tones of the oparian priests we come  we come again and again la repeated her summons until singly and in pairs the greater portion of her following approached and halted a short distance away from the high priestess and her savior  they came with scowling brows and threatening mien  when all had come tarzan addressed them  your la is safe said the apeman  had she slain me she would now herself be dead and many more of you but she spared me that i might save her  go your way with her back to opar and tarzan will go his way into the jungle let there be peace always between tarzan and la what is your answer  the priests grumbled and shook their heads  they spoke together and la and tarzan could see that they were not favorably inclined toward the proposition  they did not wish to take la back and they did wish to complete the sacrifice of tarzan to the flaming god  at last the apeman became impatient  you will obey the commands of your queen he said and go back to opar with her or tarzan of the apes will call together the other creatures of the jungle and slay you all  la saved me that i might save you and her  i have served you better alive than i could have dead  if you are not all fools you will let me go my way in peace and you will return to opar with la  i know not where the sacred knife is but you can fashion another  had i not taken it from la you would have slain me and now your god must be glad that i took it since i have saved his priestess from lovemad tantor  will you go back to opar with la promising that no harm shall befall her  the priests gathered together in a little knot arguing and discussing they pounded upon their breasts with their fists they raised their hands and eyes to their fiery god they growled and barked among themselves until it became evident to tarzan that one of their number was preventing the acceptance of his proposal  this was the high priest whose heart was filled with jealous rage because la openly acknowledged her love for the stranger when by the worldly customs of their cult she should have belonged to him seemingly there was to be no solution of the problem until another priest stepped forth and raising his hand addressed la  cadj the high priest he announced would sacrifice you both to the flaming god but all of us except cadj would gladly return to opar with our queen  you are many against one spoke up tarzan  why should you not have your will  go your way with la to opar and if cadj interferes slay him  the priests of opar welcomed this suggestion with loud cries of approval  to them it appeared nothing short of divine inspiration the influence of ages of unquestioning obedience to high priests had made it seem impossible to them to question his authority but when they realized that they could force him to their will they were as happy as children with new toys  they rushed forward and seized cadj  they talked in loud menacing tones into his ear  they threatened him with bludgeon and knife until at last he acquiesced in their demands though sullenly and then tarzan stepped close before cadj  priest he said la goes back to her temple under the protection of her priests and the threat of tarzan of the apes that whoever harms her shall die  tarzan will go again to opar before the next rains and if harm has befallen la woe betide cadj the high priest  sullenly cadj promised not to harm his queen  protect her cried tarzan to the other oparians  protect her so that when tarzan comes again he will find la there to greet him  la will be there to greet thee exclaimed the high priestess and la will wait longing always longing until you come again  oh tell me that you will come  who knows asked the apeman as he swung quickly into the trees and raced off toward the east  for a moment la stood looking after him then her head drooped a sigh escaped her lips and like an old woman she took up the march toward distant opar  through the trees raced tarzan of the apes until the darkness of night had settled upon the jungle then he lay down and slept with no thought beyond the morrow and with even la but the shadow of a memory within his consciousness  but a few marches to the north lady greystoke looked forward to the day when her mighty lord and master should discover the crime of achmet zek and be speeding to rescue and avenge and even as she pictured the coming of john clayton the object of her thoughts squatted almost naked beside a fallen log beneath which he was searching with grimy fingers for a chance beetle or a luscious grub  two days elapsed following the theft of the jewels before tarzan gave them a thought  then as they chanced to enter his mind he conceived a desire to play with them again and having nothing better to do than satisfy the first whim which possessed him he rose and started across the plain from the forest in which he had spent the preceding day  though no mark showed where the gems had been buried and though the spot resembled the balance of an unbroken stretch several miles in length where the reeds terminated at the edge of the meadowland yet the apeman moved with unerring precision directly to the place where he had hid his treasure  with his hunting knife he upturned the loose earth beneath which the pouch should be but though he excavated to a greater distance than the depth of the original hole there was no sign of pouch or jewels tarzans brow clouded as he discovered that he had been despoiled little or no reasoning was required to convince him of the identity of the guilty party and with the same celerity that had marked his decision to unearth the jewels he set out upon the trail of the thief  though the spoor was two days old and practically obliterated in many places tarzan followed it with comparative ease  a white man could not have followed it twenty paces twelve hours after it had been made a black man would have lost it within the first mile but tarzan of the apes had been forced in childhood to develop senses that an ordinary mortal scarce ever uses  we may note the garlic and whisky on the breath of a fellow strap hanger or the cheap perfume emanating from the person of the wondrous lady sitting in front of us and deplore the fact of our sensitive noses but as a matter of fact we cannot smell at all our olfactory organs are practically atrophied by comparison with the development of the sense among the beasts of the wild  where a foot is placed an effluvium remains for a considerable time it is beyond the range of our sensibilities but to a creature of the lower orders especially to the hunters and the hunted as interesting and ofttimes more lucid than is the printed page to us  nor was tarzan dependent alone upon his sense of smell  vision and hearing had been brought to a marvelous state of development by the necessities of his early life where survival itself depended almost daily upon the exercise of the keenest vigilance and the constant use of all his faculties  and so he followed the old trail of the belgian through the forest and toward the north but because of the age of the trail he was constrained to a far from rapid progress  the man he followed was two days ahead of him when tarzan took up the pursuit and each day he gained upon the apeman  the latter however felt not the slightest doubt as to the outcome  some day he would overhaul his quarryhe could bide his time in peace until that day dawned  doggedly he followed the faint spoor pausing by day only to kill and eat and at night only to sleep and refresh himself  occasionally he passed parties of savage warriors but these he gave a wide berth for he was hunting with a purpose that was not to be distracted by the minor accidents of the trail  these parties were of the collecting hordes of the waziri and their allies which basuli had scattered his messengers broadcast to summon they were marching to a common rendezvous in preparation for an assault upon the stronghold of achmet zek but to tarzan they were enemieshe retained no conscious memory of any friendship for the black men  it was night when he halted outside the palisaded village of the arab raider  perched in the branches of a great tree he gazed down upon the life within the enclosure  to this place had the spoor led him  his quarry must be within but how was he to find him among so many huts tarzan although cognizant of his mighty powers realized also his limitations  he knew that he could not successfully cope with great numbers in open battle  he must resort to the stealth and trickery of the wild beast if he were to succeed  sitting in the safety of his tree munching upon the leg bone of horta the boar tarzan waited a favorable opportunity to enter the village for awhile he gnawed at the bulging round ends of the large bone splintering off small pieces between his strong jaws and sucking at the delicious marrow within but all the time he cast repeated glances into the village  he saw whiterobed figures and halfnaked blacks but not once did he see one who resembled the stealer of the gems  patiently he waited until the streets were deserted by all save the sentries at the gates then he dropped lightly to the ground circled to the opposite side of the village and approached the palisade  at his side hung a long rawhide ropea natural and more dependable evolution from the grass rope of his childhood loosening this he spread the noose upon the ground behind him and with a quick movement of his wrist tossed the coils over one of the sharpened projections of the summit of the palisade  drawing the noose taut he tested the solidity of its hold satisfied the apeman ran nimbly up the vertical wall aided by the rope which he clutched in both hands  once at the top it required but a moment to gather the dangling rope once more into its coils make it fast again at his waist take a quick glance downward within the palisade and assured that no one lurked directly beneath him drop softly to the ground  now he was within the village  before him stretched a series of tents and native huts  the business of exploring each of them would be fraught with danger but danger was only a natural factor of each days lifeit never appalled tarzan  the chances appealed to himthe chances of life and death with his prowess and his faculties pitted against those of a worthy antagonist  it was not necessary that he enter each habitationthrough a door a window or an open chink his nose told him whether or not his prey lay within  for some time he found one disappointment following upon the heels of another in quick succession  no spoor of the belgian was discernible but at last he came to a tent where the smell of the thief was strong  tarzan listened his ear close to the canvas at the rear but no sound came from within  at last he cut one of the pin ropes raised the bottom of the canvas and intruded his head within the interior  all was quiet and dark tarzan crawled cautiously withinthe scent of the belgian was strong but it was not live scent even before he had examined the interior minutely tarzan knew that no one was within it  in one corner he found a pile of blankets and clothing scattered about but no pouch of pretty pebbles  a careful examination of the balance of the tent revealed nothing more at least nothing to indicate the presence of the jewels but at the side where the blankets and clothing lay the apeman discovered that the tent wall had been loosened at the bottom and presently he sensed that the belgian had recently passed out of the tent by this avenue  tarzan was not long in following the way that his prey had fled  the spoor led always in the shadow and at the rear of the huts and tents of the villageit was quite evident to tarzan that the belgian had gone alone and secretly upon his mission  evidently he feared the inhabitants of the village or at least his work had been of such a nature that he dared not risk detection  at the back of a native hut the spoor led through a small hole recently cut in the brush wall and into the dark interior beyond  fearlessly tarzan followed the trail  on hands and knees he crawled through the small aperture  within the hut his nostrils were assailed by many odors but clear and distinct among them was one that half aroused a latent memory of the pastit was the faint and delicate odor of a woman  with the cognizance of it there rose in the breast of the apeman a strange uneasinessthe result of an irresistible force which he was destined to become acquainted with anewthe instinct which draws the male to his mate  in the same hut was the scent spoor of the belgian too and as both these assailed the nostrils of the apeman mingling one with the other a jealous rage leaped and burned within him though his memory held before the mirror of recollection no image of the she to which he had attached his desire  like the tent he had investigated the hut too was empty and after satisfying himself that his stolen pouch was secreted nowhere within he left as he had entered by the hole in the rear wall  here he took up the spoor of the belgian followed it across the clearing over the palisade and out into the dark jungle beyond     15  the flight of werper   after werper had arranged the dummy in his bed and sneaked out into the darkness of the village beneath the rear wall of his tent he had gone directly to the hut in which jane clayton was held captive  before the doorway squatted a black sentry  werper approached him boldly spoke a few words in his ear handed him a package of tobacco and passed into the hut  the black grinned and winked as the european disappeared within the darkness of the interior  the belgian being one of achmet zeks principal lieutenants might naturally go where he wished within or without the village and so the sentry had not questioned his right to enter the hut with the white woman prisoner  within werper called in french and in a low whisper lady greystoke it is i m frecoult  where are you but there was no response hastily the man felt around the interior groping blindly through the darkness with outstretched hands  there was no one within  werpers astonishment surpassed words  he was on the point of stepping without to question the sentry when his eyes becoming accustomed to the dark discovered a blotch of lesser blackness near the base of the rear wall of the hut examination revealed the fact that the blotch was an opening cut in the wall  it was large enough to permit the passage of his body and assured as he was that lady greystoke had passed out through the aperture in an attempt to escape the village he lost no time in availing himself of the same avenue but neither did he lose time in a fruitless search for jane clayton  his own life depended upon the chance of his eluding or outdistancing achmet zek when that worthy should have discovered that he had escaped  his original plan had contemplated connivance in the escape of lady greystoke for two very good and sufficient reasons  the first was that by saving her he would win the gratitude of the english and thus lessen the chance of his extradition should his identity and his crime against his superior officer be charged against him  the second reason was based upon the fact that only one direction of escape was safely open to him  he could not travel to the west because of the belgian possessions which lay between him and the atlantic  the south was closed to him by the feared presence of the savage apeman he had robbed  to the north lay the friends and allies of achmet zek only toward the east through british east africa lay reasonable assurance of freedom  accompanied by a titled englishwoman whom he had rescued from a frightful fate and his identity vouched for by her as that of a frenchman by the name of frecoult he had looked forward and not without reason to the active assistance of the british from the moment that he came in contact with their first outpost  but now that lady greystoke had disappeared though he still looked toward the east for hope his chances were lessened and another subsidiary design completely dashed from the moment that he had first laid eyes upon jane clayton he had nursed within his breast a secret passion for the beautiful american wife of the english lord and when achmet zeks discovery of the jewels had necessitated flight the belgian had dreamed in his planning of a future in which he might convince lady greystoke that her husband was dead and by playing upon her gratitude win her for himself  at that part of the village farthest from the gates werper discovered that two or three long poles taken from a nearby pile which had been collected for the construction of huts had been leaned against the top of the palisade forming a precarious though not impossible avenue of escape  rightly he inferred that thus had lady greystoke found the means to scale the wall nor did he lose even a moment in following her lead once in the jungle he struck out directly eastward  a few miles south of him jane clayton lay panting among the branches of a tree in which she had taken refuge from a prowling and hungry lioness  her escape from the village had been much easier than she had anticipated  the knife which she had used to cut her way through the brush wall of the hut to freedom she had found sticking in the wall of her prison doubtless left there by accident when a former tenant had vacated the premises  to cross the rear of the village keeping always in the densest shadows had required but a few moments and the fortunate circumstance of the discovery of the hut poles lying so near the palisade had solved for her the problem of the passage of the high wall  for an hour she had followed the old game trail toward the south until there fell upon her trained hearing the stealthy padding of a stalking beast behind her  the nearest tree gave her instant sanctuary for she was too wise in the ways of the jungle to chance her safety for a moment after discovering that she was being hunted  werper with better success traveled slowly onward until dawn when to his chagrin he discovered a mounted arab upon his trail  it was one of achmet zeks minions many of whom were scattered in all directions through the forest searching for the fugitive belgian  jane claytons escape had not yet been discovered when achmet zek and his searchers set forth to overhaul werper the only man who had seen the belgian after his departure from his tent was the black sentry before the doorway of lady greystokes prison hut and he had been silenced by the discovery of the dead body of the man who had relieved him the sentry that mugambi had dispatched  the bribe taker naturally inferred that werper had slain his fellow and dared not admit that he had permitted him to enter the hut fearing as he did the anger of achmet zek so as chance directed that he should be the one to discover the body of the sentry when the first alarm had been given following achmet zeks discovery that werper had outwitted him the crafty black had dragged the dead body to the interior of a nearby tent and himself resumed his station before the doorway of the hut in which he still believed the woman to be  with the discovery of the arab close behind him the belgian hid in the foliage of a leafy bush  here the trail ran straight for a considerable distance and down the shady forest aisle beneath the overarching branches of the trees rode the whiterobed figure of the pursuer  nearer and nearer he came  werper crouched closer to the ground behind the leaves of his hiding place  across the trail a vine moved werpers eyes instantly centered upon the spot  there was no wind to stir the foliage in the depths of the jungle  again the vine moved in the mind of the belgian only the presence of a sinister and malevolent force could account for the phenomenon  the mans eyes bored steadily into the screen of leaves upon the opposite side of the trail  gradually a form took shape beyond thema tawny form grim and terrible with yellowgreen eyes glaring fearsomely across the narrow trail straight into his  werper could have screamed in fright but up the trail was coming the messenger of another death equally sure and no less terrible  he remained silent almost paralyzed by fear the arab approached  across the trail from werper the lion crouched for the spring when suddenly his attention was attracted toward the horseman  the belgian saw the massive head turn in the direction of the raider and his heart all but ceased its beating as he awaited the result of this interruption  at a walk the horseman approached  would the nervous animal he rode take fright at the odor of the carnivore and bolting leave werper still to the mercies of the king of beasts  but he seemed unmindful of the near presence of the great cat  on he came his neck arched champing at the bit between his teeth  the belgian turned his eyes again toward the lion  the beasts whole attention now seemed riveted upon the horseman  they were abreast the lion now and still the brute did not spring  could he be but waiting for them to pass before returning his attention to the original prey werper shuddered and half rose  at the same instant the lion sprang from his place of concealment full upon the mounted man  the horse with a shrill neigh of terror shrank sideways almost upon the belgian the lion dragged the helpless arab from his saddle and the horse leaped back into the trail and fled away toward the west  but he did not flee alone  as the frightened beast had pressed in upon him werper had not been slow to note the quickly emptied saddle and the opportunity it presented scarcely had the lion dragged the arab down from one side than the belgian seizing the pommel of the saddle and the horses mane leaped upon the horses back from the other  a half hour later a naked giant swinging easily through the lower branches of the trees paused and with raised head and dilating nostrils sniffed the morning air  the smell of blood fell strong upon his senses and mingled with it was the scent of numa the lion  the giant cocked his head upon one side and listened  from a short distance up the trail came the unmistakable noises of the greedy feeding of a lion  the crunching of bones the gulping of great pieces the contented growling all attested the nearness of the king at table  tarzan approached the spot still keeping to the branches of the trees he made no effort to conceal his approach and presently he had evidence that numa had heard him from the ominous rumbling warning that broke from a thicket beside the trail  halting upon a low branch just above the lion tarzan looked down upon the grisly scene  could this unrecognizable thing be the man he had been trailing  the apeman wondered  from time to time he had descended to the trail and verified his judgment by the evidence of his scent that the belgian had followed this game trail toward the east  now he proceeded beyond the lion and his feast again descended and examined the ground with his nose  there was no scent spoor here of the man he had been trailing tarzan returned to the tree  with keen eyes he searched the ground about the mutilated corpse for a sign of the missing pouch of pretty pebbles but naught could he see of it  he scolded numa and tried to drive the great beast away but only angry growls rewarded his efforts  he tore small branches from a nearby limb and hurled them at his ancient enemy  numa looked up with bared fangs grinning hideously but he did not rise from his kill  then tarzan fitted an arrow to his bow and drawing the slim shaft far back let drive with all the force of the tough wood that only he could bend  as the arrow sank deeply into his side numa leaped to his feet with a roar of mingled rage and pain  he leaped futilely at the grinning apeman tore at the protruding end of the shaft and then springing into the trail paced back and forth beneath his tormentor again tarzan loosed a swift bolt  this time the missile aimed with care lodged in the lions spine  the great creature halted in its tracks and lurched awkwardly forward upon its face paralyzed  tarzan dropped to the trail ran quickly to the beasts side and drove his spear deep into the fierce heart then after recovering his arrows turned his attention to the mutilated remains of the animals prey in the nearby thicket  the face was gone  the arab garments aroused no doubt as to the mans identity since he had trailed him into the arab camp and out again where he might easily have acquired the apparel  so sure was tarzan that the body was that of he who had robbed him that he made no effort to verify his deductions by scent among the conglomerate odors of the great carnivore and the fresh blood of the victim  he confined his attentions to a careful search for the pouch but nowhere upon or about the corpse was any sign of the missing article or its contents  the apeman was disappointedpossibly not so much because of the loss of the colored pebbles as with numa for robbing him of the pleasures of revenge  wondering what could have become of his possessions the apeman turned slowly back along the trail in the direction from which he had come in his mind he revolved a plan to enter and search the arab camp after darkness had again fallen  taking to the trees he moved directly south in search of prey that he might satisfy his hunger before midday and then lie up for the afternoon in some spot far from the camp where he might sleep without fear of discovery until it came time to prosecute his design  scarcely had he quitted the trail when a tall black warrior moving at a dogged trot passed toward the east  it was mugambi searching for his mistress  he continued along the trail halting to examine the body of the dead lion  an expression of puzzlement crossed his features as he bent to search for the wounds which had caused the death of the jungle lord  tarzan had removed his arrows but to mugambi the proof of death was as strong as though both the lighter missiles and the spear still protruded from the carcass  the black looked furtively about him  the body was still warm and from this fact he reasoned that the killer was close at hand yet no sign of living man appeared  mugambi shook his head and continued along the trail but with redoubled caution  all day he traveled stopping occasionally to call aloud the single word lady in the hope that at last she might hear and respond but in the end his loyal devotion brought him to disaster  from the northeast for several months abdul mourak in command of a detachment of abyssinian soldiers had been assiduously searching for the arab raider achmet zek who six months previously had affronted the majesty of abdul mouraks emperor by conducting a slave raid within the boundaries of meneleks domain  and now it happened that abdul mourak had halted for a short rest at noon upon this very day and along the same trail that werper and mugambi were following toward the east  it was shortly after the soldiers had dismounted that the belgian unaware of their presence rode his tired mount almost into their midst before he had discovered them  instantly he was surrounded and a volley of questions hurled at him as he was pulled from his horse and led toward the presence of the commander  falling back upon his european nationality werper assured abdul mourak that he was a frenchman hunting in africa and that he had been attacked by strangers his safari killed or scattered and himself escaping only by a miracle  from a chance remark of the abyssinian werper discovered the purpose of the expedition and when he realized that these men were the enemies of achmet zek he took heart and immediately blamed his predicament upon the arab  lest however he might again fall into the hands of the raider he discouraged abdul mourak in the further prosecution of his pursuit assuring the abyssinian that achmet zek commanded a large and dangerous force and also that he was marching rapidly toward the south  convinced that it would take a long time to overhaul the raider and that the chances of engagement made the outcome extremely questionable mourak none too unwillingly abandoned his plan and gave the necessary orders for his command to pitch camp where they were preparatory to taking up the return march toward abyssinia the following morning  it was late in the afternoon that the attention of the camp was attracted toward the west by the sound of a powerful voice calling a single word repeated several times lady  lady  lady  true to their instincts of precaution a number of abyssinians acting under orders from abdul mourak advanced stealthily through the jungle toward the author of the call  a half hour later they returned dragging mugambi among them  the first person the big blacks eyes fell upon as he was hustled into the presence of the abyssinian officer was m jules frecoult the frenchman who had been the guest of his master and whom he last had seen entering the village of achmet zek under circumstances which pointed to his familiarity and friendship for the raiders  between the disasters that had befallen his master and his masters house and the frenchman mugambi saw a sinister relationship which kept him from recalling to werpers attention the identity which the latter evidently failed to recognize  pleading that he was but a harmless hunter from a tribe farther south mugambi begged to be allowed to go upon his way but abdul mourak admiring the warriors splendid physique decided to take him back to adis abeba and present him to menelek  a few moments later mugambi and werper were marched away under guard and the belgian learned for the first time that he too was a prisoner rather than a guest  in vain he protested against such treatment until a strapping soldier struck him across the mouth and threatened to shoot him if he did not desist  mugambi took the matter less to heart for he had not the slightest doubt but that during the course of the journey he would find ample opportunity to elude the vigilance of his guards and make good his escape  with this idea always uppermost in his mind he courted the good opinion of the abyssinians asked them many questions about their emperor and their country and evinced a growing desire to reach their destination that he might enjoy all the good things which they assured him the city of adis abeba contained  thus he disarmed their suspicions and each day found a slight relaxation of their watchfulness over him  by taking advantage of the fact that he and werper always were kept together mugambi sought to learn what the other knew of the whereabouts of tarzan or the authorship of the raid upon the bungalow as well as the fate of lady greystoke but as he was confined to the accidents of conversation for this information not daring to acquaint werper with his true identity and as werper was equally anxious to conceal from the world his part in the destruction of his hosts home and happiness mugambi learned nothingat least in this way  but there came a time when he learned a very surprising thing by accident  the party had camped early in the afternoon of a sultry day upon the banks of a clear and beautiful stream  the bottom of the river was gravelly there was no indication of crocodiles those menaces to promiscuous bathing in the rivers of certain portions of the dark continent and so the abyssinians took advantage of the opportunity to perform longdeferred and much needed ablutions  as werper who with mugambi had been given permission to enter the water removed his clothing the black noted the care with which he unfastened something which circled his waist and which he took off with his shirt keeping the latter always around and concealing the object of his suspicious solicitude  it was this very carefulness which attracted the blacks attention to the thing arousing a natural curiosity in the warriors mind and so it chanced that when the belgian in the nervousness of overcaution fumbled the hidden article and dropped it mugambi saw it as it fell upon the ground spilling a portion of its contents on the sward  now mugambi had been to london with his master  he was not the unsophisticated savage that his apparel proclaimed him  he had mingled with the cosmopolitan hordes of the greatest city in the world he had visited museums and inspected shop windows and besides he was a shrewd and intelligent man  the instant that the jewels of opar rolled scintillating before his astonished eyes he recognized them for what they were but he recognized something else too that interested him far more deeply than the value of the stones a thousand times he had seen the leathern pouch which dangled at his masters side when tarzan of the apes had in a spirit of play and adventure elected to return for a few hours to the primitive manners and customs of his boyhood and surrounded by his naked warriors hunt the lion and the leopard the buffalo and the elephant after the manner he loved best  werper saw that mugambi had seen the pouch and the stones  hastily he gathered up the precious gems and returned them to their container while mugambi assuming an air of indifference strolled down to the river for his bath  the following morning abdul mourak was enraged and chagrined to discover that this huge black prisoner had escaped during the night while werper was terrified for the same reason until his trembling fingers discovered the pouch still in its place beneath his shirt and within it the hard outlines of its contents     16  tarzan again leads the mangani   achmet zek with two of his followers had circled far to the south to intercept the flight of his deserting lieutenant werper  others had spread out in various directions so that a vast circle had been formed by them during the night and now they were beating in toward the center  achmet and the two with him halted for a short rest just before noon they squatted beneath the trees upon the southern edge of a clearing the chief of the raiders was in ill humor  to have been outwitted by an unbeliever was bad enough but to have at the same time lost the jewels upon which he had set his avaricious heart was altogether too muchallah must indeed be angry with his servant  well he still had the woman  she would bring a fair price in the north and there was too the buried treasure beside the ruins of the englishmans house  a slight noise in the jungle upon the opposite side of the clearing brought achmet zek to immediate and alert attention  he gathered his rifle in readiness for instant use at the same time motioning his followers to silence and concealment  crouching behind the bushes the three waited their eyes fastened upon the far side of the open space  presently the foliage parted and a womans face appeared glancing fearfully from side to side  a moment later evidently satisfied that no immediate danger lurked before her she stepped out into the clearing in full view of the arab  achmet zek caught his breath with a muttered exclamation of incredulity and an imprecation  the woman was the prisoner he had thought safely guarded at his camp  apparently she was alone but achmet zek waited that he might make sure of it before seizing her  slowly jane clayton started across the clearing  twice already since she had quitted the village of the raiders had she barely escaped the fangs of carnivora and once she had almost stumbled into the path of one of the searchers  though she was almost despairing of ever reaching safety she still was determined to fight on until death or success terminated her endeavors  as the arabs watched her from the safety of their concealment and achmet zek noted with satisfaction that she was walking directly into his clutches another pair of eyes looked down upon the entire scene from the foliage of an adjacent tree  puzzled troubled eyes they were for all their gray and savage glint for their owner was struggling with an intangible suggestion of the familiarity of the face and figure of the woman below him  a sudden crashing of the bushes at the point from which jane clayton had emerged into the clearing brought her to a sudden stop and attracted the attention of the arabs and the watcher in the tree to the same point  the woman wheeled about to see what new danger menaced her from behind and as she did so a great anthropoid ape waddled into view  behind him came another and another but lady greystoke did not wait to learn how many more of the hideous creatures were so close upon her trail  with a smothered scream she rushed toward the opposite jungle and as she reached the bushes there achmet zek and his two henchmen rose up and seized her  at the same instant a naked brown giant dropped from the branches of a tree at the right of the clearing  turning toward the astonished apes he gave voice to a short volley of low gutturals and without waiting to note the effect of his words upon them wheeled and charged for the arabs  achmet zek was dragging jane clayton toward his tethered horse  his two men were hastily unfastening all three mounts  the woman struggling to escape the arab turned and saw the apeman running toward her  a glad light of hope illuminated her face  john she cried  thank god that you have come in time  behind tarzan came the great apes wondering but obedient to his summons  the arabs saw that they would not have time to mount and make their escape before the beasts and the man were upon them  achmet zek recognized the latter as the redoubtable enemy of such as he and he saw too in the circumstance an opportunity to rid himself forever of the menace of the apemans presence  calling to his men to follow his example he raised his rifle and leveled it upon the charging giant  his followers acting with no less alacrity than himself fired almost simultaneously and with the reports of the rifles tarzan of the apes and two of his hairy henchmen pitched forward among the jungle grasses  the noise of the rifle shots brought the balance of the apes to a wondering pause and taking advantage of their momentary distraction achmet zek and his fellows leaped to their horses backs and galloped away with the now hopeless and griefstricken woman  back to the village they rode and once again lady greystoke found herself incarcerated in the filthy little hut from which she had thought to have escaped for good  but this time she was not only guarded by an additional sentry but bound as well  singly and in twos the searchers who had ridden out with achmet zek upon the trail of the belgian returned empty handed  with the report of each the raiders rage and chagrin increased until he was in such a transport of ferocious anger that none dared approach him  threatening and cursing achmet zek paced up and down the floor of his silken tent but his temper served him naughtwerper was gone and with him the fortune in scintillating gems which had aroused the cupidity of his chief and placed the sentence of death upon the head of the lieutenant  with the escape of the arabs the great apes had turned their attention to their fallen comrades  one was dead but another and the great white ape still breathed  the hairy monsters gathered about these two grumbling and muttering after the fashion of their kind  tarzan was the first to regain consciousness  sitting up he looked about him  blood was flowing from a wound in his shoulder  the shock had thrown him down and dazed him but he was far from dead  rising slowly to his feet he let his eyes wander toward the spot where last he had seen the she who had aroused within his savage breast such strange emotions  where is she he asked  the tarmangani took her away replied one of the apes  who are you who speak the language of the mangani  i am tarzan replied the apeman mighty hunter greatest of fighters  when i roar the jungle is silent and trembles with terror i am tarzan of the apes  i have been away but now i have come back to my people  yes spoke up an old ape he is tarzan  i know him  it is well that he has come back  now we shall have good hunting  the other apes came closer and sniffed at the apeman  tarzan stood very still his fangs half bared and his muscles tense and ready for action but there was none there to question his right to be with them and presently the inspection satisfactorily concluded the apes again returned their attention to the other survivor  he too was but slightly wounded a bullet grazing his skull having stunned him so that when he regained consciousness he was apparently as fit as ever  the apes told tarzan that they had been traveling toward the east when the scent spoor of the she had attracted them and they had stalked her now they wished to continue upon their interrupted march but tarzan preferred to follow the arabs and take the woman from them  after a considerable argument it was decided that they should first hunt toward the east for a few days and then return and search for the arabs and as time is of little moment to the ape folk tarzan acceded to their demands he himself having reverted to a mental state but little superior to their own  another circumstance which decided him to postpone pursuit of the arabs was the painfulness of his wound  it would be better to wait until that had healed before he pitted himself again against the guns of the tarmangani  and so as jane clayton was pushed into her prison hut and her hands and feet securely bound her natural protector roamed off toward the east in company with a score of hairy monsters with whom he rubbed shoulders as familiarly as a few months before he had mingled with his immaculate fellowmembers of one of londons most select and exclusive clubs  but all the time there lurked in the back of his injured brain a troublesome conviction that he had no business where he wasthat he should be for some unaccountable reason elsewhere and among another sort of creature  also there was the compelling urge to be upon the scent of the arabs undertaking the rescue of the woman who had appealed so strongly to his savage sentiments though the thoughtword which naturally occurred to him in the contemplation of the venture was capture rather than rescue  to him she was as any other jungle she and he had set his heart upon her as his mate  for an instant as he had approached closer to her in the clearing where the arabs had seized her the subtle aroma which had first aroused his desires in the hut that had imprisoned her had fallen upon his nostrils and told him that he had found the creature for whom he had developed so sudden and inexplicable a passion  the matter of the pouch of jewels also occupied his thoughts to some extent so that he found a double urge for his return to the camp of the raiders  he would obtain possession of both his pretty pebbles and the she  then he would return to the great apes with his new mate and his baubles and leading his hairy companions into a far wilderness beyond the ken of man live out his life hunting and battling among the lower orders after the only manner which he now recollected  he spoke to his fellowapes upon the matter in an attempt to persuade them to accompany him but all except taglat and chulk refused  the latter was young and strong endowed with a greater intelligence than his fellows and therefore the possessor of better developed powers of imagination  to him the expedition savored of adventure and so appealed strongly  with taglat there was another incentivea secret and sinister incentive which had tarzan of the apes had knowledge of it would have sent him at the others throat in jealous rage  taglat was no longer young but he was still a formidable beast mightily muscled cruel and because of his greater experience crafty and cunning  too he was of giant proportions the very weight of his huge bulk serving ofttimes to discount in his favor the superior agility of a younger antagonist  he was of a morose and sullen disposition that marked him even among his frowning fellows where such characteristics are the rule rather than the exception and though tarzan did not guess it he hated the apeman with a ferocity that he was able to hide only because the dominant spirit of the nobler creature had inspired within him a species of dread which was as powerful as it was inexplicable to him  these two then were to be tarzans companions upon his return to the village of achmet zek  as they set off the balance of the tribe vouchsafed them but a parting stare and then resumed the serious business of feeding  tarzan found difficulty in keeping the minds of his fellows set upon the purpose of their adventure for the mind of an ape lacks the power of longsustained concentration  to set out upon a long journey with a definite destination in view is one thing to remember that purpose and keep it uppermost in ones mind continually is quite another there are so many things to distract ones attention along the way  chulk was at first for rushing rapidly ahead as though the village of the raiders lay but an hours march before them instead of several days but within a few minutes a fallen tree attracted his attention with its suggestion of rich and succulent forage beneath and when tarzan missing him returned in search he found chulk squatting beside the rotting bole from beneath which he was assiduously engaged in digging out the grubs and beetles whose kind form a considerable proportion of the diet of the apes  unless tarzan desired to fight there was nothing to do but wait until chulk had exhausted the storehouse and this he did only to discover that taglat was now missing  after a considerable search he found that worthy gentleman contemplating the sufferings of an injured rodent he had pounced upon  he would sit in apparent indifference gazing in another direction while the crippled creature wriggled slowly and painfully away from him and then just as his victim felt assured of escape he would reach out a giant palm and slam it down upon the fugitive  again and again he repeated this operation until tiring of the sport he ended the sufferings of his plaything by devouring it  such were the exasperating causes of delay which retarded tarzans return journey toward the village of achmet zek but the apeman was patient for in his mind was a plan which necessitated the presence of chulk and taglat when he should have arrived at his destination  it was not always an easy thing to maintain in the vacillating minds of the anthropoids a sustained interest in their venture  chulk was wearying of the continued marching and the infrequency and short duration of the rests  he would gladly have abandoned this search for adventure had not tarzan continually filled his mind with alluring pictures of the great stores of food which were to be found in the village of tarmangani  taglat nursed his secret purpose to better advantage than might have been expected of an ape yet there were times when he too would have abandoned the adventure had not tarzan cajoled him on  it was midafternoon of a sultry tropical day when the keen senses of the three warned them of the proximity of the arab camp  stealthily they approached keeping to the dense tangle of growing things which made concealment easy to their uncanny jungle craft  first came the giant apeman his smooth brown skin glistening with the sweat of exertion in the close hot confines of the jungle  behind him crept chulk and taglat grotesque and shaggy caricatures of their godlike leader  silently they made their way to the edge of the clearing which surrounded the palisade and here they clambered into the lower branches of a large tree overlooking the village occupied by the enemy the better to spy upon his goings and comings  a horseman white burnoosed rode out through the gateway of the village  tarzan whispering to chulk and taglat to remain where they were swung monkeylike through the trees in the direction of the trail the arab was riding  from one jungle giant to the next he sped with the rapidity of a squirrel and the silence of a ghost  the arab rode slowly onward unconscious of the danger hovering in the trees behind him  the apeman made a slight detour and increased his speed until he had reached a point upon the trail in advance of the horseman  here he halted upon a leafy bough which overhung the narrow jungle trail on came the victim humming a wild air of the great desert land of the north  above him poised the savage brute that was today bent upon the destruction of a human lifethe same creature who a few months before had occupied his seat in the house of lords at london a respected and distinguished member of that august body  the arab passed beneath the overhanging bough there was a slight rustling of the leaves above the horse snorted and plunged as a brownskinned creature dropped upon its rump  a pair of mighty arms encircled the arab and he was dragged from his saddle to the trail  ten minutes later the apeman carrying the outer garments of an arab bundled beneath an arm rejoined his companions  he exhibited his trophies to them explaining in low gutturals the details of his exploit  chulk and taglat fingered the fabrics smelled of them and placing them to their ears tried to listen to them  then tarzan led them back through the jungle to the trail where the three hid themselves and waited  nor had they long to wait before two of achmet zeks blacks clothed in habiliments similar to their masters came down the trail on foot returning to the camp  one moment they were laughing and talking togetherthe next they lay stretched in death upon the trail three mighty engines of destruction bending over them  tarzan removed their outer garments as he had removed those of his first victim and again retired with chulk and taglat to the greater seclusion of the tree they had first selected  here the apeman arranged the garments upon his shaggy fellows and himself until at a distance it might have appeared that three whiterobed arabs squatted silently among the branches of the forest  until dark they remained where they were for from his point of vantage tarzan could view the enclosure within the palisade  he marked the position of the hut in which he had first discovered the scent spoor of the she he sought  he saw the two sentries standing before its doorway and he located the habitation of achmet zek where something told him he would most likely find the missing pouch and pebbles  chulk and taglat were at first greatly interested in their wonderful raiment  they fingered the fabric smelled of it and regarded each other intently with every mark of satisfaction and pride  chulk a humorist in his way stretched forth a long and hairy arm and grasping the hood of taglats burnoose pulled it down over the latters eyes extinguishing him snufferlike as it were  the older ape pessimistic by nature recognized no such thing as humor  creatures laid their paws upon him for but two thingsto search for fleas and to attack  the pulling of the tarmanganiscented thing about his head and eyes could not be for the performance of the former act therefore it must be the latter  he was attacked  chulk had attacked him  with a snarl he was at the others throat not even waiting to lift the woolen veil which obscured his vision  tarzan leaped upon the two and swaying and toppling upon their insecure perch the three great beasts tussled and snapped at one another until the apeman finally succeeded in separating the enraged anthropoids  an apology is unknown to these savage progenitors of man and explanation a laborious and usually futile process tarzan bridged the dangerous gulf by distracting their attention from their altercation to a consideration of their plans for the immediate future  accustomed to frequent arguments in which more hair than blood is wasted the apes speedily forget such trivial encounters and presently chulk and taglat were again squatting in close proximity to each other and peaceful repose awaiting the moment when the apeman should lead them into the village of the tarmangani  it was long after darkness had fallen that tarzan led his companions from their hiding place in the tree to the ground and around the palisade to the far side of the village  gathering the skirts of his burnoose beneath one arm that his legs might have free action the apeman took a short running start and scrambled to the top of the barrier  fearing lest the apes should rend their garments to shreds in a similar attempt he had directed them to wait below for him and himself securely perched upon the summit of the palisade he unslung his spear and lowered one end of it to chulk  the ape seized it and while tarzan held tightly to the upper end the anthropoid climbed quickly up the shaft until with one paw he grasped the top of the wall  to scramble then to tarzans side was the work of but an instant  in like manner taglat was conducted to their sides and a moment later the three dropped silently within the enclosure  tarzan led them first to the rear of the hut in which jane clayton was confined where through the roughly repaired aperture in the wall he sought with his sensitive nostrils for proof that the she he had come for was within  chulk and taglat their hairy faces pressed close to that of the patrician sniffed with him  each caught the scent spoor of the woman within and each reacted according to his temperament and his habits of thought  it left chulk indifferent  the she was for tarzanall that he desired was to bury his snout in the foodstuffs of the tarmangani  he had come to eat his fill without labortarzan had told him that that should be his reward and he was satisfied  but taglats wicked bloodshot eyes narrowed to the realization of the nearing fulfillment of his carefully nursed plan  it is true that sometimes during the several days that had elapsed since they had set out upon their expedition it had been difficult for taglat to hold his idea uppermost in his mind and on several occasions he had completely forgotten it until tarzan by a chance word had recalled it to him but for an ape taglat had done well  now he licked his chops and he made a sickening sucking noise with his flabby lips as he drew in his breath  satisfied that the she was where he had hoped to find her tarzan led his apes toward the tent of achmet zek  a passing arab and two slaves saw them but the night was dark and the white burnooses hid the hairy limbs of the apes and the giant figure of their leader so that the three by squatting down as though in conversation were passed by unsuspected  to the rear of the tent they made their way  within achmet zek conversed with several of his lieutenants  without tarzan listened     17  the deadly peril of jane clayton   lieutenant albert werper terrified by contemplation of the fate which might await him at adis abeba cast about for some scheme of escape but after the black mugambi had eluded their vigilance the abyssinians redoubled their precautions to prevent werper following the lead of the negro  for some time werper entertained the idea of bribing abdul mourak with a portion of the contents of the pouch but fearing that the man would demand all the gems as the price of liberty the belgian influenced by avarice sought another avenue from his dilemma  it was then that there dawned upon him the possibility of the success of a different course which would still leave him in possession of the jewels while at the same time satisfying the greed of the abyssinian with the conviction that he had obtained all that werper had to offer  and so it was that a day or so after mugambi had disappeared werper asked for an audience with abdul mourak  as the belgian entered the presence of his captor the scowl upon the features of the latter boded ill for any hope which werper might entertain still he fortified himself by recalling the common weakness of mankind which permits the most inflexible of natures to bend to the consuming desire for wealth  abdul mourak eyed him frowningly  what do you want now he asked  my liberty replied werper  the abyssinian sneered  and you disturbed me thus to tell me what any fool might know he said  i can pay for it said werper  abdul mourak laughed loudly  pay for it he cried  what withthe rags that you have upon your back  or perhaps you are concealing beneath your coat a thousand pounds of ivory  get out  you are a fool  do not bother me again or i shall have you whipped  but werper persisted  his liberty and perhaps his life depended upon his success  listen to me he pleaded  if i can give you as much gold as ten men may carry will you promise that i shall be conducted in safety to the nearest english commissioner  as much gold as ten men may carry repeated abdul mourak  you are crazy  where have you so much gold as that  i know where it is hid said werper  promise and i will lead you to itif ten loads is enough  abdul mourak had ceased to laugh  he was eyeing the belgian intently the fellow seemed sane enoughyet ten loads of gold  it was preposterous  the abyssinian thought in silence for a moment  well and if i promise he said  how far is this gold  a long weeks march to the south replied werper  and if we do not find it where you say it is do you realize what your punishment will be  if it is not there i will forfeit my life replied the belgian  i know it is there for i saw it buried with my own eyes  and morethere are not only ten loads but as many as fifty men may carry it is all yours if you will promise to see me safely delivered into the protection of the english  you will stake your life against the finding of the gold asked abdul  werper assented with a nod  very well said the abyssinian i promise and even if there be but five loads you shall have your freedom but until the gold is in my possession you remain a prisoner  i am satisfied said werper  tomorrow we start  abdul mourak nodded and the belgian returned to his guards  the following day the abyssinian soldiers were surprised to receive an order which turned their faces from the northeast to the south  and so it happened that upon the very night that tarzan and the two apes entered the village of the raiders the abyssinians camped but a few miles to the east of the same spot  while werper dreamed of freedom and the unmolested enjoyment of the fortune in his stolen pouch and abdul mourak lay awake in greedy contemplation of the fifty loads of gold which lay but a few days farther to the south of him achmet zek gave orders to his lieutenants that they should prepare a force of fighting men and carriers to proceed to the ruins of the englishmans douar on the morrow and bring back the fabulous fortune which his renegade lieutenant had told him was buried there  and as he delivered his instructions to those within a silent listener crouched without his tent waiting for the time when he might enter in safety and prosecute his search for the missing pouch and the pretty pebbles that had caught his fancy  at last the swarthy companions of achmet zek quitted his tent and the leader went with them to smoke a pipe with one of their number leaving his own silken habitation unguarded  scarcely had they left the interior when a knife blade was thrust through the fabric of the rear wall some six feet above the ground and a swift downward stroke opened an entrance to those who waited beyond  through the opening stepped the apeman and close behind him came the huge chulk but taglat did not follow them  instead he turned and slunk through the darkness toward the hut where the she who had arrested his brutish interest lay securely bound  before the doorway the sentries sat upon their haunches conversing in monotones  within the young woman lay upon a filthy sleeping mat resigned through utter hopelessness to whatever fate lay in store for her until the opportunity arrived which would permit her to free herself by the only means which now seemed even remotely possiblethe hitherto detested act of selfdestruction  creeping silently toward the sentries a whiteburnoosed figure approached the shadows at one end of the hut  the meager intellect of the creature denied it the advantage it might have taken of its disguise  where it could have walked boldly to the very sides of the sentries it chose rather to sneak upon them unseen from the rear  it came to the corner of the hut and peered around  the sentries were but a few paces away but the ape did not dare expose himself even for an instant to those feared and hated thundersticks which the tarmangani knew so well how to use if there were another and safer method of attack  taglat wished that there was a tree nearby from the overhanging branches of which he might spring upon his unsuspecting prey but though there was no tree the idea gave birth to a plan  the eaves of the hut were just above the heads of the sentriesfrom them he could leap upon the tarmangani unseen  a quick snap of those mighty jaws would dispose of one of them before the other realized that they were attacked and the second would fall an easy prey to the strength agility and ferocity of a second quick charge  taglat withdrew a few paces to the rear of the hut gathered himself for the effort ran quickly forward and leaped high into the air  he struck the roof directly above the rear wall of the hut and the structure reinforced by the wall beneath held his enormous weight for an instant then he moved forward a step the roof sagged the thatching parted and the great anthropoid shot through into the interior  the sentries hearing the crashing of the roof poles leaped to their feet and rushed into the hut  jane clayton tried to roll aside as the great form lit upon the floor so close to her that one foot pinned her clothing to the ground  the ape feeling the movement beside him reached down and gathered the girl in the hollow of one mighty arm  the burnoose covered the hairy body so that jane clayton believed that a human arm supported her and from the extremity of hopelessness a great hope sprang into her breast that at last she was in the keeping of a rescuer  the two sentries were now within the hut but hesitating because of doubt as to the nature of the cause of the disturbance  their eyes not yet accustomed to the darkness of the interior told them nothing nor did they hear any sound for the ape stood silently awaiting their attack  seeing that they stood without advancing and realizing that handicapped as he was by the weight of the she he could put up but a poor battle taglat elected to risk a sudden break for liberty lowering his head he charged straight for the two sentries who blocked the doorway  the impact of his mighty shoulders bowled them over upon their backs and before they could scramble to their feet the ape was gone darting in the shadows of the huts toward the palisade at the far end of the village  the speed and strength of her rescuer filled jane clayton with wonder could it be that tarzan had survived the bullet of the arab  who else in all the jungle could bear the weight of a grown woman as lightly as he who held her  she spoke his name but there was no response  still she did not give up hope  at the palisade the beast did not even hesitate  a single mighty leap carried it to the top where it poised but for an instant before dropping to the ground upon the opposite side  now the girl was almost positive that she was safe in the arms of her husband and when the ape took to the trees and bore her swiftly into the jungle as tarzan had done at other times in the past belief became conviction  in a little moonlit glade a mile or so from the camp of the raiders her rescuer halted and dropped her to the ground  his roughness surprised her but still she had no doubts  again she called him by name and at the same instant the ape fretting under the restraints of the unaccustomed garments of the tarmangani tore the burnoose from him revealing to the eyes of the horrorstruck woman the hideous face and hairy form of a giant anthropoid  with a piteous wail of terror jane clayton swooned while from the concealment of a nearby bush numa the lion eyed the pair hungrily and licked his chops   tarzan entering the tent of achmet zek searched the interior thoroughly  he tore the bed to pieces and scattered the contents of box and bag about the floor  he investigated whatever his eyes discovered nor did those keen organs overlook a single article within the habitation of the raider chief but no pouch or pretty pebbles rewarded his thoroughness  satisfied at last that his belongings were not in the possession of achmet zek unless they were on the person of the chief himself tarzan decided to secure the person of the she before further prosecuting his search for the pouch  motioning for chulk to follow him he passed out of the tent by the same way that he had entered it and walking boldly through the village made directly for the hut where jane clayton had been imprisoned  he noted with surprise the absence of taglat whom he had expected to find awaiting him outside the tent of achmet zek but accustomed as he was to the unreliability of apes he gave no serious attention to the present defection of his surly companion  so long as taglat did not cause interference with his plans tarzan was indifferent to his absence  as he approached the hut the apeman noticed that a crowd had collected about the entrance  he could see that the men who composed it were much excited and fearing lest chulks disguise should prove inadequate to the concealment of his true identity in the face of so many observers he commanded the ape to betake himself to the far end of the village and there await him  as chulk waddled off keeping to the shadows tarzan advanced boldly toward the excited group before the doorway of the hut  he mingled with the blacks and the arabs in an endeavor to learn the cause of the commotion in his interest forgetting that he alone of the assemblage carried a spear a bow and arrows and thus might become an object of suspicious attention  shouldering his way through the crowd he approached the doorway and had almost reached it when one of the arabs laid a hand upon his shoulder crying who is this at the same time snatching back the hood from the apemans face  tarzan of the apes in all his savage life had never been accustomed to pause in argument with an antagonist  the primitive instinct of selfpreservation acknowledges many arts and wiles but argument is not one of them nor did he now waste precious time in an attempt to convince the raiders that he was not a wolf in sheeps clothing instead he had his unmasker by the throat ere the mans words had scarce quitted his lips and hurling him from side to side brushed away those who would have swarmed upon him  using the arab as a weapon tarzan forced his way quickly to the doorway and a moment later was within the hut  a hasty examination revealed the fact that it was empty and his sense of smell discovered too the scent spoor of taglat the ape  tarzan uttered a low ominous growl  those who were pressing forward at the doorway to seize him fell back as the savage notes of the bestial challenge smote upon their ears  they looked at one another in surprise and consternation  a man had entered the hut alone and yet with their own ears they had heard the voice of a wild beast within  what could it mean  had a lion or a leopard sought sanctuary in the interior unbeknown to the sentries  tarzans quick eyes discovered the opening in the roof through which taglat had fallen  he guessed that the ape had either come or gone by way of the break and while the arabs hesitated without he sprang catlike for the opening grasped the top of the wall and clambered out upon the roof dropping instantly to the ground at the rear of the hut  when the arabs finally mustered courage to enter the hut after firing several volleys through the walls they found the interior deserted at the same time tarzan at the far end of the village sought for chulk but the ape was nowhere to be found  robbed of his she deserted by his companions and as much in ignorance as ever as to the whereabouts of his pouch and pebbles it was an angry tarzan who climbed the palisade and vanished into the darkness of the jungle  for the present he must give up the search for his pouch since it would be paramount to selfdestruction to enter the arab camp now while all its inhabitants were aroused and upon the alert  in his escape from the village the apeman had lost the spoor of the fleeing taglat and now he circled widely through the forest in an endeavor to again pick it up  chulk had remained at his post until the cries and shots of the arabs had filled his simple soul with terror for above all things the ape folk fear the thundersticks of the tarmangani then he had clambered nimbly over the palisade tearing his burnoose in the effort and fled into the depths of the jungle grumbling and scolding as he went  tarzan roaming the jungle in search of the trail of taglat and the she traveled swiftly  in a little moonlit glade ahead of him the great ape was bending over the prostrate form of the woman tarzan sought  the beast was tearing at the bonds that confined her ankles and wrists pulling and gnawing upon the cords  the course the apeman was taking would carry him but a short distance to the right of them and though he could not have seen them the wind was bearing down from them to him carrying their scent spoor strongly toward him  a moment more and jane claytons safety might have been assured even though numa the lion was already gathering himself in preparation for a charge but fate already all too cruel now outdid herselfthe wind veered suddenly for a few moments the scent spoor that would have led the apeman to the girls side was wafted in the opposite direction tarzan passed within fifty yards of the tragedy that was being enacted in the glade and the opportunity was gone beyond recall     18  the fight for the treasure   it was morning before tarzan could bring himself to a realization of the possibility of failure of his quest and even then he would only admit that success was but delayed  he would eat and sleep and then set forth again  the jungle was wide but wide too were the experience and cunning of tarzan  taglat might travel far but tarzan would find him in the end though he had to search every tree in the mighty forest  soliloquizing thus the apeman followed the spoor of bara the deer the unfortunate upon which he had decided to satisfy his hunger  for half an hour the trail led the apeman toward the east along a wellmarked game path when suddenly to the stalkers astonishment the quarry broke into sight racing madly back along the narrow way straight toward the hunter  tarzan who had been following along the trail leaped so quickly to the concealing verdure at the side that the deer was still unaware of the presence of an enemy in this direction and while the animal was still some distance away the apeman swung into the lower branches of the tree which overhung the trail  there he crouched a savage beast of prey awaiting the coming of its victim  what had frightened the deer into so frantic a retreat tarzan did not knownuma the lion perhaps or sheeta the panther but whatsoever it was mattered little to tarzan of the apeshe was ready and willing to defend his kill against any other denizen of the jungle  if he were unable to do it by means of physical prowess he had at his command another and a greater powerhis shrewd intelligence  and so on came the running deer straight into the jaws of death  the apeman turned so that his back was toward the approaching animal  he poised with bent knees upon the gently swaying limb above the trail timing with keen ears the nearing hoof beats of frightened bara  in a moment the victim flashed beneath the limb and at the same instant the apeman above sprang out and down upon its back  the weight of the mans body carried the deer to the ground  it stumbled forward once in a futile effort to rise and then mighty muscles dragged its head far back gave the neck a vicious wrench and bara was dead  quick had been the killing and equally quick were the apemans subsequent actions for who might know what manner of killer pursued bara or how close at hand he might be  scarce had the neck of the victim snapped than the carcass was hanging over one of tarzans broad shoulders and an instant later the apeman was perched once more among the lower branches of a tree above the trail his keen gray eyes scanning the pathway down which the deer had fled  nor was it long before the cause of baras fright became evident to tarzan for presently came the unmistakable sounds of approaching horsemen  dragging his kill after him the apeman ascended to the middle terrace and settling himself comfortably in the crotch of a tree where he could still view the trail beneath cut a juicy steak from the deers loin and burying his strong white teeth in the hot flesh proceeded to enjoy the fruits of his prowess and his cunning  nor did he neglect the trail beneath while he satisfied his hunger his sharp eyes saw the muzzle of the leading horse as it came into view around a bend in the tortuous trail and one by one they scrutinized the riders as they passed beneath him in single file  among them came one whom tarzan recognized but so schooled was the apeman in the control of his emotions that no slightest change of expression much less any hysterical demonstration that might have revealed his presence betrayed the fact of his inward excitement  beneath him as unconscious of his presence as were the abyssinians before and behind him rode albert werper while the apeman scrutinized the belgian for some sign of the pouch which he had stolen  as the abyssinians rode toward the south a giant figure hovered ever upon their traila huge almost naked white man who carried the bloody carcass of a deer upon his shoulders for tarzan knew that he might not have another opportunity to hunt for some time if he were to follow the belgian  to endeavor to snatch him from the midst of the armed horsemen not even tarzan would attempt other than in the last extremity for the way of the wild is the way of caution and cunning unless they be aroused to rashness by pain or anger  so the abyssinians and the belgian marched southward and tarzan of the apes swung silently after them through the swaying branches of the middle terrace  a two days march brought them to a level plain beyond which lay mountainsa plain which tarzan remembered and which aroused within him vague half memories and strange longings  out upon the plain the horsemen rode and at a safe distance behind them crept the apeman taking advantage of such cover as the ground afforded  beside a charred pile of timbers the abyssinians halted and tarzan sneaking close and concealing himself in nearby shrubbery watched them in wonderment  he saw them digging up the earth and he wondered if they had hidden meat there in the past and now had come for it  then he recalled how he had buried his pretty pebbles and the suggestion that had caused him to do it  they were digging for the things the blacks had buried here  presently he saw them uncover a dirty yellow object and he witnessed the joy of werper and of abdul mourak as the grimy object was exposed to view  one by one they unearthed many similar pieces all of the same uniform dirty yellow until a pile of them lay upon the ground a pile which abdul mourak fondled and petted in an ecstasy of greed  something stirred in the apemans mind as he looked long upon the golden ingots  where had he seen such before  what were they  why did these tarmangani covet them so greatly  to whom did they belong  he recalled the black men who had buried them  the things must be theirs  werper was stealing them as he had stolen tarzans pouch of pebbles  the apemans eyes blazed in anger  he would like to find the black men and lead them against these thieves  he wondered where their village might be  as all these things ran through the active mind a party of men moved out of the forest at the edge of the plain and advanced toward the ruins of the burned bungalow  abdul mourak always watchful was the first to see them but already they were halfway across the open  he called to his men to mount and hold themselves in readiness for in the heart of africa who may know whether a strange host be friend or foe  werper swinging into his saddle fastened his eyes upon the newcomers then white and trembling he turned toward abdul mourak  it is achmet zek and his raiders he whispered  they are come for the gold  it must have been at about the same instant that achmet zek discovered the pile of yellow ingots and realized the actuality of what he had already feared since first his eyes had alighted upon the party beside the ruins of the englishmans bungalow  someone had forestalled himanother had come for the treasure ahead of him  the arab was crazed by rage  recently everything had gone against him he had lost the jewels the belgian and for the second time he had lost the englishwoman  now some one had come to rob him of this treasure which he had thought as safe from disturbance here as though it never had been mined  he cared not whom the thieves might be  they would not give up the gold without a battle of that he was certain and with a wild whoop and a command to his followers achmet zek put spurs to his horse and dashed down upon the abyssinians and after him waving their long guns above their heads yelling and cursing came his motley horde of cutthroat followers  the men of abdul mourak met them with a volley which emptied a few saddles and then the raiders were among them and sword pistol and musket each was doing its most hideous and bloody work  achmet zek spying werper at the first charge bore down upon the belgian and the latter terrified by contemplation of the fate he deserved turned his horses head and dashed madly away in an effort to escape  shouting to a lieutenant to take command and urging him upon pain of death to dispatch the abyssinians and bring the gold back to his camp achmet zek set off across the plain in pursuit of the belgian his wicked nature unable to forego the pleasures of revenge even at the risk of sacrificing the treasure  as the pursued and the pursuer raced madly toward the distant forest the battle behind them raged with bloody savageness  no quarter was asked or given by either the ferocious abyssinians or the murderous cutthroats of achmet zek  from the concealment of the shrubbery tarzan watched the sanguinary conflict which so effectually surrounded him that he found no loophole through which he might escape to follow werper and the arab chief  the abyssinians were formed in a circle which included tarzans position and around and into them galloped the yelling raiders now darting away now charging in to deliver thrusts and cuts with their curved swords  numerically the men of achmet zek were superior and slowly but surely the soldiers of menelek were being exterminated  to tarzan the result was immaterial  he watched with but a single purposeto escape the ring of bloodmad fighters and be away after the belgian and his pouch  when he had first discovered werper upon the trail where he had slain bara he had thought that his eyes must be playing him false so certain had he been that the thief had been slain and devoured by numa but after following the detachment for two days with his keen eyes always upon the belgian he no longer doubted the identity of the man though he was put to it to explain the identity of the mutilated corpse he had supposed was the man he sought  as he crouched in hiding among the unkempt shrubbery which so short a while since had been the delight and pride of the wife he no longer recalled an arab and an abyssinian wheeled their mounts close to his position as they slashed at each other with their swords  step by step the arab beat back his adversary until the latters horse all but trod upon the apeman and then a vicious cut clove the black warriors skull and the corpse toppled backward almost upon tarzan  as the abyssinian tumbled from his saddle the possibility of escape which was represented by the riderless horse electrified the apeman to instant action  before the frightened beast could gather himself for flight a naked giant was astride his back  a strong hand had grasped his bridle rein and the surprised arab discovered a new foe in the saddle of him whom he had slain  but this enemy wielded no sword and his spear and bow remained upon his back  the arab recovered from his first surprise dashed in with raised sword to annihilate this presumptuous stranger  he aimed a mighty blow at the apemans head a blow which swung harmlessly through thin air as tarzan ducked from its path and then the arab felt the others horse brushing his leg a great arm shot out and encircled his waist and before he could recover himself he was dragged from his saddle and forming a shield for his antagonist was borne at a mad run straight through the encircling ranks of his fellows  just beyond them he was tossed aside upon the ground and the last he saw of his strange foeman the latter was galloping off across the plain in the direction of the forest at its farther edge  for another hour the battle raged nor did it cease until the last of the abyssinians lay dead upon the ground or had galloped off toward the north in flight  but a handful of men escaped among them abdul mourak  the victorious raiders collected about the pile of golden ingots which the abyssinians had uncovered and there awaited the return of their leader  their exultation was slightly tempered by the glimpse they had had of the strange apparition of the naked white man galloping away upon the horse of one of their foemen and carrying a companion who was now among them expatiating upon the superhuman strength of the apeman none of them there but was familiar with the name and fame of tarzan of the apes and the fact that they had recognized the white giant as the ferocious enemy of the wrongdoers of the jungle added to their terror for they had been assured that tarzan was dead  naturally superstitious they fully believed that they had seen the disembodied spirit of the dead man and now they cast fearful glances about them in expectation of the ghosts early return to the scene of the ruin they had inflicted upon him during their recent raid upon his home and discussed in affrighted whispers the probable nature of the vengeance which the spirit would inflict upon them should he return to find them in possession of his gold  as they conversed their terror grew while from the concealment of the reeds along the river below them a small party of naked black warriors watched their every move  from the heights beyond the river these black men had heard the noise of the conflict and creeping warily down to the stream had forded it and advanced through the reeds until they were in a position to watch every move of the combatants  for a half hour the raiders awaited achmet zeks return their fear of the earlier return of the ghost of tarzan constantly undermining their loyalty to and fear of their chief  finally one among them voiced the desires of all when he announced that he intended riding forth toward the forest in search of achmet zek  instantly every man of them sprang to his mount  the gold will be safe here cried one  we have killed the abyssinians and there are no others to carry it away  let us ride in search of achmet zek  and a moment later amidst a cloud of dust the raiders were galloping madly across the plain and out from the concealment of the reeds along the river crept a party of black warriors toward the spot where the golden ingots of opar lay piled on the ground  werper had still been in advance of achmet zek when he reached the forest but the latter better mounted was gaining upon him  riding with the reckless courage of desperation the belgian urged his mount to greater speed even within the narrow confines of the winding game trail that the beast was following  behind him he could hear the voice of achmet zek crying to him to halt but werper only dug the spurs deeper into the bleeding sides of his panting mount  two hundred yards within the forest a broken branch lay across the trail  it was a small thing that a horse might ordinarily take in his natural stride without noticing its presence but werpers horse was jaded his feet were heavy with weariness and as the branch caught between his front legs he stumbled was unable to recover himself and went down sprawling in the trail  werper going over his head rolled a few yards farther on scrambled to his feet and ran back  seizing the reins he tugged to drag the beast to his feet but the animal would not or could not rise and as the belgian cursed and struck at him achmet zek appeared in view  instantly the belgian ceased his efforts with the dying animal at his feet and seizing his rifle dropped behind the horse and fired at the oncoming arab  his bullet going low struck achmet zeks horse in the breast bringing him down a hundred yards from where werper lay preparing to fire a second shot  the arab who had gone down with his mount was standing astride him and seeing the belgians strategic position behind his fallen horse lost no time in taking up a similar one behind his own  and there the two lay alternately firing at and cursing each other while from behind the arab tarzan of the apes approached to the edge of the forest  here he heard the occasional shots of the duelists and choosing the safer and swifter avenue of the forest branches to the uncertain transportation afforded by a halfbroken abyssinian pony took to the trees  keeping to one side of the trail the apeman came presently to a point where he could look down in comparative safety upon the fighters first one and then the other would partially raise himself above his breastwork of horseflesh fire his weapon and immediately drop flat behind his shelter where he would reload and repeat the act a moment later  werper had but little ammunition having been hastily armed by abdul mourak from the body of one of the first of the abyssinians who had fallen in the fight about the pile of ingots and now he realized that soon he would have used his last bullet and be at the mercy of the araba mercy with which he was well acquainted  facing both death and despoilment of his treasure the belgian cast about for some plan of escape and the only one that appealed to him as containing even a remote possibility of success hinged upon the chance of bribing achmet zek  werper had fired all but a single cartridge when during a lull in the fighting he called aloud to his opponent  achmet zek he cried allah alone knows which one of us may leave our bones to rot where he lies upon this trail today if we keep up our foolish battle  you wish the contents of the pouch i wear about my waist and i wish my life and my liberty even more than i do the jewels  let us each then take that which he most desires and go our separate ways in peace  i will lay the pouch upon the carcass of my horse where you may see it and you in turn will lay your gun upon your horse with butt toward me  then i will go away leaving the pouch to you and you will let me go in safety  i want only my life and my freedom  the arab thought in silence for a moment  then he spoke his reply was influenced by the fact that he had expended his last shot  go your way then he growled leaving the pouch in plain sight behind you  see i lay my gun thus with the butt toward you  go  werper removed the pouch from about his waist  sorrowfully and affectionately he let his fingers press the hard outlines of the contents  ah if he could extract a little handful of the precious stones  but achmet zek was standing now his eagle eyes commanding a plain view of the belgian and his every act  regretfully werper laid the pouch its contents undisturbed upon the body of his horse rose and taking his rifle with him backed slowly down the trail until a turn hid him from the view of the watchful arab  even then achmet zek did not advance fearful as he was of some such treachery as he himself might have been guilty of under like circumstances nor were his suspicions groundless for the belgian no sooner had he passed out of the range of the arabs vision halted behind the bole of a tree where he still commanded an unobstructed view of his dead horse and the pouch and raising his rifle covered the spot where the others body must appear when he came forward to seize the treasure  but achmet zek was no fool to expose himself to the blackened honor of a thief and a murderer  taking his long gun with him he left the trail entering the rank and tangled vegetation which walled it and crawling slowly forward on hands and knees he paralleled the trail but never for an instant was his body exposed to the rifle of the hidden assassin  thus achmet zek advanced until he had come opposite the dead horse of his enemy  the pouch lay there in full view while a short distance along the trail werper waited in growing impatience and nervousness wondering why the arab did not come to claim his reward  presently he saw the muzzle of a rifle appear suddenly and mysteriously a few inches above the pouch and before he could realize the cunning trick that the arab had played upon him the sight of the weapon was adroitly hooked into the rawhide thong which formed the carrying strap of the pouch and the latter was drawn quickly from his view into the dense foliage at the trails side  not for an instant had the raider exposed a square inch of his body and werper dared not fire his one remaining shot unless every chance of a successful hit was in his favor  chuckling to himself achmet zek withdrew a few paces farther into the jungle for he was as positive that werper was waiting nearby for a chance to pot him as though his eyes had penetrated the jungle trees to the figure of the hiding belgian fingering his rifle behind the bole of the buttressed giant  werper did not dare advancehis cupidity would not permit him to depart and so he stood there his rifle ready in his hands his eyes watching the trail before him with catlike intensity  but there was another who had seen the pouch and recognized it who did advance with achmet zek hovering above him as silent and as sure as death itself and as the arab finding a little spot less overgrown with bushes than he had yet encountered prepared to gloat his eyes upon the contents of the pouch tarzan paused directly above him intent upon the same object  wetting his thin lips with his tongue achmet zek loosened the tie strings which closed the mouth of the pouch and cupping one clawlike hand poured forth a portion of the contents into his palm  a single look he took at the stones lying in his hand  his eyes narrowed a curse broke from his lips and he hurled the small objects upon the ground disdainfully  quickly he emptied the balance of the contents until he had scanned each separate stone and as he dumped them all upon the ground and stamped upon them his rage grew until the muscles of his face worked in demonlike fury and his fingers clenched until his nails bit into the flesh  above tarzan watched in wonderment  he had been curious to discover what all the powwow about his pouch had meant  he wanted to see what the arab would do after the other had gone away leaving the pouch behind him and having satisfied his curiosity he would then have pounced upon achmet zek and taken the pouch and his pretty pebbles away from him for did they not belong to tarzan  he saw the arab now throw aside the empty pouch and grasping his long gun by the barrel clublike sneak stealthily through the jungle beside the trail along which werper had gone  as the man disappeared from his view tarzan dropped to the ground and commenced gathering up the spilled contents of the pouch and the moment that he obtained his first near view of the scattered pebbles he understood the rage of the arab for instead of the glittering and scintillating gems which had first caught and held the attention of the apeman the pouch now contained but a collection of ordinary river pebbles     19  jane clayton and the beasts of the jungle   mugambi after his successful break for liberty had fallen upon hard times  his way had led him through a country with which he was unfamiliar a jungle country in which he could find no water and but little food so that after several days of wandering he found himself so reduced in strength that he could barely drag himself along  it was with growing difficulty that he found the strength necessary to construct a shelter by night wherein he might be reasonably safe from the large carnivora and by day he still further exhausted his strength in digging for edible roots and searching for water  a few stagnant pools at considerable distances apart saved him from death by thirst but his was a pitiable state when finally he stumbled by accident upon a large river in a country where fruit was abundant and small game which he might bag by means of a combination of stealth cunning and a crude knobstick which he had fashioned from a fallen limb  realizing that he still had a long march ahead of him before he could reach even the outskirts of the waziri country mugambi wisely decided to remain where he was until he had recuperated his strength and health  a few days rest would accomplish wonders for him he knew and he could ill afford to sacrifice his chances for a safe return by setting forth handicapped by weakness  and so it was that he constructed a substantial thorn boma and rigged a thatched shelter within it where he might sleep by night in security and from which he sallied forth by day to hunt the flesh which alone could return to his giant thews their normal prowess  one day as he hunted a pair of savage eyes discovered him from the concealment of the branches of a great tree beneath which the black warrior passed  bloodshot wicked eyes they were set in a fierce and hairy face  they watched mugambi make his little kill of a small rodent and they followed him as he returned to his hut their owner moving quietly through the trees upon the trail of the negro  the creature was chulk and he looked down upon the unconscious man more in curiosity than in hate  the wearing of the arab burnoose which tarzan had placed upon his person had aroused in the mind of the anthropoid a desire for similar mimicry of the tarmangani  the burnoose though had obstructed his movements and proven such a nuisance that the ape had long since torn it from him and thrown it away  now however he saw a gomangani arrayed in less cumbersome apparela loin cloth a few copper ornaments and a feather headdress  these were more in line with chulks desires than a flowing robe which was constantly getting between ones legs and catching upon every limb and bush along the leafy trail  chulk eyed the pouch which suspended over mugambis shoulder swung beside his black hip  this took his fancy for it was ornamented with feathers and a fringe and so the ape hung about mugambis boma waiting an opportunity to seize either by stealth or might some object of the blacks apparel  nor was it long before the opportunity came  feeling safe within his thorny enclosure mugambi was wont to stretch himself in the shade of his shelter during the heat of the day and sleep in peaceful security until the declining sun carried with it the enervating temperature of midday  watching from above chulk saw the black warrior stretched thus in the unconsciousness of sleep one sultry afternoon  creeping out upon an overhanging branch the anthropoid dropped to the ground within the boma  he approached the sleeper upon padded feet which gave forth no sound and with an uncanny woodcraft that rustled not a leaf or a grass blade  pausing beside the man the ape bent over and examined his belongings great as was the strength of chulk there lay in the back of his little brain a something which deterred him from arousing the man to combata sense that is inherent in all the lower orders a strange fear of man that rules even the most powerful of the jungle creatures at times  to remove mugambis loin cloth without awakening him would be impossible and the only detachable things were the knobstick and the pouch which had fallen from the blacks shoulder as he rolled in sleep  seizing these two articles as better than nothing at all chulk retreated with haste and every indication of nervous terror to the safety of the tree from which he had dropped and still haunted by that indefinable terror which the close proximity of man awakened in his breast fled precipitately through the jungle  aroused by attack or supported by the presence of another of his kind chulk could have braved the presence of a score of human beings but aloneah that was a different matteralone and unenraged  it was some time after mugambi awoke that he missed the pouch instantly he was all excitement  what could have become of it  it had been at his side when he lay down to sleepof that he was certain for had he not pushed it from beneath him when its bulging bulk pressing against his ribs caused him discomfort  yes it had been there when he lay down to sleep  how then had it vanished  mugambis savage imagination was filled with visions of the spirits of departed friends and enemies for only to the machinations of such as these could he attribute the disappearance of his pouch and knobstick in the first excitement of the discovery of their loss but later and more careful investigation such as his woodcraft made possible revealed indisputable evidence of a more material explanation than his excited fancy and superstition had at first led him to accept  in the trampled turf beside him was the faint impress of huge manlike feet  mugambi raised his brows as the truth dawned upon him  hastily leaving the boma he searched in all directions about the enclosure for some farther sign of the telltale spoor  he climbed trees and sought for evidence of the direction of the thiefs flight but the faint signs left by a wary ape who elects to travel through the trees eluded the woodcraft of mugambi  tarzan might have followed them but no ordinary mortal could perceive them or perceiving translate  the black now strengthened and refreshed by his rest felt ready to set out again for waziri and finding himself another knobstick turned his back upon the river and plunged into the mazes of the jungle  as taglat struggled with the bonds which secured the ankles and wrists of his captive the great lion that eyed the two from behind a nearby clump of bushes wormed closer to his intended prey  the apes back was toward the lion  he did not see the broad head fringed by its rough mane protruding through the leafy wall  he could not know that the powerful hind paws were gathering close beneath the tawny belly preparatory to a sudden spring and his first intimation of impending danger was the thunderous and triumphant roar which the charging lion could no longer suppress  scarce pausing for a backward glance taglat abandoned the unconscious woman and fled in the opposite direction from the horrid sound which had broken in so unexpected and terrifying a manner upon his startled ears but the warning had come too late to save him and the lion in his second bound alighted full upon the broad shoulders of the anthropoid  as the great bull went down there was awakened in him to the full all the cunning all the ferocity all the physical prowess which obey the mightiest of the fundamental laws of nature the law of selfpreservation and turning upon his back he closed with the carnivore in a death struggle so fearless and abandoned that for a moment the great numa himself may have trembled for the outcome  seizing the lion by the mane taglat buried his yellowed fangs deep in the monsters throat growling hideously through the muffled gag of blood and hair  mixed with the apes voice the lions roars of rage and pain reverberated through the jungle till the lesser creatures of the wild startled from their peaceful pursuits scurried fearfully away  rolling over and over upon the turf the two battled with demoniac fury until the colossal cat by doubling his hind paws far up beneath his belly sank his talons deep into taglats chest then ripping downward with all his strength numa accomplished his design and the disemboweled anthropoid with a last spasmodic struggle relaxed in limp and bloody dissolution beneath his titanic adversary  scrambling to his feet numa looked about quickly in all directions as though seeking to detect the possible presence of other foes but only the still and unconscious form of the girl lying a few paces from him met his gaze and with an angry growl he placed a forepaw upon the body of his kill and raising his head gave voice to his savage victory cry  for another moment he stood with fierce eyes roving to and fro about the clearing  at last they halted for a second time upon the girl  a low growl rumbled from the lions throat  his lower jaw rose and fell and the slaver drooled and dripped upon the dead face of taglat  like two yellowgreen augurs wide and unblinking the terrible eyes remained fixed upon jane clayton  the erect and majestic pose of the great frame shrank suddenly into a sinister crouch as slowly and gently as one who treads on eggs the devilfaced cat crept forward toward the girl  beneficent fate maintained her in happy unconsciousness of the dread presence sneaking stealthily upon her  she did not know when the lion paused at her side  she did not hear the sniffing of his nostrils as he smelled about her  she did not feel the heat of the fetid breath upon her face nor the dripping of the saliva from the frightful jaws half opened so close above her  finally the lion lifted a forepaw and turned the body of the girl half over then he stood again eyeing her as though still undetermined whether life was extinct or not  some noise or odor from the nearby jungle attracted his attention for a moment  his eyes did not again return to jane clayton and presently he left her walked over to the remains of taglat and crouching down upon his kill with his back toward the girl proceeded to devour the ape  it was upon this scene that jane clayton at last opened her eyes inured to danger she maintained her selfpossession in the face of the startling surprise which her newfound consciousness revealed to her she neither cried out nor moved a muscle until she had taken in every detail of the scene which lay within the range of her vision  she saw that the lion had killed the ape and that he was devouring his prey less than fifty feet from where she lay but what could she do her hands and feet were bound  she must wait then in what patience she could command until numa had eaten and digested the ape when without doubt he would return to feast upon her unless in the meantime the dread hyenas should discover her or some other of the numerous prowling carnivora of the jungle  as she lay tormented by these frightful thoughts she suddenly became conscious that the bonds at her wrists and ankles no longer hurt her and then of the fact that her hands were separated one lying upon either side of her instead of both being confined at her back  wonderingly she moved a hand  what miracle had been performed  it was not bound  stealthily and noiselessly she moved her other limbs only to discover that she was free  she could not know how the thing had happened that taglat gnawing upon them for sinister purposes of his own had cut them through but an instant before numa had frightened him from his victim  for a moment jane clayton was overwhelmed with joy and thanksgiving but only for a moment  what good was her newfound liberty in the face of the frightful beast crouching so close beside her  if she could have had this chance under different conditions how happily she would have taken advantage of it but now it was given to her when escape was practically impossible  the nearest tree was a hundred feet away the lion less than fifty  to rise and attempt to reach the safety of those tantalizing branches would be but to invite instant destruction for numa would doubtless be too jealous of this future meal to permit it to escape with ease  and yet too there was another possibilitya chance which hinged entirely upon the unknown temper of the great beast  his belly already partially filled he might watch with indifference the departure of the girl yet could she afford to chance so improbable a contingency  she doubted it  upon the other hand she was no more minded to allow this frail opportunity for life to entirely elude her without taking or attempting to take some advantage from it  she watched the lion narrowly  he could not see her without turning his head more than halfway around  she would attempt a ruse  silently she rolled over in the direction of the nearest tree and away from the lion until she lay again in the same position in which numa had left her but a few feet farther from him  here she lay breathless watching the lion but the beast gave no indication that he had heard aught to arouse his suspicions  again she rolled over gaining a few more feet and again she lay in rigid contemplation of the beasts back  during what seemed hours to her tense nerves jane clayton continued these tactics and still the lion fed on in apparent unconsciousness that his second prey was escaping him  already the girl was but a few paces from the treea moment more and she would be close enough to chance springing to her feet throwing caution aside and making a sudden bold dash for safety  she was halfway over in her turn her face away from the lion when he suddenly turned his great head and fastened his eyes upon her  he saw her roll over upon her side away from him and then her eyes were turned again toward him and the cold sweat broke from the girls every pore as she realized that with life almost within her grasp death had found her out  for a long time neither the girl nor the lion moved  the beast lay motionless his head turned upon his shoulders and his glaring eyes fixed upon the rigid victim now nearly fifty yards away  the girl stared back straight into those cruel orbs daring not to move even a muscle  the strain upon her nerves was becoming so unbearable that she could scarcely restrain a growing desire to scream when numa deliberately turned back to the business of feeding but his backlayed ears attested a sinister regard for the actions of the girl behind him  realizing that she could not again turn without attracting his immediate and perhaps fatal attention jane clayton resolved to risk all in one last attempt to reach the tree and clamber to the lower branches  gathering herself stealthily for the effort she leaped suddenly to her feet but almost simultaneously the lion sprang up wheeled and with widedistended jaws and terrific roars charged swiftly down upon her  those who have spent lifetimes hunting the big game of africa will tell you that scarcely any other creature in the world attains the speed of a charging lion  for the short distance that the great cat can maintain it it resembles nothing more closely than the onrushing of a giant locomotive under full speed and so though the distance that jane clayton must cover was relatively small the terrific speed of the lion rendered her hopes of escape almost negligible  yet fear can work wonders and though the upward spring of the lion as he neared the tree into which she was scrambling brought his talons in contact with her boots she eluded his raking grasp and as he hurtled against the bole of her sanctuary the girl drew herself into the safety of the branches above his reach  for some time the lion paced growling and moaning beneath the tree in which jane clayton crouched panting and trembling  the girl was a prey to the nervous reaction from the frightful ordeal through which she had so recently passed and in her overwrought state it seemed that never again should she dare descend to the ground among the fearsome dangers which infested the broad stretch of jungle that she knew must lie between herself and the nearest village of her faithful waziri  it was almost dark before the lion finally quit the clearing and even had his place beside the remnants of the mangled ape not been immediately usurped by a pack of hyenas jane clayton would scarcely have dared venture from her refuge in the face of impending night and so she composed herself as best she could for the long and tiresome wait until daylight might offer some means of escape from the dread vicinity in which she had witnessed such terrifying adventures  tired nature at last overcame even her fears and she dropped into a deep slumber cradled in a comparatively safe though rather uncomfortable position against the bole of the tree and supported by two large branches which grew outward almost horizontally but a few inches apart  the sun was high in the heavens when she at last awoke and beneath her was no sign either of numa or the hyenas  only the cleanpicked bones of the ape scattered about the ground attested the fact of what had transpired in this seemingly peaceful spot but a few hours before  both hunger and thirst assailed her now and realizing that she must descend or die of starvation she at last summoned courage to undertake the ordeal of continuing her journey through the jungle  descending from the tree she set out in a southerly direction toward the point where she believed the plains of waziri lay and though she knew that only ruin and desolation marked the spot where once her happy home had stood she hoped that by coming to the broad plain she might eventually reach one of the numerous waziri villages that were scattered over the surrounding country or chance upon a roving band of these indefatigable huntsmen  the day was half spent when there broke unexpectedly upon her startled ears the sound of a rifle shot not far ahead of her  as she paused to listen this first shot was followed by another and another and another  what could it mean  the first explanation which sprung to her mind attributed the firing to an encounter between the arab raiders and a party of waziri but as she did not know upon which side victory might rest or whether she were behind friend or foe she dared not advance nearer on the chance of revealing herself to an enemy  after listening for several minutes she became convinced that no more than two or three rifles were engaged in the fight since nothing approximating the sound of a volley reached her ears but still she hesitated to approach and at last determining to take no chance she climbed into the concealing foliage of a tree beside the trail she had been following and there fearfully awaited whatever might reveal itself  as the firing became less rapid she caught the sound of mens voices though she could distinguish no words and at last the reports of the guns ceased and she heard two men calling to each other in loud tones then there was a long silence which was finally broken by the stealthy padding of footfalls on the trail ahead of her and in another moment a man appeared in view backing toward her a rifle ready in his hands and his eyes directed in careful watchfulness along the way that he had come  almost instantly jane clayton recognized the man as m  jules frecoult who so recently had been a guest in her home  she was upon the point of calling to him in glad relief when she saw him leap quickly to one side and hide himself in the thick verdure at the trails side  it was evident that he was being followed by an enemy and so jane clayton kept silent lest she distract frecoults attention or guide his foe to his hiding place  scarcely had frecoult hidden himself than the figure of a whiterobed arab crept silently along the trail in pursuit  from her hiding place jane clayton could see both men plainly  she recognized achmet zek as the leader of the band of ruffians who had raided her home and made her a prisoner and as she saw frecoult the supposed friend and ally raise his gun and take careful aim at the arab her heart stood still and every power of her soul was directed upon a fervent prayer for the accuracy of his aim  achmet zek paused in the middle of the trail  his keen eyes scanned every bush and tree within the radius of his vision  his tall figure presented a perfect target to the perfidious assassin  there was a sharp report and a little puff of smoke arose from the bush that hid the belgian as achmet zek stumbled forward and pitched face down upon the trail  as werper stepped back into the trail he was startled by the sound of a glad cry from above him and as he wheeled about to discover the author of this unexpected interruption he saw jane clayton drop lightly from a nearby tree and run forward with outstretched hands to congratulate him upon his victory     20  jane clayton again a prisoner   though her clothes were torn and her hair disheveled albert werper realized that he never before had looked upon such a vision of loveliness as that which lady greystoke presented in the relief and joy which she felt in coming so unexpectedly upon a friend and rescuer when hope had seemed so far away  if the belgian had entertained any doubts as to the womans knowledge of his part in the perfidious attack upon her home and herself it was quickly dissipated by the genuine friendliness of her greeting  she told him quickly of all that had befallen her since he had departed from her home and as she spoke of the death of her husband her eyes were veiled by the tears which she could not repress  i am shocked said werper in wellsimulated sympathy but i am not surprised  that devil there and he pointed toward the body of achmet zek has terrorized the entire country  your waziri are either exterminated or have been driven out of their country far to the south  the men of achmet zek occupy the plain about your former homethere is neither sanctuary nor escape in that direction  our only hope lies in traveling northward as rapidly as we may of coming to the camp of the raiders before the knowledge of achmet zeks death reaches those who were left there and of obtaining through some ruse an escort toward the north  i think that the thing can be accomplished for i was a guest of the raiders before i knew the nature of the man and those at the camp are not aware that i turned against him when i discovered his villainy  come  we will make all possible haste to reach the camp before those who accompanied achmet zek upon his last raid have found his body and carried the news of his death to the cutthroats who remained behind it is our only hope lady greystoke and you must place your entire faith in me if i am to succeed  wait for me here a moment while i take from the arabs body the wallet that he stole from me and werper stepped quickly to the dead mans side and kneeling sought with quick fingers the pouch of jewels  to his consternation there was no sign of them in the garments of achmet zek  rising he walked back along the trail searching for some trace of the missing pouch or its contents but he found nothing even though he searched carefully the vicinity of his dead horse and for a few paces into the jungle on either side  puzzled disappointed and angry he at last returned to the girl  the wallet is gone he explained crisply and i dare not delay longer in search of it we must reach the camp before the returning raiders  unsuspicious of the mans true character jane clayton saw nothing peculiar in his plans or in his specious explanation of his former friendship for the raider and so she grasped with alacrity the seeming hope for safety which he proffered her and turning about she set out with albert werper toward the hostile camp in which she so lately had been a prisoner  it was late in the afternoon of the second day before they reached their destination and as they paused upon the edge of the clearing before the gates of the walled village werper cautioned the girl to accede to whatever he might suggest by his conversation with the raiders  i shall tell them he said that i apprehended you after you escaped from the camp that i took you to achmet zek and that as he was engaged in a stubborn battle with the waziri he directed me to return to camp with you to obtain here a sufficient guard and to ride north with you as rapidly as possible and dispose of you at the most advantageous terms to a certain slave broker whose name he gave me  again the girl was deceived by the apparent frankness of the belgian she realized that desperate situations required desperate handling and though she trembled inwardly at the thought of again entering the vile and hideous village of the raiders she saw no better course than that which her companion had suggested  calling aloud to those who tended the gates werper grasping jane clayton by the arm walked boldly across the clearing  those who opened the gates to him permitted their surprise to show clearly in their expressions  that the discredited and hunted lieutenant should be thus returning fearlessly of his own volition seemed to disarm them quite as effectually as his manner toward lady greystoke had deceived her  the sentries at the gate returned werpers salutations and viewed with astonishment the prisoner whom he brought into the village with him  immediately the belgian sought the arab who had been left in charge of the camp during achmet zeks absence and again his boldness disarmed suspicion and won the acceptance of his false explanation of his return  the fact that he had brought back with him the woman prisoner who had escaped added strength to his claims and mohammed beyd soon found himself fraternizing goodnaturedly with the very man whom he would have slain without compunction had he discovered him alone in the jungle a half hour before  jane clayton was again confined to the prison hut she had formerly occupied but as she realized that this was but a part of the deception which she and frecoult were playing upon the credulous raiders it was with quite a different sensation that she again entered the vile and filthy interior from that which she had previously experienced when hope was so far away  once more she was bound and sentries placed before the door of her prison but before werper left her he whispered words of cheer into her ear  then he left and made his way back to the tent of mohammed beyd he had been wondering how long it would be before the raiders who had ridden out with achmet zek would return with the murdered body of their chief and the more he thought upon the matter the greater his fears became that without accomplices his plan would fail  what even if he got away from the camp in safety before any returned with the true story of his guiltof what value would this advantage be other than to protract for a few days his mental torture and his life these hard riders familiar with every trail and bypath would get him long before he could hope to reach the coast  as these thoughts passed through his mind he entered the tent where mohammed beyd sat crosslegged upon a rug smoking  the arab looked up as the european came into his presence  greetings o brother he said  greetings replied werper  for a while neither spoke further  the arab was the first to break the silence  and my master achmet zek was well when last you saw him he asked  never was he safer from the sins and dangers of mortality replied the belgian  it is well said mohammed beyd blowing a little puff of blue smoke straight out before him  again there was silence for several minutes  and if he were dead asked the belgian determined to lead up to the truth and attempt to bribe mohammed beyd into his service  the arabs eyes narrowed and he leaned forward his gaze boring straight into the eyes of the belgian  i have been thinking much werper since you returned so unexpectedly to the camp of the man whom you had deceived and who sought you with death in his heart  i have been with achmet zek for many yearshis own mother never knew him so well as i he never forgivesmuch less would he again trust a man who had once betrayed him that i know  i have thought much as i said and the result of my thinking has assured me that achmet zek is deadfor otherwise you would never have dared return to his camp unless you be either a braver man or a bigger fool than i have imagined  and if this evidence of my judgment is not sufficient i have but just now received from your own lips even more confirmatory witnessfor did you not say that achmet zek was never more safe from the sins and dangers of mortality  achmet zek is deadyou need not deny it  i was not his mother or his mistress so do not fear that my wailings shall disturb you  tell me why you have come back here tell me what you want and werper if you still possess the jewels of which achmet zek told me there is no reason why you and i should not ride north together and divide the ransom of the white woman and the contents of the pouch you wear about your person eh  the evil eyes narrowed a vicious thinlipped smile tortured the villainous face as mohammed beyd grinned knowingly into the face of the belgian  werper was both relieved and disturbed by the arabs attitude  the complacency with which he accepted the death of his chief lifted a considerable burden of apprehension from the shoulders of achmet zeks assassin but his demand for a share of the jewels boded ill for werper when mohammed beyd should have learned that the precious stones were no longer in the belgians possession  to acknowledge that he had lost the jewels might be to arouse the wrath or suspicion of the arab to such an extent as would jeopardize his newfound chances of escape  his one hope seemed then to lie in fostering mohammed beyds belief that the jewels were still in his possession and depend upon the accidents of the future to open an avenue of escape  could he contrive to tent with the arab upon the march north he might find opportunity in plenty to remove this menace to his life and libertyit was worth trying and further there seemed no other way out of his difficulty  yes he said achmet zek is dead  he fell in battle with a company of abyssinian cavalry that held me captive  during the fighting i escaped but i doubt if any of achmet zeks men live and the gold they sought is in the possession of the abyssinians  even now they are doubtless marching on this camp for they were sent by menelek to punish achmet zek and his followers for a raid upon an abyssinian village  there are many of them and if we do not make haste to escape we shall all suffer the same fate as achmet zek  mohammed beyd listened in silence  how much of the unbelievers story he might safely believe he did not know but as it afforded him an excuse for deserting the village and making for the north he was not inclined to crossquestion the belgian too minutely  and if i ride north with you he asked half the jewels and half the ransom of the woman shall be mine  yes replied werper  good said mohammed beyd  i go now to give the order for the breaking of camp early on the morrow and he rose to leave the tent  werper laid a detaining hand upon his arm  wait he said let us determine how many shall accompany us  it is not well that we be burdened by the women and children for then indeed we might be overtaken by the abyssinians  it would be far better to select a small guard of your bravest men and leave word behind that we are riding west  then when the abyssinians come they will be put upon the wrong trail should they have it in their hearts to pursue us and if they do not they will at least ride north with less rapidity than as though they thought that we were ahead of them  the serpent is less wise than thou werper said mohammed beyd with a smile  it shall be done as you say  twenty men shall accompany us and we shall ride westwhen we leave the village  good cried the belgian and so it was arranged  early the next morning jane clayton after an almost sleepless night was aroused by the sound of voices outside her prison and a moment later m frecoult and two arabs entered  the latter unbound her ankles and lifted her to her feet  then her wrists were loosed she was given a handful of dry bread and led out into the faint light of dawn  she looked questioningly at frecoult and at a moment that the arabs attention was attracted in another direction the man leaned toward her and whispered that all was working out as he had planned  thus assured the young woman felt a renewal of the hope which the long and miserable night of bondage had almost expunged  shortly after she was lifted to the back of a horse and surrounded by arabs was escorted through the gateway of the village and off into the jungle toward the west  half an hour later the party turned north and northerly was their direction for the balance of the march  m frecoult spoke with her but seldom and she understood that in carrying out his deception he must maintain the semblance of her captor rather than protector and so she suspected nothing though she saw the friendly relations which seemed to exist between the european and the arab leader of the band  if werper succeeded in keeping himself from conversation with the young woman he failed signally to expel her from his thoughts  a hundred times a day he found his eyes wandering in her direction and feasting themselves upon her charms of face and figure  each hour his infatuation for her grew until his desire to possess her gained almost the proportions of madness  if either the girl or mohammed beyd could have guessed what passed in the mind of the man which each thought a friend and ally the apparent harmony of the little company would have been rudely disturbed  werper had not succeeded in arranging to tent with mohammed beyd and so he revolved many plans for the assassination of the arab that would have been greatly simplified had he been permitted to share the others nightly shelter  upon the second day out mohammed beyd reined his horse to the side of the animal on which the captive was mounted  it was apparently the first notice which the arab had taken of the girl but many times during these two days had his cunning eyes peered greedily from beneath the hood of his burnoose to gloat upon the beauties of the prisoner  nor was this hidden infatuation of any recent origin  he had conceived it when first the wife of the englishman had fallen into the hands of achmet zek but while that austere chieftain lived mohammed beyd had not even dared hope for a realization of his imaginings  now though it was differentonly a despised dog of a christian stood between himself and possession of the girl  how easy it would be to slay the unbeliever and take unto himself both the woman and the jewels  with the latter in his possession the ransom which might be obtained for the captive would form no great inducement to her relinquishment in the face of the pleasures of sole ownership of her yes he would kill werper retain all the jewels and keep the englishwoman  he turned his eyes upon her as she rode along at his side  how beautiful she was  his fingers opened and closedskinny brown talons itching to feel the soft flesh of the victim in their remorseless clutch  do you know he asked leaning toward her where this man would take you  jane clayton nodded affirmatively  and you are willing to become the plaything of a black sultan  the girl drew herself up to her full height and turned her head away but she did not reply  she feared lest her knowledge of the ruse that m frecoult was playing upon the arab might cause her to betray herself through an insufficient display of terror and aversion  you can escape this fate continued the arab mohammed beyd will save you and he reached out a brown hand and seized the fingers of her right hand in a grasp so sudden and so fierce that this brutal passion was revealed as clearly in the act as though his lips had confessed it in words jane clayton wrenched herself from his grasp  you beast she cried  leave me or i shall call m  frecoult  mohammed beyd drew back with a scowl  his thin upper lip curled upward revealing his smooth white teeth  m frecoult he jeered  there is no such person  the mans name is werper  he is a liar a thief and a murderer  he killed his captain in the congo country and fled to the protection of achmet zek  he led achmet zek to the plunder of your home  he followed your husband and planned to steal his gold from him  he has told me that you think him your protector and he has played upon this to win your confidence that it might be easier to carry you north and sell you into some black sultans harem  mohammed beyd is your only hope and with this assertion to provide the captive with food for thought the arab spurred forward toward the head of the column  jane clayton could not know how much of mohammed beyds indictment might be true or how much false but at least it had the effect of dampening her hopes and causing her to review with suspicion every past act of the man upon whom she had been looking as her sole protector in the midst of a world of enemies and dangers  on the march a separate tent had been provided for the captive and at night it was pitched between those of mohammed beyd and werper  a sentry was posted at the front and another at the back and with these precautions it had not been thought necessary to confine the prisoner to bonds  the evening following her interview with mohammed beyd jane clayton sat for some time at the opening of her tent watching the rough activities of the camp  she had eaten the meal that had been brought her by mohammed beyds negro slavea meal of cassava cakes and a nondescript stew in which a newkilled monkey a couple of squirrels and the remains of a zebra slain the previous day were impartially and unsavorily combined but the onetime baltimore belle had long since submerged in the stern battle for existence an estheticism which formerly revolted at much slighter provocation  as the girls eyes wandered across the trampled jungle clearing already squalid from the presence of man she no longer apprehended either the nearer objects of the foreground the uncouth men laughing or quarreling among themselves or the jungle beyond which circumscribed the extreme range of her material vision  her gaze passed through all these unseeing to center itself upon a distant bungalow and scenes of happy security which brought to her eyes tears of mingled joy and sorrow  she saw a tall broadshouldered man riding in from distant fields she saw herself waiting to greet him with an armful of freshcut roses from the bushes which flanked the little rustic gate before her  all this was gone vanished into the past wiped out by the torches and bullets and hatred of these hideous and degenerate men  with a stifled sob and a little shudder jane clayton turned back into her tent and sought the pile of unclean blankets which were her bed  throwing herself face downward upon them she sobbed forth her misery until kindly sleep brought her at least temporary relief  and while she slept a figure stole from the tent that stood to the right of hers  it approached the sentry before the doorway and whispered a few words in the mans ear  the latter nodded and strode off through the darkness in the direction of his own blankets  the figure passed to the rear of jane claytons tent and spoke again to the sentry there and this man also left following in the trail of the first  then he who had sent them away stole silently to the tent flap and untying the fastenings entered with the noiselessness of a disembodied spirit     21  the flight to the jungle   sleepless upon his blankets albert werper let his evil mind dwell upon the charms of the woman in the nearby tent  he had noted mohammed beyds sudden interest in the girl and judging the man by his own standards had guessed at the basis of the arabs sudden change of attitude toward the prisoner  and as he let his imaginings run riot they aroused within him a bestial jealousy of mohammed beyd and a great fear that the other might encompass his base designs upon the defenseless girl  by a strange process of reasoning werper whose designs were identical with the arabs pictured himself as jane claytons protector and presently convinced himself that the attentions which might seem hideous to her if proffered by mohammed beyd would be welcomed from albert werper  her husband was dead and werper fancied that he could replace in the girls heart the position which had been vacated by the act of the grim reaper  he could offer jane clayton marriagea thing which mohammed beyd would not offer and which the girl would spurn from him with as deep disgust as she would his unholy lust  it was not long before the belgian had succeeded in convincing himself that the captive not only had every reason for having conceived sentiments of love for him but that she had by various feminine methods acknowledged her newborn affection  and then a sudden resolution possessed him  he threw the blankets from him and rose to his feet  pulling on his boots and buckling his cartridge belt and revolver about his hips he stepped to the flap of his tent and looked out  there was no sentry before the entrance to the prisoners tent  what could it mean  fate was indeed playing into his hands  stepping outside he passed to the rear of the girls tent  there was no sentry there either  and now boldly he walked to the entrance and stepped within  dimly the moonlight illumined the interior  across the tent a figure bent above the blankets of a bed  there was a whispered word and another figure rose from the blankets to a sitting position  slowly albert werpers eyes were becoming accustomed to the half darkness of the tent  he saw that the figure leaning over the bed was that of a man and he guessed at the truth of the nocturnal visitors identity  a sullen jealous rage enveloped him  he took a step in the direction of the two  he heard a frightened cry break from the girls lips as she recognized the features of the man above her and he saw mohammed beyd seize her by the throat and bear her back upon the blankets  cheated passion cast a red blur before the eyes of the belgian  no the man should not have her  she was for him and him alone  he would not be robbed of his rights  quickly he ran across the tent and threw himself upon the back of mohammed beyd  the latter though surprised by this sudden and unexpected attack was not one to give up without a battle  the belgians fingers were feeling for his throat but the arab tore them away and rising wheeled upon his adversary  as they faced each other werper struck the arab a heavy blow in the face sending him staggering backward  if he had followed up his advantage he would have had mohammed beyd at his mercy in another moment but instead he tugged at his revolver to draw it from its holster and fate ordained that at that particular moment the weapon should stick in its leather scabbard  before he could disengage it mohammed beyd had recovered himself and was dashing upon him  again werper struck the other in the face and the arab returned the blow  striking at each other and ceaselessly attempting to clinch the two battled about the small interior of the tent while the girl wideeyed in terror and astonishment watched the duel in frozen silence  again and again werper struggled to draw his weapon  mohammed beyd anticipating no such opposition to his base desires had come to the tent unarmed except for a long knife which he now drew as he stood panting during the first brief rest of the encounter  dog of a christian he whispered look upon this knife in the hands of mohammed beyd  look well unbeliever for it is the last thing in life that you shall see or feel  with it mohammed beyd will cut out your black heart  if you have a god pray to him nowin a minute more you shall be dead and with that he rushed viciously upon the belgian his knife raised high above his head  werper was still dragging futilely at his weapon  the arab was almost upon him  in desperation the european waited until mohammed beyd was all but against him then he threw himself to one side to the floor of the tent leaving a leg extended in the path of the arab  the trick succeeded  mohammed beyd carried on by the momentum of his charge stumbled over the projecting obstacle and crashed to the ground  instantly he was up again and wheeling to renew the battle but werper was on foot ahead of him and now his revolver loosened from its holster flashed in his hand  the arab dove headfirst to grapple with him there was a sharp report a lurid gleam of flame in the darkness and mohammed beyd rolled over and over upon the floor to come to a final rest beside the bed of the woman he had sought to dishonor  almost immediately following the report came the sound of excited voices in the camp without  men were calling back and forth to one another asking the meaning of the shot  werper could hear them running hither and thither investigating  jane clayton had risen to her feet as the arab died and now she came forward with outstretched hands toward werper  how can i ever thank you my friend she asked  and to think that only today i had almost believed the infamous story which this beast told me of your perfidy and of your past  forgive me m frecoult  i might have known that a white man and a gentleman could be naught else than the protector of a woman of his own race amid the dangers of this savage land  werpers hands dropped limply at his sides  he stood looking at the girl but he could find no words to reply to her  her innocent arraignment of his true purposes was unanswerable  outside the arabs were searching for the author of the disturbing shot  the two sentries who had been relieved and sent to their blankets by mohammed beyd were the first to suggest going to the tent of the prisoner  it occurred to them that possibly the woman had successfully defended herself against their leader  werper heard the men approaching  to be apprehended as the slayer of mohammed beyd would be equivalent to a sentence of immediate death the fierce and brutal raiders would tear to pieces a christian who had dared spill the blood of their leader  he must find some excuse to delay the finding of mohammed beyds dead body  returning his revolver to its holster he walked quickly to the entrance of the tent  parting the flaps he stepped out and confronted the men who were rapidly approaching  somehow he found within him the necessary bravado to force a smile to his lips as he held up his hand to bar their farther progress  the woman resisted he said and mohammed beyd was forced to shoot her  she is not deadonly slightly wounded  you may go back to your blankets  mohammed beyd and i will look after the prisoner then he turned and reentered the tent and the raiders satisfied by this explanation gladly returned to their broken slumbers  as he again faced jane clayton werper found himself animated by quite different intentions than those which had lured him from his blankets but a few minutes before  the excitement of his encounter with mohammed beyd as well as the dangers which he now faced at the hands of the raiders when morning must inevitably reveal the truth of what had occurred in the tent of the prisoner that night had naturally cooled the hot passion which had dominated him when he entered the tent  but another and stronger force was exerting itself in the girls favor however low a man may sink honor and chivalry has he ever possessed them are never entirely eradicated from his character and though albert werper had long since ceased to evidence the slightest claim to either the one or the other the spontaneous acknowledgment of them which the girls speech had presumed had reawakened them both within him  for the first time he realized the almost hopeless and frightful position of the fair captive and the depths of ignominy to which he had sunk that had made it possible for him a wellborn european gentleman to have entertained even for a moment the part that he had taken in the ruin of her home happiness and herself  too much of baseness already lay at the threshold of his conscience for him ever to hope entirely to redeem himself but in the first sudden burst of contrition the man conceived an honest intention to undo in so far as lay within his power the evil that his criminal avarice had brought upon this sweet and unoffending woman  as he stood apparently listening to the retreating footstepsjane clayton approached him  what are we to do now she asked  morning will bring discovery of this and she pointed to the still body of mohammed beyd  they will kill you when they find him  for a time werper did not reply then he turned suddenly toward the woman  i have a plan he cried  it will require nerve and courage on your part but you have already shown that you possess both  can you endure still more  i can endure anything she replied with a brave smile that may offer us even a slight chance for escape  you must simulate death he explained while i carry you from the camp  i will explain to the sentries that mohammed beyd has ordered me to take your body into the jungle  this seemingly unnecessary act i shall explain upon the grounds that mohammed beyd had conceived a violent passion for you and that he so regretted the act by which he had become your slayer that he could not endure the silent reproach of your lifeless body  the girl held up her hand to stop  a smile touched her lips  are you quite mad she asked  do you imagine that the sentries will credit any such ridiculous tale  you do not know them he replied  beneath their rough exteriors despite their calloused and criminal natures there exists in each a welldefined strain of romantic emotionalismyou will find it among such as these throughout the world  it is romance which lures men to lead wild lives of outlawry and crime  the ruse will succeednever fear  jane clayton shrugged  we can but try itand then what  i shall hide you in the jungle continued the belgian coming for you alone and with two horses in the morning  but how will you explain mohammed beyds death she asked  it will be discovered before ever you can escape the camp in the morning  i shall not explain it replied werper  mohammed beyd shall explain it himselfwe must leave that to him  are you ready for the venture  yes  but wait i must get you a weapon and ammunition and werper walked quickly from the tent  very shortly he returned with an extra revolver and ammunition belt strapped about his waist  are you ready he asked  quite ready replied the girl  then come and throw yourself limply across my left shoulder and werper knelt to receive her  there he said as he rose to his feet  now let your arms your legs and your head hang limply  remember that you are dead  a moment later the man walked out into the camp the body of the woman across his shoulder  a thorn boma had been thrown up about the camp to discourage the bolder of the hungry carnivora  a couple of sentries paced to and fro in the light of a fire which they kept burning brightly  the nearer of these looked up in surprise as he saw werper approaching  who are you he cried  what have you there  werper raised the hood of his burnoose that the fellow might see his face  this is the body of the woman he explained  mohammed beyd has asked me to take it into the jungle for he cannot bear to look upon the face of her whom he loved and whom necessity compelled him to slay  he suffers greatlyhe is inconsolable  it was with difficulty that i prevented him taking his own life  across the speakers shoulder limp and frightened the girl waited for the arabs reply  he would laugh at this preposterous story of that she was sure  in an instant he would unmask the deception that m frecoult was attempting to practice upon him and they would both be lost  she tried to plan how best she might aid her wouldbe rescuer in the fight which must most certainly follow within a moment or two  then she heard the voice of the arab as he replied to m frecoult  are you going alone or do you wish me to awaken someone to accompany you he asked and his tone denoted not the least surprise that mohammed beyd had suddenly discovered such remarkably sensitive characteristics  i shall go alone replied werper and he passed on and out through the narrow opening in the boma by which the sentry stood  a moment later he had entered among the boles of the trees with his burden and when safely hidden from the sentrys view lowered the girl to her feet with a low shsh when she would have spoken  then he led her a little farther into the forest halted beneath a large tree with spreading branches buckled a cartridge belt and revolver about her waist and assisted her to clamber into the lower branches  tomorrow he whispered as soon as i can elude them i will return for you  be brave lady greystokewe may yet escape  thank you she replied in a low tone  you have been very kind and very brave  werper did not reply and the darkness of the night hid the scarlet flush of shame which swept upward across his face  quickly he turned and made his way back to camp  the sentry from his post saw him enter his own tent but he did not see him crawl under the canvas at the rear and sneak cautiously to the tent which the prisoner had occupied where now lay the dead body of mohammed beyd  raising the lower edge of the rear wall werper crept within and approached the corpse  without an instants hesitation he seized the dead wrists and dragged the body upon its back to the point where he had just entered  on hands and knees he backed out as he had come in drawing the corpse after him  once outside the belgian crept to the side of the tent and surveyed as much of the camp as lay within his visionno one was watching  returning to the body he lifted it to his shoulder and risking all on a quick sally ran swiftly across the narrow opening which separated the prisoners tent from that of the dead man  behind the silken wall he halted and lowered his burden to the ground and there he remained motionless for several minutes listening  satisfied at last that no one had seen him he stooped and raised the bottom of the tent wall backed in and dragged the thing that had been mohammed beyd after him  to the sleeping rugs of the dead raider he drew the corpse then he fumbled about in the darkness until he had found mohammed beyds revolver  with the weapon in his hand he returned to the side of the dead man kneeled beside the bedding and inserted his right hand with the weapon beneath the rugs piled a number of thicknesses of the closely woven fabric over and about the revolver with his left hand  then he pulled the trigger and at the same time he coughed  the muffled report could not have been heard above the sound of his cough by one directly outside the tent  werper was satisfied  a grim smile touched his lips as he withdrew the weapon from the rugs and placed it carefully in the right hand of the dead man fixing three of the fingers around the grip and the index finger inside the trigger guard  a moment longer he tarried to rearrange the disordered rugs and then he left as he had entered fastening down the rear wall of the tent as it had been before he had raised it  going to the tent of the prisoner he removed there also the evidence that someone might have come or gone beneath the rear wall  then he returned to his own tent entered fastened down the canvas and crawled into his blankets  the following morning he was awakened by the excited voice of mohammed beyds slave calling to him at the entrance of his tent  quick  quick cried the black in a frightened tone  come mohammed beyd is dead in his tentdead by his own hand  werper sat up quickly in his blankets at the first alarm a startled expression upon his countenance but at the last words of the black a sigh of relief escaped his lips and a slight smile replaced the tense lines upon his face  i come he called to the slave and drawing on his boots rose and went out of his tent  excited arabs and blacks were running from all parts of the camp toward the silken tent of mohammed beyd and when werper entered he found a number of the raiders crowded about the corpse now cold and stiff  shouldering his way among them the belgian halted beside the dead body of the raider  he looked down in silence for a moment upon the still face then he wheeled upon the arabs  who has done this thing he cried  his tone was both menacing and accusing  who has murdered mohammed beyd  a sudden chorus of voices arose in tumultuous protest  mohammed beyd was not murdered they cried  he died by his own hand  this and allah are our witnesses and they pointed to a revolver in the dead mans hand  for a time werper pretended to be skeptical but at last permitted himself to be convinced that mohammed beyd had indeed killed himself in remorse for the death of the white woman he had all unknown to his followers loved so devotedly  werper himself wrapped the blankets of the dead man about the corpse taking care to fold inward the scorched and bullettorn fabric that had muffled the report of the weapon he had fired the night before  then six husky blacks carried the body out into the clearing where the camp stood and deposited it in a shallow grave  as the loose earth fell upon the silent form beneath the telltale blankets albert werper heaved another sigh of reliefhis plan had worked out even better than he had dared hope  with achmet zek and mohammed beyd both dead the raiders were without a leader and after a brief conference they decided to return into the north on visits to the various tribes to which they belonged werper after learning the direction they intended taking announced that for his part he was going east to the coast and as they knew of nothing he possessed which any of them coveted they signified their willingness that he should go his way  as they rode off he sat his horse in the center of the clearing watching them disappear one by one into the jungle and thanked his god that he had at last escaped their villainous clutches  when he could no longer hear any sound of them he turned to the right and rode into the forest toward the tree where he had hidden lady greystoke and drawing rein beneath it called up in a gay and hopeful voice a pleasant good morning  there was no reply and though his eyes searched the thick foliage above him he could see no sign of the girl  dismounting he quickly climbed into the tree where he could obtain a view of all its branches  the tree was emptyjane clayton had vanished during the silent watches of the jungle night     22  tarzan recovers his reason   as tarzan let the pebbles from the recovered pouch run through his fingers his thoughts returned to the pile of yellow ingots about which the arabs and the abyssinians had waged their relentless battle  what was there in common between that pile of dirty metal and the beautiful sparkling pebbles that had formerly been in his pouch  what was the metal  from whence had it come  what was that tantalizing halfconviction which seemed to demand the recognition of his memory that the yellow pile for which these men had fought and died had been intimately connected with his pastthat it had been his  what had been his past  he shook his head  vaguely the memory of his apish childhood passed slowly in reviewthen came a strangely tangled mass of faces figures and events which seemed to have no relation to tarzan of the apes and yet which were even in their fragmentary form familiar  slowly and painfully recollection was attempting to reassert itself the hurt brain was mending as the cause of its recent failure to function was being slowly absorbed or removed by the healing processes of perfect circulation  the people who now passed before his minds eye for the first time in weeks wore familiar faces but yet he could neither place them in the niches they had once filled in his past life nor call them by name one was a fair she and it was her face which most often moved through the tangled recollections of his convalescing brain  who was she what had she been to tarzan of the apes  he seemed to see her about the very spot upon which the pile of gold had been unearthed by the abyssinians but the surroundings were vastly different from those which now obtained  there was a buildingthere were many buildingsand there were hedges fences and flowers  tarzan puckered his brow in puzzled study of the wonderful problem  for an instant he seemed to grasp the whole of a true explanation and then just as success was within his grasp the picture faded into a jungle scene where a naked white youth danced in company with a band of hairy primordial apethings  tarzan shook his head and sighed  why was it that he could not recollect  at least he was sure that in some way the pile of gold the place where it lay the subtle aroma of the elusive she he had been pursuing the memory figure of the white woman and he himself were inextricably connected by the ties of a forgotten past  if the woman belonged there what better place to search or await her than the very spot which his broken recollections seemed to assign to her  it was worth trying  tarzan slipped the thong of the empty pouch over his shoulder and started off through the trees in the direction of the plain  at the outskirts of the forest he met the arabs returning in search of achmet zek  hiding he let them pass and then resumed his way toward the charred ruins of the home he had been almost upon the point of recalling to his memory  his journey across the plain was interrupted by the discovery of a small herd of antelope in a little swale where the cover and the wind were well combined to make stalking easy  a fat yearling rewarded a half hour of stealthy creeping and a sudden savage rush and it was late in the afternoon when the apeman settled himself upon his haunches beside his kill to enjoy the fruits of his skill his cunning and his prowess  his hunger satisfied thirst next claimed his attention  the river lured him by the shortest path toward its refreshing waters and when he had drunk night already had fallen and he was some half mile or more down stream from the point where he had seen the pile of yellow ingots and where he hoped to meet the memory woman or find some clew to her whereabouts or her identity  to the jungle bred time is usually a matter of small moment and haste except when engendered by terror by rage or by hunger is distasteful  today was gone  therefore tomorrow of which there was an infinite procession would answer admirably for tarzans further quest  and besides the apeman was tired and would sleep  a tree afforded him the safety seclusion and comforts of a wellappointed bedchamber and to the chorus of the hunters and the hunted of the wild river bank he soon dropped off into deep slumber  morning found him both hungry and thirsty again and dropping from his tree he made his way to the drinking place at the rivers edge  there he found numa the lion ahead of him  the big fellow was lapping the water greedily and at the approach of tarzan along the trail in his rear he raised his head and turning his gaze backward across his maned shoulders glared at the intruder  a low growl of warning rumbled from his throat but tarzan guessing that the beast had but just quitted his kill and was well filled merely made a slight detour and continued to the river where he stopped a few yards above the tawny cat and dropping upon his hands and knees plunged his face into the cool water  for a moment the lion continued to eye the man then he resumed his drinking and man and beast quenched their thirst side by side each apparently oblivious of the others presence  numa was the first to finish  raising his head he gazed across the river for a few minutes with that stony fixity of attention which is a characteristic of his kind  but for the ruffling of his black mane to the touch of the passing breeze he might have been wrought from golden bronze so motionless so statuesque his pose  a deep sigh from the cavernous lungs dispelled the illusion  the mighty head swung slowly around until the yellow eyes rested upon the man  the bristled lip curved upward exposing yellow fangs  another warning growl vibrated the heavy jowls and the king of beasts turned majestically about and paced slowly up the trail into the dense reeds  tarzan of the apes drank on but from the corners of his gray eyes he watched the great brutes every move until he had disappeared from view and after his keen ears marked the movements of the carnivore  a plunge in the river was followed by a scant breakfast of eggs which chance discovered to him and then he set off up river toward the ruins of the bungalow where the golden ingots had marked the center of yesterdays battle  and when he came upon the spot great was his surprise and consternation for the yellow metal had disappeared  the earth trampled by the feet of horses and men gave no clew  it was as though the ingots had evaporated into thin air  the apeman was at a loss to know where to turn or what next to do there was no sign of any spoor which might denote that the she had been here  the metal was gone and if there was any connection between the she and the metal it seemed useless to wait for her now that the latter had been removed elsewhere  everything seemed to elude himthe pretty pebbles the yellow metal the she his memory  tarzan was disgusted  he would go back into the jungle and look for chulk and so he turned his steps once more toward the forest  he moved rapidly swinging across the plain in a long easy trot and at the edge of the forest taking to the trees with the agility and speed of a small monkey  his direction was aimlesshe merely raced on and on through the jungle the joy of unfettered action his principal urge with the hope of stumbling upon some clew to chulk or the she a secondary incentive  for two days he roamed about killing eating drinking and sleeping wherever inclination and the means to indulge it occurred simultaneously  it was upon the morning of the third day that the scent spoor of horse and man were wafted faintly to his nostrils instantly he altered his course to glide silently through the branches in the direction from which the scent came  it was not long before he came upon a solitary horseman riding toward the east  instantly his eyes confirmed what his nose had previously suspectedthe rider was he who had stolen his pretty pebbles  the light of rage flared suddenly in the gray eyes as the apeman dropped lower among the branches until he moved almost directly above the unconscious werper  there was a quick leap and the belgian felt a heavy body hurtle onto the rump of his terrorstricken mount  the horse snorting leaped forward  giant arms encircled the rider and in the twinkling of an eye he was dragged from his saddle to find himself lying in the narrow trail with a naked white giant kneeling upon his breast  recognition came to werper with the first glance at his captors face and a pallor of fear overspread his features  strong fingers were at his throat fingers of steel  he tried to cry out to plead for his life but the cruel fingers denied him speech as they were as surely denying him life  the pretty pebbles cried the man upon his breast  what did you with the pretty pebbleswith tarzans pretty pebbles  the fingers relaxed to permit a reply  for some time werper could only choke and coughat last he regained the powers of speech  achmet zek the arab stole them from me he cried he made me give up the pouch and the pebbles  i saw all that replied tarzan but the pebbles in the pouch were not the pebbles of tarzanthey were only such pebbles as fill the bottoms of the rivers and the shelving banks beside them  even the arab would not have them for he threw them away in anger when he had looked upon them  it is my pretty pebbles that i wantwhere are they  i do not know i do not know cried werper  i gave them to achmet zek or he would have killed me  a few minutes later he followed me along the trail to slay me although he had promised to molest me no further and i shot and killed him but the pouch was not upon his person and though i searched about the jungle for some time i could not find it  i found it i tell you growled tarzan and i also found the pebbles which achmet zek had thrown away in disgust  they were not tarzans pebbles  you have hidden them  tell me where they are or i will kill you and the brown fingers of the apeman closed a little tighter upon the throat of his victim  werper struggled to free himself  my god lord greystoke he managed to scream would you commit murder for a handful of stones  the fingers at his throat relaxed a puzzled faraway expression softened the gray eyes  lord greystoke repeated the apeman  lord greystoke  who is lord greystoke  where have i heard that name before  why man you are lord greystoke cried the belgian  you were injured by a falling rock when the earthquake shattered the passage to the underground chamber to which you and your black waziri had come to fetch golden ingots back to your bungalow  the blow shattered your memory  you are john clayton lord greystokedont you remember  john clayton lord greystoke repeated tarzan  then for a moment he was silent  presently his hand went falteringly to his forehead an expression of wonderment filled his eyesof wonderment and sudden understanding  the forgotten name had reawakened the returning memory that had been struggling to reassert itself  the apeman relinquished his grasp upon the throat of the belgian and leaped to his feet  god he cried and then jane suddenly he turned toward werper my wife he asked  what has become of her  the farm is in ruins you know  you have had something to do with all this  you followed me to opar you stole the jewels which i thought but pretty pebbles  you are a crook  do not try to tell me that you are not  he is worse than a crook said a quiet voice close behind them  tarzan turned in astonishment to see a tall man in uniform standing in the trail a few paces from him  back of the man were a number of black soldiers in the uniform of the congo free state  he is a murderer monsieur continued the officer  i have followed him for a long time to take him back to stand trial for the killing of his superior officer  werper was upon his feet now gazing white and trembling at the fate which had overtaken him even in the fastness of the labyrinthine jungle  instinctively he turned to flee but tarzan of the apes reached out a strong hand and grasped him by the shoulder  wait said the apeman to his captive  this gentleman wishes you and so do i when i am through with you he may have you  tell me what has become of my wife  the belgian officer eyed the almost naked white giant with curiosity he noted the strange contrast of primitive weapons and apparel and the easy fluent french which the man spoke  the former denoted the lowest the latter the highest type of culture  he could not quite determine the social status of this strange creature but he knew that he did not relish the easy assurance with which the fellow presumed to dictate when he might take possession of the prisoner  pardon me he said stepping forward and placing his hand on werpers other shoulder but this gentleman is my prisoner  he must come with me  when i am through with him replied tarzan quietly  the officer turned and beckoned to the soldiers standing in the trail behind him  a company of uniformed blacks stepped quickly forward and pushing past the three surrounded the apeman and his captive  both the law and the power to enforce it are upon my side announced the officer  let us have no trouble  if you have a grievance against this man you may return with me and enter your charge regularly before an authorized tribunal  your legal rights are not above suspicion my friend replied tarzan and your power to enforce your commands are only apparentnot real you have presumed to enter british territory with an armed force where is your authority for this invasion  where are the extradition papers which warrant the arrest of this man  and what assurance have you that i cannot bring an armed force about you that will prevent your return to the congo free state  the belgian lost his temper  i have no disposition to argue with a naked savage he cried  unless you wish to be hurt you will not interfere with me  take the prisoner sergeant  werper raised his lips close to tarzans ear  keep me from them and i can show you the very spot where i saw your wife last night he whispered  she cannot be far from here at this very minute  the soldiers following the signal from their sergeant closed in to seize werper  tarzan grabbed the belgian about the waist and bearing him beneath his arm as he might have borne a sack of flour leaped forward in an attempt to break through the cordon  his right fist caught the nearest soldier upon the jaw and sent him hurtling backward upon his fellows  clubbed rifles were torn from the hands of those who barred his way and right and left the black soldiers stumbled aside in the face of the apemans savage break for liberty  so completely did the blacks surround the two that they dared not fire for fear of hitting one of their own number and tarzan was already through them and upon the point of dodging into the concealing mazes of the jungle when one who had sneaked upon him from behind struck him a heavy blow upon the head with a rifle  in an instant the apeman was down and a dozen black soldiers were upon his back  when he regained consciousness he found himself securely bound as was werper also  the belgian officer success having crowned his efforts was in good humor and inclined to chaff his prisoners about the ease with which they had been captured but from tarzan of the apes he elicited no response  werper however was voluble in his protests  he explained that tarzan was an english lord but the officer only laughed at the assertion and advised his prisoner to save his breath for his defense in court  as soon as tarzan regained his senses and it was found that he was not seriously injured the prisoners were hastened into line and the return march toward the congo free state boundary commenced  toward evening the column halted beside a stream made camp and prepared the evening meal  from the thick foliage of the nearby jungle a pair of fierce eyes watched the activities of the uniformed blacks with silent intensity and curiosity  from beneath beetling brows the creature saw the boma constructed the fires built and the supper prepared  tarzan and werper had been lying bound behind a small pile of knapsacks from the time that the company had halted but with the preparation of the meal completed their guard ordered them to rise and come forward to one of the fires where their hands would be unfettered that they might eat  as the giant apeman rose a startled expression of recognition entered the eyes of the watcher in the jungle and a low guttural broke from the savage lips  instantly tarzan was alert but the answering growl died upon his lips suppressed by the fear that it might arouse the suspicions of the soldiers  suddenly an inspiration came to him  he turned toward werper  i am going to speak to you in a loud voice and in a tongue which you do not understand  appear to listen intently to what i say and occasionally mumble something as though replying in the same languageour escape may hinge upon the success of your efforts  werper nodded in assent and understanding and immediately there broke from the lips of his companion a strange jargon which might have been compared with equal propriety to the barking and growling of a dog and the chattering of monkeys  the nearer soldiers looked in surprise at the apeman  some of them laughed while others drew away in evident superstitious fear  the officer approached the prisoners while tarzan was still jabbering and halted behind them listening in perplexed interest  when werper mumbled some ridiculous jargon in reply his curiosity broke bounds and he stepped forward demanding to know what language it was that they spoke  tarzan had gauged the measure of the mans culture from the nature and quality of his conversation during the march and he rested the success of his reply upon the estimate he had made  greek he explained  oh i thought it was greek replied the officer but it has been so many years since i studied it that i was not sure  in future however i will thank you to speak in a language which i am more familiar with  werper turned his head to hide a grin whispering to tarzan it was greek to him all rightand to me too  but one of the black soldiers mumbled in a low voice to a companion i have heard those sounds beforeonce at night when i was lost in the jungle i heard the hairy men of the trees talking among themselves and their words were like the words of this white man  i wish that we had not found him  he is not a man at allhe is a bad spirit and we shall have bad luck if we do not let him go and the fellow rolled his eyes fearfully toward the jungle  his companion laughed nervously and moved away to repeat the conversation with variations and exaggerations to others of the black soldiery so that it was not long before a frightful tale of black magic and sudden death was woven about the giant prisoner and had gone the rounds of the camp  and deep in the gloomy jungle amidst the darkening shadows of the falling night a hairy manlike creature swung swiftly southward upon some secret mission of his own     23  a night of terror   to jane clayton waiting in the tree where werper had placed her it seemed that the long night would never end yet end it did at last and within an hour of the coming of dawn her spirits leaped with renewed hope at sight of a solitary horseman approaching along the trail  the flowing burnoose with its loose hood hid both the face and the figure of the rider but that it was m  frecoult the girl well knew since he had been garbed as an arab and he alone might be expected to seek her hiding place  that which she saw relieved the strain of the long night vigil but there was much that she did not see  she did not see the black face beneath the white hood nor the file of ebon horsemen beyond the trails bend riding slowly in the wake of their leader  these things she did not see at first and so she leaned downward toward the approaching rider a cry of welcome forming in her throat  at the first word the man looked up reining in in surprise and as she saw the black face of abdul mourak the abyssinian she shrank back in terror among the branches but it was too late  the man had seen her and now he called to her to descend  at first she refused but when a dozen black cavalrymen drew up behind their leader and at abdul mouraks command one of them started to climb the tree after her she realized that resistance was futile and came slowly down to stand upon the ground before this new captor and plead her cause in the name of justice and humanity  angered by recent defeat and by the loss of the gold the jewels and his prisoners abdul mourak was in no mood to be influenced by any appeal to those softer sentiments to which as a matter of fact he was almost a stranger even under the most favourable conditions  he looked for degradation and possible death in punishment for his failures and his misfortunes when he should have returned to his native land and made his report to menelek but an acceptable gift might temper the wrath of the emperor and surely this fair flower of another race should be gratefully received by the black ruler  when jane clayton had concluded her appeal abdul mourak replied briefly that he would promise her protection but that he must take her to his emperor  the girl did not need ask him why and once again hope died within her breast  resignedly she permitted herself to be lifted to a seat behind one of the troopers and again under new masters her journey was resumed toward what she now began to believe was her inevitable fate  abdul mourak bereft of his guides by the battle he had waged against the raiders and himself unfamiliar with the country had wandered far from the trail he should have followed and as a result had made but little progress toward the north since the beginning of his flight today he was beating toward the west in the hope of coming upon a village where he might obtain guides but night found him still as far from a realization of his hopes as had the rising sun  it was a dispirited company which went into camp waterless and hungry in the dense jungle  attracted by the horses lions roared about the boma and to their hideous din was added the shrill neighs of the terrorstricken beasts they hunted  there was little sleep for man or beast and the sentries were doubled that there might be enough on duty both to guard against the sudden charge of an overbold or overhungry lion and to keep the fire blazing which was an even more effectual barrier against them than the thorny boma  it was well past midnight and as yet jane clayton notwithstanding that she had passed a sleepless night the night before had scarcely more than dozed  a sense of impending danger seemed to hang like a black pall over the camp  the veteran troopers of the black emperor were nervous and ill at ease  abdul mourak left his blankets a dozen times to pace restlessly back and forth between the tethered horses and the crackling fire  the girl could see his great frame silhouetted against the lurid glare of the flames and she guessed from the quick nervous movements of the man that he was afraid  the roaring of the lions rose in sudden fury until the earth trembled to the hideous chorus  the horses shrilled their neighs of terror as they lay back upon their halter ropes in their mad endeavors to break loose  a trooper braver than his fellows leaped among the kicking plunging fearmaddened beasts in a futile attempt to quiet them  a lion large and fierce and courageous leaped almost to the boma full in the bright light from the fire  a sentry raised his piece and fired and the little leaden pellet unstoppered the vials of hell upon the terrorstricken camp  the shot ploughed a deep and painful furrow in the lions side arousing all the bestial fury of the little brain but abating not a whit the power and vigor of the great body  unwounded the boma and the flames might have turned him back but now the pain and the rage wiped caution from his mind and with a loud and angry roar he topped the barrier with an easy leap and was among the horses  what had been pandemonium before became now an indescribable tumult of hideous sound  the stricken horse upon which the lion leaped shrieked out its terror and its agony  several about it broke their tethers and plunged madly about the camp  men leaped from their blankets and with guns ready ran toward the picket line and then from the jungle beyond the boma a dozen lions emboldened by the example of their fellow charged fearlessly upon the camp  singly and in twos and threes they leaped the boma until the little enclosure was filled with cursing men and screaming horses battling for their lives with the greeneyed devils of the jungle  with the charge of the first lion jane clayton had scrambled to her feet and now she stood horrorstruck at the scene of savage slaughter that swirled and eddied about her  once a bolting horse knocked her down and a moment later a lion leaping in pursuit of another terrorstricken animal brushed her so closely that she was again thrown from her feet  amidst the cracking of the rifles and the growls of the carnivora rose the death screams of stricken men and horses as they were dragged down by the bloodmad cats  the leaping carnivora and the plunging horses prevented any concerted action by the abyssiniansit was every man for himselfand in the melee the defenseless woman was either forgotten or ignored by her black captors  a score of times was her life menaced by charging lions by plunging horses or by the wildly fired bullets of the frightened troopers yet there was no chance of escape for now with the fiendish cunning of their kind the tawny hunters commenced to circle about their prey hemming them within a ring of mighty yellow fangs and sharp long talons  again and again an individual lion would dash suddenly among the frightened men and horses and occasionally a horse goaded to frenzy by pain or terror succeeded in racing safely through the circling lions leaping the boma and escaping into the jungle but for the men and the woman no such escape was possible  a horse struck by a stray bullet fell beside jane clayton a lion leaped across the expiring beast full upon the breast of a black trooper just beyond  the man clubbed his rifle and struck futilely at the broad head and then he was down and the carnivore was standing above him  shrieking out his terror the soldier clawed with puny fingers at the shaggy breast in vain endeavor to push away the grinning jaws  the lion lowered his head the gaping fangs closed with a single sickening crunch upon the feardistorted face and turning strode back across the body of the dead horse dragging his limp and bloody burden with him  wideeyed the girl stood watching  she saw the carnivore step upon the corpse stumblingly as the grisly thing swung between its forepaws and her eyes remained fixed in fascination while the beast passed within a few paces of her  the interference of the body seemed to enrage the lion  he shook the inanimate clay venomously  he growled and roared hideously at the dead insensate thing and then he dropped it and raised his head to look about in search of some living victim upon which to wreak his ill temper  his yellow eyes fastened themselves balefully upon the figure of the girl the bristling lips raised disclosing the grinning fangs a terrific roar broke from the savage throat and the great beast crouched to spring upon this new and helpless victim  quiet had fallen early upon the camp where tarzan and werper lay securely bound  two nervous sentries paced their beats their eyes rolling often toward the impenetrable shadows of the gloomy jungle the others slept or tried to sleepall but the apeman  silently and powerfully he strained at the bonds which fettered his wrists  the muscles knotted beneath the smooth brown skin of his arms and shoulders the veins stood out upon his temples from the force of his exertionsa strand parted another and another and one hand was free then from the jungle came a low guttural and the apeman became suddenly a silent rigid statue with ears and nostrils straining to span the black void where his eyesight could not reach  again came the uncanny sound from the thick verdure beyond the camp  a sentry halted abruptly straining his eyes into the gloom  the kinky wool upon his head stiffened and raised  he called to his comrade in a hoarse whisper  did you hear it he asked  the other came closer trembling  hear what  again was the weird sound repeated followed almost immediately by a similar and answering sound from the camp  the sentries drew close together watching the black spot from which the voice seemed to come  trees overhung the boma at this point which was upon the opposite side of the camp from them  they dared not approach  their terror even prevented them from arousing their fellowsthey could only stand in frozen fear and watch for the fearsome apparition they momentarily expected to see leap from the jungle  nor had they long to wait  a dim bulky form dropped lightly from the branches of a tree into the camp  at sight of it one of the sentries recovered command of his muscles and his voice  screaming loudly to awaken the sleeping camp he leaped toward the flickering watch fire and threw a mass of brush upon it  the white officer and the black soldiers sprang from their blankets the flames leaped high upon the rejuvenated fire lighting the entire camp and the awakened men shrank back in superstitious terror from the sight that met their frightened and astonished vision  a dozen huge and hairy forms loomed large beneath the trees at the far side of the enclosure  the white giant one hand freed had struggled to his knees and was calling to the frightful nocturnal visitors in a hideous medley of bestial gutturals barkings and growlings  werper had managed to sit up  he too saw the savage faces of the approaching anthropoids and scarcely knew whether to be relieved or terrorstricken  growling the great apes leaped forward toward tarzan and werper chulk led them  the belgian officer called to his men to fire upon the intruders but the negroes held back filled as they were with superstitious terror of the hairy treemen and with the conviction that the white giant who could thus summon the beasts of the jungle to his aid was more than human  drawing his own weapon the officer fired and tarzan fearing the effect of the noise upon his really timid friends called to them to hasten and fulfill his commands  a couple of the apes turned and fled at the sound of the firearm but chulk and a half dozen others waddled rapidly forward and following the apemans directions seized both him and werper and bore them off toward the jungle  by dint of threats reproaches and profanity the belgian officer succeeded in persuading his trembling command to fire a volley after the retreating apes  a ragged straggling volley it was but at least one of its bullets found a mark for as the jungle closed about the hairy rescuers chulk who bore werper across one broad shoulder staggered and fell  in an instant he was up again but the belgian guessed from his unsteady gait that he was hard hit  he lagged far behind the others and it was several minutes after they had halted at tarzans command before he came slowly up to them reeling from side to side and at last falling again beneath the weight of his burden and the shock of his wound  as chulk went down he dropped werper so that the latter fell face downward with the body of the ape lying half across him  in this position the belgian felt something resting against his hands which were still bound at his backsomething that was not a part of the hairy body of the ape  mechanically the mans fingers felt of the object resting almost in their graspit was a soft pouch filled with small hard particles werper gasped in wonderment as recognition filtered through the incredulity of his mind  it was impossible and yetit was true  feverishly he strove to remove the pouch from the ape and transfer it to his own possession but the restricted radius to which his bonds held his hands prevented this though he did succeed in tucking the pouch with its precious contents inside the waist band of his trousers  tarzan sitting at a short distance was busy with the remaining knots of the cords which bound him  presently he flung aside the last of them and rose to his feet  approaching werper he knelt beside him for a moment he examined the ape  quite dead he announced  it is too badhe was a splendid creature and then he turned to the work of liberating the belgian  he freed his hands first and then commenced upon the knots at his ankles  i can do the rest said the belgian  i have a small pocketknife which they overlooked when they searched me and in this way he succeeded in ridding himself of the apemans attentions that he might find and open his little knife and cut the thong which fastened the pouch about chulks shoulder and transfer it from his waist band to the breast of his shirt  then he rose and approached tarzan  once again had avarice claimed him  forgotten were the good intentions which the confidence of jane clayton in his honor had awakened  what she had done the little pouch had undone  how it had come upon the person of the great ape werper could not imagine unless it had been that the anthropoid had witnessed his fight with achmet zek seen the arab with the pouch and taken it away from him but that this pouch contained the jewels of opar werper was positive and that was all that interested him greatly  now said the apeman keep your promise to me  lead me to the spot where you last saw my wife  it was slow work pushing through the jungle in the dead of night behind the slowmoving belgian  the apeman chafed at the delay but the european could not swing through the trees as could his more agile and muscular companions and so the speed of all was limited to that of the slowest  the apes trailed out behind the two white men for a matter of a few miles but presently their interest lagged the foremost of them halted in a little glade and the others stopped at his side  there they sat peering from beneath their shaggy brows at the figures of the two men forging steadily ahead until the latter disappeared in the leafy trail beyond the clearing  then an ape sought a comfortable couch beneath a tree and one by one the others followed his example so that werper and tarzan continued their journey alone nor was the latter either surprised or concerned  the two had gone but a short distance beyond the glade where the apes had deserted them when the roaring of distant lions fell upon their ears  the apeman paid no attention to the familiar sounds until the crack of a rifle came faintly from the same direction and when this was followed by the shrill neighing of horses and an almost continuous fusillade of shots intermingled with increased and savage roaring of a large troop of lions he became immediately concerned  someone is having trouble over there he said turning toward werper ill have to go to themthey may be friends  your wife might be among them suggested the belgian for since he had again come into possession of the pouch he had become fearful and suspicious of the apeman and in his mind had constantly revolved many plans for eluding this giant englishman who was at once his savior and his captor  at the suggestion tarzan started as though struck with a whip  god he cried she might be and the lions are attacking themthey are in the camp  i can tell from the screams of the horsesand there that was the cry of a man in his death agonies  stay here mani will come back for you  i must go first to them and swinging into a tree the lithe figure swung rapidly off into the night with the speed and silence of a disembodied spirit  for a moment werper stood where the apeman had left him  then a cunning smile crossed his lips  stay here he asked himself  stay here and wait until you return to find and take these jewels from me not i my friend not i and turning abruptly eastward albert werper passed through the foliage of a hanging vine and out of the sight of his fellowmanforever     24  home   as tarzan of the apes hurtled through the trees the discordant sounds of the battle between the abyssinians and the lions smote more and more distinctly upon his sensitive ears redoubling his assurance that the plight of the human element of the conflict was critical indeed  at last the glare of the camp fire shone plainly through the intervening trees and a moment later the giant figure of the apeman paused upon an overhanging bough to look down upon the bloody scene of carnage below  his quick eye took in the whole scene with a single comprehending glance and stopped upon the figure of a woman standing facing a great lion across the carcass of a horse  the carnivore was crouching to spring as tarzan discovered the tragic tableau  numa was almost beneath the branch upon which the apeman stood naked and unarmed  there was not even an instants hesitation upon the part of the latterit was as though he had not even paused in his swift progress through the trees so lightninglike his survey and comprehension of the scene below himso instantaneous his consequent action  so hopeless had seemed her situation to her that jane clayton but stood in lethargic apathy awaiting the impact of the huge body that would hurl her to the groundawaiting the momentary agony that cruel talons and grisly fangs may inflict before the coming of the merciful oblivion which would end her sorrow and her suffering  what use to attempt escape  as well face the hideous end as to be dragged down from behind in futile flight  she did not even close her eyes to shut out the frightful aspect of that snarling face and so it was that as she saw the lion preparing to charge she saw too a bronzed and mighty figure leap from an overhanging tree at the instant that numa rose in his spring  wide went her eyes in wonder and incredulity as she beheld this seeming apparition risen from the dead  the lion was forgottenher own perileverything save the wondrous miracle of this strange recrudescence  with parted lips with palms tight pressed against her heaving bosom the girl leaned forward largeeyed enthralled by the vision of her dead mate  she saw the sinewy form leap to the shoulder of the lion hurtling against the leaping beast like a huge animate battering ram  she saw the carnivore brushed aside as he was almost upon her and in the instant she realized that no substanceless wraith could thus turn the charge of a maddened lion with brute force greater than the brutes  tarzan her tarzan lived  a cry of unspeakable gladness broke from her lips only to die in terror as she saw the utter defenselessness of her mate and realized that the lion had recovered himself and was turning upon tarzan in mad lust for vengeance  at the apemans feet lay the discarded rifle of the dead abyssinian whose mutilated corpse sprawled where numa had abandoned it  the quick glance which had swept the ground for some weapon of defense discovered it and as the lion reared upon his hind legs to seize the rash manthing who had dared interpose its puny strength between numa and his prey the heavy stock whirred through the air and splintered upon the broad forehead  not as an ordinary mortal might strike a blow did tarzan of the apes strike but with the maddened frenzy of a wild beast backed by the steel thews which his wild arboreal boyhood had bequeathed him  when the blow ended the splintered stock was driven through the splintered skull into the savage brain and the heavy iron barrel was bent into a rude v  in the instant that the lion sank lifeless to the ground jane clayton threw herself into the eager arms of her husband  for a brief instant he strained her dear form to his breast and then a glance about him awakened the apeman to the dangers which still surrounded them  upon every hand the lions were still leaping upon new victims fearmaddened horses still menaced them with their erratic bolting from one side of the enclosure to the other  bullets from the guns of the defenders who remained alive but added to the perils of their situation  to remain was to court death  tarzan seized jane clayton and lifted her to a broad shoulder  the blacks who had witnessed his advent looked on in amazement as they saw the naked giant leap easily into the branches of the tree from whence he had dropped so uncannily upon the scene and vanish as he had come bearing away their prisoner with him  they were too well occupied in selfdefense to attempt to halt him nor could they have done so other than by the wasting of a precious bullet which might be needed the next instant to turn the charge of a savage foe  and so unmolested tarzan passed from the camp of the abyssinians from which the din of conflict followed him deep into the jungle until distance gradually obliterated it entirely  back to the spot where he had left werper went the apeman joy in his heart now where fear and sorrow had so recently reigned and in his mind a determination to forgive the belgian and aid him in making good his escape  but when he came to the place werper was gone and though tarzan called aloud many times he received no reply  convinced that the man had purposely eluded him for reasons of his own john clayton felt that he was under no obligations to expose his wife to further danger and discomfort in the prosecution of a more thorough search for the missing belgian  he has acknowledged his guilt by his flight jane he said  we will let him go to lie in the bed that he has made for himself  straight as homing pigeons the two made their way toward the ruin and desolation that had once been the center of their happy lives and which was soon to be restored by the willing black hands of laughing laborers made happy again by the return of the master and mistress whom they had mourned as dead  past the village of achmet zek their way led them and there they found but the charred remains of the palisade and the native huts still smoking as mute evidence of the wrath and vengeance of a powerful enemy  the waziri commented tarzan with a grim smile  god bless them cried jane clayton  they cannot be far ahead of us said tarzan basuli and the others the gold is gone and the jewels of opar jane but we have each other and the waziriand we have love and loyalty and friendship  and what are gold and jewels to these  if only poor mugambi lived she replied and those other brave fellows who sacrificed their lives in vain endeavor to protect me  in the silence of mingled joy and sorrow they passed along through the familiar jungle and as the afternoon was waning there came faintly to the ears of the apeman the murmuring cadence of distant voices  we are nearing the waziri jane he said  i can hear them ahead of us  they are going into camp for the night i imagine  a half hour later the two came upon a horde of ebon warriors which basuli had collected for his war of vengeance upon the raiders  with them were the captured women of the tribe whom they had found in the village of achmet zek and tall even among the giant waziri loomed a familiar black form at the side of basuli  it was mugambi whom jane had thought dead amidst the charred ruins of the bungalow  ah such a reunion  long into the night the dancing and the singing and the laughter awoke the echoes of the somber wood  again and again were the stories of their various adventures retold  again and once again they fought their battles with savage beast and savage man and dawn was already breaking when basuli for the fortieth time narrated how he and a handful of his warriors had watched the battle for the golden ingots which the abyssinians of abdul mourak had waged against the arab raiders of achmet zek and how when the victors had ridden away they had sneaked out of the river reeds and stolen away with the precious ingots to hide them where no robber eye ever could discover them  pieced out from the fragments of their various experiences with the belgian the truth concerning the malign activities of albert werper became apparent  only lady greystoke found aught to praise in the conduct of the man and it was difficult even for her to reconcile his many heinous acts with this one evidence of chivalry and honor  deep in the soul of every man said tarzan must lurk the germ of righteousness  it was your own virtue jane rather even than your helplessness which awakened for an instant the latent decency of this degraded man  in that one act he retrieved himself and when he is called to face his maker may it outweigh in the balance all the sins he has committed  and jane clayton breathed a fervent amen  months had passed  the labor of the waziri and the gold of opar had rebuilt and refurnished the wasted homestead of the greystokes  once more the simple life of the great african farm went on as it had before the coming of the belgian and the arab  forgotten were the sorrows and dangers of yesterday  for the first time in months lord greystoke felt that he might indulge in a holiday and so a great hunt was organized that the faithful laborers might feast in celebration of the completion of their work  in itself the hunt was a success and ten days after its inauguration a wellladen safari took up its return march toward the waziri plain lord and lady greystoke with basuli and mugambi rode together at the head of the column laughing and talking together in that easy familiarity which common interests and mutual respect breed between honest and intelligent men of any races  jane claytons horse shied suddenly at an object half hidden in the long grasses of an open space in the jungle  tarzans keen eyes sought quickly for an explanation of the animals action  what have we here he cried swinging from his saddle and a moment later the four were grouped about a human skull and a little litter of whitened human bones  tarzan stooped and lifted a leathern pouch from the grisly relics of a man  the hard outlines of the contents brought an exclamation of surprise to his lips  the jewels of opar he cried holding the pouch aloft and pointing to the bones at his feet all that remains of werper the belgian  mugambi laughed  look within bwana he cried and you will see what are the jewels of oparyou will see what the belgian gave his life for and the black laughed aloud  why do you laugh asked tarzan  because replied mugambi i filled the belgians pouch with river gravel before i escaped the camp of the abyssinians whose prisoners we were  i left the belgian only worthless stones while i brought away with me the jewels he had stolen from you  that they were afterward stolen from me while i slept in the jungle is my shame and my disgrace but at least the belgian lost themopen his pouch and you will see  tarzan untied the thong which held the mouth of the leathern bag closed and permitted the contents to trickle slowly forth into his open palm  mugambis eyes went wide at the sight and the others uttered exclamations of surprise and incredulity for from the rusty and weatherworn pouch ran a stream of brilliant scintillating gems  the jewels of opar cried tarzan  but how did werper come by them again  none could answer for both chulk and werper were dead and no other knew  poor devil said the apeman as he swung back into his saddle even in death he has made restitutionlet his sins lie with his bones
