history     preface   never shall i forget the moment when for the last time i gazed upon the manly features of charles kingsley features which death had rendered calm grand sublime  the constant struggle that in life seemed to allow no rest to his expression the spirit like a caged lion shaking the bars of his prison the mind striving for utterance the soul wearying for loving responseall that was over  there remained only the satisfied expression of triumph and peace as of a soldier who had fought a good fight and who while sinking into the stillness of the slumber of death listens to the distant sounds of music and to the shouts of victory  one saw the ideal man as nature had meant him to be and one felt that there is no greater sculptor than death  as one looked on that marble statue which only some weeks ago had so warmly pressed ones hand his whole life flashed through ones thoughts one remembered the young curate and the saints tragedy the chartist parson and alton locke the happy poet and the sands of dee the brilliant novelwriter and hypatia and westwardho the rector of eversley and his village sermons the beloved professor at cambridge the busy canon at chester the powerful preacher in westminster abbey  one thought of him by the berkshire chalkstreams and on the devonshire coast watching the beauty and wisdom of nature reading her solemn lessons chuckling too over her inimitable fun  one saw him in townalleys preaching the gospel of godliness and cleanliness while smoking his pipe with soldiers and navvies  one heard him in drawing rooms listened to with patient silence till one of his vigorous or quaint speeches bounded forth never to be forgotten  how children delighted in him  how young wild men believed in him and obeyed him too  how women were captivated by his chivalry older men by his genuine humility and sympathy  all that was now passing awaywas gone  but as one looked on him for the last time on earth one felt that greater than the curate the poet the professor the canon had been the man himself with his warm heart his honest purposes his trust in his friends his readiness to spend himself his chivalry and humility worthy of a better age  of all this the world knew littleyet few men excited wider and stronger sympathies  who can forget that funeral on the 28th jan 1875 and the large sad throng that gathered round his grave  there was the representative of the prince of wales and close by the gipsies of the eversley common who used to call him their patricorai their priestking  there was the old squire of his village and the labourers young and old to whom he had been a friend and a father  there were governors of distant colonies officers and sailors the bishop of his diocese and the dean of his abbey there were the leading nonconformists of the neighbourhood and his own devoted curates peers and members of the house of commons authors and publishers and outside the churchyard the horses and the hounds and the huntsman in pink for though as good a clergyman as any charles kingsley had been a good sportsman too and had taken in his life many a fence as bravely as he took the last fence of all without fear or trembling  all that he had loved and all that had loved him was there and few eyes were dry when he was laid in his own yellow gravel bed the old trees which he had planted and cared for waving their branches to him for the last time and the grey sunny sky looking down with calm pity on the deserted rectory and on the short joys and the shorter sufferings of mortal men  all went home feeling that life was poorer and every one knew that he had lost a friend who had been in some peculiar sense his own  charles kingsley will be missed in england in the english colonies in america where he spent his last happy year aye wherever saxon speech and saxon thought is understood  he will be mourned for yearned for in every place in which he passed some days of his busy life  as to myself i feel as if another cable had snapped that tied me to this hospitable shore  when an author or a poet dies the better part of him it is often said is left in his works  so it is in many cases  but with kingsley his life and his works were one  all he wrote was meant for the day when he wrote it  that was enough for him  he hardly gave himself time to think of fame and the future  compared with a good work done with a good word spoken with a silent grasp of the hand from a young man he had saved from mischief or with a thank you sir from a poor woman to whom he had been a comfort he would have despised what people call glory like incense curling away in smoke  he was in one sense of the word a careless writer  he did his best at the time and for the time  he did it with a concentrated energy of will which broke through all difficulties  in his flights of imagination in the light and fire of his language he had few equals if any but the perfection and classical finish which can be obtained by a sustained effort only and by a patience which shrinks from no drudgery these are wanting in most of his works  however fame for which he cared so little has come to him  his bust will stand in westminster abbey in the chapel of st john the baptist by the side of his friend frederick maurice and in the temple of fame which will be consecrated to the period of victoria and albert there will be a niche for charles kingsley the author of alton locke and hypatia  sooner or later a complete edition of his works will be wanted though we may doubt whether he himself would have wished all his literary works to be preserved  from what i knew of him and his marvellous modesty i should say decidedly not  i doubt more especially whether he would have wished the present book the roman and the teuton to be handed down to posterity  none of his books was so severely criticised as this volume of lectures delivered before the university of cambridge and published in 1864  he himself did not republish it and it seems impossible to speak in more depreciatory terms of his own historical studies than he does himself again and again in the course of his lectures  yet these lectures it should be remembered were more largely attended than almost any other lectures at cambridge  they produced a permanent impression on many a young mind  they are asked for again and again and when the publishers wished for my advice as to the expediency of bringing out a new and cheaper edition i could not hesitate as to what answer to give  i am not so blinded by my friendship for kingsley as to say that these lectures are throughout what academical lectures ought to be  i only wish some one would tell me what academical lectures at oxford and cambridge can be as long as the present system of teaching and examining is maintained  it is easy to say what these lectures are not  they do not profess to contain the results of long continued original research they are not based on a critical appreciation of the authorities which had to be consulted  they are not well arranged systematic or complete all this the suddenly elected professor of history at cambridge would have been the first to grant  i am not here he says to teach you history  i am here to teach you how to teach yourselves history  i must say even more  it seems to me that these lectures were not always written in a perfectly impartial and judicial spirit and that occasionally they are unjust to the historians who from no other motive but a sincere regard for truth thought it their duty to withhold their assent from many of the commonly received statements of mediaeval chroniclers  but for all that let us see what these lectures are and whether there is not room for them by the side of other works  first of all according to the unanimous testimony of those who heard them delivered at cambridge they stirred up the interest of young men and made them ask for books which undergraduates had never asked for before at the university libraries  they made many people who read them afterwards take a new interest in old and halfforgotten kings and battles and they extorted even from unfriendly critics the admission that certain chapters such as for instance the monk as a civiliser displayed in an unexpected way his power of appreciating the good points in characters otherwise most antipathic to the apostle of manly christianity  they contain in fact the thoughts of a poet a moralist a politician a theologian and before all of a friend and counsellor of young men while reading for them and with them one of the most awful periods in the history of mankind the agonies of a dying empire and the birth of new nationalities  history was but his text his chief aim was that of the teacher and preacher and as an eloquent interpreter of the purposes of history before an audience of young men to whom history is but too often a mere succession of events to be learnt by heart and to be ready against periodical examinations he achieved what he wished to achieve  historians by profession would naturally be incensed at some portions of this book but even they would probably admit by this time that there are in it whole chapters full of excellence telling passages happy delineations shrewd remarks powerful outbreaks of real eloquence which could not possibly be consigned to oblivion  nor would it have been possible to attempt to introduce any alterations or to correct what may seem to be mistakes  the book is not meant as a textbook or as an authority any more than schillers history of the thirty years war it should be read in future as what it was meant to be from the first kingsleys thoughts on some of the moral problems presented by the conflict between the roman and the teuton  one cannot help wishing that instead of lectures kingsley had given us another novel like hypatia or a real historical tragedy a dietrich von bern embodying in living characters one of the fiercest struggles of humanity the death of the roman the birth of the german world  let me quote here what bunsen said of kingsleys dramatic power many years ago  i do not hesitate he writes to call these two works the saints tragedy and hypatia by far the most important and perfect of this genial writer  in these more particularly i find the justification of a hope which i beg to be allowed to expressthat kingsley might continue shakspeares historical plays  i have for several years made no secret of it that kingsley seems to me the genius of our century called to place by the side of that sublime dramatic series from king john to henry viii another series of equal rank from edward vi to the landing of william of orange  this is the only historical development of europe which unites in itself all vital elements and which we might look upon without overpowering pain  the tragedy of st elizabeth shows that kingsley can grapple not only with the novel but with the more severe rules of dramatic art  and hypatia proves on the largest scale that he can discover in the picture of the historical past the truly human the deep the permanent and that he knows how to represent it  how with all this he can hit the fresh tone of popular life and draw humourous characters and complications with shakspearian energy is proved by all his works  and why should he not undertake this great task  there is a time when the true poet the prophet of the present must bid farewell to the questions of the day which seem so great because they are so near but are in truth but small and unpoetical  he must say to himself let the dead bury their deadand the time has come that kingsley should do so  a great deal has been written on mistakes which kingsley was supposed to have made in these lectures but i doubt whether these criticisms were always perfectly judicial and fair  for instance kingsleys using the name of dietrich instead of theodoric was represented as the very gem of a blunder and some critics went so far as to hint that he had taken theodoric for a greek word as an adjective of theodorus  this of course was only meant as a joke for on page 120 kingsley had said in a note that the name of theodoric theuderic dietrich signifies king of nations  he therefore knew perfectly well that theodoric was simply a greek adaptation of the gothic name theodereiks theod meaning people reiks according to grimm princeps 1  but even if he had called the king theodorus the mistake would not have been unpardonable for he might have appealed to the authority of gregory of tours who uses not only theodoricus but also theodorus as the same name  a more serious charge however was brought against him for having used the highgerman form dietrich instead of the original form theodereiks or theoderic or even theodoric  should i have altered this  i believe not for it is clear to me that kingsley had his good reasons for preferring dietrich to theodoric  he introduces him first to his hearers as theodoric known in german song as dietrich of bern  he had spoken before of the visigothic theodoric and of him he never speaks as dietrich  then why should he have adopted this highgerman name for the great theodoric and why should he speak of attila too as etzel  one of the greatest of german historians johannes von muller does the same  he always calls theodoric dietrich of bern and though he gives no reasons for it his reasons can easily be guessed  soon after theodorics death the influence of the german legends on history and of history on the german legends became so great that it was impossible for a time to disentangle two characters originally totally distinct viz thjodrekr of the edda the dietrich of the german poetry on one side and the king of the goths theodoric on the other  what had long been said and sung about thjodrekr and dietrich was believed to have happened to king theodoric while at the same time historical and local elements in the life of theodoric residing at verona were absorbed by the legends of thjodrekr and dietrich  the names of the legendary hero and the historical king were probably identical though even that is not quite certain 2 but at all events after theodorics death all the numerous dialectic varieties of the name whether in high or in lowgerman were understood by the people at large both of the hero and of the king  few names have had a larger number of alias  they have been carefully collected by graff grimm forstemann pott and others  i here give the principal varieties of this name as actually occurring in mss and arranged according to the changes of the principal consonants  1  with thd theudoricus theudericus greek text thiodiricus thiodericus thiodric thiodricus thiodrih theodoricus theodericus theoderic theodrich thiadric thiadrich thiedorik thiederic thiederik thiederich thiedorich thiedric thiedrich thideric thiederich thidrich thodericus thiaedric thieoderich thederich thedric  2  with td teudericus teudricus tiodericus teodoricus teodericus teodric teodrich tiadric tiedrik tiedrich tiedric tidericus tiderich tederich  3  with dd greek text diodericus deoderich deodrich diederich diderich  4  with tht thiotiricus thiotirih thiotiricus thiotrih theotoricus theotericus theoterih theotrih theotrich thiatric thieterich thietrih thietrich theatrih  5  with tt teutrich teoterih teotrich teotrih tieterich teatrih tiheiterich  6  with dt dioterih diotericus diotricus deotrich deotrih dieterih dieterich dietrich diterih ditricus  7  with thth theotherich theothirich  8  with tth deest  9  with dth dietherich  it is quite true that strictly speaking the forms with thd are low german and those with dt highgerman but before we trust ourselves to this division for historical purposes we must remember three facts 1 that proper names frequently defy grimms law 2 that in highgerman mss much depends on the locality in which they are written 3 that highgerman is not in the strict sense of the word a corruption of low german and at all events not as grimm supposed chronologically posterior to lowgerman but that the two are parallel dialects like doric and aeolic the lowgerman being represented by the earliest literary documents gothic and saxon the highgerman asserting its literary presence later not much before the eighth century but afterwards maintaining its literary and political supremacy from the time of charlemagne to the present day  when theodoric married odeflede the daughter of childebert and a sister of chlodwig i have little doubt that at the court of chlodwig or clovis his royal brotherinlaw was spoken of in conversation as dioterih although in official documents and in the history of gregory of tours he appears under his classical name of theodoricus in jornandes theodericus  those who with grimm 3 admit a transition of low into highgerman and deny that the change of gothic th into high german d took place before the sixth or seventh century will find it difficult to account in the first century for the name of deudorix a german captive the nephew of melo the sigambrian mentioned by strabo 4  in the oldest german poem in which the name of dietrich occurs the song of hildebrand and hadebrand written down in the beginning of the ninth century 5 we find both forms the lowgerman theotrih and the highgerman deotrih used side by side  very soon however when highgerman became the more prevalent language in germany german historians knew both of the old legendary hero and of the ostgothic king by one and the same name the highgerman dietrich  if therefore johannes von muller spoke of theodoric of verona as dietrich von bern he simply intended to carry on the historical tradition  he meant to remind his readers of the popular name which they all knew and to tell themthis dietrich with whom you are all acquainted from your childhood this dietrich of whom so much is said and sung in your legendary stories and poems the famous dietrich of bern this is really the theoderic the first german who ruled italy for thirtythree years more gloriously than any roman emperor before or after  i see no harm in this as long as it is done on purpose and as long as the purpose which johannes von muller had in his mind was attained  no doubt the best plan for an historian to follow is to call every man by the name by which he called himself  theodoric we know could not write but he had a gold plate 6 made in which the first four letters of his name were incised and when it was fixed on the paper the king drew his pen through the intervals  those four letters were greek text and though we should expect that as a goth he would have spelt his name thiudereik yet we have no right to doubt that the vowels were eo and not iu  but again and again historians spell proper names not as they were written by the people themselves but as they appear in the historical documents through which they became chiefly known  we speak of plato because we have roman literature between us and greece  american names are accepted in history through a spanish indian names through an english medium  the strictly old highgerman form of carolus magnus would be charal a s carl yet even in the oaths of strassburg 842 the name appears as karlus and as karl and has remained so ever since 7  in the same document we find ludher for lothar ludhuwig and lodhuvig for ludovicus the oldest form being chlodowich and who would lay down the law which of these forms shall be used for historical purposes  i have little doubt that kingsleys object in retaining the name dietrich for the ostgothic king was much the same as johannes von mullers  you know he meant to say of dietrich of bern of all the wonderful things told of him in the nibelunge and other german poems  well that is the dietrich of the german people that is what the germans themselves have made of him by transferring to their great gothic king some of the most incredible achievements of one of their oldest legendary heroes  they have changed even his name and as the children in the schools of germany 8 still speak of him as their dietrich von bern let him be to us too dietrich not simply the ostgothic theoderic but the german dietrich  i confess i see no harm in that though a few words on the strange mixture of legend and history might have been useful because the case of theodoric is one of the most luculent testimonies for that blending of fact and fancy in strictly historical times which people find it so difficult to believe but which offers the key and the only true key for many of the most perplexing problems both of history and of mythology  originally nothing could be more different than the dietrich of the old legend and the dietrich of history  the former is followed by misfortune through the whole of his life  he is oppressed in his youth by his uncle the famous ermanrich 9 he has to spend the greater part of his life thirty years in exile and only returns to his kingdom after the death of his enemy  yet whenever he is called dietrich of bern it is because the real theodoric the most successful of gothic conquerors ruled at verona  when his enemy was called otacher instead of sibich it is because the real theodoric conquered the real odoacer  when the king at whose court he passes his years of exile is called etzel it is because many german heroes had really taken refuge in the camp of attila that attila died two years before theodoric of verona was born is no difficulty to a popular poet nor even the still more glaring contradiction between the daring and ferocious character of the real attila and the cowardice of his namesake etzel as represented in the poem of the nibelunge  thus was legend quickened by history  on the other hand if historians such as gregory i dial iv 36 10 tell us that an italian hermit had been witness in a vision to the damnation of theodoric whose soul was plunged by the ministers of divine vengeance into the volcano of lipari one of the flaming mouths of the infernal world we may recognise in the heated imagination of the orthodox monk some recollection of the mysterious end of the legendary dietrich 11  later on the legendary and the real hero were so firmly welded together that as early as the twelfth century chroniclers are at their wits end how to reconcile facts and dates  ekkehard in his chronicon universale 12 which ends 1126 ad points out the chronological contradiction between jornandes who places the death of ermanrich long before attila and the popular story which makes him and dietrich the son of dietmar his contemporaries  otto von freising 13 in the first half of the twelfth century expresses the same perplexity when he finds that theodoric is made a contemporary of hermanricus and attila though it is certain that attila ruled long after hermanric and that after the death of attila theodoric when eight years old was given by his father as a hostage to the emperor leo  gottfried von viterbo 14 in the second half of the twelfth century expresses his difficulties in similar words  all these chroniclers who handed down the historical traditions of germany were highgermans and thus it has happened that in germany theodoric the great became dietrich as strataburgum became strassburg or turicum zurich  whether because english belongs to the low german branch it is less permissible to an english historian than to a german to adopt these highgerman names i cannot say all i wished to point out was that there was a very intelligible reason why kingsley should have preferred the popular and poetical name of dietrich even though it was highgerman either to his real gothic name theodereik or to its classical metamorphosis theodoricus or theodorus  some other mistakes too which have been pointed out did not seem to me so serious as to justify their correction in a posthumous edition  it was said for instance that kingsley ought not to have called odoacer and theodoric kings of italy as they were only lieutenants of the eastern caesar  cassiodorus however tells us that odoacer assumed the name of king nomen regis odoacer assumpsit and though gibbon points out that this may only mean that he assumed the abstract title of a king without applying it to any particular nation or country yet that great historian himself calls odoacer king of italy and shows how he was determined to abolish the useless and expensive office of vicegerent of the emperor  kingsley guesses very ingeniously that odoacers assumed title king of nations may have been the gothic theodereiks the very name of theodoric  as to theodoric himself kingsley surely knew his real status for he says why did he not set himself up as caesar of rome  why did he always consider himself as soninarms and quasivassal of the caesar of constantinople  lastly in speaking of the extinction of the western empire with romulus augustulus kingsley again simply followed the lead of gibbon and other historians nor can it be said that the expression is not perfectly legitimate however clearly modern research may have shown that the roman empire though dead lived  so much in defence or at all events in explanation of expressions and statements which have been pointed out as most glaring mistakes in kingsleys lectures  i think it must be clear that in all these cases alterations would have been impossible  there were other passages where i should gladly have altered or struck out whole lines particularly in the ethnological passages and in the attempted etymologies of german proper names  neither the one nor the other i believe are kingsleys own though i have tried in vain to find out whence he could possibly have taken them  these however are minor matters which are mentioned chiefly in order to guard against the impression that because i left them unchanged i approved of them  the permanent interest attaching to these lectures does not spring from the facts which they give  for these students will refer to gibbon  they will be valued chiefly for the thoughts which they contain for the imagination and eloquence which they display and last not least for the sake of the man a man it is true of a warm heart rather than of a cold judgment but a man whom for that very reason many admired many loved and many will miss almost every day of their life  m m     lecture ithe forest children   i wish in this first lecture to give you some general conception of the causes which urged our teutonic race to attack and destroy rome  i shall take for this one lecture no special textbook but suppose you all to be acquainted with the germania of tacitus and with the 9th chapter of gibbon  and i shall begin if you will allow me by a parable a myth a saga such as the men of whom i am going to tell you loved and if it seem to any of you childish bear in mind that what is childish need not therefore be shallow  i know that it is not history  these lectures will not be in the popular sense history at all  but i beg you to bear in mind that i am not here to teach you history  no man can do that  i am here to teach you how to teach yourselves history  i will give you the scaffolding as well as i can you must build the house  fancy to yourself a great trollgarden such as our forefathers dreamed of often fifteen hundred years agoa fairy palace with a fairy garden and all around the primaeval wood  inside the trolls dwell cunning and wicked watching their fairy treasures working at their magic forges making and making always things rare and strange and outside the forest is full of children such children as the world had never seen before but children still children in frankness and purity and affectionateness and tenderness of conscience and devout awe of the unseen and children too in fancy and silliness and ignorance and caprice and jealousy and quarrelsomeness and love of excitement and adventure and the mere sport of overflowing animal health  they play unharmed among the forest beasts and conquer them in their play but the forest is too dull and too poor for them and they wander to the walls of the trollgarden and wonder what is inside  one can conceive easily for oneself what from that moment would begin to happen  some of the more adventurous clamber in  some too the trolls steal and carry off into their palace  most never return but here and there one escapes out again and tells how the trolls killed all his comrades but tells too of the wonders he has seen inside of shoes of swiftness and swords of sharpness and caps of darkness of charmed harps charmed jewels and above all of the charmed wine and after all the trolls were very kind to himsee what fine clothes they have given himand he struts about awhile among his companions and then returns and not alone  the trolls have bewitched him as they will bewitch more  so the fame of the troll garden spreads and more and more steal in boys and maidens and tempt their comrades over the wall and tell of the jewels and the dresses and the wine the joyous maddening wine which equals men with gods and forget to tell how the trolls have bought them soul as well as body and taught them to be vain and lustful and slavish and tempted them too often to sins which have no name  but their better nature flashes out at times  they will not be the slaves and brutes in human form which the evil trolls would have them and they rebel and escape and tell of the horrors of that fair foul place  and then arises a noble indignation and war between the trolls and the forestchildren  but still the trolls can tempt and bribe the greedier or the more vain and still the wonders inside haunt their minds till it becomes a fixed idea among them all to conquer the garden for themselves and bedizen themselves in the fine clothes and drink their fill of the wine  again and again they break in but the trolls drive them out rebuild their walls keep off those outside by those whom they hold enslaved within till the boys grow to be youths and the youths men and still the trollgarden is not conquered and still it shall be  and the trolls have grown old and weak and their walls are crumbling away  perhaps they may succeed this timeperhaps next  and at last they do succeedthe fairy walls are breached the fairy palace stormedand the trolls are crouching at their feet and now all will be theirs gold jewels dresses arms all that the troll possessesexcept his cunning  for as each struggles into the charmed ground the spell of the place falls on him  he drinks the wine and it maddens him  he fills his arms with precious trumpery and another snatches it from his grasp  each envies the youth before him each crieswhy had i not the luck to enter first  and the trolls set them against each other and split them into parties each mad with excitement and jealousy and wine till they scarce know how each falls upon his fellow and all upon those who are crowding in from the forest and they fight and fight up and down the palace halls till their triumph has become a very feast of the lapithae and the trolls look on and laugh a wicked laugh as they tar them on to the unnatural fight till the gardens are all trampled the finery torn the halls dismantled and each pavement slippery with brothers blood and then when the wine is gone out of them the survivors come to their senses and stare shamefully and sadly round  what an ugly desolate tottering ruin the fairy palace has become  have they spoilt it themselves or have the trolls bewitched it  and all the fairy treasurewhat has become of it no man knows  have they thrown it away in their quarrel have the cunningest hidden it have the trolls flown away with it to the fairy land beyond the eastern mountains who can tell  nothing is left but recrimination and remorse  and they wander back again into the forest away from the doleful ruin carrionstrewn to sulk each apart over some petty spoil which he has saved from the general wreck hating and dreading each the sound of his neighbours footstep  what will become of the forest children unless some kind saint or hermit comes among them to bind them in the holy bonds of brotherhood and law  this is my saga gentlemen and it is a true one withal  for it is neither more nor less than the story of the teutonic tribes and how they overthrew the empire of rome  menzel who though he may not rank very high as a historian has at least a true german heart opens his history with a striking passage  the sages of the east were teaching wisdom beneath the palms the merchants of tyre and carthage were weighing their heavy anchors and spreading their purple sails for far seas the greek was making the earth fair by his art and the roman founding his colossal empire of force while the teuton sat yet a child unknown and naked among the forest beasts and yet unharmed and in his sport he lorded it over them for the child was of a royal race and destined to win glory for all time to come  to the strange and complicated education which god appointed for this race and by which he has fitted it to become at least for many centuries henceforth the ruling race of the world i wish to call your attention in my future lectures  today i wish to impress strongly on your minds this childishness of our forefathers  for good or for evil they were great boys very noble boys very often very naughty boysas boys with the strength of men might well be  try to conceive such to yourselves and you have the old markman allman goth lombard saxon frank  and the notion may be more than a mere metaphor  races like individuals it has been often said may have their childhood their youth their manhood their old age and natural death  it is but a theoryperhaps nothing more  but at least our race had its childhood their virtues and their sad failings and failures i can understand on no other theory  the nearest type which we can see now is i fancy the english sailor or the english navvy  a great simple honest babyfull of power and fun very coarse and plain spoken at times but if treated like a human being most affectionate susceptible even sentimental and superstitious fond of gambling brute excitement childish amusements in the intervals of enormous exertion quarrelsome among themselves as boys are and with a spirit of wild independence which seems to be strength but which till it be disciplined into loyal obedience and selfsacrifice is mere weakness and beneath all a deep practical shrewdness an indomitable perseverance when once roused by need  such a spirit as we see to this day in the english sailorthat is the nearest analogue i can find now  one gets hints here and there of what manner of men they were from the evil day when one hundred and two years before christ the kempers and teutons ranging over the alps toward italy 300000 armed men and 15000 mailed knights with broad sword and lances and in their helmets the same bullshorns wings and feathers which one sees now in the crests of german princes stumbled upon marius and his romans and were destroyed utterly first the men then the women who like true women as they were rather than give up their honour to the romans hung themselves on the horns of the waggonoxen and were trampled to death beneath their feet and then the very dogs who fought on when men and women were all slainfrom that fatal day down to the glorious one when five hundred years after alaric stood beneath the walls of rome and to their despairing boast of the roman numbers answered come out to us then the thicker the hay the easier mowedfor five hundred years i say the hints of their character are all those of a boynature  they were cruel at times but so are boysmuch more cruel than grown men i hardly know whyperhaps because they have not felt suffering so much themselves and know not how hard it is to bear  there were varieties of character among them  the franks were always false vain capricious selfish taking part with the romans whenever their interest or vanity was at stakethe worst of all teutons though by no means the weakestand a miserable business they made of it in france for some five hundred years  the goths salvian says were the most ignavi of all of them great lazy lourdans apt to be cruel too the visigoths at least as their spanish descendants proved to the horror of the world but men of honour withal as those old spaniards were  the saxons were famed for crueltyi know not why for our branch of the saxons has been from the beginning of history the least cruel people in europe but they had the reputationas the vandals had alsoof being the most pure castitate venerandi  and among the uncivilized people coldness and cruelty go often together  the less passionate and sensitive the nature the less open to pity  the caribs of the west indies were famed for both in contrast to the profligate and gentle inhabitants of cuba and hispaniola and in double contrast to the red indian tribes of north america who combined from our first acquaintance with them the two vices of cruelty and profligacy to an extent which has done more to extirpate them than all the firewater of the white man  but we must be careful how we compare our forefathers with these or any other savages  those who like gibbon have tried to draw a parallel between the red indian and the primaeval teuton have done so at the expense of facts  first they have overlooked the broad fact that while the red indians have been ever since we have known them a decreasing race the teutons have been a rapidly increasing one in spite of war and famine and all the ills of a precarious forest life proving their youthful strength and vitality by a reproduction unparalleled as far as i know in history save perhaps by that noble and young race the russian  these writers have not known that the teuton had his definite laws more simple doubtless in the time of tacitus than in that of justinian but still founded on abstract principles so deep and broad that they form the groundwork of our english laws and constitution that the teuton creed concerning the unseen world and divine beings was of a loftiness and purity as far above the silly legends of hiawatha as the teuton morals were above those of a sioux or a comanche  let any one read honest accounts of the red indians let him read catlin james lewis and clarke shoolbred and first and best of all the old travaile in virginia published by the hakluyt society and then let him read the germania of tacitus and judge for himself  for my part i believe that if gibbon was right and if our forefathers in the german forests had been like powhattans people as we found them in the virginian forests the romans would not have been long in civilizing us off the face of the earth  no  all the notes which tacitus gives us are notes of a young and strong race unconscious of its own capabilities but possessing such capabilities that the observant romans saw at once with dread and awe that they were face to face with such a people as they had never met before that in their hands sooner or later might be the fate of rome mad caracalla aping the teuton dress and hair listening in dread to the songs of the allman alrunas telling the teutons that they ought to come over the rhine and destroy the empire and then murdering the interpreters lest they should repeat his words was but babbling out in an insane shape the thought which was brooding in the most farseeing roman minds  he felt that they could have done the deed and he felt rightly madman as he was  they could have done it then if physical power and courage were all that was needed in the days of the allman war  they could have done it a few years before when the markmen fought marcus aurelius antoninus on the day when the caesar at the advice of his augurs sent two lions to swim across the danube as a test of victory and the simple markmen took them for big dogs and killed them with their clubs  from that day indeed the teutons began to conquer slowly but surely  though antoninus beat the markmen on the danube and recovered 100000 roman prisoners yet it was only by the help of the vandals from that day the empire was doomed and the teutons only kept at bay by bribing one tribe to fight another or by enlisting their more adventurous spirits into the roman legions to fight against men of their own blooda shortsighted and suicidal policy for by that very method they were teaching the teuton all he needed the discipline and the military science of the roman  but the teutons might have done it a hundred years before that when rome was in a death agony and vitellius and vespasian were struggling for the purple and civilis and the fair velleda like barak and deborah of old raised the teuton tribes  they might have done it before that again when hermann slew varus and his legions in the teutoburger wald or before that again when the kempers and teutons burst over the alps to madden themselves with the fatal wines of the rich south  and why did the teutons not do it  because they were boys fighting against cunning men  boiorich the young kemper riding down to marius camp to bid him fix the place and time of battlefor the teuton thought it mean to use surprises and stratagems or to conquer save in fair and open fightis the type of the teuton hero and one which had no chance in a struggle with the cool false politic roman grown grey in the experience of the forum and of the camp and still as physically brave as his young enemy because too there was no unity among them no feeling that they were brethren of one blood  had the teuton tribes at any one of the great crises i have mentioned and at many a crisis afterwards united for but three years under the feeling of a common blood language interest destiny rome would have perished  but they could not learn that lesson they could not put aside their boyish quarrels  they never learnt the lesson till after their final victory when the gospel of christof a being to whom they all owed equal allegiance in whose sight they were all morally equalcame to unite them into a christendom  and it was well that they did not learn it sooner  well for them and for the world that they did not unite on any false ground of interest or ambition but had to wait for the true ground of unity the knowledge of the godman king of all nations upon earth  had they destroyed rome sooner what would not they have lost  what would not the world have lost  christianity would have been stifled in its very cradle and with christianity all chancebe sure of itof their own progress  roman law order and discipline the very things which they needed to acquire by a contact of five hundred years would have been swept away  all classic literature and classic art which they learnt to admire with an almost superstitious awe would have perished likewise  greek philosophy the germs of physical science and all that we owe to the ancients would have perished and we should have truly had an invasion of the barbarians followed by truly dark ages in which europe would have had to begin all anew without the help of the generations which had gone before  therefore it was well as it was and god was just and merciful to them and to the human race  they had a glorious destiny and glorious powers wherewith to fulfil it but they had as every man and people has before whom there is a noble future to be educated by suffering  there was before them a terrible experience of sorrow and disappointment sin and blood by which they gained the first consciousness of what they could do and what they could not  like adam of old like every man unto this day they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and were driven out of the paradise of unconsciousness had to begin again sadder and wiser men and eat their bread in the sweat of their brow and so to rise after their fall into a nobler wiser more artificial and therefore more truly human and divine life than that from which they had at first fallen when they left their german wilds  one does not of course mean the parallel to fit in all details  the fall of the teuton from the noble simplicity in which tacitus beheld and honoured him was a work of four centuries perhaps it was going on in tacitus own time  but the culminating point was the century which saw italy conquered and rome sacked by visigoth by ostrogoth by vandal till nothing was left save feverhaunted ruins  then the ignorant and greedy child who had been grasping so long after the fair apples of sodom clutched them once and for all and found them turn to ashes in his hands  yesit is thus that i wish you to look at the invasion of the barbarians immigration of the teutons or whatsoever name you may call it  before looking at questions of migration of ethnology of laws and of classes look first at the thing itself and see with sacred pityand awe one of the saddest and grandest tragedies ever performed on earth poor souls  and they were so simple withal  one pities them as one pities a child who steals apples and makes himself sick with them after all  it is not the enormous loss of life which is to me the most tragic part of the story it is that very simplicity of the teutons  bloodshed is a bad thing certainly but after all nature is prodigal of human lifekilling her twenty thousand and her fifty thousand by a single earthquake and as for death in battlei sometimes am tempted to think having sat by many death beds that our old forefathers may have been right and that death in battle may be a not unenviable method of passing out of this troublesome world  besides we have no right to blame those old teutons while we are killing every year more of her majestys subjects by preventible disease than ever they killed in their bloodiest battle  let us think of that and mend that ere we blame the old german heroes  no there are more pitiful tragedies than any battlefield can shew and first among them surely is the disappointment of young hopes the degradation of young souls  one pities them i say  and they pitied themselves  remorse shame sadness mark the few legends and songs of the days which followed the fall of rome  they had done a great work  they had destroyed a mighty tyranny they had parted between them the spoils wrung from all the nations they had rid the earth of a mighty mandevouring ogre whose hands had been stretched out for centuries over all the earth dragging all virgins to his den butchering and torturing thousands for his sport foul too with crimes for which their language like our own thank god has scarcely found a name  babylon the great drunken with the blood of the saints had fallen at last before the simple foresters of the north but if it looks a triumph to us it looked not such to them  they could only think how they had stained their hands in their brothers blood they had got the fatal nibelungen hoard but it had vanished between their hands and left them to kill each other till none was left  you know the nibelungen lied  that expresses i believe the keynote of the old teutons heart after his work was done  siegfried murdered by his brotherinlaw fair chriemhild turned into an avenging fury the heroes hewing each other down they scarce know why in hunnish etzels hall till hagen and gunther stand alone dietrich of bern going in to bind the last surviving heroes chriemhild shaking hagens gory head in gunthers face himself hewed down by the old hildebrand till nothing is left but stark corpses and vain tearswhile all the while the nibelungen hoard the cause of all the woe lies drowned in the deep rhine until the judgment daywhat is all this but the true tale of the fall of rome of the mad quarrels of the conquering teutons  the names are confused mythic the dates and places all awry but the tale is truetoo true  mutato nomine fabula narratur  even so they went on killing till none were left  deeds as strange horrible fratricidal were done again and again not only between frank and goth lombard and gepid but between lombard and lombard frank and frank  yes they were drunk with each others blood those elder brethren of ours  let us thank god that we did not share their booty and perish like them from the touch of the fatal nibelungen hoard  happy for us englishmen that we were forced to seek our adventures here in this lonely isle to turn aside from the great stream of teutonic immigration and settle here each man on his forestclearing to till the ground in comparative peace keeping unbroken the old teutonic laws unstained the old teutonic faith and virtue cursed neither with poverty nor riches but fed with food sufficient for us  to us indeed after long centuries peace brought sloth and sloth foreign invaders and bitter woes but better so than that we should have cast away alike our virtue and our lives in that mad quarrel over the fairy gold of rome     lecture iithe dying empire   it is not for me to trace the rise or even the fall of the roman empire that would be the duty rather of a professor of ancient history than of modern  all i need do is to sketch as shortly as i can the state in which the young world found the old when it came in contact with it  the roman empire toward the latter part of the fourth century was in much the same condition as the chinese or the turkish empire in our own days  private morality as juvenal and persius will tell you had vanished long before  public morality had of course vanished likewise the only powers really recognised were force and cunning  the only aim was personal enjoyment  the only god was the divus caesar the imperial demigod whose illimitable brute force gave him illimitable powers of selfenjoyment and made him thus the paragon and ideal of humanity whom all envied flattered hated and obeyed  the palace was a sink of corruption where eunuchs concubines spies informers freedmen adventurers struggled in the basest plots each for his share of the public plunder  the senate only existed to register the edicts of their tyrant and if need be destroy each other or any one else by judicial murders the willing tools of imperial cruelty  the government was administered at least since the time of diocletian by an official bureaucracy of which professor goldwin smith well says the earth swarmed with the consuming hierarchy of extortion so that it was said that they who received taxes were more than those who paid them  the free middle class had disappeared or lingered in the cities too proud to labour fed on government bounty and amused by government spectacles with them arts and science had died likewise  such things were left to slaves and became therefore literally servile imitations of the past what indeed was not left to slaves  drawn without respect of rank as well as of sex and age from every nation under heaven by an organized slavetrade to which our late african one was but a tiny streamlet compared with a mighty river a slavetrade which once bought 10000 human beings in delos in a single day the servorum nationes were the only tillers of the soil of those latifundia or great estates quae perdidere romam  denied the rights of marriage the very name of humanity protected by no law save the interest or caprice of their masters subjected for slight offences to cruel torments they were butchered by thousands in the amphitheatres to make a roman holiday or wore out their lives in ergastula or barracks which were dens of darkness and horror  their owners as senatores clarissimi or at least curiales spent their lives in the cities luxurious and effeminate and left their slaves to the tender mercy of villici stewards and gangdrivers who were themselves slaves likewise  more pampered yet more degraded were the crowds of wretched beings cut off from all the hopes of humanity who ministered to the wicked pleasures of their masters even in the palaces of nominally christian emperorsbut over that side of roman slavery i must draw a veil only saying that the atrocities of the romans toward their slavesespecially of this last and darkest kindnotably drew down on them the just wrath and revenge of those teutonic nations from which so many of their slaves were taken 19  and yet they called themselves christiansto whom it had been said be not deceived god is not mocked  for these things cometh the wrath of god on the children of disobedience  and the wrath did come  if such were the morals of the empire what was its political state  one of complete disorganization  the only uniting bond left seems to have been that of the bureaucracy the community of taxgatherers who found it on the whole safer and more profitable to pay into the imperial treasury a portion of their plunder than to keep it all themselves  it stood by mere vi inertiae just because it happened to be there and there was nothing else to put in its place  like an old tree whose every root is decayed it did not fall simply because the storm had not yet come  storms indeed had come but they had been partial and local  one cannot look into the pages of gibbon without seeing that the normal condition of the empire was one of revolt civil war invasionpretenders like carausius and allectus in britain setting themselves up as emperors for awhilebands of brigands like the bagaudae of gaul and the circumcelliones of africa wandering about desperate with hunger and revenge to slay and pillageteutonic tribes making forays on the frontier enlisted into the roman armies and bought off or hired to keep back the tribes behind them and perish by their brethrens swords  what kept the empire standing paradoxical as it may seem was its own innate weakness  from within at least it could not be overthrown  the masses were too crushed to rise  without unity purpose courage they submitted to inevitable misery as to rain and thunder  at most they destroyed their own children from poverty or as in egypt fled by thousands into the caves and quarries and turned monks and hermits while the upper classes equally without unity or purpose said each to himself let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die  the state of things at rome and after the rise of byzantium under constantine at byzantium likewise was one altogether fantastic abnormal utterly unlike anything that we have seen or can imagine to ourselves without great effort  i know no better method of illustrating it than quoting from mr sheppards excellent book the fall of rome and the rise of new nationalities a passage in which he transfers the whole comitragedy from italy of old to england in 1861  i have not thought it necessary to give a separate and distinct reply to the theory of mr congreve that roman imperialism was the type of all good government and a desirable precedent for ourselves  those who feel any penchant for the notion i should strongly recommend to read the answer of professor g smith in the oxford essays for 1856 which is as complete and crushing as that gentlemans performances usually are but in order to convey to the uninitiated some idea of the state of society under caesarian rule and which a caesarian rule so far as mere government is concerned if it does not produce has never shewn any tendency to prevent let us give reins to imagination for a moment and picture to ourselves a few social and political analogies in our own england of the nineteenth century  an entire revolution has taken place in our principles manners and form of government  parliaments meetings and all the ordinary expressions of the national will are no longer in existence  a free press has shared their fate  there is no accredited organ of public opinion indeed there is no public opinion to record  lords and commons have been swept away though a number of the richest old gentlemen in london meet daily at westminster to receive orders from buckingham palace  but at the palace itself has broken out one of those sanguinary conspiracies which have of late become unceasing  the last heir of the house of brunswick is lying dead with a dagger in his heart and everything is in frightful confusion  the armed force of the capital are of course masters of the situation and the guards after a tumultuous meeting at windsor or knightsbridge have sold the throne to baron rothschild for a handsome donation of 25 pounds apiece  lord clyde however we may be sure is not likely to stand this and in a few months will be marching upon london at the head of the indian army  in the mean time the channel fleet has declared for its own commander has seized upon plymouth and portsmouth and intends to starve the metropolis by stopping the imports of breadstuffs at the mouth of the thames  and this has become quite possible for half the population of london under the present state of things subsist upon free distributions of corn dispensed by the occupant of the throne for the time being  but a more fatal change than even this has come over the population of the capital and of the whole country  the free citizens and prentices of london the sturdy labourers of dorsetshire and the eastern counties and the skilful artizans of manchester sheffield and birmingham the mariners and shipwrights of liverpool have been long ago drafted into marching regiments and have left their bones to bleach beneath indian suns and polar snows  their place has been supplied by countless herds of negro slaves who till the fields and crowd the workshops of our towns to the entire exclusion of free labour for the free population or rather the miserable relics of them disdain all manual employment they divide their time between starvation and a degrading debauchery the means for which are sedulously provided by the government  the timehonoured institutions of the bullbait the cockpit and the ring are in daily operation under the most distinguished patronage  hyde park has been converted into a gigantic arena where criminals from newgate setto with the animals from the zoological gardens  every fortnight there is a derby day and the whole population pour into the downs with frantic excitement leaving the city to the slaves  and then the moral condition of this immense mass  of the doings about the palace we should be sorry to speak  but the lady patronesses of almacks still more assiduously patronize the prizefights and one of them has been seen within the ropes in battle array by the side of sayers himself  no tongue may tell the orgies enacted with the aid of french cooks italian singers and foreign artists of all sorts in the gilded saloons of park lane and mayfair  suffice to say that in them the worst passions of human nature have full swing unmodified by any thought of human or divine restraints and only dashed a little now and then by the apprehension that the slaves may rise and make a clean sweep of the metropolis with fire and steel but nimportevive la bagatelle  mario has just been appointed prime minister and has made a chorus singer from the opera duke of middlesex and governorgeneral of india  all wise men and all good men despair of the state but they are not permitted to say anything much less to act  mr disraeli lost his head a few days ago lords palmerston and derby lie in the tower under sentence of death lord brougham the archbishop of canterbury and mr gladstone opened their veins and died in a warm bath last week  foreign relations will make a still greater demand on the readers imagination  we must conceive of england no longer as     a precious stone set in the silver sea    which serves it in the office of a wall    or as a moat defensive of a house  but rather as open to the inroad of every foe whom her aggressive and colonizing genius has provoked  the red man of the west the caffre the sikh and the sepoy chinese braves and fierce orientals of all sorts are hovering on her frontiers in numbers numberless as the flakes of snow in the northern winter  they are not the impotent enemy which we know but vigorous races supplied from inexhaustible founts of population and animated by an insatiate appetite for the gold and silver purple and fine linen rich meats and intoxicating drinks of our effete civilization  and we can no longer oppose them with those victorious legions which have fought and conquered in all regions of the world  the men of waterloo and inkermann are no more  we are compelled to recruit our armies from those very tribes before whose swords we are receding  doubtless the ordinary reader will believe this picture to be overcharged drawn with manifest exaggeration and somewhat questionable taste  every single statement which it contains may be paralleled by the circumstances and events of the decadence of the roman empire  the analogous situation was with the subjects of this type of all good government always a possible often an actual state of things  we think this disposes of the theory of mr congreve  with it may advantageously be contrasted the opinion of a man of more statesmanlike mind  the benefits of despotism are shortlived it poisons the very springs which it lays open if it display a merit it is an exceptional one if a virtue it is created of circumstances and when once this better hour has passed away all the vices of its nature break forth with redoubled violence and weigh down society in every direction  so writes m guizot  is it the language of prophecy as well as of personal experience  mr sheppard should have added to make the picture complete that the irish have just established popery across st georges channel by the aid of reimmigrants from america that free kirk and national kirk are carrying on a sanguinary civil war in scotland that the devonshire wesleyans have just sacked exeter cathedral and murdered the bishop at the altar while the bishop of london supported by the jews and the rich churchmen who are all mixed up in financial operations with baron rothschild has just commanded all dissenters to leave the metropolis within three days under pain of death  i must add yet one more feature to this fearful but accurate picture and say how a few generations forward an even uglier thing would be seen  the english aristocracy would have been absorbed by foreign adventurers  the grandchildren of these slaves and mercenaries would be holding the highest offices in the state and the army naming themselves after the masters who had freed them or disguising their barbarian names by english endings  the de fungchowvilles would be dukes the little grizzlybearjoesmiths earls and the fitzstanleysons descended from a king of the gipsies who enlisted to avoid transportation and in due time became commanderinchief would rule at knowsley in place of the earl of derby having inherited the same by the summary process of assassination beggars on horseback only too literally married most of them to englishwomen of the highest rank but looking on england merely as a prey without patriotism without principle they would destroy the old aristocracy by legal murders grind the people fight against their yet barbarian cousins outside as long as they were in luck but the moment the luck turned against them would call in those barbarian cousins to help them and invade england every ten years with heathen hordes armed no more with tulwar and matchlock but with enfield rifle and whitworth cannon  and that it must be agreed would be about the last phase of the british empire  if you will look through the names which figure in the high places of the roman empire during the fourth and fifth centuries you will see how few of them are really roman  if you will try to investigate not their genealogiesfor they have nonenot a grandfather among thembut the few facts of their lives which have come down to us you will see how that nemesis had fallen on her which must at last fall on every nation which attempts to establish itself on slavery as a legal basis  rome had become the slave of her own slaves  it is at this last period the point when rome has become the slave of her own slaves that i take up the story of our teutonic race  i do not think that anyone will call either mr sheppards statements or mine exaggerated who knows the bitter complaints of the wickedness and folly of the time which are to be found in the writings of the emperor julian  pedant and apostate as he was he devoted his short life to one great idea the restoration of the roman empire to what it had been as he fancied in the days of the virtuous stoic emperors of the second century  he found his dream a dream owing to the dead heap of frivolity sensuality brutality utter unbelief not merely in the dead pagan gods whom he vainly tried to restore but in any god at all as a living ruling judging rewarding punishing power  no one again will call these statements exaggerated who knows the roman history of his faithful servant and soldier ammianus marcellinus and especially the later books of it in which he sets forth the state of the empire after julians death under jovian procopius valentinian who kept close to his bedchamber two shebears who used to eat men one called golden camel and the other innocencewhich latter when she had devoured a sufficiency of his living victims he set free in the forests as a reward for her servicesa brutal tyrant whose only virtue seems to have been his chastity and valens the shameless extortioner who perished in that great battle of adrianople of which more hereafter  the last five remaining books of the honest soldiers story are a tissue of horrors from reading which one turns away as from a slaughterhouse or a witches sabbath  no one again will think these statements exaggerated who knows salvians de gubernatione dei  it has been always and most justly held in high esteem as one great authority of the state of gaul when conquered by the franks and goths and vandals  salvian was a christian gentleman born somewhere near treves  he married a pagan lady of cologne converted her had by her a daughter and then persuaded her to devote herself to celibacy while he did the like  his fatherinlaw hypatius quarrelled with him on this account and the letter in which he tries to soothe the old man is still extant a curious specimen of the style of cultivated men in that day  salvian then went down to the south of france and became a priest at marseilles and tutor to the sons of eucherius the bishop of lyons  eucherius himself a good man speaks in terms of passionate admiration of salvian his goodness sanctity learning talents  gennadius who describes him as still living when he wrote about 490 calls him among other encomiums the master of bishops and both mention familiarly this very work by which he became notorious in his own day and which he wrote about 450 or 455 during the invasion of the britons  so that we may trust fully that we have hold of an authentic contemporaneous work written by a good man and true  let me first say a few words on the fact of his havingas many good men did thenseparated from his wife in order to lead what was called a religious life  it has a direct bearing on the history of those days one must not praise him because he in common with all christians of his day held no doubt the belief that marriage was a degradation in itself that though the church might mend it somewhat by exalting it into a sacrament still the less of a bad thing the bettera doctrine against which one need not use thank god in england the same language which michelet has most justly used in france  we being safe from the poison can afford to talk of it calmly  but i boldly assert that few more practically immoral doctrines than that of the dignity of celibacy and the defilement of marriage which was the doctrine of all christian devotees for 1000 years have as far as i know ever been preached to man  that is a strong statement  it will be answered perhaps by the patent fact that during those very 1000 years the morality of europe improved more and more rapidly than it had ever done before  i know it and i thank god for it  but i adhere to my statement and rejoinand how much more rapidly have the morals of europe improved since that doctrine has been swept away and woman and the love of woman have been restored to their rightful place in the education of man  but if we do not praise salvian we must not blame him or any one else who meant to be an honest and good man  such did not see to what their celibate notions would lead  if they had we must believe that they would have acted differently  and what is more their preference for celibacy was not fancy but common sense of a very lofty kind  be sure that when two middleaged christian people consider it best to part they have very good reasons for such a solemn step at which only boys or cynics will laugh  and the reasons in salvians case and many more in his day are patent to common human understanding  do not fancy that he had any private reason such as we should very fairly assign now public reasons and those such as god grant no living man may see caused wise men to thank god that they were not burdened with wife and child remember the years in which salvian livedfrom 416 perhaps to 490  it was a day of the lord such as joel saw a day of clouds and of thick darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and strong there had not been ever the like neither should be any more after it the land was a garden of eden before them and behind them a desolate wilderness yea and nothing should escape them  all things were going to wrack the country was overrun by foreign invaders bankruptcy devastation massacre and captivity were for perhaps 100 years the normal state of gaul and of most other countries besides  i have little doubt that salvian was a prudent man when he thought fit to bring no more human beings into the world  that is an ugly thoughti trust that you feel how ugly unnatural desperate a thought it is  if you do not think over it till you do till it frightens you  you will gain a great step thereby in human sympathy and therefore in the understanding of history  for many times and in many places men have said rightly or wrongly it is better to leave none behind me like myself  the miseries of life and of what comes after this life are greater than its joys  i commit an act of cruelty by bringing a fresh human being into the world  i wish you to look at that thought steadily and apply it for yourselves  it has many applications and has therefore been a very common one  but put to yourselvesit is too painful for me to put to youthe case of a married gentleman who sees his country gradually devastated and brought to utter ruin by foreign invaders and who feelsas poor salvian felt that there is no hope or escape that the misery is merited deserved fairly earned for that is the true meaning of those words and therefore must come  conceive him seeing around him estates destroyed farms burnt ladies and gentlemen his own friends and relations reduced in an hour to beggary plundered stript driven off in gangsi do not choose to finish the picture but ask yourselves would an honourable man wish to bring sonsmuch more daughtersinto the world to endure that  put yourselves in salvians place  forget for a few minutes that you are englishmen the freest and bravest nation upon earth strong in all that gives real strength and with a volunteer army which is now formidable by numbers and couragewhich did the terrible call come might be increased ten times in as many months  forget all that awhile and put yourselves in salvians place the gentleman of gaul while franks and goths burgunds and vandals were sweeping wave after wave over that lovely land and judge him rationally and talk as little as possible of his superstition and as much as possible of his human feeling prudence selfcontrol and common sense  believe me neither celibacy nor any other seemingly unnatural superstition would have held its ground for a generation if there had not been some practical considerations of common sense to back them  we wonder why men in old times went into monasteries  the simplest answer is common sense sent them thither they were tired of being the slaves of their own passions they were tired of killing and of running the chance of being killed  they saw society the whole world going to wrack as they thought around them what could they do better than see that their own characters morals immortal souls did not go to wrack with the rest  we wonder why women especially women of rank went into convents why as soon as a community of monks was founded a community of nuns sprung up near them  the simplest answer is common sense sent them thither  the men especially of the upper fighting classes were killed off rapidly the women were not killed off and a large number always remained who if they had wished to marry could not  what better for them than to seek in convents that peace which this world could not give  they may have mixed up with that simple wish for peace the notion of being handmaids of god brides of christ and so forth  be it so  let us instead of complaining thank heaven that there was some motive whether quite right or not to keep alive in them selfrespect and the feeling that they were not altogether useless and aimless on earth  look at the question in this light and you will understand two things first how horrible the times were and secondly why there grew up in the early middle age a passion for celibacy  salvian in a word had already grown up to manhood and reason when he saw a time come to his native country in which were fulfilled with fearful exactness the words of the prophet isaiah     behold the lord maketh the land empty and maketh it waste and    turneth it upside down and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof    and it shall be as with the people so with the priest as with the    slave so with his master as with the maid so with her mistress as    with the seller so with the buyer as with the lender so with the    borrower as with the taker of usury so with the giver of usury to    him  the land shall be utterly emptied and utterly spoiled for the    lord hath spoken this word  and salvian desired to know the reason why the lord had spoken that word and read his bible till he found out and wrote thereon his book de gubernatione dei of the government of god and a very noble book it is he takes his stand on the ground of scripture with which he shews an admirable acquaintance  the few good were expecting the end of the world  christ was coming to put an end to all these horrors but why did he delay his coming  the many weak were crying that god had given up the world that christ had deserted his church and delivered over christians to the cruelties of heathen and arian barbarians  the many bad were openly blaspheming throwing off in despair all faith all bonds of religion all common decency and crying let us eat and drink for to morrow we die  salvian answers them like an old hebrew prophet the lords arm is not shortened  the lords eyes are not closed  the lord is still as near as ever  he is governing the world as he has always governed it by the everlasting moral laws by which the wages of sin are death  your iniquities have withheld good things from you  you have earned exactly what god has paid you  yourselves are your own punishment  you have been wicked men and therefore weak men your own vices and not the goths have been your true conquerors  as i said in my inaugural lecturethat is after all the true theory of history  men may forget it in piping times of peace  god grant that in the dark hour of adversity god may always raise up to them a prophet like good old salvian to preach to them once again the everlasting judgments of god and teach them that not faulty constitutions faulty laws faulty circumstances of any kind but the faults of their own hearts and lives are the causes of their misery  m guizot in his elaborate work on the history of civilization in france has a few curious pages on the causes of the decline of civil society in roman gaul and its consequent weakness and ruin  he tells you how the senators or clarissimi did not constitute a true aristocracy able to lead and protect the people being at the mercy of the emperor and nominated and removed at his pleasure  how the curiales or wealthy middle class who were bound by law to fulfil all the municipal offices and were responsible for the collection of the revenue found their responsibilities so great that they by every trick in their power avoided office  how as m guizot well puts it the central despotism of rome stript the curiales of all they earned to pay its own functionaries and soldiers and gave them the power of appointing magistrates who were only after all the imperial agents of that despotism for whose sake they robbed their fellowcitizens  how the plebs comprising the small tradesmen and free artizans were utterly unable to assert their own opinions or rights  how the slave population though their condition was much improved constituted a mere dead weight of helpless brutality  and then he says that the roman empire was dying  very true but often as he quotes salvian he omits always to tell us what roman society was dying of  salvian says that it was dying of vice  not of bad laws and class arrangements but of bad men  m guizot belongs to a school which is apt to impute human happiness and prosperity too exclusively to the political constitution under which they may happen to live irrespectively of the morality of the people themselves  from that the constitutionalist school there has been of late a strong reaction the highest exponent nay the very coryphaeus of which is mr carlyle  he undervalues even despises the influence of laws and constitutions with him private virtue from which springs public virtue is the first and sole cause of national prosperity  my inaugural lecture has told you how deeply i sympathize with his viewtaking my stand as mr carlyle does on the hebrew prophets  there is nevertheless a side of truth in the constitutionalist view which mr carlyle i think overlooks  a bad political constitution does produce poverty and weakness but only in as far as it tends to produce moral evil to make men bad  that it can help to do  it can put a premium on vice on falsehood on peculation on laziness on ignorance and thus tempt the mass to moral degradation from the premier to the slave  russia has been for two centuries now but too patent a proof of the truth of this assertion  but even in this case the moral element is the most important and just the one which is overlooked  to have good laws m guizot is apt to forget you must first have good men to make them and second you must have good men to carry them out after they are made  bad men can abuse the best of laws the best of constitutions look at the working of our parliaments during the reigns of william iii and anne and see how powerless good constitutions are when the men who work them are false and venal  look on the other hand at the roman empire from the time of vespasian to that of the antonines and see how well even a bad constitution will succeed when good men are working it  bad laws i say will work tolerably under good men if fitted to the existing circumstances by men of the world as all roman laws were  if they had not been such how was the roman empire at least in its first years a blessing to the safety prosperity and wealth of every country it enslaved  but when defective roman laws began to be worked by bad men and that for 200 years then indeed came times of evil  let us take then salvians own account of the cause of roman decay  he an eyewitness imputes it all to the morals of roman citizens  they were according to him of the very worst  to the general dissoluteness he attributes in plain words the success of the frank and gothic invaders and the facts which he gives and which there is no reason to doubt are quite enough to prove him in the right  every great mans house he says was a sink of profligacy  the women slaves were at the mercy of their master and the slaves copied his morals among themselves  it is an ugly picture but common sense will tell us if we but think a little that such will and must be the case in slaveholding countries wherever christianity is not present in its purest and strongest form to control the passions of arbitrary power  but there was not merely profligacy among these gauls  that alone would not have wrought their immediate ruin  morals were bad enough in old greece and rome as they were afterwards among the turks nevertheless as long as a race is strong as long as there is prudence energy deep national feeling outraged virtue does not avenge itself at once by general ruin  but it avenges itself at last as salvian shewsas all experience shews  as in individuals so in nations unbridled indulgence of the passions must produce and does produce frivolity effeminacy slavery to the appetite of the moment a brutalized and reckless temper before which prudence energy national feeling any and every feeling which is not centered in self perishes utterly  the old french noblesse gave a proof of this law which will last as a warning beacon to the end of time  the spanish population of america i am told gives now a fearful proof of this same terrible penalty  has not italy proved it likewise for centuries past  it must be so gentlemen  for national life is grounded on is the development of the life of the family  and where the root is corrupt the tree must be corrupt likewise  it must be so  for asmodeus does not walk alone  in his train follow impatience and disappointment suspicion and jealousy rage and cruelty and all the passions which set mans hand against his fellowman  it must be so  for profligacy is selfishness and the family and the society the nation exists only by casting away selfishness and by obeying lawnot only the outward law which says in the name of god thou shalt not but the inward law the law of christ which says thou must the law of self sacrifice which selfish lust tramples under foot till there is no more cohesion left between man and man no more trust no more fellowhelp than between the stags who fight for the hinds and god help the nation which has brought itself to that  no wonder therefore if salvians accounts of gaulish profligacy be true that gaulish recklessness reached at last a pitch all but incredible  it is credible however shocking that as he says he himself saw both at treves and another great city probably cologne colonia agrippina or the colony par excellence while the destruction of the state was imminent old men of rank decrepit christians slaves to gluttony and lust rabid with clamour furious with bacchanalian orgies  it is credible however shocking that all through gaul the captivity was foreseen yet never dreaded  and so when the barbarians had encamped almost in sight there was no terror among the people no care of the cities  all was possest by carelessness and sloth gluttony drunkenness sleep according to that which the prophet saith a sleep from the lord had come over them  it is credible however shocking that though treves was four times taken by the barbarians it remained just as reckless as ever and thati quote salvian stillwhen the population was half destroyed by fire and sword the poor dying of famine corpses of men and women lying about the streets breeding pestilence while the dogs devoured them the few nobles who were left comforted themselves by sending to the emperor to beg for circensian games  those circensian games and indeed all the public spectacles are fresh proofs of what i said just now that if a bad people earn bad government still a bad government makes a bad people  they were the most extraordinary instance which the world ever saw of a government setting to work at a vast expense to debauch its subjects whether the roman rulers set that purpose consciously before them one dare not affirm  their notion probably was for they were as worldly wise as they were unprincipled that the more frivolous and sensual the people were the more quietly they would submit to slavery and the best way to keep them frivolous and sensual the romans knew full well so well that after the empire became christian and many heathen matters were done away with they did not find it safe to do away with the public spectacles  the temples of the gods might go but not the pantomimes  in one respect indeed these government spectacles became worse not better under christianity  they were less cruel no doubt but also they were less beautiful  the old custom of exhibiting representations of the old greek myths which had something of grace and poetry about them and would carry back the spectators thoughts to the nobler and purer heroic ages disappeared before christianity but the old vice did not  that was left and no longer ennobled by the old heroic myths round which it had clustered itself was simply of the silliest and most vulgar kind  we know in detail the abominations as shameless and ridiculous which went on a century after salvian in the theatres of constantinople under the eyes of the most christian emperor justinian and which won for that most infamous woman theodora a share in his imperial crown and the right to dictate doctrine to the christian bishops of the east and to condemn the soul of origen to everlasting damnation for having exprest hopes of the final pardon of sinners  we can well believe therefore salvians complaints of the wickedness of those pantomimes of which he says that honeste non possunt vel accusari he cannot even accuse them without saying what he is ashamed to say i believe also his assertion that they would not let people be modest even if they wished that they inflamed the passions and debauched the imaginations of young and old man and woman andbut i am not here to argue that sin is sin or that the population of london would be the worse if the most shameless persons among them were put by the government in possession of drury lane and covent garden and that and nothing less than that did the roman pantomimes mean from the days of juvenal till those of the most holy and orthodox empress theodora  who knowing the judgment of god that they who do such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them  now in contrast to all these abominations old salvian sets boldly and honestly the superior morality of the barbarians  that he says is the cause of their strength and our weakness  we professing orthodoxy are profligate hypocrites  they half heathens half arians are honester men purer men than we  there is no use he says in despising the goths as heretics while they are better men than we  they are better christians than the romans because they are better men  they pray to god for success and trust in him and we presumptuously trust in ourselves  we swear by christ but what do we do but blaspheme him when we swear per christum tollo eum i will make away with him per christum hunc jugulo i will cut his throat and then believe ourselves bound to commit the murder which we have vowed    the saxons he says are fierce the franks faithless the gepidae inhuman the huns shameless  but is the franks perfidy as blameable as ours  is the almans drunkenness or the alans rapacity as damnable as a christians  if a hun or a gepid deceives you what wonder  he is utterly ignorant that there is any sin in falsehood  but what of the christian who does the same  the barbarians he says are better men than the christians  the goths he says are perfidious but chaste the alans unchaste but less perfidious  the franks are liars but hospitable the saxons ferociously cruel but venerable for their chastity  the visigoths who conquered spain he says were the most ignavi heavy i presume he means and loutish of all the barbarians but they were chaste and therefore they conquered  in africa if we are to believe salvian things stood even worse at the time of the invasion of the vandals  in his violent invectives against the africans however allowance must be made  salvian was a great lover of monks and the africans used he says to detest them and mob them wherever they appeared for which offence of course he can find no words too strong  st augustine however himself a countryman of theirs who died happily just before the storm burst on that hapless land speaks bitterly of their exceeding profligacyof which he himself in his wild youth had had but too sad experience  salvians assertion is that the africans were the most profligate of all the romans and that while each barbarian tribe had as we have just seen some good in them the africans had none  but there were noble souls left among them lights which shone all the more brightly in the surrounding darkness  in the pages of victor vitensis which tell the sad story of the persecution of the african catholics by the arian vandals you will find many a moving tale which shews that god had his own even among those degraded carthaginians  the causes of the arian hatred to the catholics is very obscure  you will find all that is known in dean milmans history of latin christianity  a simple explanation may be found in the fact that the catholics considered the arians and did not conceal their opinion as all literally and actually doomed to the torments of everlasting fire and that as gibbon puts it the heroes of the north who had submitted with some reluctance to believe that all their ancestors were in hell were astonished and exasperated to learn that they themselves had only changed the mode of their eternal condemnation  the teutons were salvian himself confesses it trying to serve god devoutly in chastity sobriety and honesty according to their light  and they were told by the profligates of africa that this and no less was their doom  it is not to be wondered at again if they mistook the catholic creed for the cause of catholic immorality  that may account for the vandal custom of rebaptizing the catholics  it certainly accounts for the fact if after all it be a fact which victor states that they tortured the nuns to extort from them shameful confessions against the priests  but the history of the african persecution is the history of all persecutions as confest again and again by the old fathers as proved by the analogies of later times  the sins of the church draw down punishment by making her enemies confound her doctrine and her practice  but in return the punishment of the church purifies her and brings out her nobleness afresh as the snake casts his skin in pain and comes out young and fair once more and in every dark hour of the church there flashes out some bright form of human heroism to be a beacon and a comfort to all future time  victor for instance tells the story of dionysia the beautiful widow whom the vandals tried to torture into denying the divinity of our lordhow when they saw that she was bolder and fairer than all the other matrons they seized her and went to strip her and she cried to them qualiter libet occidite verecunda tamen membra nolite nudare but in vain  they hung her up by the hands and scourged her till streams of blood ran down every limb  her only son a delicate boy stood by trembling knowing that his turn would come next and she saw it and called to him in the midst of her shame and agony  he had been baptized into the name of the blessed trinity let him die in that name and not lose the weddinggarment  let him fear the pain that never ends and cling to the life that endures for ever  the boy took heart and when his turn came died under the torture and dionysia took up the little corpse and buried it in her own house and worshipped upon her boys grave to her dying day  yes  god had his own left even among those fallen africans of carthage  but neither there nor in spain could the vandals cure the evil  nowa days says salvian there are no profligates among the goths save romans none among the vandals save romans  blush roman people everywhere blush for your morals  there is hardly a city free from dens of sin and none at all from impurity save those which the barbarians have begun to occupy  and do we wonder if we are surpassed in power by an enemy who surpasses us in decency  it is not the natural strength of their bodies which makes them conquer us  we have been conquered only by the vices of our own morals  yes  salvian was right  those last words were no mere outburst of national vanity content to confess every sin save that of being cowards  he was right  it was not the mere muscle of the teuton which enabled him to crush the decrepit and debauched slavenations gaul and briton iberian and african as the ox crushes the frogs of the marsh the sera juvenum venus ideoque inexhausta pubertas had given him more than his lofty stature and his mighty limbs  had he had nought but them he might have remained to the end a blind samson grinding among the slaves in caesars mill butchered to make a roman holiday  but it had given him more that purity of his it had given him as it may give you gentlemen a calm and steady brain and a free and loyal heart the energy which springs from health the selfrespect which comes from self restraint and the spirit which shrinks from neither god nor man and feels it light to die for wife and child for people and for queen     preface to lecture iiion dr lathams germania   if i have followed in these lectures the better known and more widely received etymology of the name goth i have done so out of no disrespect to dr latham but simply because his theory seems to me adhuc sub judice  it is this as far as i understand it  that goth was not the aboriginal name of the race  that they were probably not so called till they came into the land of the getae about the mouths of the danube that the teutonic name for the ostrogoths was grutungs and that of the visigoths which he does not consider to mean westgoths thervings thuringer  that on reaching the land of the getae they took their name just as the kentings of anglosaxon england took name from the keltic country of kent and that the names goth gothones gothini were originally given to lithuanians by their sclavonic neighbours  i merely state the theory and leave it for the judgment of others  the principal points which dr latham considers himself to have established are  that the area and population of the teutonic tribes have been on the authority of tacitus much overrated many tribes hitherto supposed to be teutonic being really sclavonic c  this need not shock our pride if provedas it seems to me to be  the nations who have influenced the worlds destiny have not been great in the modern american sense of big but great in heart as our forefathers were  the greeks were but a handful at salamis so were the romans of the republic so were the spaniards of america so probably were the aztecs and incas whom they overthrew and surely our own conquerors and reconquerers of hindostan have shewn enough that it is not numbers but soul which gives a race the power to rule  neither need we object to dr lathams opinion that more than one of the tribes which took part in the destruction of the empire were not aboriginal germans but sclavonians germanized and under german leaders it may be so  the custom of enslaving captives would render pure teutonic blood among the lower classes of a tribe the exception and not the rule while the custom of chiefs choosing the thegns gesitha or comites who lived and died as their companionsinarms from among the most valiant of the unfree would tend to produce a mixed blood in the upper classes also and gradually assimilate the whole mass to the manners and laws of their teutonic lords  only by some such actual superiority of the upper classes to the lower can i explain the deep respect for rank and blood which distinguishes and will perhaps always distinguish the teutonic peoples  had there even been anything like a primaeval equality among our race a hereditary aristocracy could never have arisen or if arising for a while never could have remained as a fact which all believed in from the lowest to the highest  just or unjust the institution represented i verily believe an ethnological fact  the goldenhaired hero said to his brownhaired bondsman i am a gentleman who have a gens a stamm a pedigree and know from whom i am sprung  i am a garding an amalung a scylding an osing or what not  i am a son of the gods  the blood of the asas is in my veins  do you not see it  am i not wiser stronger more virtuous more beautiful than you  you must obey me and be my man and follow me to the death then if you prove a worthy thane i will give you horse weapons bracelets lands and marry you it may be to my daughter or my niece and if not you must remain a son of the earth grubbing in the dust of which you were made  and the bondsman believed him and became his lords man and followed him to the death and was thereby not degraded but raised out of selfish savagery and brute independence into loyalty usefulness and selfrespect  as a fact that is the method by which the thing was done donevery ill indeed as most human things are done but a method inevitableand possibly right till as in england now the lower classes became ethnologically identical with the upper and equality became possible in law simply because it existed in fact  but the part of dr lathams germania to which i am bound to call most attention because i have not followed it is that interesting part of the prolegomena in which he combats the generally received theory that between the time of tacitus and that of charlemagne vast masses of germans had migrated southward from between the elbe and the vistula and that they had been replaced by the sclavonians who certainly were there in charlemagnes days  dr latham argues against this theory with a great variety of facts and reasons  but has he not overstated his case on some points  need the migrations necessary for this theory have been of unparalleled magnitude and rapidity  as for the unparalleled completeness on which he lays much stress from the fact that no remnants of teutonic population are found in the countries evacuated  is it the fact that history only tells us of german armies having advanced south  do we not find four famous casesthe irruption of the cimbri and teutons into italy the passage of the danube by the visigoths and the invasions of italy first by the ostrogoths then by the lombardsin which the nations came with men women and children horses cattle and dogs bag and baggage  may not this have been the custom of the race with its strong feeling for the family tie and may not this account for no traces of them being left behind  does not dr lathams theory proceed too much on an assumption that the sclavonians dispossest the teutons by force  and is not this assumption his ground for objecting that the movement was effected improbably by that division of the european population the sclavonic and lithuanian which has within the historic period receded before the germanic  are these migrations though unrepresented in any history ie contemporaneous really unrepresented in any tradition  do not the traditions of jornandes and paulus diaconus that the goths and the lombards came from scandinavia represent this very factand are they to be set aside as naught  surely not  myths of this kind generally embody a nucleus of truth and must be regarded with respect for they often after all arguments about them are spent are found to contain the very pith of the matter  are the phenomena of replacement and substitution so very strangei will not say upon the popular theory but at least on one halfway between it and dr lathams  namely  that the teutonic races came originally as some of them say they did from scandinavia denmark the south baltic c  that they forced their way down wave after wave on what would have been the line of least resistancethe marches between the gauls romanized or otherwise and the sclavonians  and that the alps and the solid front of the roman empire turned them to the east till their vanguard found itself on the danube  this would agree with dr lathams most valuable hint that markmen men of the marches was perhaps the name of many german tribes successively  that they fought as they went with the sclavonian and other tribes as their traditions seem to report and rolled them back to the eastward and that as each teutonic tribe past down the line the sclavonians rolled back again till the last column was past  that the teutons also carried down with them as slaves or allies a portion of this old sclavonic population to which dr latham will perhaps agree and that this fact caused a hiatus which was gradually filled by tribes who after all were little better than nomad hunters and would occupy quite nominally a very large tract with a small population  would not this theory agree at once tolerably with the old traditions and with dr lathams new facts  the question still remainswhich is the question of all  what put these germanic peoples on going south  were there no causes sufficient to excite so desperate a resolve  1  did they all go  is not paulus diaconus story that onethird of the lombards was to emigrate by lot and twothirds remain at home a rough type of what generally happenedwhat happens now in our modern emigrations  was not the surplus population driven off by famine toward warmer and more hopeful climes  2  are not the teutonic populations of england north germany and the baltic the descendants much intermixed and with dialects much changed of the portions which were left behind  this is the opinion i believe of several great ethnologists  is it not true  if philological objections are raised to this i ask but in all humility did not these southward migrations commence long before the time of tacitus  if so may they not have commenced before the different teutonic dialects were as distinct as they were in the historic period  and are we to suppose that the dialects did not alter during the long journeyings through many nations  is it possible that the thervings and grutungs could have retained the same tongue on the danube as their forefathers spoke in their native land  would not the moesogothic of ulfilas have been all but unintelligible to the goth who upon the old theory remained in gothland of sweden  3  but were there not more causes than mere want which sent them south  had the peculiar restlessness of the race nothing to do with it a restlessness not nomadic but migratory arising not from carelessness of land and home but from the longing to found a home in a new land like the restlessness of us their children  as soon as we meet them in historic times they are always moving migrating invading  were they not doing the same in prehistoric times by fits and starts no doubt with periods of excitement periods of collapse and rest  when we recollect the invasion of the normans the wholesale eastward migration of the crusaders men women and children and the later colonization by teutonic peoples of every quarter of the globe is there anything wonderful in the belief that similar migratory manias may have seized the old tribes that the spirit of woden the mover may have moved them and forced them to go ahead as now  doubtless the theory is strange but the teutons were and are a strange people so strange that they have conqueredone may almost say that they areall nations which are alive upon the globe and we may therefore expect them to have done strange things even in their infancy  the romans saw them conquer the empire and said the good men among them that it was on account of their superior virtue  but beside the virtue which made them succeed there must have been the adventurousness which made them attempt  they were a people fond of avanturen like their descendants and they went out to seek them and found enough and to spare  4  but more had they never heard of rome  surely they had and at a very early period of the empire  we are apt to forget that for every discovery of the germans by the romans there was a similar discovery of the romans by the germans and one which would tell powerfully on their childish imagination  did not one single kemper or teuton return from marius slaughter to spread among the tribes niddering though he may have been called for coming back alive the fair land which they had found fit for the gods of valhalla the land of sunshine fruits and wine wherein his brothers and sisters bones were bleaching unavenged did no gay gaul of the legion of the lark boast in a frontier winehouse to a german trapper who came in to sell his peltry how he himself was a gentleman now and a civilized man and a roman and how he had followed julius caesar the king of men over the rubicon and on to a city of the like of which man never dreamed wherein was room for all the gods of heaven  did no captive tribune of varus legions led with horrid shouts round thors altar in the teutoburger wald ere his corpse was hung among the horses and goats on the primaeval oaks turn to bay like a roman and tell his wild captors of the eternal city and of the might of that caesar who would avenge every hair upon his head with a german life and receive for answer a shout of laughter and the cryyou have come to us and some day we will go to you  did no commissary bargaining with a german for cattle to be sent over the frontier by such a day of the week and teaching him to mistranslate into those names of thor woden freya and so forth which they now carry the jewishassyrianroman days of the sennight amuse the simple forester by telling him how the streets of rome were paved with gold and no one had anything to do there but to eat and bathe at the public expense and to go to the theatre and see 20000 gladiators fight at once  did no german regulus alderman or king enter rome on an embassy and come back with uplifted eyes and hands declaring that he had seen things unspeakablea very fine plunder as blucher said of london and that if it were not for the walls they might get it all for not only the ladies but the noblemen went about in litters of silver and gold and wore gauze dresses the shameless wretches through which you might see every limb so that as for killing them there was no more fear of them than of a flock of sheep but that he did not see as well as he could have wished how to enter the great city for he was more or less the worse for liquor the whole time with wondrous stuff which they called wine  or did no captive escaped by miracle from the butcheries of the amphitheatre return to tell his countrymen how all the rest had died like german men and call on them to rise and avenge their brothers blood  yes surely the teutons knew well even in the time of tacitus of the micklegard the great city and all its glory  every fresh tribe who passed along the frontier of gaul or of noricum would hear more and more of it see more and more men who had actually been there  if the glory of the city exercised on its own inhabitants an intoxicating influence as of a place omnipotent superhuman divineit would exercise exaggerated as it would be a still stronger influence on the barbarians outside and what wonder if they pressed southwards at first in the hope of taking the mighty city and afterwards as her real strength became more known of at least seizing some of those colonial cities which were as superhuman in their eyes as rome itself would have been  in the crusades the children whenever they came to a great town asked their parents if that was not jerusalem  and so it may be many a gallant young teuton on entering for the first time such a city as cologne lyons or vienna whispered half trembling to his lordsurely this must be rome  some such arguments as these might surely be brought in favour of a greater migration than dr latham is inclined to allow but i must leave the question for men of deeper research and wider learning than i possess     lecture iiithe human deluge   i have taken in hand said sir francis drake once to the crew of the immortal pelican that which i know not how to accomplish  yea it hath even bereaved me of my wits to think of it  and so i must say on the subject of this lecture  i wish to give you some notion of the history of italy for nearly one hundred years say from 400 to 500  but it is very difficult  how can a man draw a picture of that which has no shape or tell the order of absolute disorder  it is all a horrible fourmillement des nations like the working of an ant heap like the insects devouring each other in a drop of water  teuton tribes sclavonic tribes tartar tribes roman generals empresses bishops courtiers adventurers appear for a moment out of the crowd dim phantomsnothing more most of themwith a name appended and then vanish proving their humanity only by leaving behind them one more stain of blood  and what became of the masses all the while of the men slaves the greater part of them if not all who tilled the soil and ground the cornfor man must have eaten then as now  we have no hint  one trusts that god had mercy on them if not in this world still in the world to come  man at least had none  taking ones stand at rome and looking toward the north what does one see for nearly one hundred years  wave after wave rising out of the north the land of night and wonder and the terrible unknown visible only as the light of roman civilization strikes their crests and they dash against the alps and roll over through the mountain passes into the fertile plains below  then at last they are seen but too well and you discover that the waves are living men women and children horses dogs and cattle all rushing headlong into that great whirlpool of italy and yet the gulf is never full  the earth drinks up the blood the bones decay into the fruitful soil the very names and memories of whole tribes are washed away  and the result of an immigration which may be counted by hundreds of thousands is thisthat all the land is waste  the best authorities which i can give you though you will find many more in gibbon arefor the main story jornandes de rebus geticis  himself a goth he wrote the history of his race and that of attila and his huns in good rugged latin not without force and sense  then claudian the poet a bombastic panegyrist of contemporary roman scoundrels but full of curious facts if one could only depend on them  then the earlier books of procopius de bello gothico and the chronicle of zosimus  salvian ennodius and sidonius apollinaris as christians will give you curious details especially as to south france and north italy while many particulars of the first sack of rome with comments thereon which express the highest intellects of that day you will find in st jeromes letters and st augustines city of god  but if you want these dreadful times explained to you i do not think you can do better than to take your bibles and to read the revelations of st john the apostle  i shall quote them more than once in this lecture  i cannot help quoting them  the words come naturally to my lips as fitter to the facts than any words of my own  i do not come here to interpret the book of revelations  i do not understand that book  but i do say plainly though i cannot interpret the book that the book has interpreted those times to me  its awful metaphors give me more living and accurate pictures of what went on than any that gibbons faithful details can give  you may see if you have spiritual eyes wherewith to see the dragon the serpent symbol of political craft and the devilish wisdom of the roman giving authority to the beast the symbol of brute power to mongrel aetiuses and bonifaces barbarian stilichos ricimers and aspars and a host of similar adventurers whose only strength was force  you may see the world wondering after the beast and worshipping brute force as the only thing left to believe in  you may see the nations of the world gnawing their tongues for pain and blaspheming god but not repenting of their deeds  you may see the faith and patience of the saintsmen like augustine salvian epiphanius severinus deogratias of carthage and a host more no doubt whose names the world will never hearthe salt of the earth which kept it all from rotting  you may see babylon the great fallen and all the kings and merchants of the earth bewailing her afar off and watching the smoke of her torment  you may see as st john warns you thatafter her fall mindif men would go on worshipping the beast and much more his imagethe phantom and shadow of brute force after the reality had passed awaythey should drink of the wine of the wrath of god and be tormented for ever  for you may see how those degenerate romans did go on worshipping the shadow of brute force and how they were tormented for ever and had no rest day or night because they worshipped the beast and his image  you may see all the fowl of the heavens flocking together to the feast of the great god to eat the flesh of kings and captains horse and rider bond and freeall carrionbirds human as well as bruteall greedy villains and adventurers the scoundreldom of the whole world flocking in to get their share of the carcass of the dying empire as the vulture and the raven flock in to the carrion when the royal eagles have gorged their fill  and lastly you may see if god give you grace one who is faithful and true with a name which no man knew save himself making war in righteousness against all evil bringing order out of disorder hope out of despair fresh health and life out of old disease and death executing just judgment among all the nations of the earth and sending down from heaven the city of god in the light of which the nations of those who are saved should walk and the kings of the earth should bring their power and their glory into it with the tree of life in the midst of it whose leaves should be for the healing of the nations  again i say i am not here to interpret the book of revelations but this i say that that book interprets those times to me  leaving for the present at least to better historians than myself the general subject of the teutonic immigrations the conquest of north gaul by the franks of britain by the saxons and angles of burgundy by the burgundians of africa by the vandals i shall speak rather of those teutonic tribes which actually entered and conquered italy and first of course of the goths  especially interesting to us english should their fortunes be for they are said to be very near of kin to us at least to those jutes who conquered kent  as goths geats getae juts antiquarians find them in early and altogether mythic times in the scandinavian peninsula and the isles and mainland of denmark  their name it is said is the same as one name for the supreme being goth guth yuth signifies war  god is the highest warrior the lord of hosts and the progenitor of the race whether as an eponym hero or as the supreme deity  physical force was their rude notion of divine power and tiu tiv or tyr in like manner who was originally the god of the clear sky the zeus or jove of the greeks and romans became by virtue of his warlike character identical with the roman mars till the dies martis of the roman week became the german tuesday  working their way down from gothland and jutland we know not why nor when thrusting aside the cognate burgunds and the sclavonic tribes whom they met on the road they had spread themselves in the third century over the whole south of russia and westward over the danubian provinces and hungary  the ostrogoths eastgoths lay from the volga to the borysthenes the visigoths westgoths from the borysthenes to the theiss  behind them lay the gepidae a german tribe who had come south eastward with them and whose name is said to signify the men who had bided remained behind the rest  what manner of men they were it is hard to say so few details are left to us  but we may conceive them as a tall fairhaired people clothed in shirts and smocks of embroidered linen and gaiters crossstrapped with hide their arms and necks encircled with gold and silver rings the warriors at least of the upper class well horsed and armed with lance and heavy sword with chainmail and helmets surmounted with plumes horns towers dragons boars and the other strange devices which are still seen on the crests of german nobles  this much we can guess for in this way their ancestors or at least relations the wargeats appear clothed in the grand old song of beowulf  their land must have been tilled principally by slaves usually captives taken in war but the noble mystery of the forge where arms and ornaments were made was an honourable craft for men of rank and their ladies as in the middle age prided themselves on their skill with the needle and the loom  their language has been happily preserved to us in ulfilas translation of the scriptures  for these goths the greater number of them at least were by this time christians or very nearly such  good bishop ulfilas brought up a christian and consecrated by order of constantine the great had been labouring for years to convert his adopted countrymen from the worship of thor and woden  he had translated the bible for them and had constructed a gothic alphabet for that purpose  he had omitted however prudently as he considered the books of kings with their histories of the jewish wars  the goths he held were only too fond of fighting already and needed in that matter the bit rather than the spur  he had now a large number of converts some of whom had even endured persecution from their heathen brethren  athanaric judge or alderman of the thervings had sent through the campso runs the storythe waggon which bore the idol of woden and had burnt with their tents and their families those who refused to worship  they like all other german tribes were ruled over by two royal races sons of woden and the asas  the ostrogoth race was the amalungsthe heavenly or spotless race the visigoth race was the balthungsthe bold or valiant race and from these two families and from a few others but all believed to be lineally descended from woden and now much intermixed are derived all the old royal families of europe that of the house of brunswick among the rest  that they were no savages is shewn sufficiently by their names at least those of their chiefs  such names as alaric all rich or all powerful ataulf the helping father fridigern the willing peace maker and so forthall the names in fact which can be put back into their native form out of their romanized distortions are tokens of a people far removed from that barbarous state in which men are named after personal peculiarities natural objects or the beasts of the field  on this subject you may consult as full of interest and instruction the list of teutonic names given in muratori  they had broken over the roman frontier more than once and taken cities they had compelled the emperor gratian to buy them off  they had built themselves flatbottomed boats without iron in them and sailed from the crimea round the shores of the black sea once and again plundering trebizond and at last the temple itself of diana at ephesus  they had even penetrated into greece and athens plundered the parthenon and threatened the capitol  they had fought the emperor decius till he and many of his legionaries were drowned in a bog in the moment of victory they had been driven with difficulty back across the danube by aurelian and walled out of the empire with the allemanni by probuss teufelsmauer stretching from the danube to the rhine  their time was not yet come by a hundred years  but they had seen and tasted the fine things of the sunny south and did not forget them amid the steppes and snows  at last a sore need came upon them  about 350 there was a great king among them ermanaric the powerful warrior comparable says jornandes to alexander himself who had conquered all the conquered tribes around  when he was past 100 years old a chief of the roxolani ugrians according to dr latham men of ros or russia one of these tribes plotted against him and sent for help to the new people the huns who had just appeared on the confines of europe and asia  old ermanaric tore the traitors wife to pieces with wild horses but the huns came nevertheless  a magic hind the goths said guided the new people over the steppes to the land of the goths and then vanished  they fought with the goths and defeated them  old ermanaric stabbed himself for shame and the hearts of the goths became as water before the tempest of nations  they were supernatural creatures the goths believed engendered of witches and demons on the steppes pigeyed hideous beings with cakes instead of faces offam magis quam faciem under ratskin caps armed with arrows tipped with bone and lassos of cord eating marketing sleeping on horseback so grown into the saddle that they could hardly walk in their huge boots  with them were acatzirs painted blue hair as well as skin alans wandering with their waggons like the huns armed with heavy cuirasses of plaited horn their horses decked with human scalps geloni armed with a scythe wrapt in a cloak of human skin bulgars who impaled their prisonerssavages innumerable as the locust swarms  who could stand against them  in the year 375 the west goths came down to the danubebank and entreated the romans to let them cross  there was a christian party among them persecuted by the heathens and hoping for protection from rome  athanaric had vowed never to set foot on roman soil and after defending himself against the huns retired into the forests of caucaland  good bishop ulfilas and his converts looked longingly toward the christian empire  surely the christians would receive them as brothers welcome them help them  the simple german fancied a roman even such a one as themselves  ulfilas went on embassy to antioch to valens the emperor  valens low born cruel and covetous was an arian and could not lose the opportunity of making converts  he sent theologians to meet ulfilas and torment him into arianism  when he arrived valens tormented him himself  while the goths starved he argued apostasy was the absolute condition of his help till ulfilas in a weak moment gave his word that the goths should become arians if valens would give them lands on the south bank of the danube  then they would be the emperors men and guard the marches against all foes  from that time arianism became the creed not only of the goths but of the vandals the sueves and almost all the teutonic tribes  it was if the story be true a sinful and foolish compact forced from a good man by the sight of his countrymens extreme danger and misery  it avenged itself soon enough upon both goths and romans  to the goths themselves the change must have seemed not only unimportant but imperceptible  unaccustomed to that accuracy of thought which is too often sneered at by gibbon as metaphysical subtlety all of which they would have been aware was the change of a few letters in a creed written in an unknown tongue  they could not know ulfilas himself could not have known only two years after the death of st athanasius at alexandria while the nicaean creed was as yet received by only half of the empire and while he meanwhile had been toiling for years in the danubian wilds ignorant perhaps of the controversy which had meanwhile convulsed the churchneither the goths nor he i say could have known that the arianism which they embraced was really the last and as it were apologetic refuge of dying polytheism that it and not the catholic faith denied the abysmal unity of the godhead that by making the son inferior to the father as touching his godhead it invented two gods a greater and a lesser thus denying the absoluteness the infinity the illimitability by any category of quantity of that one eternal of whom it is written that god is a spirit  still less could they have guessed that when arius the handsome popular preacher whose very name perhaps ulfilas never heard asked the fine ladies of alexandriahad you a son before that son was bornno  then god could have no son before that son was begotten cthat he was mingling up the idea of time with the idea of that eternal god who created time and debasing to the accidents of before and after that timeless and eternal generation of which it is written thou art my son this day have i begotten thee  still less could ulfilas or his goths have known that the natural human tendency to condition god by time would be in later ages even long after arianism was crushed utterly the parent of many a cruel gross and stupid superstition  to them it would have been a mere question whether woden the allfather was superior to one of his sons the asas and the catholic faith probably seemed to them an impious assumption of equality on the part of one of those asas with woden himself  of the battle between arianism and orthodoxy i have said enough to shew you that i think it an internecine battle between truth and falsehood but it has been long ago judged by wager of battle by the success of that duel of time of which we must believe as our forefathers believed of all fair duels that god defends the right  so the goths were to come over the danube stream but they must give up their arms and deliver their children those of rank one supposes as hostages to be educated by the romans as romans  they crossed the fatal river they were whole days in crossing those set to count them gave it up in despair ammianus says he who wishes to know their number        libyci velit aequoris idem    discere quam multae zephyro volvuntur arenae  and when they were across they gave up the children  they had not the heart to give up the beloved weapons  the roman commissioners let them keep the arms at the price of many a gothic womans honour  ugly and foul things happened of which we have only hints  then they had to be fed for the time being till they could cultivate their land  lupicinus and maximus the two governors of thrace pocketed the funds which valens sent and starved the goths  the markets were full of carrion and dogs flesh  anything was good enough for a barbarian  their fringed carpets their beautiful linens all went  a little wholesome meat cost 10 pounds of silver  when all was gone they had to sell their children  to establish a slavetrade in the beautiful boys and girls was just what the wicked romans wanted  at last the end came  they began to rise  fridigern their king kept them quiet till the time was ripe for revenge  the romans trying to keep the west goths down got so confused it seems that they let the whole nation of the east goths of whom we shall hear more hereafter dash across the danube and establish themselves in the north of the present turkey to the east of the west goths  then at marcianopolis the capital of lower moesia lupicinus asked fridigern and his chiefs to a feast  the starving goths outside were refused supplies from the market and came to blows with the guards lupicinus half drunk heard of it and gave orders for a massacre fridigern escaped from the palace sword in hand  the smouldering embers burst into flame the warcry was raised and the villain lupicinus fled for his life  then began war south of the danube  the roman legions were defeated by the goths who armed themselves with the weapons of the dead  moesia was overrun with fire and sword  adrianople was attacked but in vain  the slaves in the gold mines were freed from their misery and shewed the goths the mountainpasses and the stores of grain  as they went on the goths recovered their children  the poor things told horrid tales and the goths maddened avenged themselves on the romans of every age and sex  they left says st jerome nothing alivenot even the beasts of the field till nothing was left but growing brambles and thick forests  valens the emperor was at antioch  now he hurried to constantinople but too late  the east goths had joined the west goths and hordes of huns alans and taifalae detestable savages of whom we know nothing but evil had joined fridigerns confederacy  gratian valens colleague and nephew son of valentinian the bearward had just won a great victory over the allemanni at colmar in alsace and valens was jealous of his glory  he is said to have been a virtuous youth whose monomania was shooting  he fell in love with the wild alans in spite of their horsetrappings of scalps simply because of their skill in archery formed a bodyguard of them and passed his time hunting with them round paris  nevertheless he won this great victory by the help it seems of one count ricimer everpowerful count of the domestics whose name proclaims him a german  valens was jealous of gratians fame he was stung by the reproaches of the mob of constantinople and he undervalued the goths on account of some successes of his lieutenants who had recovered much of the plunder taken by them and had utterly overpowered the foul taifalae transporting them to lands about modena and parma in italy  he rejected count ricimers advice to wait till gratian reinforced him with the victorious western legions and determined to give battle a few miles from adrianople  had he waited for gratian the history of the whole world might have been different  for on the ninth of august ad 378 the fatal day the second cannae from which rome never recovered as from that first the young world and the old world met and fought it out and the young world won  the light roman cavalry fled before the long lances and heavy swords of the german knights  the knights turned on the infantry broke them hunted them down by charge after charge and left the footmen to finish the work  twothirds of the roman army were destroyed four counts of the empire generals and officers without number  valens fled wounded to a cottage the goths set it on fire and burned him and his staff therein ignorant that they had in their hands the emperor of rome  verily there is a god who judgeth the earth  so thought the catholics of that day who saw in the fearful death of valens a punishment for his having forced the goths to become arians  it was just says one that he should burn on earth by whose counsels so many barbarians will burn in hell for ever  there are as i have shewn still darker counts in the conduct of the romans toward the goths enough if we believe our bibles to draw down on the guilty the swift and terrible judgments of god  at least this was the second cannae the deathwound of rome  from that day the end was certain however slow  the teuton had at last tried his strength against the roman  the wild forestchild had found himself suddenly at deathgrips with the enchanter whom he had feared and almost worshipped for so long and behold to his own wonder he was no more a child but grown into a man and the stronger if not the cunninger of the two  there had been a spell upon him the romani nominis umbra but from that day the spell was broken  he had faced a roman emperor a divus caesar the mangod by whose head all nations swore rich with the magic wealth wise with the magic cunning of centuries of superhuman glory and he had killed him and behold he died like other men  that he had done  what was there left for him now that he could not do  the stronger he was but not yet the cunninger of the two  the goths could do no more  they had to leave adrianople behind them with the emperors treasures safe within its walls to gaze with childish wonder at the bosphorus and its palaces to recoil in awe from the long walls of constantinople and the great stones which the engines thereon hurled at them by arsmetricke and nigromancy as their descendants believed of the roman mechanicians even five hundred years after to hear without being able to avenge the horrible news that the gothic lads distributed throughout asia to be educated as romans had been decoyed into the cities by promises of lands and honours and then massacred in cold blood and then to settle down leaving their children unavenged for twenty years on the rich land which we now call turkey in europe waiting till the time was come  waiting i say till the time was come  the fixed idea that rome if not constantinople could be taken at last probably never left the minds of the leading goths after the battle of adrianople  the altered policy of the caesars was enough of itself to keep that idea alive  so far from expelling them from the country which they had seized the new emperor began to flatter and to honour them  they had been heretofore regarded as savages either to be driven back by main force or tempted to enlist in the roman ranks  theodosius regarded them as a nation and one which it was his interest to hire to trust to indulge at the expense of his roman subjects  theodosius has received the surname of greatseemingly by comparison inter caecos luscus rex and it was highly creditable to a roman emperor in those days to be neither ruffian nor villain but a handsome highbred courteous gentleman pure in his domestic life an orthodox christian and sufficiently obedient to the church to forgive the monks who had burnt a jewish synagogue and to do penance in the cathedral of milan for the massacre of thessalonica  that the morals of the empire if zosimus is to be at all believed grew more and more effeminate corrupt reckless that the soldiers if vegetius is to be believed actually laid aside by royal permission their helmets and cuirasses as too heavy for their degenerate bodies that the roman heavy infantry which had conquered the world ceased to exist while its place was taken by that teutonic heavy cavalry which decided every battle in europe till the english yeoman at crecy and poictiers turned again the balance of arms in favour of the men who fought on foot that the goths became the foederati or allies of the empire paid to fight its battles against maximus the spaniard and arbogast the frank the rebels who after the murder of young gratian attempted to set up a separate empire in the west that stilicho the vandal was the emperors trusted friend and master of the horse that alaric the balth and other noble goths were learning to combine with their native courage those roman tactics which they only needed to become masters of the world that in all cities even in the royal palace the huge goth swaggered in roman costume his neck and arms heavy with golden torcs and bracelets or even as in the case of fravitta and priulf stabbed his enemy with impunity at the imperial table that greek text to disturb the goths was a deadly offence throughout the empire all these things did not prevent a thousand new statues from rising in honour of the great caesar and excited nothing more than grumblings of impotent jealousy from a people whose maxim had become let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die  three anecdotes will illustrate sufficiently the policy of theodosius toward his inconvenient guests  towards the beginning of his reign when the goths after the death of the great fridigern were broken up and quarreling among themselves he tempted a royal amal modar by name by the title of mastergeneral to attack and slaughter in their sleep a rival tribe of goths and carry off an immense spoil to the imperial camp  to destroy the german by the german was so old a method of the roman policy that it was not considered derogatory to the greatness of theodosius  the old athanaric the thervinghe who had sworn never to set foot on roman soil and had burnt them who would not fall down and worship before wodens waggon came over the danube out of the forests of caucaland and put himself at the head of the goths  the great caesar trembled before the heathen hero and they made peace together and old athanaric went to him at constantinople and they became as friends  and the romani nominis umbra the glamour of the roman name fell on the old man too feeble now to fight and as he looked says jornandes on the site of the city and on the fleets of ships and the worldfamous walls and the people from all the nations upon earth he said now i behold what i have often heard tell and never believed  the kaiser is a god on earth and he who shall lift his hand against him is guilty of his own blood the old hero died in constantinople and the really goodnatured emperor gave him a grand funeral and a statue and so delighted the simple goths that the whole nation entered his service bodily and became the emperors men  the famous massacre of thessalonica and the penance of theodosius immortalized by the pencil of vandyke is another significant example of the relation between goth and roman  one botheric a vandal or other teuton by his name was military commandant of that important post  he put in prison a popular charioteer of the circus for a crime for which the teutonic language had to borrow a foreign name and which the teutons like ourselves punished with death though it was committed with impunity in any roman city  at the public games the base mob clamoured but in vain for the release of their favourite and not getting him rose on botheric murdered him and his officers and dragged their corpses through the streets  this was indeed greek text and theodosius partly in honest indignation partly perhaps in fear of the consequences issued orders from milan which seem to have amounted to a permission to the goths to avenge themselves  the populace were invited as usual to the games of the circus and crowded in forgetful of their crime heedless of danger absorbed in the one greed of frivolous if not sinful pleasure  the gothic troops concealed around entered and then began a murder grim and great  for three hours it lasted  every age and sex innocent or guilty native or foreigner to the number of at least 7000 perished or are said to have perished and the soul of botheric had good company on its way to valhalla  the goths doubtless considered that they were performing an act of public justice upon villains but the bishops of the church looked at the matter in another light  the circumstances of treachery the confusion of the innocent with the guilty the want of any judicial examination and sentence aroused their sense of humanity and justice  the offence was aggravated by the thought that the victims were roman and orthodox the murderers barbarians and arians st ambrose with a noble courage stopped the emperor at the door of the basilica of milan and forbad him to enter till he had atoned for the fatal order by public penance  the caesar submitted nobly to the noble demand and the repentance of theodosius is the last scene in the downward career of the caesars which can call forth a feeling of admiration and respect  in january 395 theodosius died and after him came the deluge  the empire was parted between his two worthless sons  honorius had the west arcadius the east while the real master of the empire was stilicho the vandal whose virtues and valour and mighty stature are sung and not undeservedly in the pompous verses of claudian  of the confusion which ensued of the murder welldeserved of rufinus the infamous minister whose devout hypocrisy had so long cajoled theodosius of the revolt and atrocities of gildo in africa you must read in the pages of gibbon these lectures confine themselves at present to the history of the goths  in january 395 i said theodosius died  before the end of the winter the goths were in arms with alaric the balth at their head  they had been refused at least for the time the payment of their usual subsidy he had been refused the command of the roman armies  any excuse was sufficient  the fruit was ripe for plucking  the wrongs of centuries were to be avenged  other tribes crost the danube on the ice and joined the goths and the mighty host swept down through greece passing thermopylae unopposed ransoming athens where alaric enjoyed a greek bath and a public banquet and tried to behave for a day like a roman gentleman sacking corinth argos sparta and all the cities and villages far and wide and carrying off plunder inestimable and troops of captive women  stilicho threw himself into the peloponnese at corinth to cut off the goths and after heavy fighting alaric who seems to have been a really great general outmanoeuvred him crost the gulf of corinth at rhium with all his plunder and captives and got safe away into northern greece  there arcadius the terrified emperor of the east punished him for having devastated greece by appointing him mastergeneral of the very country which he had ravaged  the end was coming very near  the goths lifted him on the shield and proclaimed him king of the west goths and there he staid somewhere about the head of the adriatic poised like an eagle in midair watching rome on one side and byzant on the other uncertain on which quarry he should swoop  he made up his mind for rome  he would be the man to do the deed at last  there was a saga in which he trusted  claudian gives it in an hexameter     alpibus italiae ruptis penetrabis ad urbem  yes he would take the city and avenge the treachery of valens and all the wrongs which teutons had endured from the romans for now four centuries  and he did it  but not the first time  he swept over the alps  honorius fled to asta and alaric besieged him there  the faithful stilicho came to the rescue and alaric was driven to extremities  his warriors counselled him to retreat  no he would take rome or die  but at pollentia stilicho surprised him while he and his goths were celebrating easter sunday and a fearful battle followed  the romans stormed his camp recovered the spoils of greece and took his wife decked in the jewels in which she meant to enter rome  one longs to know what became of her  at least so say the romans the goths tell a very different story and one suspects that pollentia may be one more of those splendid paper victories in which the teutons were utterly exterminated only to rise out of the ground seemingly stronger and more numerous than ever  at least instead of turning his head to the alps he went on toward rome stilicho dared not fight him again and bought him off  he turned northward toward gaul and at verona stilicho got him at an advantage and fought him once more and if we are to believe rosino and claudian beat him again  taceo de alarico saepe victo saepe concluso semperque dimisso  it is ill work trapping an eagle says some one when you have caught him the safest thing very often is to let him go again  meanwhile poured down into italy as far as florence a merely unimportant episode in those fearful days another wave of german invaders under one radogast 200000 strong  under the walls of florence they sat down and perished of wine and heat and dysentery  like water they flowed in and like water they sank into the soil and every one of them a human soul  stilicho and honorius went to rome and celebrated their triumph over the goths with for the last time in history gladiatorial sports  three years past and then stilicho was duly rewarded for having saved rome in the approved method for every great barbarian who was fool enough to help the treacherous roman namely by being murdered  alaric rose instantly and with him all the gothic tribes  down through italy he past almost without striking a blow  ravenna infamous according to sidonius for its profligacy where the emperors court was he past disdainfully and sat down before the walls of rome  he did not try to storm it  probably he could not  he had no such machines as those with which the romans battered walls  quietly he sat he and his goths as wolves wait round the dying buffalo waiting for the romans within to starve and die  they did starve and die men murdered each other for food mothers ate their own babes but they sent out embassies boasting of their strength and numbers  alaric laughedthe thicker the hay the easier it is mowed  what terms would he take  all your gold all your silver the best of your precious things  all your barbarian slaves  that last is significant  he would deliver his own flesh and blood  the teuton man should be free  the trolls should drag no more of the forest children into their accursed den  what then will you leave us  your lives  they bought him off with a quaint ransom 5000 pounds weight of gold 30000 of silver 4000 robes of silk 3000 pieces of scarlet cloth and 3000 lbs of pepper possibly spices of all kinds  gold and finery and spicesgifts fit for children such as those goths were  but he got too 40000 teuton slaves safe out of the evil place and embodied them into his army  he had now 100000 fighting men  why did he not set up as king of italy  was it that the awe of the place the prestige of the roman name cowed him  it cowed each of the teutonic invaders successively  to make themselves emperors of rome was a thing of which they dared not dream  be that as it may all he asked was to be received as some sort of vassal of the emperor  the mastergeneralship of italy subsidies for his army an independent command in the tyrolese country whence he had come were his demand  overblown with selfconceit the romans refused him  they would listen to no conditions  they were in a thoroughly chinese temper  you will find the byzantine empire in the same temper centuries after blinded to present weakness by the traditions of their forefathers strength  they had worshipped the beast  now that only his image was left they worshipped that  alaric seized ostia and cut off their supplies  they tried to appease him by dethroning honorius and setting up some puppet attalus  alaric found him plotting or said that he had done so and degraded him publicly at rimini before his whole army  again he offered peace  the insane romans proclaimed that his guilt precluded him for ever from the clemency of the empire  then came the end  he marched on rome  the salarian gate was thrown open at midnight probably by german slaves within and then for five dreadful days and nights the wicked city expiated in agony the sins of centuries  and so at last the nibelungen hoard was won  and the kings of the earth who had lived delicately with her and the merchants of the earth who were made rich by her bewailed her standing afar off for the fear of her torment and crying alas alas that great babylon for in one hour is thy judgment come  st john passes in those words from the region of symbol to that of literal description  a great horror fell upon all nations when the news came  rome taken  surely the end of all things was at hand  the wretched fugitives poured into egypt and syriaespecially to jerusalem perhaps with some superstitious hope that christs tomb or even christ himself might save them  st jerome as he saw day by day patrician men and women who had passed their lives in luxury begging their bread around his hermitage at bethlehem wrote of the fall of rome as a man astonied  st augustine at hippo could only look on it as the end of all human power and glory perhaps of the earth itself  babylon the great had fallen and now christ was coming in the clouds of heaven to set up the city of god for ever  in that thought he wrote his de civitate dei  read it gentlemenespecially you who are to be priestsnot merely for its details of the fall of rome but as the noblest theodicy which has yet proceeded from a human pen  followed by long trains of captives long trains of waggons bearing the spoils of all the world alaric went on south with the native instinct of the barbarian as dr sheppard well says  always toward the sun away from muspelheim and the dark cold north toward the sun and valhalla where odin and the asas dwell in everlasting light  he tried to cross into sicily but a storm wrecked his boats and the goths were afraid of the sea  and after a while he died  and the wild men made a great mourning over him  they had now no plan left no heart to go south and look for odin over the sea  but of one thing they were resolved that the base romans should not dig up alaric out of his barrow and scatter his bones to the winds  so they put no barrow over the great king but under the walls of cosenza they turned the riverbed and in that riverbed they set alaric armed and mailed upright upon his horse with gold and jewels and arms and it may be captive youths and maids that he might enter into valhalla in royal pomp and make a worthy show among the heroes in odins hall  and then they turned back the river into its bed and slew the slaves who had done the work that no man might know where alaric lies and no man does know till this day  as i said they had no plan left now  two years they stayed in campania basking in the villas and gardens drinking their fill of the wine and then flowed away northward again no one knows why  they had no wish to settle as they might have done  they followed some godgiven instinct undiscoverable now by us  ataulf alarics kinsman married placidia the emperors beautiful young sister and accepted from him some sort of commission to fight against his enemies in gaul  so to the south of gaul they went and then into spain crushing before them alans sueves and vandals and quarrelling among themselves  ataulf was murdered and all his children placidia put to shame  then she had her revenge  to me it is not so much horrible as pitiful  they had got the nibelungen hoard and with it the nibelungen curse  a hundred years afterwards when the franks pillaged the gothic palace of narbonne they found the remnants of it  things inestimable indescribable tables of solid emerald the missorium a dish 2500 lbs weight covered with all the gems of india  they had been in solomons temple fancied the simple franksas indeed some of them may well have been  the arabs got the great emerald table at last with its three rows of great pearls  where are they all now  what is become gentlemen of the treasures of rome  jewels recollect are all but indestructible recollect too that vast quantities were buried from time to time and their places forgotten  perhaps future generations will discover many such hoards  meanwhile many of those same jewels must be in actual use even now  many a gem which hangs now on an english ladys wrist saw alaric sack romeand saw before and sincewhat not  the palaces of the pharaohs or of darius then the pomp of the ptolemies or of the seleucidscame into europe on the neck of some vulgar drunken wife of a roman proconsul to glitter for a few centuries at every gladiators butchery in the amphitheatre then went away with placidia on a gothic ox waggon to pass into an arab seraglio at seville and then perhaps back from sultan to sultan again to its native india to figure in the peacock throne of the great mogul and be bought at last by some armenian for a few rupees from an english soldier and come hitherand whither next when england shall be what alexandria and rome are now that little stone will be as bright as everan awful symbol if you will take it so of the permanence of gods works and gods laws amid the wild chance and change of sinful man  then followed for rome years of peacesuch peace as the wicked make for themselvesa troubled sea casting up mire and dirt  wicked women wicked counts mayors of the palace one may call them like aetius and boniface the real rulers of a nominal empire  puppet valentinian succeeded his father puppet honorius  in his days appeared another great portentanother comet sweeping down out of infinite space and back into infinite space againattila and his huns they lay in innumerable hordes upon the danube until honoria valentinians sister confined in a convent at constantinople for some profligacy sent her ring to attila  he must be her champion and deliver her  he paused a while like alaric before him doubting whether to dash on constantinople or rome and at last decided for rome  but he would try gaul first and into gaul he poured with all his tartar hordes and with them all the teuton tribes who had gathered in his progress as an avalanche gathers the snow in its course  at the great battle of chalons in the year 451 he fought it out hun sclav tartar and finn backed by teutonic gepid and herule turkling east goth and lombard against roman and west goth frank and burgund and the bretons of armorica  wicked aetius shewed himself that day as always a general and a herothe marlborough of his timeand conquered  attila and his hordes rolled away eastward and into italy for rome  that is the hunnenschlacht a battle as jornandes calls it atrox multiplex immane pertinax  antiquity he says tells of nothing like it  no man who had lost that sight could say that he had seen aught worth seeinga fight gigantic supernatural in vastness and horror and the legends which still hang about the place  you may see one of them in von kaulbachs immortal designthe ghosts of the huns and the ghosts of the germans rising from their graves on the battlenight in every year to fight it over again in the clouds while the country far and wide trembles at their ghostly hurrah  no wonder men remember that hunnenschlacht  many consider that it saved europe that it was one of the decisive battles of the world  not that attila was ruined  within the year he had swept through germany crossed the alps and devastated italy almost to the walls of rome  and there the great pope leo the cicero of preaching the homer of theology the aristotle of true philosophy met the wild heathen and a sacred horror fell upon attila and he turned and went his way to die a year or two after no man knows how  over and above his innumerable wives he took a beautiful german girl  when his people came in the morning the girl sat weeping or seeming to weep but etzel the scourge of god lay dead in a pool of gore  she said that he had burst a blood vessel  the teutons whispered among themselves that like a freeborn teuton she had slain her tyrant  one longs to know what became of her  and then the hordes broke up  ardarich raised the teuton gepids and ostrogoths  the teutons who had obeyed attila turned on their tartar conquerors the only people who had ever subdued german men and then only by brute force of overpowering numbers  at netad upon the great plain between the drave and the danube they fought the second hunnenschlacht and the germans conquered  thirty thousand huns fell on that dreadful day and the rest streamed away into the heart of asia into the infinite unknown deserts from whence the foul miscreants had streamed forth and left the teutons masters of the world  the battle of netad that and not chalons to my mind was the saving battle of europe  so rome was saved but only for a few years  puppet valentinian rewarded aetius for saving rome by stabbing with his own hand in his own palace the hero of chalons and then went on to fill up the cup of his iniquity it is all more like some horrible romance than sober history  neglecting his own wife eudoxia he took it into his wicked head to ravish her intimate friend the wife of a senator  maximus stabbed him retaliated on the beautiful empress and made himself emperor  she sent across the seas to africa to genseric the vandal the cruel tyrant and persecutor he must come and be her champion as attila had been honorias  and he came with vandals moors naked ausurians from the atlas  the wretched romans in their terror tore maximus in pieces but it was too late eudoxia met genseric at the gates in royal robes and jewels  he stript her of her jewels on the spot and sacked rome and that was her reward  this is the second sack  more dreadful far than the first455 is its date  then it was that the statues whose fragments are still found were hurled in vain on the barbarian assailants  not merely gold and jewels but the arttreasures of rome were carried off to the vandal fleet and with them the golden table and the sevenbranched candlestick which titus took from the temple of jerusalem  how had these things escaped the goths forty years before  we cannot tell  perhaps the gothic sack which only lasted five days was less complete than this one which went on for fourteen days of unutterable horrors  the plunderers were not this time sturdy honest goths not even german slaves mad to revenge themselves on their masters they were moors ausurian black savages and all the pirates and cutthroats of the mediterranean  sixty thousand prisoners were carried off to carthage  all the statues were wrecked on the voyage to africa and lost for ever  and yet rome did not die  she lingered on her emperor still calling himself an emperor her senate a senate feeding her lazy plebs as best she could with the remnant of those revenues which former emperors had set aside for their supporttheir public bread public pork public oil public wine public bathsand leaving them to gamble and quarrel and listen to the lawyers in rags and rascality and to rise and murder ruler after ruler benefactor after benefactor out of base jealousy and fear of any one less base than themselves  and so the smoke of her torment went up continually  but if rome would not die still less would she repent as it is writtenthe remnant of the people repented not of their deeds but gnawed their tongues for pain and blasphemed the god of heaven  as the century runs on the confusion becomes more and more dreadful anthemius olybrius orestes and the other halfcaste romans with greek names who become quasiemperors and get murdered ricimer the sueve the kingmaker and kingmurderer even good majorian who as puppet emperor set up by ricimer tries to pass a few respectable laws and is only murdered all the sooner  none of these need detain us  they mean nothing they represent no idea they are simply kites and crows quarrelling over the carcase and cannot possibly teach us anything but the terrible lesson that in all revolutions the worst men are certain to rise to the top  but only for a while gentlemen only for a while  villany is by its very essence selfdestructive and if rogues have their day the time comes when rogues fall out and honest men come by their own  that day however was not come for wretched rome  a third time she was sacked by ricimer her own general and then more villains ruled her and more kites and crows plundered her  the last of them only need keep us a while  he is odoacer the giant herule houdywacker as some say his name really is a soubriquet perhaps from his warcry hold ye stoutly stand you steady  his father was aedecon attilas secretary chief of the little turkling tribe who though teutonic had clung faithfully to attilas sons and after the battle of netad came to ruin  there are strange stories of odoacer  one from the lives of st severinus how odoacer and his brothers started over the alps knapsacks at back to seek their fortunes in italy and take service with the romans and how they came to st severinus cell near vienna and went in heathens as they probably were to get a blessing from the holy hermit and how odoacer had to stoop and stand stooping so huge he was  and how the saint saw that he was no common lad and said go into italy clothed in thy ragged sheepskins thou shalt soon give greater gifts to thy friends  so he went and his brother with him  one of them at least ought to interest us  he was onulf hunwulf wulf guelph the wolfcub who went away to constantinople and saw strange things and did strange things likewise and at last got back to germany and settled in bavaria and became the ancestor of all the guelphs and of victoria queen of england  his son wulfgang fought under belisarius against the goths his son again ulgang under belisarius against persian and lombard his son or grandson was queen brunhildas confidant in france and became duke of burgundy and after that the fortunes of his family were mixed up with the merovingian kings of france and then again with the lombards in italy till one of them emerges as guelf count of altorf the ancestor of our guelphic line  but to return to odoacer  he came to rome seeking his fortune  there he found in power orestes his fathers old colleague at attilas court the most unprincipled turncoat of his day who had been the emperors man then attilas man and would be anybodys man if needed but who was now his own man being kingmaker for the time being and father of the puppet emperor romulus augustulus a pretty little lad with an ominous name  odoacer took service under orestes in the bodyguards became a great warrior and popular watched his time and when orestes refused the mercenaries herules rugians scyrings turklings and alansall the weak or halfcaste frontier tribes who had as yet little or no share in the spoils of italytheir demand of the third of the lands of italy he betrayed his benefactor promised the mercenaries to do for them what orestes would not and raises his famous band of confederates  at last he called himself king of nations burnt pavia and murdered orestes as a due reward for his benefits  stript of his purple the last emperor of rome knelt crying at the feet of the german giant and begged not to be murdered like his father  and the great wild beasts hard heart smote him and he sent the poor little lad away to live in wealth and peace in lucullus villa at misenum with plenty of money and women and gewgaws to dream away his foolish life looking out over the fair bay of naplesthe last emperor of rome  then odoacer set to work and not altogether ill  he gave his confederates the third of italy in fief under himself as king and for fourteen years not without the help of a few more murders he kept some sort of rude order and justice in the wretched land  remember him for bad man as he is he does represent a principle  he initiated by that gift of the lands to his soldiers the feudal system in italy  i do not mean that he invented it  it seems rather to be a primaeval german form as old as the days of tacitus who describes if you will recollect the german warkings as parting the conquered lands among their comites thanes or companions in arms  so we leave odoacer king of italy for fourteen years little dreaming perhaps of the day when as he had done unto others so should it be done to him  but for that tale of just and terrible retribution you must wait till the next lecture  and now to refresh us with a gleam of wholesome humanity after all these horrors let us turn to our worthy west goth cousins for a while  they have stopt cutting each others throats settled themselves in north spain and south france and good bishop sidonius gets to like them  they are just and honest men on the whole kindly and respectable in morals living according to their strange old gothic law  but above all sidonius likes their kingtheodoric is his name  a man of blood he has been in his youth but he has settled down like his people and here is a picture of him  a real photograph of a live old goth nearly 1400 years ago  gibbon gives a good translation of it  i will give you one but sidonius is prolix and florid and i have had to condense  a middlesized stout man of great breadth of chest and thickness of limb a large hand and a small foot curly haired bushy eyebrowed with remarkably large eyes and eyelids hooknosed thinlipped brilliant cheerful impassioned full of health and strength in mind and body  he goes to chapel before daylight sits till eight doing justice while the crowd let into a latticed enclosure is admitted one by one behind a curtain into the presence  at eight he leaves the throne and goes either to count his money or look at his horses  if he hunts he thinks it undignified to carry his bow and womanish to keep it strung a boy carries it behind him and when game gets up he asks you or the bishop who seems to have gone hunting with him what you would wish him to aim at strings his bow and then says sidonius never misses his shot  he dines at noon quietly in general magnificently on saturdays drinks very little and instead of sleeping after dinner plays at tables and dice  he is passionately fond of his game but never loses his temper joking and talking to the dice and to every one round him throwing aside royal severity and bidding all be merry says the bishop for to speak my mind what he is afraid of is that people should be afraid of him  if he wins he is in immense good humour then is the time to ask favours of him and says the crafty bishop many a time have i lost the game and won my cause thereby  at three begins again the toil of state  the knockers return and those who shove them away return too everywhere the litigious crowd murmurs round and follows him at evening when he goes to supper or gets its matters settled by the officers of the court who have to stay there till bed time  at supper though there are but rarely mimici sales which i cannot translatesome sort of jesting but biting and cruel insults common at the feasts of the roman emperors are never allowed  his taste in music is severe  no waterorgans fluteplayer lyrist cymbal or harpplaying woman is allowed  all he delights in is the old teutonic music whose virtue says the bishop soothes the soul no less than does its sound the ear  when he rises from table the guards for the night are set and armed men stand at all the doors to watch him through the first hours of sleep     lecture ivthe gothic civilizer   let us follow the fortunes of italy and of rome  they are not only a type of the fortunes of the whole western world but the fortunes of that world as you will see depend on rome  you must recollect meanwhile that by the middle of the fifth century the western empire had ceased to exist  the angles and saxons were fighting their way into britain  the franks were settled in north france and the lower rhineland  south of them the centre of gaul still remained roman governed by counts of cities who were all but independent sovereigns while they confessed a nominal allegiance to the emperor of constantinople  their power was destined soon to be annihilated by the conquests of clovis and his franksas false and cruel ruffians as their sainted king the firstborn son of the church  the history of gaul for some centuries becomes henceforth a tissue of internecine horrors which you must read for yourselves in the pages of m sismondi or of gregory of tours  the allemanni whose name has become among the franks the general name for germans held the lands from the maine to the rhaetian alps  the burgunds the lands to the south west of them comprising the greater part of southeast gaul  the west goths held the southwest of gaul and the greater part of spain having thrust the sueves and with them some alans into gallicia asturias and portugal and thrust also the vandals across the straits of gibraltar to found a prosperous kingdom along the northern shore of africa  the east goths meanwhile after various wanderings to the north of the alps lay in the present austria and in the danube lands resting after their great struggle with the huns and their crowning victory of netad  to follow the fortunes of italy we must follow those of these east goths and especially of one man among them theodoric known in german song as dietrich of bern or verona  interesting exceedingly to us should this great hero be  no mans history better shows the strange relations between the teutons and the dying empire but more his life is the first instance of a teuton attempting to found a civilized and ordered state upon experience drawn from roman sources of the young world trying to build itself up some sort of dwelling out of the ruins of the old  dietrich failed it is true  but if the thing had been then possible he seems to have been the man to have done it  he lived and laboured like what he wasa royal amal a true son of woden  unable to write he founded a great kingdom by native virtue and common sense  called a barbarian he restored prosperity to ruined italy and gave to it and with it to the greater part of the western world peace for three and thirty years  brought up among hostile sects he laid down that golden law of religious liberty which the nineteenth century has not yet courage and humanity enough to accept  but if his life was heroic his death was tragic  he failed after all in his vast endeavours from causes hidden from him but visible and most instructive to us and after having toiled impartially for the good of conquerors and of conquered alike he died sadly leaving behind him a people who most of them believed gladly the news that a holy hermit had seen his soul hurled down the crater of stromboli as a just punishment for the inexpiable crime of being wiser than his generation  some have complained of gibbons heroworship of dietrichi do not the honest and accurate cynic so very seldom worshipped a hero or believed in the existence of any that we may take his good opinion as almost final and without appeal  one author for whose opinion i have already exprest a very high respect says that he was but a wild man of the woods to the last polished over skindeep with roman civilization scratch him and you found the barbarian underneath 101  it may be true  if it be true it is a very high compliment  it was not from his roman civilization but from his barbarian mother and father that he drew the vive intelligence des choses morales et ces inspirations elevees et heroiques which m thierry truly attributes to him  if there was as m thierry truly says another nature struggling within himis there not such in every man  and are not the struggles the more painful the temptations more dangerous the inconsistencies too often the more shameful the capacities for evil as well as for good more huge just in proportion to the native force and massiveness of the soul the doctrine may seem dangerous  it is dangerous like many truths and woe to those who being unlearned and unstable wrest it to their own destruction and presume upon it to indulge their own passions under byronic excuses of genius or muscular christianity  but it is true nevertheless so at least the bible tells us in its wonderful delineations of david the man after gods own heart and of st peter the chief of the apostles  and there are points of likeness between the character of dietrich and that of david which will surely suggest themselves to any acute student of human nature  m thierry attributes to him as his worse self les instincts les plus violents la cruaute lastuce legoisme impitoyable  the two first counts are undeniableat least during his youth they were the common vices of the age  the two latter i must hold as not proven by facts but were they proven they would still be excusable on the simple ground of his greek education cunning and pitiless egotism were the only moral qualities which dietrich is likely to have seen exercised at the court of constantinople and what wonder if he was somewhat demoralized by the abominable atmosphere which he breathed from childhood  dietrich is an illustration of the saga with which these lectures began  he is the very type of the forest child bewitched by the fine things of the wicked troll garden the key to the mans character indeed the very glory of it is the long struggle within him between the teutonic and the greek elements  dazzled and debauched at times by the sinful glories of the bosphorus its palaces its gold and its women he will break the spell desperately  he will become a wild goth and an honest man once more he will revenge his own degradation on that court and empire which he knows well enough to despise distrust and hate  again and again the spell comes over him his vanity and his passions make him once more a courtier among the greeks but the blood of odin is strong within him still again and again he rises with a noble shame to virtue and patriotism trampling under foot selfish luxury and glory till the victory is complete and he turns away in the very moment of the greatest temptation from the bewitching city to wander fight starve and at last conquer a new land for himself and for his nation and shew by thirty years of justice and wisdom what that true dietrich was which had been so long overlaid by the false dietrich of his sinful youth  look at the facts of his history as they stand and see whether they do not bear out this and no other theory of his character  the year was 455 two years after attilas death  near vienna a boy was born of theodemir one of the gothic kings and his favourite erleva  he was sent when eight years old to constantinople as a hostage  the emperor leo had agreed to pay the goths 300 pounds of gold every year if they would but leave him in peace and young dietrich was the pledge of the compact  there he grew up amid all the wisdom of the romans watching it all and yet never even learning to write  it seems to some that the german did not care to learn it seems to me rather that they did not care to teach  he came back to his people at eighteen delighted them by his strength and stature and became to all appearance a goth of the goths going adventures with six thousand volunteers against the sarmatae who had just defeated the greeks and taken a citywhich he retook but instead of restoring it to the emperor kept himself  food becoming scarce in austria the ostrogoths moved some into italy some down on illyria and thessaly and the emperor gracefully presented them with the country of which they had already taken possession  in every case you see this method went on  the failing emperors bought off the teutons where they could submitted to them where they could not and readily enough turned on them when they had a chance  the relations between the two parties can be hardly better explained than by comparing them to those between the english adventurers in hindostan and the falling rajahs and sultans of the last century  after a while theodoric or dietrich found himself at his fathers death sole king of the ostrogoths  this period of his life is very obscure but one hint at least we have which may explain his whole future career  side by side with him and with his father before him there was another dietrichdietrich the oneeyed son of triar a low born adventurer who had got together the remnants of some lowcaste tribes who were called the goths of thrace and was swaggering about the court of constantinople as when the east goths first met him what we call warden of the marches with some annual pay for his goths  he was insolent to theodemir and his family and they retaliated by bitter hatred  it was intolerable for them amals sons of odin to be insulted by this upstart  so they went on for years till the miserable religious squabble fell outyou may read it in gibbonwhich ended in the emperor zeno a lowborn and cunning man suspected of the murder of his own son by the princess ariadne being driven out of constantinople by basiliscus  we need not enter into such matters except as far as they bear on the history of dietrich the amal  dietrich the oneeyed helped basiliscusand then zeno seems to have sent for dietrich the amal to help him  he came but too late  basiliscus party had already broken up basiliscus and his family had taken refuge in a church from whence zeno enticed him on the promise of shedding no blood which he did not but instead put him his wife and children in a dry cistern walled it up and left them  dietrich the amal rose into power and great glory and became sonin arms to the emperor  but the young amal longed for adventures  he offered to take his ostrogoths into italy drive out odoacer and seat on the throne of the west nepos one of the many puppets who had been hurled off it a few years before  zeno had need of the young hero nearer home and persuaded him to stay in constantinople eat drink and be merry  whereon odoacer made romulus agustulus and the roman senate write to zeno that they wanted no emperor save him at constantinople that they were very happy under the excellent odoacer and that they therefore sent to zeno as the rightful owner all the imperial insignia and ornaments things which may have been worn some of them by augustus himself  and so ended even in name the empire of rome  all which the amal saw and as will appear did not forget  zeno gave the amal all that the oneeyed had had before him and paid the ostrogoths yearly as he had paid the oneeyes men  the oneeyed was banished to his cantonments and of course revolted  zeno wanted to buy him off but the amal would not hear of it he would not help the romans against his rival unless they swore perpetual enmity against him  they did so and he marched to the assistance of the wretched empire  he was to be met by roman reinforcements at the haemus  they never came and the amal disgusted and disheartened found himself entangled in the defiles of the haemus starving and worn out with the oneeyed entrenched on an inaccessible rock where he dared not attack him  then followed an extraordinary scene  the oneeyed came down again and again from his rock and rode round the amals camp shouting to him words so true that one must believe them to have been really spoken  perjured boy madman betrayer of your racedo you not see that the roman plan is as always to destroy goths by goths  whichever of us falls they not we will be the stronger  they never met you as they promised at the cities nor here  they have sent you out here to perish in the desert  then the east goths raised a cry  the oneeyed is right  the amal cares not that these men are goths like ourselves  then the oneeyed appeals to the goths themselves as he curses the amal  why are you killing your kinsmen  why have you made so many widows where is all their wealth gone they who set out to fight for you  each of them had two or three horses but now they are walking on foot behind you like slavesfreemen as wellborn as yourselfand you promised to measure them out gold by the bushel  was it not true  if young dietrich had in him and he shewed that he had in after years a teutons heart may not that strange interview have opened his eyes to his own folly and taught him that the teuton must be his own master and not the mercenary of the romans  the men cried out that it was true  he must make peace with the oneeyed or they would do it themselves and peace was made  they both sent ambassadors to zeno the amal complaining of treachery the oneeyed demanding indemnity for all his losses  the emperor was furious  he tried to buy off the amal by marrying him to a princess of the blood royal and making him a caesar  dietrich would not consent he felt that it was a snare  zeno proclaimed the oneeyed an enemy to the empire and ended by reinstating him in his old honours and taking them from the amal  the amal became furious burnt villages slaughtered the peasants even the greeks say cut off the hands of his captives  he had broken with the romans at last  the roman was astride of him and of all teutons like sindbads old man of the sea  the only question as with sindbad was whether he should get drunk and give them a chance of throwing the perfidious tyrant  and now the time was come  he was compelled to ask himself notwhat shall i be in relation to myself but what shall i be in relation to the kaiser of the romansa mercenary a slave or a conquerorfor one of the three i must be  so it went on year after yearsometimes with terrible reverses for dietrich till the year 480  then the old oneeyed died in a strange way  mounting a wild horse at the tentdoor the beast reared before he could get his seat afraid of pulling it over by the curb he let it go a lance in gothic fashion was hanging at the tentdoor and the horse plunged the oneeyed against it  the point went deep into his side and the old fighting man was at rest for ever  and then came a strange peripeteia for the amal  zeno we know not why sent instantly for him  he had been ravaging pursuing defeating roman troops or being defeated by them  now he must come to rome  his goths should have the lower danube  he should have glory and honour to spare he came  his ideal at this time seems actually to have been to live like a roman citizen in constantinople and help to govern the empire recollect he was still little more than five and twenty years old  so he went to constantinople and i suppose with him the faithful mother and faithful sister who had been with him in all his wanderings  he had a triumph decreed him at the emperors expense was made consul ordinarius which saith jornandes is accounted the highest good and chief glory in the world and mastergeneral and lodged in the palace  what did it all mean  dietrich was dazzled by it at least for a while what it meant he found out too soon  he was to fight the emperors battles against all rebels and he fought them to return irritated complaining justly or unjustly of plots against his life to be pacified like a child with the honour of an equestrian statue then to sink down into byzantine luxury for seven inglorious years with only one flashing out of the ancient spirit when he demanded to go alone against the bulgars and killed their king with his own hand  what woke him from his dream  the cry of his starving people  the goths settled on the lower danube had been living as wild men and mercenaries live recklessly from hand to mouth drinking and gambling till their families were in want  they send to the amal  while thou art revelling at roman banquets we are starvingcome back ere we are ruined  they were jealous too of the success of odoacer and his mercenaries  he was growing now to be a great power styling himself king of nations 109 giving away to the visigoths the narbonnaise the last remnant of the western empire collecting round him learned romans like symmachus boethius and cassiodorus respecting the catholic clergy and seemingly doing his best to govern well  his mercenaries however would not be governed  under their violence and oppression agriculture and population were both failing till pope gelasius speaks of aemilia tuscia ceteraeque provinciae in quibus nullus prope hominum existit  meanwhile there seems to have been a deep hatred on the part of the goths to odoacer and his mercenaries  dr sheppard thinks that they despised him himself as a man of low birth  but his father aedecon had been chief of the turklings and was most probably of royal blood  it is very unlikely indeed that so large a number of teutons would have followed any man who had not odins blood in his veins  was there a stain on odoacer from his early connexion with attila  or was the hatred against his men more than himself contempt especially of the lowcaste herulesa question of race springing out of those miserable tribefeuds which kept the teutons always divided and weak  be that as it may odoacer had done a deed which raised this hatred to open fury  he had gone over the alps into rugiland then noricum and the neighbourhood of vienna and utterly destroyed those of the rugier who had not gone into italy under his banner  they had plundered it is said the cell of his old friend st severinus as soon as the saint died of the garments laid up for the poor and a silver cup and the sacred vessels of the mass  be that as it may odoacer utterly exterminated them and carried their king feletheus or fava back to italy with gisa his noxious wife and with them many roman christians and seemingly the body of st severinus himself  but this had been a small thing if he had not advised himself to have a regular roman triumph with fava the captive king walking beside his chariot and afterwards in the approved fashion of the ancient romans on such occasions to put fava to death in cold blood  the records of this feat are to be found as far as i know them in one short chapter i xix of paulus diaconus and in muratoris notes thereto but however small the records the deed decided the fate of italy  frederic son of fava took refuge with the ostrogoths and demanded revenge in the name of his royal race and it is easy to conceive that the sympathies of the goths would be with him  an attack seemingly unprovoked on an ancient teutonic nation by a mere band of adventurers wasor could easily be madea grievous wrong and clear casus belli over and above the innate teutonic lust for fighting and adventures simply for the sake of the sport  dietrich went back and from that day the dream of eastern luxury was broken and young dietrich was a goth again for good and for evil  he assembled the goths and marched straight on constantinople burning and pillaging as he went  so say at least the greek historians of whom all through this strange story no one need believe more than he likes  had the goths had the writing of the life of dietrich we should have heard another tale  as it is we have as it were a life of lord clive composed by the court scribes of delhi  to no roman would he tell what was in his mind  five leagues from constantinople he paused  some say that he had compassion on the city where he had been brought up  who can tell  he demanded to speak to zeno alone and the father in arms and his wild son met once more  there was still strong in him the old teutonic feudal instinct  he was zenos man in spite of all  he asked says jornandes zenos leave to march against odoacer and conquer italy  procopius and the valesian fragment say that zeno sent him and that in case of success he was to reign there till zeno came  zeno was no doubt glad to get rid of him at any price  as ennodius well says anothers honour made him remember his own origin and fear the very legions which obeyed himfor that obedience is suspected which serves the unworthy  rome was only nominally under zenos dominion and it mattered little to him whether herule or gothic adventurer called himself his representative  then was held a grand function  dietrich solemnly appointed patrician had italy ceded to him by a pragmatic sanction and zeno placed on his head the sacrum velamen a square of purple signifying in constantinople things wonderful august imperialif they could only be made to come to pass  and he made them come to pass  he gathered all teutonic heroes of every tribe as well as his own and through roumelia and through the alps a long and dangerous journey went dietrich and his goths with their wives and children and all they had packed on waggons living on their flocks and herds grinding their corn in hand mills and hunting as they went for seven hundred miles of march fighting as they went with bulgars and sarmatians who had swarmed into the waste marches of hungary and carniola once populous cultivated and full of noble cities fighting a desperate battle with the gepidae up to their knees in a morass till over the passes of the julian alps where icicles hung upon their beards and their clothes cracked with frost they poured into the venetian plains  it was a daring deed and needed a spirit like dietrichs to carry it through  odoacer awaited him near the ruins of aquileia  on the morning of the fight as he was arming dietrich asked his noble mother to bring him some specially fine mantle which she had embroidered for him and put it over his armour that all men may see how he goes gayer into the fight than ever he did into feast  for this day she shall see whether she have brought a manchild into the world or no  and in front of verona where the plain was long white with human bones he beat odoacer and after a short and sharp campaign drove him to ravenna  but there roman fortifications and roman artillery stopped as usual the goth and odoacer fulfilled his name so well and stood so stout that he could only be reduced by famine and at last surrendered on terms difficult now to discover  gibbon says that there was a regular compact that they should enjoy equal authority and refers to procopius but procopius only says that they should live together peaceably in that city  be that as it may odoacer and his party were detected after awhile conspiring against dietrich and put to death in some dark fashion  gibbon as advocatus diaboli of course gives the doubt against dietrich by his usual enthymemeall men are likely to be rogues ergo dietrich was one rather hard measure when one remembers that the very men who tell the story are dietrichs own enemies  by far the most important of them the author of the valesian fragment who considers dietrich damned as an arian and the murderer of boethius and symmachus says plainly that odoacer plotted against his life  but it was a dark business at best  be that as it may dietrich the amal found himself in one day king of all italy without a peer  and now followed a three and thirty years reign of wisdom justice and prosperity unexampled in the history of those centuries  between the days of the antonines and those of charlemagne i know no such bright spot in the dark history of europe  as for his transferring the third of the lands of italy which had been held by odoacers men to his own gothsthat was just or unjust even putting out of the question the rights of conquest according to what manner of men odoacers mercenaries were and what right they had to the lands  at least it was done so says cassiodorus that it notoriously gave satisfaction to the romans themselves  one can well conceive it odoacers men had been lawless adventurers and now law was installed as supreme  dietrich in his long sojourn at the emperors court had discovered the true secret of roman power which made the empire terrible even in her fallen fortunes and that was law  law which tells every man what to expect and what is expected of him and so gives if not content still confidence energy industry  the goths were to live by the gothic law the romans by the roman  to amalgamate the two races would have been as impossible as to amalgamate english and hindoos  the parallel is really tolerably exact  the goth was very english and the overcivilized learned false profligate roman was the very counterpart of the modern brahmin  but there was to be equal justice between man and man  if the goths were the masters of much of the roman soil still spoliation and oppression were forbidden and the remarkable edict or code of theodoric shews how deeply into his great mind had sunk the idea of the divineness of law  it is short and of draconic severity especially against spoliation cheating false informers abuse by the clergy of the rights of sanctuary and all offences against the honour of women  i advise you all to study it as an example of what an early teutonic king thought men ought to do and could be made to do  the romans were left to their luxury and laziness and their country villas long deserted were filled again by the owners  the goths were expected to perform military service and were drilled from their youth in those military evolutions which had so often given the disciplined roman the victory over the undisciplined goth till every pomoerium boulevard says ennodius might be seen full of boys and lads learning to be soldiers  everything meanwhile was done to soothe the wounded pride of the conquered  the senate of rome was still kept up in name as by odoacer her nobles flattered by sonorous titles and the officers of the kingdom and the palace bore the same names as they would have done under roman emperors  the whole was an attempt to develop dietrichs own goths by the only civilization which he knew that of constantinople but to engraft on it an order a justice a freedom a morality which was the barbarian element  the treasures of roman art were placed under the care of government officers baths palaces churches aqueducts were repaired or founded to build seems to have been dietrichs great delight and we have left us on a coin some image of his own palace at verona a strange building with domes and minarets something like a turkish mosque standing seemingly on the arcades of some older roman building  dietrich the goth may indeed be called the founder of byzantine architecture throughout the western world  meanwhile agriculture prospered once more the pontine marshes were drained the imperial ports restored and new cities sprang up  the new ones says machiavelli were venice siena ferrara aquileia and those which became extended were florence genoa pisa milan naples and bologna  of these the great seaports especially venice were founded not by goths but by roman and greek fugitives but it was the security and liberality of dietrichs reign which made their existence possible and venice really owes far more to the barbarian hero than to the fabled patronage of st mark  from this devastation and new population continues machiavelli arose new languages which partaking of the native idiom of the new people and of the old roman formed a new manner of discourse  besides not only were the names of provinces changed but also of lakes rivers seas and men for france spain and italy are full of fresh names wholly different from the ancient  this reign of dietrich was in fact the birthhour of modern italy and as machiavelli says brought the country to such a state of greatness that her previous sufferings were unrecognizable  we shall see hereafter how the great goths work was all undone and to their everlasting shame by whom it was undone  the most interesting records of the time are without doubt the letters of cassiodorus the kings secretary and chancellor which have come down to us in great numbers  there are letters among them on all questions of domestic and foreign policy to the kings of the varni kings of the herules kings of the thuringer who were still heathens beyond the black forest calling on them all to join him and the burgundians and defend his soninlaw alaric ii king of the visigoths against clovis and his franks  there are letters too bearing on the religious feuds of the roman population and on the morals and social state of rome itself of which i shall say nothing in this lecture having cause to refer to them hereafter  but if you wish to know the times you must read cassiodorus thoroughly  in his letters you will remark how most of the socalled roman names are greek  you will remark too as a sign of the decadence of taste and art that though full of wisdom and practical morality the letters are couched in the most wonderful bombast to be met with even in that age of infimae latinitatis  one can only explain their style by supposing that king dietrich having supplied the sense left it for cassiodorus to shape it as he thought best and when the letter was read over to him took for granted being no scholar that that was the way in which roman caesars and other cultivated personages ought to talk admired his secretarys learning and probably laughed in his sleeve at the whole thing thinking that ten words of honest german would have said all that he meant  as for understanding these flights of rhetoric it is impossible that dietrich could have done so perhaps not even cassiodorus himself  take as one example such a letter as thisafter a lofty moral maxim which i leave for you to construein partem pietatis recidit mitigata districtio et sub beneficio praestat qui poenam debitam moderatione considerata palpaveritjovinus the curial is informed after the most complex method that having first quarrelled with a fellowcurial and then proceeded to kill him he is banished for life to the isle of volcano among the liparis  as a curial is a gentleman and a government magistrate the punishment is just enough but why should cassiodorus certainly not king dietrich finish a short letter by a long dissertation on volcanoes in general and stromboli in particular insisting on the wonder that the rocks though continually burnt are continually renewed by the inextricable potency of nature and only returning to jovinus to inform him that he will henceforth follow the example of a salamander which always lives in fire being so contracted by natural cold that it is tempered by burning flame  it is a thin and small animal connected with worms and clothed with a yellow colour    cassiodorus then returns to the main subject of volcanoes and ends with a story of stromboli having broken out just as hannibal poisoned himself at the court of prusiasinformation which may have been interesting though not consoling to poor jovinus in the prospect of living there but of which one would like to have had king dietrichs opinion  did he felicitate himself like a simple teuton on the wonderful learning and eloquence of his greekroman secretary  or did he laugh a royal laugh at the whole letter and crack a royal joke at cassiodorus and all quilldriving schoolmasters and lawyersthe two classes of men whom the goths hated especially and at the end to which they by their pedantries had brought imperial rome  one would like to know  for not only was dietrich no scholar himself but he had a contempt for the very scholarship which he employed and forbade the goths to learn itas the event proved a foolish and fatal prejudice but it was connected in his mind with chicanery effeminacy and with the cruel and degrading punishments of children  perhaps the ferula had been applied to him at constantinople in old days  if so no wonder that he never learnt to write  the boy who trembles at a cane he used to say will never face a lance  his mother wit meanwhile was so shrewd that many of his sayings says the unknown author of the invaluable valesian fragment remain among us to this day  two only as far as i know have been preserved quaint enough     he that hath gold or a devil cannot hide it  and     the roman when poor apes the goth the goth    when rich apes the roman  there is a sort of solomons judgment too told of him in the case of a woman who refused to acknowledge her own son which was effectual enough but somewhat too homely to repeat  as for his personal appearance it was given in a saga but i have not consulted it myself and am no judge of its authenticity  the traditional description of him is that of a man almost beardlessa rare case among the gothswith masses of golden ringlets and black eyebrows over oculos caesios the blue grey eyes common to so many conquerors  a complexion so peculiar that one must believe it to be truly reported  his tragic death and the yet more tragic consequences thereof will be detailed in the next lecture     lecture vdietrichs end   i have now to speak to you on the latter end of dietrichs reignmade so sadly famous by the death of boethiusthe last roman philosopher as he has been called for centuries and not unjustly  his de consolatione philosophiae is a book good for any man full of wholesome and godly doctrine  for centuries it ranked as high as the highest classics higher perhaps at times than any book save the bible among not merely scholars but statesmen  it is the last legacy of the dying old world to the young world which was trampling it out of life and therefore it is full of sadness  but beneath the sadness there is faith and hope for god is just and virtue must be triumphant and immortal and the absolute and only good for man  the whole story is very sad  dietrich was one of those great men who like henry viii elizabeth napoleon or the late czar nicholas have lived too long for their own honour  the old heathen would have attributed his misadventures to a greek text an envy of the gods who will not abide to see men as prosperous as they themselves are we may attribute it more simply and more piously to the wear and tear of frail humanity  for it may be that very few human souls can stand for many years the strain of a great rule  i do not mean that they break down from overwork but that they are pulled out of shape by it and that especially the will becomes enormously developed at the expense of the other powers of the soul till the man becomes as he grows older imperious careless of or irritated by counsel determined to have his own way because it is his own way  we see the same tendency in all accustomed for a long while to absolute rule even in petty mattersin the old ships captain the old head of a factory the old master of hounds and we do not blame them for it  it is a disease incident to their calling as pedantry is to that of a scholar or astuteness to that of an attorney  but it is most dangerous in the greatest minds and in the highest places and only to be kept off by them as by us each in our place by honest selfexamination diligent prayer and the grace of god which comes thereby  once or twice in the worlds history a great ruler like charles the fifth cuts the gordian knot and escapes into a convent but how few can or ought to do that  there are those who must go on ruling or see their country ruined for all depends on them  so had queen elizabeth to do so had dietrich of bern likewise  after them would come the deluge and did come and they must endure to the last whatever it may cost to their own health of character or peace of mind  but most painful and most dangerous to the veteran sovereign is it to have learnt to suspect perhaps to despise those whom he rules to have thrown away all his labour upon knaves and fools to have cast his pearls before swine and find them turning again and rending him  that feeling forced from queen elizabeth in her old age that tragic cry i am a miserable forlorn woman  there is none about me whom i can trust  she was a woman always longing for some one to love and her heart broke under it all  but do you not see that where the ruler is not an affectionate woman but a strong proud man the effect may be very different and very terriblehow roused to indignation scorn suspicion rage he may turn to bay against his own subjects with scoundrels you have seen the fair side of my character and in vain now you shall see the foul and beware for yourselves  even so i fancy did old dietrich turn to bay and did deeds which have blackened his name for ever  heaven forgive him for surely he had provocation enough and to spare  i have told you of the simple halfsuperstitious respect which the teuton had for the prestige of rome  dietrich seems to have partaken of it like the rest  else why did he not set himself up as caesar of rome why did he always consider himself as soninarms and quasivassal of the caesar of constantinople  he had been in youth overawed by the cunning civilization which he had seen in the great city  he felt with a noble modesty that he could not emulate it  he must copy it afar off he must take to his counsels men like cassiodorus symmachus boethius born and bred in it trained from childhood in the craft by which as a patent fact the kaisers of rome had been for centuries even in their decay and degradation the rulers of the nations  yet beneath that there must have been a perpetual undercurrent of contempt for it and for romethe colluvies gentiumthe sink of the nations with its conceit its pomposity its beggary its profligacy its superstition its pretence of preserving the roman law and rights while practically it cared for no law nor right at all  dietrich had had to write letter upon letter to prevent the green and blue factions cutting each others throats at the public spectacles letters to the tribunus voluptatum who had to look after the pantomimes and loose women telling him to keep the poor wretches in some decent order and to set them and the city an example of a better life by being a chaste and respectable man himself letter upon letter of cassiodorus written in dietrichs name disclose a state of things in rome on which a goth could look only with disgust and contempt  and what if he discovered or thought that he discovered that these prating coxcombswho were actually living on government bounty and had their daily bread daily bath daily oil daily pork daily wine found for them at government expense while they lounged from the theatre to the church and the church to the theatrewere plotting with justin the scoundrel and upstart emperor at constantinople to restore forsooth the liberties of rome  and that that was their answer to his three and thirty years of good government respect indulgence which had raised them up again out of all the miseries of domestic anarchy and foreign invasion  and what if he discovered or thought that he discovered that the catholic clergy with pope john at their head were in the very same plot for bringing in the emperor of constantinople on the grounds of religion because he was persecuting the arian goths at constantinople and therefore would help them to persecute them in italy  and that that was their answer to his three and thirty years of unexampled religious liberty  would not those two facts even the belief that they were facts have been enough to drive many a wise man mad  how far they were facts we never shall exactly know  almost all our information comes from catholic historiansand he would be a rash man who would pin his faith on any statement of theirs concerning the actions of a heretic  but i think even with no other help than theirs we may see why dietrich would have looked with horror on any intimacy between the church of rome and the court of constantinople  we must remember first what the greek empire was then and who was the new emperor  anastasius the poor old emperor dying at eighty with his heart broken by monks and priests had an ugly dream and told it to amantius the eunuch and lord chamberlain  whereon amantius said he had had a dream toohow a great hog flew at him as he was in waiting in the very presence and threw him down and eat him fairly up  which came truethough not in the way amantius expected  on the death of anastasius he determined to set up as emperor a creature of his own  for this purpose he must buy the guards to which noble end he put a large sum of treasure into the hands of justin senator and commanderinchief of the said guards who takes the money and spends it on his own account so that the miserable eunuch finds not his man but justin himself emperor and his hardearned money spent against him  the mere rise of this unscrupulous swindler and his still more unscrupulous nephew justinian would have been enough to rouse dietrichs suspicion if not fear  deep and unspeakable must have been the royal amals contempt for the man  for he must have known him well at constantinople in his youth known how he was a goth or other teuton after all though he was called a dardanian how his real name was uprauda upright the son of stockwhich uprauda he had latinized into justinus  the amal knew well how he had entered the emperors guard how he had intrigued and fought his way up for the man did not lack courage and conduct to his generals commission and now by a crowning act of roguery to the empire  he had known too most probably the mans vulgar peasant wife who in her efforts to ape royalty was making herself the laughingstock of the people and who was urging on her already willing husband to persecute  and this man he saw ready to convulse his own empire by beginning a violent persecution against the arians  he was dangerous enough as a villain doubly dangerous as a bigot also  we must remember next what the greek church was then a chaos of intrigue villainy slander and wild fury tearing to pieces itself and the whole empire by religious feuds in which the doctrine in question becomes invisible amid the passions and crimes of the disputants while the lords of the church were hordes of wild monks who swarm out of their dens to head the lowest mobs or fight pitched battles with each other the ecclesiastical history of the fifth century in the eastern empire is one which not even the genius of a gibbon or a milman can make interesting or even intelligible  recollect that dietrich had seen much of this with his own eyes had seen actually as i told you the rebellion of basiliscus and the eutychian bishops headed by the mad daniel the stylite against his foster father the emperor zeno had seen that emperor as dean milman forcibly puts it flying before a naked hermit who had lost the use of his legs by standing sixteen years upon a column  recollect that dietrich and his goths had helped to restore that emperor to his throne and then understand in what a school he had learnt his great ideas of religious toleration how deep must have been the determination to have no such doings in his kingdom how deep too the dread of any similar outbreak at rome  recollect also that now in his old age he had just witnessed the same iniquities again rending the eastern empire the old emperor anastasius hunted to death by armies of mad monks about the monophysite heresy the cities even the holiest places of the east stained with christian blood everywhere moblaw murder treachery assassination even in the house of god and now the new emperor justin was throwing himself into the party of the orthodox with all the blind rage of an ignorant peasant persecuting expelling shutting up the arian churches of the goths refusing to hear dietrichs noble appeals and evidently organizing a great movement against those peaceable arians against whom during the lifetime of dietrich their bitterest enemies do not allege a single case of persecution  remember too that dietrich had had experience of similar outbreaks of fanaticism at rome that the ordination of two rival popes had once made the streets run with blood that he had seen priests murdered monasteries fired nuns insulted and had had to interfere with the strong arm of the law and himself decide in favour of the pope who had the most votes and was first chosen and that in the quarrels intrigues and slanders which followed that election he had had too good proof that the ecclesiastics and the mob of rome if he but let them could behave as ill as that of constantinople and moreover that this new pope john who seems to have been a hotheaded fanatic had begun his rule by whipping and banishing manicheesby whose permission does not appear  recollect too that for some reason or other dietrich when he had interfered in eastern matters had been always on the side of the orthodox and the council of chalcedon  he had fought for the orthodox against basiliscus  he had backed the orthodox and vitalianus their champion against the late emperor anastasius and now as soon as the orthodox got into power under justin this was the reward of his impartiality  if he did not distrust and despise the church and emperor of the east he must have been not a hero but a saint  recollect too that in those very days catholic bigotry had broken out in a general plunder of the jews  at rome at milan and genoa their houses had been sacked and their synagogues burnt and dietrich having compelled the catholics to rebuild them at their own expense had earned the hatred of a large portion of his subjects  and now pope john was doing all he could to thwart him  dietrich bade him go to constantinople and plead with justin for the persecuted arians  he refused  dietrich shipt him off nolentem volentem  but when he got to constantinople he threw his whole weight into the emperors scale  he was received by justin as if he was st peter himself the emperor coming out to meet him with processions and waxlights imploring his blessing he did exactly the opposite to what dietrich bade him do and published on his return a furious epistle to the bishops of italy calling upon them to oppress and extirpate the arian perfidy so that no root of it is left to consecrate the arian churches wheresoever he found them pleading the advice of the most pious and christian emperor justin talking of dietrich as tainted inwardly and wrapt up outwardly with the pest of heresy  on which cochlaeus who religiously believes that dietrich was damned for his arianism and that all his virtues went for nothing because he had not charity which exists he says alone within the pale of the church cannot help the naive comment that if the pontiff did really write that letter he cannot wonder at dietrichs being a little angry  kings now it is true can afford to smile at such outbursts they could not afford to do so in dietrichs days  such words meant murder pillage civil war dethronement general anarchy and so dietrich threw pope john into prison  he had been in bad health before he sailed to constantinople and in a few months he died and was worshipped as a saint  as for the political conspiracy we shall never know the truth of it  the anonymus valesii meanwhile says that when cyprian accused albinus boethius answered it is false but if albinus has done it so have i and the whole senate with one consent  it is false my lord king whatever such words may prove they prove at least this that boethius as he says himself was the victim of his own chivalry  to save albinus and the senate he thrust himself into the forefront of the battle and fell at least like a brave man  whether albinus boethius and symmachus did plot to bring in justin whether the senate did send a letter to him i cannot tell  boethius in his de consolatione denies it all and boethius was a good man  he says that the letters in which he hoped for the liberty of rome were forged how could he hope for the impossible but he adds would that any liberty could have been hoped for  i would have answered the king as cassius did when falsely accused of conspiring by caligula if i had known of it you should not  one knows not whether dietrich ever saw those words but they prove at least that all his confidence justice kindness to the patrician philosopher had not won him from the pardonable conceit about the romani nominis umbram  boethius story is most probably true  one cannot think that that man would die with a lie in his mouth  one cannot pass by as the utterances of a deliberate hypocrisy those touching appeals to his guiding mistress that heavenly wisdom who has led him so long upon the paths of truth and virtue and who seems to him in his miserable cell to have betrayed him in his hour of need  heaven forbid  better to believe that dietrich committed once in his life a fearful crime than that good boethius famous book is such another as the eikon basilike  boethius again says that the gothic courtiers hated him and suborned branded scoundrels to swear away his life and that of the senate because he had opposed the hounds of the palace amigast trigulla and other greedy barbarians  there was of course a gothic party and a roman party about the court and each hated the other bitterly  dietrich had favoured the romans  but the goths could not have seen such men as symmachus and boethius the confidants and counsellors of the amal without longing for their downfall and if as boethius and the catholic historians say the whole tragedy arose out of a gothic plot to destroy the roman party such things have happened but too often in the worlds history  the only facts which make against the story are that cyprianus the accuser was a roman and that cassiodorus who must have belonged to the roman party not only is never mentioned during the whole tragedy but was high in power under theodatus and athalaric afterwards  add to this that there were vague but widespread reports that the goths were in danger that dietrich at least could not be ignorant of the ambition and the talents of that terrible justinian justins nephew who was soon to alter for a generation the fortunes of the whole empire and to sweep the goths from italy that mens minds must have been perplexed with fear of change when they recollected that dietrich was seventy years old without a son to succeed him and that a woman and a child would soon rule that great people in a crisis which they could not but foresee  we know that the ruin came is it unreasonable to suppose that the goths foresaw it and made a desperate it may be a treacherous effort to crush once and for all the proud and not less treacherous senators of rome  so maddened with the fancied discovery that the man whom he had honoured trusted loved was conspiring against him dietrich sent boethius to prison  he seems however not to have been eager for his death for boethius remained there long enough to write his noble book  however whether fresh proofs of his supposed guilt were discovered or not the day came when he must die  a cord was twisted round his head probably to extort confession till his eyes burst from their sockets and then he was put out of his misery by a club and so ended the last roman philosopher  symmachus his fatherinlaw was beheaded and pope john as we have heard was thrown into prison on his return and died after a few months  these are the tragedies which have stained for ever the name of theodoric the great  pope john seems to have fairly earned his imprisonment  for the two others we can only i fear join in the sacred pity in which their memories have been embalmed to all succeeding generations  but we must recollect that after all we know but one side of the question  the romans could write the goths could not they may have been able to make out a fair case for themselves they may have believed truly in the guilt of boethius and if they did nothing less could have happened by such rules of public law and justice as were then in vogue than did happen  be that as it may the deed was done and the punishment if deserved came soon enough  sitting at dinner so the story runs the head of a fish took in dietrichs fancy the shape of symmachus head the upper teeth biting the lip the great eyes staring at him  he sprang up in horror took to his bed and there complaining of a mortal chill wrapping himself up in heaps of blankets and bewailing to his physician the death of his two victims he died sadly in a few days  and a certain holy hermit name not given nor date of the vision saw the ghosts of boethius and symmachus lead the amals soul up the cone of stromboli and hurl him in as the english sailors saw old boots the wapping usurer hurled into the same place for offences far more capable of proof  so runs the story of dietrichs death  it is perfectly natural and very likely true  his contemporaries who all believed it saw in it proof of his enormous guilt and the manifest judgment of god  we shall rather see in it a proof of the earnest childlike honest nature of the man startled into boundless horror and selfabasement by the sudden revelation of his crime  truly bad men die easier deaths than that and go down to the grave for the most part blind and selfcontented and as they think unpunished and perhaps forgiven  after dietrich came the deluge  the royal head was gone  the royal heart remained in amalasuentha the heavenly beauty a daughter worthy of her father  one of her first acts was to restore to the widows and children of the two victims the estates which dietrich had confiscated  that may or may not prove that she thought the men innocent  she may have only felt it royal not to visit the sins of the fathers on the children and those fathers too her own friends and preceptors  beautiful learned and wise she too was like her father before her age  she the pupil of boethius would needs bring up her son athalaric in roman learning and favour the romans in all ways never putting to death or even fining any of them and keeping down the rough goths who were ready enough now dietrichs hand was off them to illuse the conquered italians  the goths soon grew to dislike her and her roman tendencies her roman education of the lad  one day she boxed his ears for some fault  he ran crying out into the heldensaal and complained to the heroes  they sent a deputation to amalasuentha insolent enough  the boy should not be made a scholar of  she meant to kill the boy and marry again  had not old dietrich forbidden free goths to go to schoolmasters and said that the boy who was taught to tremble at a cane would never face a lance so they took the lad away from the women and made a ruffian of him  what with drink women idleness and the company of wild young fellows like himself he was early ruined body and soul  poor amalasuentha not knowing whither to turn took the desperate resolution of offering italy to the emperor justinian  she did not know that her cousin theodatus had been beforehand with hera bad old man greedy and unjust whose rapacity she had had to control again and again and who hated her in return  both send messages to justinian  the wily emperor gave no direct answer but sent his ambassador to watch the course of events  the young prince died of debauchery and the goths whispered that his mother had poisoned him  meanwhile theodatus went on from bad to worse accusations flowed in to amalasuentha of his lawless rapacity but he was too strong for her and she losing her head more and more made the desperate resolve of marrying him as the only way to keep him quiet  he was the last male heir of the royal amalungs  the marriage would set him right in the eyes of the goths while it would free her from the suspicion of having murdered her son in order to reign alone  theodatus meanwhile was to have the name of royalty but she was to keep the power and the moneya foolish confused plan which could have but one ending theodatus married her of course and then cast her into prison seized all her treasures and threw himself into the arms of that party among the goths who hated amalasuentha for having punished their oppressions the end was swift and sad  by the time that justinians ambassador landed amalasuentha was strangled in her bath and all that peter the ambassador had to do was to catch at the cause of quarrel and declare inexpiable war on the part of justinian as the avenger of the queen  and then began that dreadful east goth war which you may read for yourselves in the pages of an eyewitness procopiusa war which destroyed utterly the civilization of dietrichs long and prosperous reign left italy a desert and exterminated the roman people  that was the last woe but of it i must tell you in my next lecture     lecture vithe nemesis of the goths   of this truly dreadful gothic war i can give you but a hasty sketch of some of the most important figures in it not even a sketch  i cannot conceive to myself and therefore cannot draw for you the famous belisarius  was he really the strange compound of strength and weakness which procopius and after him gibbon represent hima caricature for good and evil of our own famous marlborough  you must read and judge for yourselves  i cannot at least as yet offer you any solution of the enigma  still less can i conceive to myself narses living till his grey hairs in the effeminate intrigues of the harem and then springing forth a general the warrior eunuch the misanthrope avenging his great wrong upon all mankind in bloody battlefields dark of counsel and terrible of execution him to whom in after years the empress sophia sent word that he was more fit to spin among maids than to command armies and he answered that he would spin her such a thread as she could not unravel and kept his word as legends say by inviting the lombards into italy  least of all can i sketch justinian the great the halfteuton peasant whom his uncle justin sent for out of the dardanian hills to make him a demigod upon earth  men whispered in after years that he was born of a demon a demon himself passing whole days without food wandering up and down his palace corridors all night resolving dark things and labouring all day with herculean force to carry them out  no wonder he was thought to be a demon wedded to a demonwife  the man is unfathomable inexplicablemarrying deliberately the wickedest of all women plainly not for mere beautys sake but possibly because he saw in her a congenial intellectfaithful and loving to her and she to him amid all the crimes of their following yearspious with exceeding devotion and orthodoxy and yet with a piety utterly divorced from unconscious of the commonest moralitydiscerning and using the greatest men belisarius and narses for example and throwing them away again surely not in weak caprice whenever they served him too wellconquering persians vandals goths all but reconquering in fact the carcase roman empireand then trying with a deep discernment of the value of roman law to put a galvanic life into the carcase by codifying that law  in whatever work i find this man during his long life he is to me inexplicable  louis xi of france is the man most like justinian whom i know but he too is a man not to be fathomed by me  all the facts about justinian you will find in gibbon  i have no theory by which to arrange and explain them and therefore can tell you no more than gibbon does  so to this gothic war which you must remember became possible for justinian by belisarius having just destroyed the vandals out of africa it began by belisarius invading the south of italy  witigis was elected warking of the goths the man of witty counsels who did not fulfil his name while theodatus theodaht esteemed by the people as his name meant had fallen into utter disesteem after some last villainy about money had been struck down in the road by the man he had injured and there had his throat cut resupinus instar victimae jugulatus  he had consulted a jew diviner just before who had given him a warning thirty pigs signifying the unclean gentiles the jew shut up in three sties naming ten goths ten romans and ten imperialists of belisarius army and left them to starve  at the end they found dead all the goths but two hardly any of the imperialists and half the romans but the five roman pigs who were left had lost their bristlesbare to the skin as the event proved  after that theodatus had no heart to fight and ended his dogs life by a dogs death as we have seen  note also this that there was a general feeling of coming ruin that there were quaint signs and omens  we have heard of the pigs which warned the goths  here is another  there was a mosaic picture of theodoric at naples it had been crumbling to pieces at intervals and every fresh downfall had marked the death of an amal  now the last remains went down to the very feet and the romans believed that it foretold the end of the amal dynasty  there was a sibylline oracle too     quintili mense roma nihil geticum metuet  here too we find the last trace of heathenism of that political mythology which had so inextricably interwoven itself with the life and history of the city  the shrine of janus was still standing all of bronze only just large enough procopius says to contain the bronze image of janus bifrons  the gates during christian centuries had never been opened even in war time  now people went by night and tried to force them open but hardly succeeded  belisarius garrisoned rome and the goths attacked it but in vain  you must read the story of that famous siege in the really brilliant pages of old procopius the last good historian of the old world  moreover and this is most important belisarius raised the native population against the goths  as he had done in africa when in one short campaign he utterly destroyed the now effeminate aristocracy of the vandals so he did in italy  by real justice and kindness by proclaiming himself the deliverer of the conquered from the yoke of foreign tyrants he isolated the slaveholding aristocracy of the goths from the mass of the inhabitants of italy  belisarius and the goths met and the goths conquered  but to take rome was beyond their power and after that a long miserable war struggled and wrangled up and down over the wretched land city after city was taken and destroyed now by roman now by goth  the lands lay waste the people disappeared in tens of thousands  all great dietrichs work of thirty years was trampled into mud  there were horrible sieges and destructions by both partiessack of milan by goths sack of rimini and the country round by romans horrors of famine at auximum two women who kept an inn killing and eating seventeen men till the eighteenth discovered the trap and killed them everywhere as i say good dietrichs work of thirty years trampled into gory mud  then theudebert and his false franks came down to see what they could get all save a few knights round the king on foot without bow or lance but armed with sword shield and heavy shorthandled doubleedged francisc or battleaxe  at the bridge over the ticinus they nominal catholics sacrificed gothic women and children with horrid rites fought alike goths and romans lost a third of their army by dysentery and went home again  at last after more horrors vitigis and his goths were driven into ravenna  justinian treated for peace and then followed a strange peripeteia which we have happily from an eyewitness procopius himself  the roman generals outside confessed their chance of success hopeless  the goths inside tired of the slow vitigis send out to the great belisarius will he be their king  king over them there in italy he promised meaning to break his promise and to the astonishment and delight of the romans the simple and honest barbarians opened the gates of ravenna and let in him and his romans to find themselves betrayed and enslaved  when i saw our troops march in says procopius i felt it was gods doing so to turn their minds  the goths he says were far superior in numbers and in strength and their women who had fancied these romans to be mighty men of valour spit in the faces of their huge husbands and pointing to the little romans reproached them with having surrendered to such things as that  but the folly was committed belisarius carried them away captive to constantinople and so ended the first act of the gothic war  in the moment of victory the envy of the byzantine court undid all that it had done  belisarius returned with his captives to rome not for a triumph but for a disgrace and italy was left open to the goths if they had men and heart to rise once more  and they did rise  among the remnant of the race was left a hero totila by namea teuton of the ancient stamp  totilas free from deaththe deathless one they say his name means  under him the nation rose once more as out of the ground  a teuton of the ancient stamp he was just and merciful exceedingly  take but two instances of him and know the man by them  he retook naples the romans within were starving  he fed them but lest they should die of the sudden repletion he kept them in by guards at each gate and fed them up more and more each day till it was safe to let them out to find food for themselves in the country  a roman came to complain that a goth had violated his daughter  he shall die said totila  he shall not die said the goths  he is a valiant hero  they came clamouring to the king he answered them quietly and firmly  they may choose today whether to let this man go unpunished or to save the gothic nation and win the victory  do they not recollect how at the beginning of the war they had brave soldiers famous generals countless treasures horses weapons and all the forts of italy  and yet under theodatus a man who loved gold better than justice they had so angered god by their unrighteous lives thatwhat had happened they knew but too well  now god had seemed to have avenged himself on them enough  he had begun a new course with them  they must begin a new course with him and justice was the only path  as for the mans being a valiant hero let them know that the unjust and the ravisher were never brave in fight but that according to a mans life such was his luck in battle  his noble words came all but true  the feeble generals who were filling belisariuss place were beaten one by one and almost all italy was reconquered  belisarius had to be sent back again to italy but the envy whether of justinian himself or of the two wicked women who ruled his court allowed him so small a force that he could do nothing  totila and the goths came down once more to rome  belisarius in agony sent for reinforcements and got them but too late  he could not relieve rome  the goths had massed themselves round the city and belisarius having got to ostia portus at the tibers mouth could get no further  this was the last woe the actual deathagony of ancient rome  the famine grew and grew  the wretched romans cried to bessas and his garrison either to feed them or to kill them out of their misery they would do neither  they could hardly at last feed themselves  the romans ate nettles off the ruins and worse things still  there was not a dog or a rat left  they even killed themselves  one father of five children could bear no longer their cries for food  he wrapped his head in his mantle and sprang into the tiber while the children looked on the survivors wandered about like spectres brown with hunger and dropped dead with halfchewed nettles between their lips  to this says procopius had fortune brought the roman senate and people  nay not fortune but wickedness  they had wished to play at being free while they themselves were the slaves of sin  and still belisarius was comingand still he did not come  he was forcing his way up the tiber he had broken totilas chain burnt a tower full of goths and the city was on the point of being relieved when one isaac made a fool of himself and was taken by the goths  belisarius fancied that portus his base of operations with all his supplies and antonia the worthless wife on whom he doted were gone  he lost his head was beaten terribly fell back on ostia and then the end came isaurians from within helped in goths by night  the asinarian gate was opened and rome was in the hands of the goths  and what was left  what of all the pomp and glory the spoils of the world the millions of inhabitants  five or six senators who had taken refuge in st peters and some five hundred of the plebs pope pelagius crouching at totilas feet and crying for mercy and rusticiana daughter of symmachus boethius widow with other noble women in slaves rags knocking without shame at door after door to beg a bit of bread  and that was what was left of rome  gentlemen i make no comment  i know no more awful page in the history of europe  through such facts as these god speaks  let man be silent and look on in fear and trembling knowing that it was written of old timethe wages of sin are death  the goths wanted to kill rusticiana  she had sent money to the roman generals she had thrown down dietrichs statues in revenge for the death of her father and her husband  totila would not let them touch her  neither maid wife nor widow says procopius was the worse for any goth  next day he called the heroes together  he is going to tell them the old tale he sayshow in vitigis time at ravenna 7000 greeks had conquered and robbed of kingdom and liberty 200000 rich and wellarmed goths  and now that they were raw levies few naked wretched they had conquered more than 20000 of the enemy  and why  because of old they had looked to everything rather than to justice they had sinned against each other and the romans  therefore they must choose and be just men henceforth and have god with them or unjust and have god against them  then he sends for the wretched remnant of the senators and tells them the plain truthhow the great dietrich and his successors had heaped them with honour and wealth and how they had returned his benefits by bringing in the greeks  and what had they gained by changing dietrich for justinian  logothetes who forced them by blows to pay up the money which they had already paid to their gothic rulers and revenue exacted alike in war and in peace  slaves they deserve to be and slaves they shall be henceforth  then he sends to justinian  he shall withdraw his army from italy and make peace with him  he will be his ally and his son in arms as dietrich had been to the emperors before him or if not he will kill the senate destroy rome and march into illyricum  justinian leaves it to belisarius  then totila begins to destroy rome  he batters down the walls he is ready to burn the town  he will turn the evil place into a sheeppasture  belisarius flatters and cajoles him from his purpose and he marches away with all his captives leaving not a living soul in rome  but totila shews himself a general unable to cope with that great tactician  he divides his forces and allows belisarius to start out of ostia and fortify himself in rome  the goths are furious at his rashness but it is too late and the war begins again up and down the wretched land till belisarius is recalled by some fresh court intrigue of his wicked wife and another and even more terrible enemy appears on the field narses the eunuch avenging his wrong upon his fellowmen by cunning and courage almost preternatural  he comes upon them with a mighty host but not of romans alone  he has gathered the teuton tribesherules the descendants probably of odoacers confederates gepids who have a long bloodfeud against the goths and most terrible of all alboin with his five thousand more burgundians of whom you will hear enough hereafter  we read even of multitudes of huns and even of persian deserters from the chosroo  but narses policy is the old roman oneteuton must destroy teuton  and it succeeds  in spite of some trouble with the franks who are holding venetia he marches down victorious through the wasted land and totila marches to meet him in the apennines  the hero makes his last speech  he says there will be no need to talk henceforth  this day will end the war they are not to fear these hired huns herules lombards fighting for money  let them hold together like desperate men  so they fight it out  the goths depending entirely on the lance the romans on a due use of every kind of weapon  the tremendous charge of the gothic knights is stopped by showers of hun and herule arrows and they roll back again and again in disorder on the foot but in spite of the far superior numbers of the romans it is not till nightfall that narses orders a general advance of his line  the goths try one last charge but appalled by the numbers of the enemy break up and falling back on the foot throw them into confusion and all is lost  the foot are cut down flying  the knights ride for their lives  totila and five horsemen are caught up by asbad the gepid chief  asbad puts his lance in rest not knowing who was before him  dog cries totilas page wilt thou strike thy lord  but it is too late  asbads lance goes through his back and he drops on his horses neck  scipwar shipward the goth wounds asbad and falls wounded himself  the rest carry off totila  he dies that night after reigning eleven stormy years  the goths flee across the po  there is one more struggle for life and one more hero left  teia by name the slow one slow but strong  he shall be king now  they lift him on the shield and gather round him desperate but determined to die hard  he finds the treasure of totila hid in pisa  he sends to theudebald and his franks  will they help him against the roman and they shall have the treasure the last remnant of the nibelungen hoard  no  the luegenfelden will not come  they will stand by and see the butchery on the chance of getting all italy for themselves  narses storms romeor rather a little part of it round hadrians mole which the goths had fortified and the goths escape down into campania mad with rage  that victory of narses says procopius brought only a more dreadful destruction on the roman senate and people  the goths as they go down murder every roman they meet  the day of grace which totila had given them is over  the teutons in narses army do much the same  what matter to burgunds and herules who was who provided they had any thing to be plundered of  totila has allowed many roman senators to live in campania  they hear that narses has taken rome they begin to flock to the ghastly ruin  perhaps there will be once again a phantom senate phantom consuls under the romani nominis umbram  the goths catch them and kill them to a man  and there is an end of the senatus populusque romanus  the end is near now  and yet these terrible goths cannot be killed out of the way  on the slopes of vesuvius by nuceria they fortify a camp and as long as they are masters of the neighbouring sea for two months they keep narses at bay  at last he brings up an innumerable fleet cuts off their supplies and then the end comes  the goths will die like desperate men on foot  they burst out of camp turn their horses loose after the fashion of german knightsone hears of the fashion again and again in the middle ageand rush upon the enemy in deep solid column the romans have hardly time to form some sort of line and then not the real romans i presume but the burgunds and gepids turn their horses loose like the goths  there is no need for tactics the fight is hand to hand every man says procopius rushing at the man nearest him  for a third of the day teia fights in front sheltered by his long pavisse stabbing with a mighty lance at the mob which makes at him as dogs at a boar at bay  procopius is awed by the man  most probably he saw him with his own eyes  second in valour he says to none of the heroes  again and again his shield is full of darts  without moving a foot without turning an inch right or left says procopius he catches another from his shieldbearer and fights on  at last he has twelve lances in his shield and cannot move it coolly he calls for a fresh one as if he were fixed to the soil thrusts back the enemy with his left hand and stabs at them with his right  but his time is come  as he shifts his shield for a moment his chest is exposed and a javelin is through him and so ends the last hero of the east goths  they put his head upon a pole and carry it round the lines to frighten the goths  the goths are long past frightening  all day long and all the next day did the germans fight on burgund and gepid against goth neither giving nor taking quarter each man dying where he stood till human strength could bear up no longer while narses sat by like an ugly troll as he was smiling to see the teuton slay the teuton for the sake of their common enemy  then the goths sent down to narses  they were fighting against god  they would give in and go their ways peaceably and live with some other teuton nations after their own laws  they had had enough of italy poor fellows and of the nibelungen hoard  only narses that they might buy food on the journey back must let them have their money which he had taken in various towns of italy  narses agreed  there was no use fighting more with desperate men  they should go in peace  and he kept his faith with them  perhaps he dared not break it  he let them go like a wounded lion crawling away from the hunter up through italy and over the po to vanish  they and their name became absorbed in other nations and history knows the east goths no more  so perished by their own sins a noble nation and in perishing destroyed utterly the roman people  after war and famine followed as usual dreadful pestilence and italy lay waste for years  henceforth the italian population was not roman but a mixture of all races with a most powerful but an entirely new type of character  rome was no more senatorial but papal  and why did these goths perish in spite of all their valour and patriotism at the hands of mercenaries  they were enervated no doubt as the vandals had been in africa by the luxurious southern climate with its gardens palaces and wines  but i have indicated a stronger reason alreadythey perished because they were a slaveholding aristocracy  we must not blame them  all men then held slaves but the original sin was their ruin though they knew it not  it helped doubtless to debauch them to tempt them to the indulgence of those fierce and greedy passions which must in the long run lower the morality of slaveholders and which as totila told them had drawn down on them the anger of heaven  but more though they reformed their morals and that nobly under the stern teaching of affliction that could not save them they were ruined by the inherent weakness of all slaveholding states the very weakness which had ruined in past years the roman empire  they had no middle class who could keep up their supplies by exercising for them during war the arts of peace  they had no lower class whom they dare entrust with arms and from whom they might recruit their hosts they could not call a whole population into the field and when beaten in that field carry on as britain would when invaded a guerilla warfare from wood to wood and hedge to hedge as long as a coign of vantageground was left  they found themselves a small army of gentlemen chivalrous and valiant as slaveholders of our race have always been but lessening day by day from battle and disease with no means of recruiting their numbers while below them and apart from them lay the great mass of the population helpless unarmed degraded ready to side with any or every one who would give them bread or let them earn it for themselves for slaves must eat even though their masters starve and careless of if not even hostile to their masters interests the moment those masters were gone to the wars  in such a case nothing was before them save certain defeat at last by an enemy who could pour in ever fresh troops of mercenaries and who had the command of the seas  i may seem to be describing the case of a modern and just as valiant and noble a people  i do not mention its name  the parallel i fear is too complete not to have already suggested itself to you     lecture viipaulus diaconus   and now i come to the final settlement of italy and the lombard race and to do that well i must introduce you today to an old chroniclera very valuable and as far as we know faithful writerpaul warnefrid alias paul the deacon  i shall not trouble you with much commentary on him but let him as much as possible tell his own story  he may not be always quite accurate but you will get no one more accurate  in the long run you will know nothing about the matter save what he tells you so be content with what you can get  let him shew you what sort of an account of his nation and the world in general a lombard gentleman and clergyman could give at the end of the 8th century  you recollect the lombards of whom tacitus says longobardos paucitas nobilitat  paulus warnefrid was one of their descendants and his history carries out the exact truth of tacitus words  he too speaks of them as a very small tribe  he could not foresee how much the nobilitat meant  he knew his folk as a brave semifeudal race who had conquered the greater part of italy and tilled and ruled it well who were now conquered by charlemagne and annexed to the great frank empire but without losing anything of their distinctive national character  he did not foresee that they would become the architects the merchants the goldsmiths the bankers the scientific agriculturists of all europe  we know it  whenever in london or any other great city you see a lombard street an old street of goldsmiths and bankersor the three golden balls of lombardy over a pawnbrokers shopor in the country a field of ryegrass or a patch of lucernerecollect this wise and noble people and thank the lombards for what they have done for mankind  paulus is a garrulous historian but a valuable one just because he is garrulous  though he turned monk and deacon in middle life he has not sunk the man in the monk and become a cosmopolite like most roman ecclesiastics who have no love or hate for human beings save as they are friends or enemies of the pope or their own abbey  he has retained enough of the lombard gentleman to be proud of his family his country and the old legends of his race which he tells halfashamed but with evident enjoyment  he was born at beautiful friuli with the jagged snowline of the alps behind him and before him the sun and the sea and the plains of po he was a courtier as a boy in desiderius court at pavia and then when charlemagne destroyed the lombard monarchy seems to have been much with the great king at aix  he certainly ended his life as a benedictine monk at monte casino about 799 having written a life of st gregory homilies long and many the appendix to eutropius the historia miscella as it is usually called up to justinians time and above all this history of the lombards his forefathers which i shall take as my text  to me and i believe to the great german antiquaries his history seems a model history of a nation  you watch the people and their story rise before you out of fable into fact out of the dreary darkness of the unknown north into the clear light of civilized roman history  the first chapter is of germany how it nourishes much people and therefore many nations go forth of it  the reason which he gives for the immense population is significant  the further to the north and the colder the more healthy he considers the world to be and more fit for breeding human beings whereas the south being nearer to the heat of the sun always abounds with diseases  the fact really is i presume that italy all the south which he knew and perhaps most of the once roman empire were during the 6th and 7th centuries pestilential  ruined cities stopt watercourses cultivated land falling back into marsh and desert a soil too often saturated with human corpsesoffered all the elements for pestilence  if the once populous campagna of rome be now uninhabitable from malaria what must it have been in paul warnefrids time  be that as it may this is his theory  then he tells us how his people were at first called winils and how they came out of scania insula  sweden is often naturally an island with the early chroniclers only the south was known to them  the north was magical unknown quenland the dwellingplace of yotuns elves trolls scratlings and all other uncanny inhumanities  the winils find that they are growing too many for scanland and they divide into three parties  two shall stay behind and the third go out to seek their fortunes  which shall go is to be decided by lot  the third on whom the lot falls choose as warkings two brothers ayo and ibor and with them their mother gambara the alrunawife prudent and wise exceedinglyand they go forth  but before paul can go too he has a thing or two to say which he must not forget about the wild mysterious north from which his forefathers came  first how in those very extreme parts of germany in a cave on the ocean shore lie the seven sleepers  how they got thither from ephesus i cannot tell still less how they should be at once there on the baltic shore and at ephesusas mohammed himself believed and edward the confessor taughtand at marmoutier by tours and probably elsewhere beside  be that as it may there they are the seven martyrs sleeping for ever in their roman dresses which some wild fellow tried to pull off once and had his arms withered as a punishment  and paul trusts that they will awake some day and by their preaching save the souls of the heathen wends and finns who haunt those parts  the teutonic knights however and not the seven sleepers did that good work  only their dog is not with them it appearsthe sacred dog which watches them till the judgment day when it is to go up to heaven with noahs dove and balaams ass and alborah the camel and all the holy beasts  the dog must have been left behind at ephesus  then he must tell us about the scritofinns of the bothnia gulf wild lapps and finns who have now retreated before the teutonic race  in paul warnefrids eyes they are little wild hopping creatureswhence they derive their name he saysscritofinns the hopping or scrambling finns  scrattels skretles often figure in the norse tales as hopping dwarfs half magical 158  the norse discoverers of america recognized the skraellings in the esquimaux and fled from them in panic terror till that furious virago freydisa thorvards wife and eirek the reds daughter caught up a dead mans sword and put to flight singlehanded the legion of little imps  others wiser or too wise say that paul is wrong that skrikfins is the right name so called from their screeking screaming and jabbering which doubtless the little fellows did loudly enough  be that as it may they appear to paul or rather to his informants wendish merchants probably who came down to charlemagnes court at aix to sell their amber and their furs as hopping about he says after the reindeer shooting them with a little clumsy bow and arrows tipt with bone and dressing themselves in their skins  procopius knew these scritfins too but he has got as usual addled in his geography and puts them in ultima thule or shetland and tells us over and above the reindeerskin dresses that the women never nursed their children but went out hunting with their husbands hanging the papoose up to a tree as the lapps do now with a piece of deers marrow in its mouth to keep it employed and moreover that they sacrificed their captives to a war god mars he calls him in cruel ugly ways  all which we may fully believe  then paul has to tell us how in the scritfin country there is little or no night in midsummer little or no day in winter and how the shadows there are exceeding long and shorten to nothing as they reach the equatorwhere he puts not merely egypt but jerusalem  and how on christmas days a mans shadow is nine feet long in italy whereas at totonis villam thionville as he himself has measured it is nineteen feet and a half  because he says shrewdly enough the further you go from the sun the nearer the sun seems to the horizon  of all which if you answerbut this is not history i shall replybut it is better than history  it is the history of history  it helps you to see how the world got gradually known how history got gradually to be written how each man in each age added his little grain to the great heap of facts and gave his rough explanation thereof and how each mans outlook upon this wondrous world grew wider clearer juster as the years rolled on  and therefore i have no objection at all to listen to paul in his next chapter concerning the two navels of the ocean one on each side britainabysses which swallow up the water twice a day and twice a day spout it up again  paul has seen so he seems to say the tide the greek text that inexplicable wonder of the old greeks and romans running up far inland at the mouths of the seine and loire and he has to get it explained somehow before he can go forward with a clear conscience  one of the navels seems to be the mahlstrom in norway  of the place of the other there is no doubt  it is close to evodia insula seemingly alderney  for a high noble of the french told him so he was sucked into it ships and all and only escaped by clinging to a rock and after awhile the margins of that abyss were all left bare leaving the frenchman high and dry palpitating so with fear says paul that he could hardly keep his seat  but when all the water had been sucked in out and up it came pouring again in huge mountains and upon them the frenchmans ships to his intense astonishment reappeared out of the bottomless pit into one of which he jumped being like a true frenchman thoroughly master of the situation and got safe home to tell paul the deacon  it is not quite the explanation of the tides which one would have wished for but if a french nobleman of high rank will swear that he saw it with his own eyes what can paul do in common courtesy but believe him  paul has observed too which is a fact that there is a small tide in his own adriatic and suggests modestly that there may be a similar hole in the bottom of that sea only a little one the tide being very little after which his praelibatis he will return he says to his story and so he goes back to the famous langbard saga the old story which he has turned out of living teutonic verse into dead latin prose and calls de woden et frea quaedam ridicula fabula but cant help for the life of him telling it apologizing all the time  how the winils his own folk went out to fight the wendels many more than them in number and how gambara the alrunawife cried to freia the goddess and freia told her that whichsoever of the two armies first greeted woden at the sunrise should win  but the winils are far away on the warroad and there is no time to send to them  so freia bids her take the winil women and dress them as warriors and plait their tresses over their lips for beards and cry to woden and woden admires their long beards and thinks them such valiant warbeasts that he grants them the victory  then freia tells him how he has been taken in and the old god laughs till the clouds rattle again and the winils are called langbardr ever after  but then comes in the antiquary and says that the etymology is worthless and that langbardr means long axesbardan axea word which we keep in halbert a hallaxe or guards poleaxe and perhaps the antiquary is right  but again comes in a very learned man dr latham 162 and more than hints that the name is derived from the lange borde the long meadows by the side of the elbe and so a good story crumbles to pieces and        all charms do fly    beneath the touch of cold philosophy  then follows another story possibly from another saga  how by reason of a great famine they had to leave scoringia the shoreland and go into mauringia a word which mr latham connects with the merovingi or meerwing conquerors of gaul  others say that it means the moorland others something else  all that they will ever find out we may see for ourselves alreadya little tribe of valiant fairhaired men whether all teutons or as mr latham thinks sclavonians with teuton leaders still intimately connected with our own english race both by their language and their laws struggling for existence on the bleak brown bogs and moors sowing a little barley and flax feeding a few rough cattle breeding a few great black horses generation after generation fighting their way southward as they exhausted the barren northern soils or became too numerous for their marches or found land left waste in front of them by the emigration of some suevic vandal or burgund tribe  we know nothing about them and never shall know save that they wore white linen gaiters and carried long halberts or poleaxes and had each an immortal soul in him as dear to god as yours or mine with immense unconscious capabilities which their children have proved right well  then comes another saga how they met the assipitti of whom whether they were tacituss usipetes of the lower rhine or asabiden the remnant of the asen who went not to scandinavia with odin we know not and need not know and how the assipitti would not let them pass and how they told the lombards that they had dogheaded men in their tribe who drank mens blood which mr latham well explains by pointing out in the travellers song a tribe of hundings houndings sons of the hound and how the lombards sent out a champion who fought the champion of the assipitti and so gained leave to go on their way  forward they go toward the southeast seemingly along the german marches the debateable land between teuton and sclav which would mechanically speaking be the line of least resistance  we hear of gothlandwherever that happened to be just then of anthaib the land held by the sclavonian anten and bathaib possibly the land held by the gepidae or remnant of the goths who bided behind as wessex men still say while the goths moved forward and then of burgundhaib wherever the burgunds might be then  i know not and i will dare to say no man can exactly know  for no dates are given and how can they be  the lombards have not yet emerged out of the dismal darkness of the north into the light of roman civilization and all the history they have are a few scraps of saga  at last they take a king of the family of the gungings agilmund son of ayo like the rest of the nations says jornandes for they will be no more under duces elective warkings  and then follows a fresh saga which repeats itself in the myths of several nations how a woman has seven children at a birth and throws them for shame into a pond and agilmund the king riding by stops to see and turns them over with his lance and one of the babes lays hold thereof and the king says this will be a great man and takes him out of the pond and calls him lamissohn the son of the fishpond so it is interpreted who grows to be a mighty kemperman and slays an amazon  for when they come to a certain river the amazons forbid them to pass unless they will fight their shechampion and lamissohn swims over and fights the warmaiden and slays her and they go on and come into a large land and quiet somewhere about silesia it would seem and abode there a long while  then down on them come the savage bulgars by night and slay king agilmund and carry off his daughter and lamissohn follows them and defeats them with a great slaughter and is made king and so forth till at last they have gothow we shall never knownear history and historic lands  for when odoacer and his turklings and other confederates went up into rugiland the country north of vienna and destroyed the rugians and fava their king then the lombards went down into the waste land of the rugians because it was fertile and abode there certain years  then they moved on again we know not why and dwelt in the open plains which are called feld  one says moravia but that they had surely left behind  rather it is the western plain of hungary about comorn  be that as it may they quarrelled there with the heruli  eutropius says that they paid the herules tribute for the land and offered to pay more if the herules would not attack them  paul tells a wild saga or story of the lombard kings daughter insulting a herule prince because he was short of stature he answered by some counterinsult and she furious had him stabbed from behind through a window as he sat with his back to it  then war came  the herules old and practised warriors trained in the roman armies despised the wild lombards and disdained to use armour against them fighting with no clothes save girdles  rodulf their king too certain of victory sat playing at tables and sent a man up a tree to see how the fight went telling him that he would cut his head off if he said that the herules fled and then touched by some secret anxiety as to the end spoke the fatal words himself and a madness from god came on the herules and when they came to a field of flax they took the blue flowers for water and spread out their arms to swim through and were all slaughtered defencelessly  then they fought with the suevi and their kings daughters married with the kings of the franks and then ruled aldwin a name which dr latham identifies with our english eadwin or edwin the noble conqueror though grotius translates it audwin the old or auld conqueror who brought them over the danube into pannonia between the danube and the drave about the year 526  procopius says that they came by a grant from the emperor justinian who gave as wife to aldwin a great niece of dietrich the good carried captive with witigis to byzant  thus at last they too have reached the forecourt of the roman empire and are waiting for their turn at the nibelungen hoard  they have one more struggle the most terrible of all and then they will be for a while the most important people of the then world  the gepidae are in hungary before them now a great people  ever since they helped to beat the huns at netad they have been holding attilas old kingdom for themselves and not attempting to move southward into the empire so fulfilling their name  there is continual desultory war justinian according to procopius account playing false with each in order to make them destroy each other  then once this is procopius story not pauls they meet for a great fight and both armies run away by a panic terror and aldwin the lombard and thorisend the gepid are left alone face to faceit is the hand of god say the two wild kingsgod does not mean these two peoples to destroy each other  so they make a truce for two years  then the gepidae call in cutuguri a hunnic tribe to help them then says procopius aldwin helped by roman mercenaries under amalfrid the goth theodorics great nephew and brotherinlaw of aldwin has a great fight with the gepidae  but paul knows naught of all this with him it is not aldwin but alboin his son who destroys the gepidae  alboin grotius translates as albewin he who wins all but dr latham true to his opinion that the lombards and the angles were closely connected identifies it with our aelfwine the fairy conqueror  aldwin paul says and thorisend fought in the asfeldwherever that may beand alboin the lombard prince slew thorisend the gepid prince and the gepidae were defeated with a great slaughter  then young alboin asked his father to let him sit at the table with him no he could not do that by lombard custom till he has become sonat arms to some neighbouring king  young alboin takes forty thanes and goes off to thorisends court as the guest of his enemy  the rites of hospitality are sacred  the king receives him feasts him seats him the slayer of his son in his dead sons place  and as he looks on him he sighs and at last he can contain no longer  the seat he says i like right well but not the man who sits in it  one of his sons takes fire and begins to insult the lombards and their white gaiters  you lombards have white legs like so many brood mares  a lombard flashes up  go to the asfeld and you will see how lombard mares can kick  your brothers bones are lying about there like any sorry nags  this is too much swords are drawn but old thorisend leaps up  he will punish the first man who strikes  guests are sacred  let them sit down again and drink their liquor in peace and after they have drunk he gives alboin his dead sons weapons and lets them go in peace like a noble gentleman  this grand old king dies in peace  aldwin dies likewise and to them succeed their sons alboin and cunimundthe latter probably the prince who made the jest about the broodmaresand they two will fight the quarrel out  cunimund says paul began the warof course that is his story  alboin is growing a great man he has married a daughter of clotaire king of the franks and now he takes to his alliance the avars who have just burst into the empire wild people who afterwards founded a great kingdom in the danube lands and they ravage cunimunds lands  he will fight the lombards first nevertheless he can settle the avars after  he and his says paul are slain to a man  alboin makes a drinkingcup of his skull carries off his daughter rosamund rosymouth and a vast multitude of captives and immense wealth  the gepidae vanish from history to this day says paul slaves either of the lombards or the huns by whom he rather means avars and alboin becomes the hero of his time praised even to pauls days in sagas saxon and bavarian as well as lombard for his liberality and his glory  we shall see now how he has his chance at the nibelungen hoard  he has heard enough as all teutons have of italy its beauty and its weakness  he has sent five thousand chosen warriors to narses to help him against totila and the ostrogoths and they have told him of the fair land and large with its vineyards olivegroves and orchards waste by war and pestilence and crying out for human beings to come and till it once more  there is no force left in italy now which can oppose him  hardly any left in the roman world  the plague is come to add its horrors to all the other horrors of the timethe true old plague as far as i can ascertain bred men say from the serbonian bog the plague which visited athens in the time of socrates and england in the seventeenth century and after the plague a famine woe on woe through all the dark days of justinian the demonemperor  the ostrogoths as you know were extinct as a nation  the two deluges of franks and allmen which under the two brothers buccelin and lothaire all on foot for the french as now were no horsemen had rolled into italy during the gothic war had been swallowed up as all things were in the fatal gulf of italy lothaire and his army returning laden with plunder had rotted away like sheep by lake benacus garda now of drink and of the plague  buccelin entrenched among his plunderwaggons by the volturno stream in the far south had waited in vain for that dead brother and his dead host till narses came on him with his army of trained herules and goths the francisc axe and barbed pike had proved useless before the arrows and the cavalry of the romans and no more than five allmen says one remained of all that mighty host  awful to think of 75000 men they say in one column 100000 in the other and like water they flowed over the land and like water they sank into the ground and left no trace  and now narses established as exarch of ravenna a sort of satrap like those of the persian emperors and representing the emperor of constantinople was rewarded for all his conquests and labours by disgrace  eunuchlike he loved money they said and eunuchlike he was harsh and cruel  the empress sophia listening too readily to court slanders bade him leave to men the use of arms and come back to the palace to spin among the maidstell her said the terrible old imp i will spin her such a thread as she shall not unravel  he went superseded by longinus but not to constantinople  from naples he sent so says paul the deacon to alboin and bade him come and try his fortune as king of italy  he sent too so says old paul presents to tempt the simple lombard mensuch presents as children would likeall fruits which grew in italian orchards  though the gold was gone those were still left  great babies they were these teutons as i told you at the first and narses knew it well and had used them for his ends for many a year  then were terrible signs seen in italy by night fiery armies fighting in the sky and streams of blood aloft foreshadowing the blood which should be shed  sent for or not king alboin came and with him all his army and a mighty multitude women and children and slaves bavarians gepidae bulgars sarmatae pannonians sueves and noricans whose names says paul remain unto this day in the names of the villages where they settled  with alboin too came saxons twenty thousand of them at the least with wife and child  and sigebert king of the franks put suevic settlers into the lands which the saxons had left  alboin gave up his own hungarian land to his friends the avars on the condition that he should have them back if he had to return  but return he never did he nor his lombard host  this is the end  the last invasion of italy  the sowing once for all of an italian people  fresh nations were still pressing down to the rear of the alps waiting for their turn to enter the fairy landnot knowing perhaps that nothing was left therein but ashes and bloodbut their chance was over now a people were going into italy who could hold what they got  on easter tuesday in the year of grace 568 they came seemingly by the old road the path of alaric and dietrich and the rest the pass from carniola through which the rail runs now from laybach to trieste  it must have been white in those days with the bones of nigh 200 years and they found bisons aurochsen in the mountains paul says and is not surprised thereat because there are plenty of them in hungary near by an old man told him he had seen a skin in which fifteen men might lie side by side  none you must know are left now save a very few in the lithuanian forests  paul goes out of his way to note this fact and so shall i  alboin left a strong guard in friuli and pauls ancestor among them under gisulf his nephew and marphrais or master of the horse who now became duke of friuli and warden of the marches bound to prevent the avars following them into their new abode  then the human deluge spread itself slowly over the lombard plains  none fought with them and none gainsaid for all the land was waste  the plague of three years before and the famine which followed it had says paul reduced the world into primaeval silence  the villages had no inhabitants but dogs the sheep were pasturing without a shepherd the wild birds swarmed unhurt about the fields  the corn was springing selfsown under the april sun the vines sprouting unpruned the lucerne fields unmown when the great lombard people flowed into that waste land and gave to it their own undying name  the scanty population worn out with misery fled to rocks and islands in the lakes and to the seaport towns but they seem to have found the lombards merciful masters and bowed their necks meekly to the inevitable yoke  the towns alone seem to have offered resistance  pavia alboin besieged three years and could not take  he swore some wild oath of utter destruction to all within and would have kept it  at last they capitulated  as alboin rode in at st johns gate his horse slipped up and could not rise though the grooms beat him with their lancebutts  a ghostly fear came on the lombards  remember lord king thy cruel oath and cancel it for there are christian folk in the city  alboin cancelled his oath and the horse rose at once  so alboin spared the people of pavia and entered the palace of old dietrich the ostrogoth as king of italy as far as the gates of rome and ravenna  and what was his end  such an end as he deserved earned and worked out for himself  a great warrior he had destroyed many nations and won a fair land  a just and wise governor he had settled north italy on some rough feudal system without bloodshed or cruelty  a passionate savage he died as savages deserve to die  you recollect rosamund his gepid bride  in some mad drinkingbout perhaps cherishing still his old hatred of her family he sent her her fathers skull full of wine and bade her drink before all  she drank and had her revenge  the story has become worldfamous from its horror but i suppose i must tell it you in its placehow she went to helmichis the shieldbearer and he bade her get peredeo the kemperman to do the deed and how peredeo intrigued with one of her bowermaidens and how rosamund did a deed of darkness and deceived peredeo and then said to him i am thy mistress thou must slay thy master or thy master thee  and how he like gyges in old herodotuss tale preferred to survive and how rosamund bound the kings sword to his bedstead as he slept his midday sleep and peredeo did the deed and how alboin leapt up and fought with his footstool but in vain  and how after he was dead rosamund became helmichis leman as she had been peredeos and fled with him to ravenna with all the treasure and alpswintha alboins daughter by the frankish wife and how longinus the exarch persuaded her to poison helmichis and marry him and how she gave helmichis the poisoned cup as he came out of the bath and he saw by the light of her wicked eyes that it was poison and made her drink the rest and so they both fell dead and then how peredeo and the treasure were sent to the emperor at constantinople and how peredeo slew a great lion in the theatre and how tiberius when he saw that he was so mighty a man of his hands bade put his eyes out and how he hid two knives in his sleeves and slew with them two great chamberlains of the emperor and so died like samson says old paul having got good weregeld for the loss of his eyesa man for either eye  and old narses died at rome at a great age and they wrapt him in lead and sent him to byzant with all his wealth  but some say that while he was still alive he hid his wealth in a great cistern and slew all who knew of it save one old man and swore him never to reveal the place  but after narses death that old man went to constantinople to tiberius the caesar and told him how he could not die with that secret on his mind and so tiberius got all the money so much that it took many days to carry away and gave it all to the poor as was his wont  a mytha fable but significant as one more attempt to answer the question of all questions in a teutons mindwhat had become of the nibelungen hoard  what had become of all the wealth of rome     lecture viiithe clergy and the heathen   i asked in my first lecture what would become of the forest children unless some kind saint or hermit took pity on them  i used the words saint and hermit with a special purpose  it was by the influence actual or imaginary of such that the teutons after the destruction of the roman empire were saved from becoming hordes of savages destroying each other by continual warfare  what our race owes for good and for evil to the roman clergy i shall now try to set before you  to mete out to them their due share of praise and blame is i confess a very difficult task  it can only be fulfilled by putting oneself as far as possible in their place and making human allowance for the circumstances utterly novel and unexpected in which they found themselves during the teutonic invasions  thus perhaps we may find it true of some of them as of others that wisdom is justified of all her children  that is a hard saying for human nature  justified of her children she may be after we have settled which are to be her children and which not but of all her children  that is a hard saying  and yet was not every man from the beginning of the world who tried with his whole soul to be right and to do good a child of wisdom of whom she at least will be justified whether he is justified or not  he may have had his ignorances follies weaknesses possibly crimes but he served the purpose of his mighty mother  he did even by his follies just what she wanted done and she is justified of all her children  this may sound like optimism but it also sounds like truth to any one who has fairly studied that fantastic page of history the contrast between the old monks and our own heathen forefathers  the more one studies the facts the less one is inclined to ask why was it not done betterthe more inclined to ask could it have been done better were not the celibate clergy from the fifth to the eighth centuries exceptional agents fitted for an exceptional time and set to do a work which in the then state of the european races none else could have done at least so one suspects after experience of their chronicles and legends sufficient to make one thoroughly detest the evil which was in their system but sufficient also to make one thoroughly love many of the men themselves  a few desultory sketches some carefully historical the rest as carefully compiled from common facts may serve best to illustrate my meaning  the monk and clergyman whether celibate or not worked on the heathen generally in one of three capacities as tribune of the people as hermit or solitary prophet as colonizer and in all three worked as well as frail human beings are wont to do in this most piecemeal world  let us look first at the hermits  all know what an important part they play in old romances and ballads  all are not aware that they played as important a part in actual history  scattered through all wildernesses from the cliffs of the hebrides to the sclavonian marches they put forth a power uniformly it must be said for good  every one knows how they appear in the old romanceshow some sir bertrand or other wearied with the burden of his sins stumbles on one of these einsiedler settlers alone and talks with him and goes on a wiser and a better man  how he crawls perhaps out of some wild scuffle allto bebled and reeling to his saddlebow and ever he went through a waste land and rocks rough and strait so that it him seemed he must surely starve and anon he heard a little bell whereat he marvelled and betwixt the water and the wood he was aware of a chapel and an hermitage and there a holy man said mass for he was a priest and a great leech and cunning withal  and sir bertrand went in to him and told him all his casehow he fought sir marculf for love of the fair ellinore and how the king bade part them and how marculf did him open shame at the wineboard and how he went about to have slain him privily but could not and then how he went and wasted marculfs lands house with byre kine with corn till a strong woman smote him over the head with a quernstone and allto broke his brainpan and so forththe usual story of mad passion drink pride revenge  and there the holy man aread him right godly doctrine and shrived him and gave him an oath upon the blessed gospels that fight he should not save in his liege lords quarrel for a year and a day  and there he abode till he was well healed he and his horse  must not that wild fighting bertrand have gone away from that place a wiser and a better man  is it a matter to be regretted or otherwise that such men as the hermit were to be found in that forest to mend bertrands head and his morals at the same time  is it a matter to be regretted or otherwise that after twenty or thirty years more of fighting and quarrelling and drinking this same sir bertrandfinding that on the whole the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life were poor paymasters and having very sufficient proof in the ends of many a friend and foe that the wages of sin are deathfell to religion likewise and was a hermit in that same place after the holy man was dead and was made priest of that same chapel and died in honour having succoured many good knights and wayfaring men  one knows very well that it would not be right now that it is not needed now  it is childish to repeat that when the question is was it right thenor at least as right as was possible then  was it needed thenor at least the nearest thing to that which was needed  if it was why should not wisdom be justified of all her children  one hopes that she was for certainly if any men ever needed to be in the right lest they should be of all men most miserable it was these same old hermits  praying and preaching continually they lived on food which dogs would not eat in dens in which dogs ought not to live  they had their reasons  possibly they knew their own business best  possibly also they knew their neighbours business somewhat they knew that such generations as they lived in could not be taught save by some extravagant example of this kind some caricature as it were of the doctrines which were to be enforced  nothing less startling perhaps could have touched the dull hearts have convinced the dull brains of fierce ignorant and unreasoning men  ferocity lawlessness rapine cruelty andwhen they were glutted and debauched by the spoils of the roman empiresensuality were the evils which were making europe uninhabitable for decent folk and historyas milton called ita mere battle of kites and crows  what less than the example of the hermitespecially when that hermit was a delicate and highborn womancould have taught men the absolute superiority of soul to body of spiritual to physical force of spiritual to physical pleasure and have said to them not in vain words but solid actsall that you follow is not the way of life  the very opposite to it is the way of life  the wages of sin are death and you will find them soin this life the victims of your own passions and of the foes whom your crimes arouse and in life to come of hell for ever  but i tell you i have no mind to go to hell  i have a mind to go to heaven and i know my mind right well  if the world is to be such as this and the rulers thereof such as you i will flee from you  i will not enter into the congregation of sinners neither will i cast in my lot with the bloodthirsty  i will be alone with god and his universe  i will go to the mountain cave or to the ocean cliff and there while the salt wind whistles through my hair i will be stronger than you safer than you richer than you happier than you  richer than you for i shall have for my companion the beatific vision of god and of all things and beings god like fair noble just and merciful  stronger than you because virtue will give me a power over the hearts of men such as your force cannot give you and you will have to come to my lonely cell and ask me to advise you and teach you and help you against the consequences of your own sins  safer than you because god in whom i trust will protect me and if not i have still the everlasting life of heaven which this world cannot give or take away  so go your ways fight and devour one another the victims of your own lusts  i am minded to be a good man and to be that i will give upas you have made all other methods impossible for meall which seems to make life worth having  oh instead of finding fault with such men instead of with vulturine beak picking out the elements of manichaeism of conceit of discontent of what not human frailty and ignorance which may have been in them let us honour the enormous moral force which enabled them so to bear witness that not the mortal animal but the immortal spirit is the man and that when all which outward circumstance can give is cast away the man still lives for ever by god and in god  and they did teach that lesson  they were good while other men were bad and men saw the beauty of goodness and felt the strength of it and worshipped it in blind savage admiration  read roswedes vitae patrum eremiticorum read the legends of the hermits of the german forests read colgans lives of the irish saints and see whether amid all fantastic incredible sometimes immoral myths the goodness of life of some one or other is not the historic nucleus round which the myths and the worship of the saint have crystallized and developed  take for instance the exquisite hymn of st bridget which colgan attributes to the sixth century though it is probably much later that has nothing to do with the argument     bridget the victorious she loved not the world    she sat on it as a gull sits on the ocean    she slept the sleep of a captive mother    mourning after her absent child     she suffered not much from evil tongues    she held the blessed faith of the trinity    bridget the mother of my lord of heaven    the best among the sons of the lord     she was not querulous nor malevolent    she loved not the fierce wrangling of women    she was not a backbiting serpent or a liar    she sold not the son of god for that which passes away     she was not greedy of the goods of this life    she gave away without gall without slackness    she was not rough to wayfaring men    she handled gently the wretched lepers     she built her a town in the plains of kildare    and dead she is the patroness of many peoples  i might comment much on this quotation  i might point out how st bridget is called the mother of the lord and by others the mary of the irish the automata coeli regina and seems to have been considered at times as an avatar or incarnation of the blessed virgin  i might more than hint how that appellation as well as the calling of christ the best of the sons of the lord in an orthodox catholic hymn seems to point to the remnants of an older creed possibly buddhist the transition whence towards catholic christianity was slow and imperfect  i might make merry over the fact that there are many bridgets some say eleven even as there are three or four st patricks and raise learned doubts as to whether such persons ever existed after that straussian method of pseudocriticism which cometh not from above from the spirit of god nor yet indeed from below from the sound region of fact but from within out of the naughtiness of the heart defiling a man  i might weaken too the effect of the hymn by going on with the rest of it and making you smile at its childish miracles and portents but i should only do a foolish thing by turning your minds away from the broad fact that st bridget or various persons who got in the lapse of time massed together under the name of st bridget were eminently good women  it matters little whether these legends are historically correct  their value lies in the moral of them  and as for their real historical correctness the straussian argument that no such persons existed because lies are told of them is i hold most irrational  the falsehood would not have been invented unless it had started in a truth the high moral character ascribed to them would never have been dreamed of by persons who had not seen living instances of that character  mans imagination does not create it only reproduces and recombines its own experience  it does so in dreams  it does so as far as the moral character of the saint is concerned in the legend and if there had not been persons like st bridget in ireland the wild irish could never have imagined them  therefore it matters little to a wise man standing on the top of croagh patrick the grandest mountain perhaps with the grandest outlook in these british isles as he looks on the wild irish there on pattern days up among the atlantic clouds crawling on bare and bleeding knees round st patricks cellit matters little i say to the wise man whether st patrick himself owned the ancient image which is worshipped on that mountain peak or the ancient bell which till late years hung in the sanctuarysuch a strange oblong bell as the irish saints carried with them to keep off the demonsthe magic bells which appear as far as i am aware in the legends of no country till you get to tartary and the buddhistssuch a bell as came or did not come down from heaven to st senan such a bell as st fursey sent flying through the air to greet st cuanady at his devotions when he could not come himself such a bell as another saint wandering in the woods rang till a stag came out of the covert and carried his burden for him on his horns  it matters as little to the wise man whether that bell belonged to st patrick as whether all these childs dreams are dreams  it matters little to him too whether st patrick did or did not stand on that mountain peak in the spirit and power of elias after whom it was long named fasting like elias forty days and forty nights wrestling with the demons of the storm and the snakes of the fen and the peishtamore the monstrous python of the lakes which assembled at the magic ringing of his bell till he conquered not by the brute force of a hercules and theseus and the monsterquellers of old greece but by the spiritual force of which so the text was then applied it is written this kind cometh not out but by prayer and fasting till he smote the evil things with the golden rod of jesus and they rolled over the cliff in hideous rout and perished in the atlantic far below  but it matters much to a wise man that under all these symbols not childish at all but most grand to the man who knows the grand place of which they are told there is set forth the victory of a good and beneficent man over evil whether of matter or of spirit  it matters much to him that that cell that bell that image are tokens that if not st patrick some one else at least did live and worship on that mountain top in remote primaeval times in a place in which we would not perhaps could not endure life a week  it matters much to him that the man who so dwelt there gained such a power over the minds of the heathen round him that five millions of their christian descendants worship him and god on account of him at this day  st ita again  it matters little that she did notbecause she could notperform the miracles imputed to her  it matters little whether she had or notas i do not believe her to have hada regularly organized convent of nuns in ireland during the sixth century  it matters little if the story which follows is a mere invention of the nuns in some after century in order to make a good title for the lands which they helda trick but too common in those days  but it matters much that she should have been such a person that such a story as this when told of her should have gained beliefhow the tribes of hyconnell hearing of her great holiness came to her with their chiefs and offered her all the land about her cell  but she not wishing to be entangled with earthly cares accepted but four acres round her cell for a garden of herbs for her and her nuns  and the simple wild irish were sad and angry and said if thou wilt not take it alive thou shalt take it when thou art dead  so they chose her then and there for their patroness and she blessed them with many blessings which are fulfilled unto this day and when she migrated to the lord they gave her all the land and her nuns hold it to this day the land of hyconnell on the east shannon bank at the roots of luachra mountain  what a picture  one hopes that it may be true for the sake of its beauty and its pathos  the poor savage halfnaked and i fear on the authority of st jerome and others now and then cannibal celts with their saffron scarfs and skenes and darts and glibs of long hair hanging over their hypogorillaceous visages coming to the prophet maiden and asking her to take their land for they could make no decent use of it themselves and look after them body and soul for they could not look after themselves and pray for them to her god for they did not know how to pray to him themselves  if any man shall regret that such an event happened to any savages on this earth i am i confess sorry for him  st severinus again whom i have mentioned to you more than oncenone of us can believe that he made a dead corpse silvinus the priest by name sit up and talk with him on its road to burial  none of us need believe that he stopped the plague at vienna by his prayers  none of us need attribute to anything but his sagacity the divine revelations whereby he predicted the destruction of a town for its wickedness and escaped thence like lot alone or by which he discovered during the famine of vienna that a certain rich widow had much corn hidden in her cellars but there are facts enough credible and undoubted concerning st severinus the apostle of austria to make us trust that in him too wisdom was justified of all her children  you may remark among the few words which have been as yet said of st severinus a destruction a plague and a famine  those words are a fair sample of st severinuss times and of the circumstances into which he voluntarily threw himself  about the middle of the fifth century there appears in the dying roman province of noricum austria we now call it a strange gentleman eloquent and learned beyond all and with the strangest power of melting and ruling the hearts of men  who he is he will not tell save that his name is severinus a right noble name without doubt  gradually it oozes out that he has been in the far east through long travels and strange dangers through many cities and many lands but he will tell nothing  he is the servant of god come hither to try to be of use  he certainly could have come for no other reason unless to buy slaves for austria was at that time the very highway of the nations the centre of the human mahlstrom in which huns gepiden allmannen rugen and a dozen wild tribes more wrestled up and down round the starving and beleaguered roman towns of that once fertile and happy province  a man who went there for his own pleasure or even devotion would have been as wise as one who had built himself last summer a villa on the rappahannock or retired for private meditation to the orchard of hougoumont during the battle of waterloo  nevertheless there severinus stayed till men began to appreciate him and called him and not unjustly saint  why not  he preached he taught he succoured he advised he fed he governed he turned aside the raids of the wild german kings he gained a divine power over their hearts he taught them something of god and of christ something of justice and mercy something of peace and unity among themselves till the fame ran through all the alps and far away into the hungarian marches that there was a prophet of god arisen in the land and before the unarmed man fasting and praying in his solitary cell on the mountain above vienna ten thousand knights and champions trembled who never had trembled at the sight of armed hosts  who would deny that man the name of saint  and who if by that sagacity which comes from the combination of intellect and virtue he sometimes seemed miraculously to foretell coming events would deny him the name of prophet also  if st severinus be the type of the monk as prophet st columba may stand as the type of the missionary monk the good man strengthened by lonely meditation but using that strength not for selfish fanaticism but for the good of men going forth unwillingly out of his beloved solitude that he may save souls  round him too cluster the usual myths  he drives away with the sign of the cross a monster which attacks him at a ford  he expels from a fountain the devils who smote with palsy and madness all who bathed therein  he sees by a prophetic spirit he sitting in his cell in ireland a great italian town destroyed by a volcano  his friends behold a column of light rising from his head as he celebrates mass  yes but they also tell of him that he was angelical in look brilliant in speech holy in work clear in intellect great in council  that he never passed an hour without prayer or a holy deed or reading of the scriptures for these old monks had bibles and knew them by heart too in spite of all that has been written to the contrary that he was of so excellent a humility and charity bathing his disciples feet when they came home from labour and carrying corn from the mill on his own back that he fulfilled the precept of his master he that will be the greatest among you let him be as your servant  they also tell of him and this is fact and history how he left his monastery of derm each the field of oaks which we call derry and went away at the risk of his life to preach to the wild picts of galloway and founded the great monastery of iona and that succession of abbots from whom christianity spread over the south of scotland and north of england under his great successor aidan  aidan has his myths likewise  they tell of him how he stilled the sea waves with holy oil how he turned back on penda and his saxons the flames with which the heathen king was trying to burn down bamborough walls  but they tell too and bede had heard it from those who had known aidan in the flesh of his love of peace and charity his purity and humility his mind superior to avarice or pride his authority becoming a minister of christ in reproving the haughty and powerful and his tenderness in relieving the afflicted and defending the poor  who save one who rejoiceth in evil instead of rejoicing in the truth will care to fix his eyes for a moment upon the fairy tales which surround such a story as long as there shines out from among them clear and pure in spite of all doctrinal errors the grace of god the likeness of jesus christ our lord  let us look next at the priest as tribune of the people supported usually by the invisible but most potent presence of the saint whose relics he kept  one may see that side of his power in raphaels immortal design of attilas meeting with the pope at the gates of rome and recoiling as he sees st peter and st paul floating terrible and threatening above the holy city  is it a myth a falsehood  not altogether  such a man as attila probably would have seen them with his strong savage imagination as incapable as that of a child from distinguishing between dreams and facts between the subjective and the objective world  and it was on the whole well for him and for mankind that he should think that he saw them and tremble before the spiritual and the invisible confessing a higher law than that of his own ambition and selfwill a higher power than that of his brute tartar hordes  raphaels design is but a famous instance of an influence which wrought through the length and breadth of the downtrodden and dying roman empire through the four fearful centuries which followed the battle of adrianople  the wild licence the boyish audacity of the invading teutons was never really checked save by the priest and the monk who worshipped over the bones of some old saint or martyr whose name the teutons had never heard  then as the wild king earl or comes with his wild reiters at his heels galloped through the land fighting indiscriminately his roman enemies and his teutonic rivalsharrying slaughtering burning by field and wildhe was aware at last of something which made him pause some little walled town built on the ruins of a great roman city with its byzantine minster towering over the thatched roofs sheltering them as the oak shelters the last nights fungus at its base  more than once in the last century or two has that same town been sacked  more than once has the surviving priest crawled out of his hidingplace when the sound of war was past called the surviving poor around him dug the dead out of the burning ruins for christian burial built up a few sheds fed a few widows and orphans organized some form of orderly life out of the chaos of blood and ashes in the name of god and st quemdeusvult whose bones he guards and so he has established a temporary theocracy and become a sort of tribune of the people magistrate and fatherthe only one they have  and now he will try the might of st quemdeusvult against the wild king and see if he can save the town from being sacked once more  so out he comesa bishop perhaps with priests monks crucifixes banners litanies  the wild king must come no further  that land belongs to no mortal man but to st quemdeusvult martyred here by the heathen five hundred years ago  some old kaiser of rome or it may be some former gothic king gave that place to the saint for ever and the saint will avenge his rights  he is very merciful to those who duly honour him but very terrible in his wrath if he be aroused  has not the king heard how the count of such a place only forty years before would have carried off a maiden from st quemdeusvults town and when the bishop withstood him he answered that he cared no more for the relics of the saint than for the relics of a dead ass and so took the maiden and went  but within a year and a day he fell down dead in his drink and when they came to lay out the corpse behold the devils had carried it away and put a dead ass in its place  all which the bishop would fully believe  why not  he had no physical science to tell him that it was impossible  morally it was in his eyes just and therefore probable while as for testimony men were content with very little in those days simply because they could get very little  news progressed slowly in countries desolate and roadless and grew as it passed from mouth to mouth as it did in the highlands a century ago as it did but lately in the indian mutiny till after a fact had taken ten years in crossing a few mountains and forests it had assumed proportions utterly fantastic and gigantic  so the wild king and his wild knights pause  they can face flesh and blood but who can face the quite infinite terrors of an unseen world they are men of blood too men of evil lives and conscience makes them cowards  they begin to think that they have gone too far  could they see the saint and make it up with him somewhat  no  the saint they cannot see  to open his shrine would be to commit the sin of uzzah  palsy and blindness would be the least that would follow  but the dome under which he lies all men may see and perhaps the saint may listen if they speak him fair  they feel more and more uncomfortable  this saint in heaven at gods right hand and yet there in the domchurchis clearly a mysterious ubiquitous person who may take them in the rear very unexpectedly  and his priests with their booklearning and their sciences and their strange dresses and chantswho knows what secret powers magical or other they may not possess  they bluster at first being as i have said much of the temper and habits for good and evil of english navvies  but they grow more and more uneasy full of childish curiosity and undefined dread  so into the town they go on promise which they will honourably keep being german men of doing no harm to the plebs the half roman artisans and burghers who are keeping themselves alive herethe last dying remnants of the civilization and luxury and cruelty and wickedness of a great roman colonial city and they stare at arts and handicrafts new to them and are hospitably fed by bishops and priests and then they go trembling and awkward into the great domchurch and gaze wondering at the frescoes and the carvings of the arcadesmarbles from italy porphyries from egypt all patched together out of the ruins of roman baths and temples and theatres and at last they arrive at the saints shrine itselfsome marble sarcophagus most probably covered with vine and ivy leaves with nymphs and satyrs long since consecrated with holy water to a new and better use  inside that lies the saint asleep yet ever awake  so they had best consider in whose presence they are and fear god and st quemdeusvult and cast away the seven deadly sins wherewith they are defiled for the saint is a righteous man and died for righteousness sake and those who rob the orphan and the widow and put the fatherless to death them he cannot abide and them he will watch like an eagle of the sky and track like a wolf of the wood fill he punishes them with a great destruction  in short the bishop preaches to the king and his men a right noble and valiant sermon calling things by their true names without fear or favour and assuming on the mere strength of being in the right a tone of calm superiority which makes the strong armed men blush and tremble before the weak and helpless one  yes  spirit is stronger than flesh  meekly bend thy neck sicamber said st remigius to the great conquering king clovis when he stept into the baptismal fontnot most gracious majesty or illustrious caesar or by the grace of god lord of the franks but sicamber as a missionary might now say maori or caffreand yet st remigiuss life was in cloviss hand then and alwaysburn what thou hast adored and adore what thou hast burned  and the terrible clovis trembled and obeyed  so does the wild king at the shrine of st quemdeusvult  he takes his bracelet or his jewel and offers it civilly enough  will the bishop be so good as to inform the great earl st quemdeusvult that he was not aware of his rights or even of his name that perhaps he will deign to accept this jewel which he took off the neck of a roman generalthatthat on the whole he is willing to make the amende honorable as far as is consistent with the feelings of a nobleman and trusts that the saint being a nobleman too will be satisfied therewith  after which probably it will appear to the wild king that this bishop is the very man that he wants the very opposite to himself and his wild riders a man pure peaceable just and brave possessed too of boundless learning who can read write cipher and cast nativities who has a whole room full of books and parchments and a map of the whole world who can talk latin and perhaps greek as well as one of those accursed maneating grendels a roman lawyer or a logothete from ravenna possessed too of boundless supernatural powerwould the bishop be so good as to help him in his dispute with the count boso about their respective marches in such and such a forest  if the bishop could only settle that without more fighting of course he should have his reward  he would confirm to the saint and his burg all the rights granted by constantine the kaiser and give him moreover all the meadow land in such and such a place with the mills and fisheries on service of a dish of trout from the bishop and his successors whenever he came that way for the trout there were exceeding good that he knew  and so a bargain would be struck and one of those curious compromises between the spiritual and temporal authorities take root of which one may read at length in the pages of m guizot or sir james stephen  and after a few years most probably the king would express a wish to be baptized at the instance of his queen who had been won over by the bishop and had gone down into the font some years before and he would bid his riders be baptized also and they would obey seeing that it could do them no harm and might do them some good and they would agree to live more or less according to the laws of god and common humanity and so one more christian state would be formed one more living stone as it was phrased in those days built into the great temple of god which was called christendom  so the work was done  can we devise any better method of doing it  if not let us be content that it was done somehow and believe that wisdom is justified of all her children  we may object to the fact that the domchurch and its organization grew up as was the case in the vast majority of instances round the body of a saint or martyr we may smile at the notion of an invisible owner and protector of the soil but we must not overlook the broad fact that without that prestige the barbarians would never have been awed into humanity without that prestige the place would have been swept off the face of the earth till not one stone stood on another and he who does not see what a disaster for humanity that would have been must be ignorant that the civilization of europe is the child of the towns and also that our teutonic forefathers were by profession destroyers of towns and settlers apart from each other on country freeholds  lonely barbarism would have been the fate of europe but for the monk who guarded the relics of the saint within the walled burg  this good work of the church in the preservation and even resuscitation of the municipal institutions of the towns has been discust so well and fully by m guizot m sismondi and sir james stephen that i shall say no more about it save to recommend you to read what they have written  i go on to point out to you some other very important facts which my ideal sketch exemplifies  the difference between the clergy and the teuton conquerors was more than a difference of creed or of civilization  it was an actual difference of race  they were romans to whom the teuton was a savage speaking a different tongue obeying different laws his whole theory of the universe different from the roman  and he was moreover an enemy and a destroyer  the teuton was to them as a hindoo is to us with the terrible exception that the positions were reversed that the teuton was not the conquered but the conqueror  it is easy for us to feel humanity and christian charity toward races which we have mastered  it was not so easy for the roman priest to feel them toward a race which had mastered him  his repugnance to the barbarian must have been at first intense he never would have conquered it he never would have become the willing converter of the heathen had there not been in him the spirit of god and firm belief in a catholic church to which all men of all races ought alike to belong  this true and glorious idea the only one which has ever been or ever will be able to break down the barriers of race and the animal antipathy which the natural man has to all who are not of his own kin this idea was the sole possession of the roman clergy and by it they conquered because it was true and came from god  but this very difference of race exposed the clergy to great temptations they were the only civilized men left west of constantinople  they looked on the teuton not as a man but as a child to be ruled to be petted when he did right punished when he did wrong and too often cajoled into doing right and avoiding wrong  craft became more and more their usual weapon  there were great excuses for them  their lives and property were in continual danger  craft is the natural weapon of the weak against the strong  it seemed to them too often to be not only natural but spiritual also and therefore just and right  again the clergy were the only organic remnants of the roman empire they claimed their privileges and lands as granted to them by past roman emperors under the roman law  this fact made it their interest of course to perpetuate that roman law and to introduce it as far as they could among their conquerors to the expulsion of the old teutonic laws and they succeeded on the whole  of that more hereafter  observe now that as their rights dated from times which to the teutons were prehistoric their statements could not be checked by conquerors who could not even read  thence rose the temptation to forge to forge legends charters dotations ecclesiastical history of all kindsan ugly and worldfamous instance of which you will hear of hereafter  to that temptation they yielded more and more as the years rolled on till their statements on ecclesiastical history became such as no historian can trust without the most plentiful corroboration  there were great excuses for them in this matter as in others  they could not but look on the teuton aswhat in fact and law he wasan unjust and intrusive usurper  they could not but look on their roman congregations and on themselves as what in fact and law they were the rightful owners of the soil  they were but defending or recovering their original rights  would not the end justify the means  but more  out of this singular position grew a doctrine which looks to us irrational now but was by no means so then  if the church derived her rights from the extinct roman caesars how could the teuton conquerors interfere with those rights  if she had owed allegiance to constantine or theodosius she certainly owed none to dietrich alboin or clovis  she did not hold their lands of them and would pay them if she could avoid it neither tax nor toll  she did not recognize the sovereignty of these teutons as ordained by god  out of this simple political fact grew up vast consequences  the teuton king was a heathen or arian usurper  he was not a king de jure in the eyes of the clergy till he was baptized into the church and then lawfully anointed king by the clergy  thus the clergy gradually became the makers of kings and the power of making involved a corresponding power of unmaking if the king rebelled against the church and so cut himself off from christendom  at best he was one of the princes of this world from whom the church was free absolutely in spiritual matters and in temporal matters also de jure and therefore de facto as far as she could be made free  to keep the possessions of the church from being touched by profane hands even that they might contribute to the common needs of the nation became a sacred duty a fixed idea for which the clergy must struggle anathematize forge if need be but alsoto do them justicedie if need be as martyrs  the nations of this world were nothing to them  the wars of the nations were nothing  they were the people of god who dwelt alone and were not reckoned among the nations their possessions were the inheritance of god and from this idea growing as i have shewn out of a political fact arose the extra national and too often antinational position which the roman clergy held for many ages and of which the instinct at least lingers among them in many countries  out of it arose too all after struggles between the temporal and ecclesiastical powers  becket fighting to the death against henry ii was not as m thierry thinks the anglosaxon defying the norman  he was the representative of the christian roman defying the teuton on the ground of rights which he believed to have existed while the teuton was a heathen in the german forests  gradually as the nations of europe became really nations within fixed boundaries and separate christian organizations these demands of the church became intolerable in reason because unnecessary in fact  but had there not been in them at the first an instinct of right and justice they would never have become the fixed idea of the clerical mind the violation of them the one inexpiable sin and the defence of them as may be seen by looking through the romish calendar the most potent qualification for saintship  yes  the clergy believed that idea deeply enough to die for it  st alphege at canterbury had been it is said one of the first advisers of the ignominious payment of the danegeld but there was one thing which he would not do  he would advise the giving up of the money of the nation but the money of his church he would not give up  the danes might thrust him into a filthy dungeon he would not take the childrens bread and cast it unto the dogs  they might drag him out into their husting and threaten him with torture but to the drunken cry of gold  bishop gold his only answer would benot a penny  he could not rob the poor of christ  and when he fell beaten to death with the bones and horns of the slaughtered oxen he died in faith a martyr to the great idea of that day that the gold of the church did not belong to the conquerors of this world  but st alphege was an englishman and not a roman  true in the letter but not in the spirit  the priest or monk by becoming such more or less renounced his nationality  it was the object of the church to make him renounce it utterly to make him regard himself no longer as englishman frank lombard or goth but as the representatives by an hereditary descent considered all the more real because it was spiritual and not carnal of the roman church to prevent his being entangled whether by marriage or otherwise in the business of this life out of which would flow nepotism simony and erastian submission to those sovereigns who ought to be the servants not the lords of the church  for this end no means were too costly  st dunstan in order to expel the married secular priests and replace them by benedictine monks of the italian order of monte casino convulsed england drove her into civil war paralysed her monarchs one after the other and finally left her exhausted and imbecile a prey to the invading northmen but he had at least done his best to make the royal house of cerdic and the nations which obeyed that house understand that the church derived its rights not from them but from rome  this hereditary sense of superiority on the part of the clergy may explain and excuse much of their seeming flattery  the most vicious kings are lauded if only they have been erga servos dei benevoli if they have founded monasteries if they have respected the rights of the church  the clergy too often looked on the secular princes as more or less wild beasts of whom neither common decency justice or mercy was to be expected and they had too often reason enough to do so  all that could be expected of the kings was that if they would not regard man they should at least fear god which if they did the proof of divine grace on their part was so unexpected as well as important that the monk chroniclers praised them heartily and honestly judging them by what they had not by what they had not  thus alone can one explain such a case as that of the monastic opinion of dagobert the second king of the franks  we are told in the same narrative seemingly without any great sense of incongruity how he murdered his own relations and guests and who nothow he massacred 9000 bulgars to whom he had given hospitality how he kept a harem of three queens and other women so numerous that fredegarius cannot mention them and also how accompanied by his harem he chanted among the monks of st denis how he founded many rich convents how he was the friend or rather pupil of st arnulf of metz st omer and above all of st eloiwhose story i recommend you to read charmingly told in mr maitlands dark ages pp 81122  the three saints were no hypocritesgod forbid  they were good men and true to whom had been entrusted the keeping of a wild beast to be petted and praised whenever it shewed any signs of humanity or obedience  but woe to the prince however useful or virtuous in other respects who laid sacrilegious hands on the goods of the church  he might like charles martel have delivered france from the pagans on the east and from the mussulmen on the south and have saved christendom once and for all from the dominion of the crescent in that great battle on the plains of poitiers where the arab cavalry says isidore of beja broke against the immoveable line of franks like waves against a wall of ice  but if like charles martel he had dared to demand of the church taxes and contributions toward the support of his troops and the salvation both of church and commonweal then all his prowess was in vain  some monk would surely see him in a vision as st eucherius bishop of orleans saw charles martel according to the council of kiersy with cain judas and caiaphas thrust into the stygian whirlpools and acherontic combustion of the sempiternal tartarus  those words which with slight variations are a common formula of cursing appended to monastic charters against all who should infringe them remind us rather of the sixth book of virgils aeneid than of the holy scriptures and explain why dante naturally chooses that poet as a guide through his inferno  the cosmogony from which such an idea was derived was simple enough  i give of course no theological opinion on its correctness but as professor of modern history i am bound to set before you opinions which had the most enormous influence on the history of early europe  unless you keep them in mind as the fixed and absolute background of all human thought and action for more than 1000 years you will never be able to understand the doings of european men  this earth then or at least the habitable part of it was considered as most probably a flat plane  below that plane or in the centre of the earth was the realm of endless fire  it could be entered as by the welsh knight who went down into st patricks purgatory by certain caves  by listening at the craters of volcanoes which were its mouths the cries of the tortured might be heard in the depths of the earth  in that tartarus every human being born into the world was doomed to be endlessly burnt alive only in the church extra quam nulla salus was there escape from the common doom  but to that doom excommunication which thrust a man from the pale of the church condemned the sinner afresh with curses the most explicit and most horrible  the superior clergy therefore with whom the anathematizing power lay believed firmly that they could proprio motu upon due cause shewn cause any man or woman to be burned alive through endless ages  and what was more the teutonic laity with that intense awe of the unseen which they had brought with them out of the wilderness believed it likewise and trembled  it paralysed the wisest as well as the fiercest that belief  instead of disgusting the kings of the earth it gave them over bound hand and foot by their own guilty consciences into the dominion of the clergy and the belief that charles martel was damned only knit as m sismondi well remarks his descendants the carlovingians more closely to the church which possest so terrible a weapon  whether they were right or wrong in these beliefs is a question not to be discussed in this chair  my duty is only to point out to you the universal existence of those beliefs and the historic fact that they gave the clergy a character supernatural magical divine with a reserve of power before which all trembled from the beggar to the king and also that all struggles between the temporal and spiritual powers like that between henry and becket can only be seen justly in the light of the practical meaning of that excommunication which becket so freely employed  i must also point out to you that so enormous a power too great for the shoulders of mortal man was certain to be and actually was fearfully abused not only by its direct exercise but also by bargaining with men through indulgences and otherwise for the remission of that punishment which the clergy could if they would inflict and worst of all that out of the whole theory sprang up that system of persecution in which the worst cruelties of heathen rome were imitated by christian priests on the seemingly irrefragable ground that it was merciful to offenders to save them or if not at least to save others through them by making them feel for a few hours in this world what they would feel for endless ages in the next     lecture ixthe monk a civilizer   historians are often blamed for writing as if the history of kings and princes were the whole history of the world  why do you tell us is said of nothing but the marriages successions wars characters of a few royal races  we want to know what the people and not the princes were like  history ought to be the history of the masses and not of kings  the only answer to this complaint seems to be that the defect is unavoidable  the history of the masses cannot be written while they have no history and none will they have as long as they remain a mass ere their history begins individuals few at first and more and more numerous as they progress must rise out of the mass and become persons with fixed ideas determination conscience more or less different from their fellows and thereby leavening and elevating their fellows that they too may become persons and men indeed  then they will begin to have a common history issuing out of each mans struggle to assert his own personality and his own convictions  till that point is reached the history of the masses will be mere statistic concerning their physical wellbeing or illbeing which for the early ages of our race is unwritten and therefore undiscoverable  the early history of the teutonic race therefore is and must always remain simply the history of a few great figures  of the many of the masses nothing is said because there was nothing to say  they all ate drank married tilled fought and died not altogether brutally we will hope but still in a dull monotony unbroken by any struggle of principles or ideas  we know that large masses of human beings have so lived in every age and are living so nowthe tartar hordes for instance or the thriving negroes of central africa comfortable folk getting a tolerable living son after father for many generations but certainly not developed enough or afflicted enough to have any history  i believe that the masses during the early middle age were very well off quite as well off as they deserved that is earned for themselves they lived in a rough way certainly but roughness is not discomfort where the taste has not been educated  a red indian sleeps as well in a wigwam as we in a spring bed and the irish babies thrive as well among the peat ashes as on a brussels carpet  man is a very well constructed being and can live and multiply anywhere provided he can keep warm and get pure water and enough to eat  indeed our teutonic fathers must have been comfortably off or they could not have multiplied as they did  even though their numbers may have been overstated the fact is patent that howsoever they were slaughtered down by the romans or by each other they rose again as out of the soil more numerous than ever  again and again you read of a tribe being all but exterminated by the romans and in a few years find it bursting over the pfalzgrab or the danube more numerous and terrible than before  never believe that a people deprest by cold illfeeding and illtraining could have conquered europe in the face of centuries of destructive war  those very wars again may have helped in the long run the increase of population and for a reason simple enough though often overlooked  war throws land out of cultivation and when peace returns the new settlers find the land fallow and more or less restored to its original fertility and so begins a period of rapid and prosperous increase  in no other way can i explain the rate at which nations after the most desolating wars spring up young and strong again like the phoenix from their own funeral pile  they begin afresh as the tillers of a virgin soil fattened too often with the ashes of burnt homesteads and the blood of the slain  another element of comfort may have been the fact that in the rough education of the forest only the strong and healthy children lived while the weakly died off young and so the labourmarket as we should say now was never overstocked  this is the case with our own gipsies and with many savage tribesthe red indians for instanceand accounts for their general healthiness the unhealthy being all dead in the first struggle for existence  but then these gipsies and the red indians do not increase in numbers but the contrary while our forefathers increased rapidly  on the other hand we have at least throughout the middle ages accounts of such swarms of cripples lepers deformed and other incapable persons as to make some men believe that there were more of them in proportion to the population than there are now  and it may have been so  the strongest and healthiest men always going off to be killed in war the weakliest only would be left at home to breed and so an unhealthy population might spring up  and againand this is a curious factas law and order enter a country so will the proportion of incapables in body and mind increase  in times of war and anarchy when every one is shifting for himself only the strongest and shrewdest can stand  woe to those who cannot take care of themselves  the fools and cowards the weakly and sickly are killed starved neglected or in other ways brought to grief  but when law and order come they protect those who cannot protect themselves and the fools and cowards the weakly and sickly are supported at the public expense and allowed to increase and multiply as public burdens  i do not say that this is wrong heaven forbid  i only state the fact  a government is quite right in defending all alike from the brute competition of nature whose motto iswoe to the weak  to the church of the middle age is due the preaching and the practice of the great christian doctrine that society is bound to protect the weak  so far the middle age saw but no further for our own times has been reserved the higher and deeper doctrine that it is the duty of society to make the weak strong to reform to cure and above all to prevent by education by sanitary science by all and every means the necessity of reforming and of curing  science could not do that in the middle age  but if science could not do it religion would at least try to do the next best thing to it  the monasteries were the refuges whither the weak escaped from the competition of the strong  thither flocked the poor the crippled the orphan and the widow all in fact who could not fight for themselves there they found something like justice order pity help  even the fool and the coward when they went to the conventdoor were not turned away  the poor halfwitted rascal who had not sense enough to serve the king might still serve the abbot  he would be set to drive plough or hew woodpossibly by the side of a gentleman a nobleman or even a princeand live under equal law with them and under too a discipline more strict than that of any modern army and if he would not hew the wood or drive the bullocks as he ought then the abbot would have him flogged soundly till he did which was better for him after all than wandering about to be hooted by the boys and dying in a ditch at last  the coward toothe abbot could make him of use even though the king could not  there were no doubt in those days though fewer in number than now men who could not face physical danger and the storm of the evil worlddelicate nervous imaginative feminine characters who when sent out to battle would be very likely to run away  our forefathers having no use for such persons used to put such into a bog hole and lay a hurdle over them in the belief that they would sink to the lowest pool of hela for ever more  but the abbot had great use for such  they could learn to read write sing think they were often very clever they might make great scholars at all events they might make saints  whatever they could not do they could pray  and the united prayer of those monks it was then believed could take heaven by storm alter the course of the elements overcome divine justice avert from mankind the anger of an offended god  whether that belief were right or wrong people held it and the man who could not fight with carnal weapons regained his selfrespect and therefore his virtue when he found himself fighting as he held with spiritual weapons against all the powers of darkness 214  the first light in which i wish you to look at the old monasteries is as defences for the weak against the strong  but what has this to do with what i said at first as to the masses having no history  thisthat through these monasteries the masses began first to have a history because through them they ceased to be masses and became first persons and men and then gradually a people that last the monasteries could not make them but they educated them for becoming a people and in this way  they brought out in each man the sense of individual responsibility  they taught him whether warrior or cripple prince or beggar that he had an immortal soul for which each must give like account to god  do you not see the effect of that new thought  treated as slaves as things and animals the many had learnt to consider themselves as things and animals  and so they had become a mass that is a mere heap of inorganic units each of which has no spring of life in itself as distinguished from a whole a people which has one bond uniting each to all  the masses of the french had fallen into that state before the revolution of 1793  the masses of our agricultural labourersthe masses of our manufacturing workmen were fast falling into that state in the days of our grandfathers  whether the french masses have risen out of it remains to be seen  the english masses thanks to almighty god have risen out of it and by the very same factor by which the middleage masses roseby religion  the great methodist movement of the last century did for our masses what the monks did for our forefathers in the middle age  wesley and whitfield and many another noble soul said to nailsea colliers cornish miners and all manner of drunken brutalized fellows living like the beasts that perisheach of youthouand thouand thoustand apart and alone before god  each has an immortal soul in him which will be happy or miserable for ever according to the deeds done in the body  a whole eternity of shame or of glory lies in youand you are living like a beast  and in proportion as each man heard that word and took it home to himself he became a new man and a true man  the preachers may have mixed up words with their message with which we may disagree have appealed to low hopes and fears which we should be ashamed to bring into our calculationsso did the monks but they got their work done somehow and let us thank them and the old methodists and any man who will tell men in whatever clumsy and rough fashion that they are not things and pieces of a mass but persons with an everlasting duty an everlasting right and wrong an everlasting god in whose presence they stand and who will judge them according to their works  true that is not all that men need to learn after they are taught each apart that he is a man they must be taught how to be an united people but the individual teaching must come first and before we hastily blame the individualizing tendencies of the old evangelical movement or that of the middleage monks let us remember that if they had not laid the foundation others could not build thereon  besides they built themselves as well as they could on their own foundation  as soon as men begin to be really men the desire of corporate life springs up in them  they must unite they must organize themselves  if they possess duties they must be duties to their fellow men if they possess virtues and graces they must mix with their fellow men in order to exercise them  the solitaries of the thebaid found that they became selfish wild beasts or went mad if they remained alone and they formed themselves into lauras lanes of huts convents under a common abbot or father  the evangelical converts of the last century formed themselves into powerful and highly organized sects  the middleage monasteries organized themselves into highly artificial communities round some sacred spot generally under the supposed protection of some saint or martyr whose bones lay there  each method was good though not the highest  none of them rises to the idea of a people having one national life under one monarch the representative to each and all of that national life and the dispenser and executor of its laws  indeed the artificial organization whether monastic or sectarian may become so strong as to interfere with national life and make men forget their real duty to their king and country in their selfimposed duty to the sect or order to which they belong  the monastic organization indeed had to die in many countries in order that national life might develop itself and the dissolution of the monasteries marks the birth of an united and powerful england  they or britain must have died  an imperium in imperiomuch more many separate imperiawas an element of national weakness which might be allowed in times of peace and safety but not in times of convulsion and of danger  you may ask however how these monasteries became so powerful if they were merely refuges for the weak  even if they were and they were the homes of an equal justice and order mercy and beneficence which had few or no standingplaces outside their walls still how if governed by weak men could they survive in the great battle of life  the sheep would have but a poor life of it if they set up hurdles against the wolves and agreed at all events not to eat each other  the answer is that the monasteries were not altogether tenanted by incapables  the same causes which brought the lowborn into the monasteries brought the highborn many of the very highest  the same cause which brought the weak into the monasteries brought the strong many of the very strongest  the middleage records give us a long list of kings princes nobles who having done as they held their work in the world outside went into those convents to try their hands at what seemed to them and often was better work than the perpetual coil of war intrigue and ambition which was not the crime but the necessary fate of a ruler in the middle ages tired of work and tired of life tired too of vain luxury and vain wealth they fled to the convent as to the only place where a man could get a little peace and think of god and his own soul and recollected as they worked with their own hands by the side of the lowestborn of their subjects that they had a human flesh and blood a human immortal soul like those whom they had ruled  thank god that the great have other methods now of learning that great truth that the work of life if but well done will teach it to them but those were hard times and wild times and fighting men could hardly learn save in the convent that there was a god above who watched the widows and the orphans tears and when he made inquisition for blood forgot not the cause of the poor  such men and women of rank brought into the convent meanwhile all the prestige of their rank all their superior knowledge of the world and became the patrons and protectors of the society while they submitted generally with peculiar humility and devotion to its most severe and degrading rules  their higher sensibilities instead of making them shrink from hardship made them strong to endure selfsacrifices and often selftortures which seem to us all but incredible and the lives or rather living deaths of the noble and princely penitents of the early middle age are among the most beautiful tragedies of humanity  to these monasteries too came the men of the very highest intellect of whatsoever class  i say of the very highest intellect  tolerably talented men might find it worth while to stay in the world and use their wits in struggling upward there  the most talented of all would be the very men to see a better carriere ouverte aux talens than the world could give to long for deeper and loftier meditation than could be found in the court for a more divine life a more blessed death than could be found in the camp and the battlefield  and so it befals that in the early middle age the cleverest men were generally inside the convent trying by moral influence and superior intellect to keep those outside from tearing each other to pieces  but these intellects could not remain locked up in the monasteries  the daily routine of devotion even of silent study and contemplation was not sufficient for them as it was for the average monk  there was still a reserve of force in them which must be up and doing and which in a man inspired by that spirit which is the spirit of love to man as well as to god must needs expand outwards in all directions to christianize to civilize to colonize  to colonize  when people talk loosely of founding an abbey for superstitious uses they cannot surely be aware of the state of the countries in which those abbeys were founded either primaeval forest hardlytilled common or to be described by that terrible epithet of domesdaybook wastawasted by war  a knowledge of that fact would lead them to guess that there were almost certainly uses for the abbey which had nothing to do with superstition which were as thoroughly practical as those of a company for draining the bog of allen or running a railroad through an american forest  such at least was the case at least for the first seven centuries after the fall of rome and to these missionary colonizers europe owes i verily believe among a hundred benefits this which all englishmen will appreciate that roman agriculture not only revived in the countries which were once the empire but spread from thence eastward and northward into the principal wilderness of the teuton and sclavonic races  i cannot i think shew you better what manner of men these monkcolonizers were and what sort of work they did than by giving you the biography of one of them and out of many i have chosen that of st sturmi founder whilome of the great abbey of fulda which lies on the central watershed of germany about equidistant to speak roughly from frankfort cassel gotha and coburg  his life is matter of history written by one eigils sainted like himself who was his disciple and his friend  naturally told it is and lovingly but if i recollect right without a single miracle or myth the living contemporaneous picture of such a man living in such a state of society as we shall never and happily need never see again but which is for that very reason worthy to be preserved for a token that wisdom is justified of all her children  it stands at length in pertzs admirable monumenta historica among many another like biography and if i tell it here somewhat at length readers must forgive me  every one has heard of little king pepin and many may have heard also how he was a mighty man of valour and cut off a lions head at one blow and how he was a crafty statesman and first consolidated the temporal power of the popes and helped them in that detestable crime of overthrowing the noble lombard kingdom which cost italy centuries of slavery and shame and which has to be expiated even yet it would seem by some fearful punishment  but every one may not know that pepin had great excusesif not for helping to destroy the lombardsyet still for supporting the power of the popes  it seemed to himand perhaps it wasthe only practical method of uniting the german tribes into one common people and stopping the internecine wars by which they were tearing themselves to pieces  it seemed to himand perhaps it wasthe only practical method for civilizing and christianizing the still wild tribes frisians saxons and sclaves who pressed upon the german marches from the mouth of the elbe to the very alps  be that as it may he began the work and his son charlemagne finished it somewhat well and again somewhat illas most work alas is done on earth  now in the days of little king pepin there was a nobleman of bavaria and his wife who had a son called sturmi and they brought him to st boniface that he might make him a priest  and the child loved st bonifaces noble english face and went with him willingly and was to him as a son  and who was st boniface  that is a long story  suffice it that he was a man of devon brought up in a cloister at exeter and that he had crossed over into frankenland upon the lower rhine and become a missionary of the widest and loftiest aims not merely a preacher and winner of souls though that it is said in perfection but a civilizer a colonizer a statesman  he and many another noble englishman and scot whether irish or caledonian were working under the frank kings to convert the heathens of the marches and carry the cross into the far east  they led lives of poverty and danger they were martyred half of them as st boniface was at last  but they did their work and doubtless they have their reward  they did their best according to their light  god grant that we to whom so much more light has been given may do our best likewise  under this great genius was young sturmi trained  trained as was perhaps needed for those who had to do such work in such a time to have neither wife nor child nor home nor penny in his purse but to do all that he was bid learn all that he could and work for his living with his own hands a life of bitter selfsacrifice  such a life is not needed now  possibly nevertheless it was needed then  so st boniface took sturmi about with him in his travels and at last handed him over to wigbert the priest to prepare him for the ministry under whom says his old chronicler the boy began to know the psalms thoroughly by heart to understand the holy scriptures of christ with spiritual sense took care to learn most studiously the mysteries of the four gospels and to bury in his heart by assiduous reading the treasures of the old and new testament  for his meditation was in the law of the lord day and night profound in understanding shrewd of thought prudent of speech fair of face sober of carriage honourable in morals spotless in life by sweetness humility and alacrity he drew to him the love of all  he grew to be a man and in due time he was ordained priest by the will and consent of all and he began to preach the words of christ earnestly to the people and his preaching wrought wonders among them  three years he preached in his rhineland parish winning love from all but in the third year a heavenly thought came into his mind that he would turn hermit and dwell in the wild forest  and why  who can tell he may likely enough have found celibacy a fearful temptation for a young and eloquent man and longed to flee from the sight of that which must not be his  and that in his circumstances was not a foolish wish he may have wished to escape if but once from the noise and crowd of outward things and be alone with god and christ and his own soul  and that was not a foolish wish  john bunyan so longed and found what he wanted in bedford jail and set it down and printed it in a pilgrims progress which will live as long as man is man  george fox longed for it and made himself clothes of leather which would not wear out and lived in a hollow tree till he too set down the fruit of his solitude in a diary which will live likewise as long as man is man  perhaps again young sturmi longed to try for once in a way what he was worth upon gods earth how much he could endure what power he had of helping himself what courage to live by his own wits and gods mercy on roots and fruits as wild things live  and surely that was not altogether a foolish wish  at least he longed to be a hermit but he kept his longing to himself however till st boniface his bishop appeared and then he told him all his heart  and st boniface said go in the name of god and gave him two comrades and sent him into the wilderness which is called buchonia the beech forest to find a place fit for the servants of the lord to dwell in  for the lord is able to provide his people a home in the desert  so those three went into the wild forest  and for three days they saw nought but earth and sky and mighty trees  and they went on praying christ that he would guide their feet into the way of peace  and on the third day they came to the place which is called hersfelt the harts down and searched it round and prayed that christ would bless the place for them to dwell in and then they built themselves little huts of beechbark and abode there many days serving god with holy fastings and watchings and prayers  is it not a strange story so utterly unlike anything which we see nowso utterly unlike anything which we ought to see now  and yet it may have been good in its time  it looks out on us from the dim ages like the fossil bone of some old monster cropping out of a quarry  but the old monster was good in his place and time  god made him and had need of him  it may be that god made those three poor monks and had need of them likewise  as for their purposes being superstitious we shall be better able to judge of that when we have seen what they werewhat sort of a house they meant to build to god  as for their having selfinterest in view no doubt they thought that they should benefit their own souls in this life and in the life to come  but one would hardly blame them for that surely  one would not blame them as selfish and sordid if they had gone out on a commercial speculation  why then if on a religious one  the merchant adventurer is often a noble type of man and one to whom the world owes much though his hands are not always clean nor his eye single  the monk adventurer of the middle age is perhaps a still nobler type of man and one to whom the world owes more though his eye too was not always single nor his hands clean  as for selfishness one must really bear in mind that men who walked away into that doleful urwarld had need to pray very literally that christ would guide their feet into the way of peace and must have cared as much for their wordly interests as those who march up to the cannons mouth  their lives in that forest were not worth twentyfour hours purchase and they knew it  it is an ugly thing for an unarmed man without a compass to traverse the bush of australia or new zealand where there are no wild beasts  but it was uglier still to start out under the dark roof of that primaeval wood  knights when they rode it went armed capapie like sintram through the dark valley trusting in god and their good sword  chapmen and merchants stole through it by a few tracks in great companies armed with bill and bow  peasants ventured into it a few miles to cut timber and find pannage for their swine and whispered wild legends of the ugly things thereinand sometimes too never came home  away it stretched from the fair rhineland wave after wave of oak and alder beech and pine god alone knew how far into the land of night and wonder and the infinite unknown full of elk and bison bear and wolf lynx and glutton and perhaps of worse beasts still  worse beasts certainly sturmi and his comrades would have met if they had met them in human form  for there were waifs and strays of barbarism there uglier far than any waif and stray of civilization border ruffian of the far west buccaneer of the tropic keys cimaroon of the panama forests men verbiesterte turned into the likeness of beasts wildfanger huner ogres wehrwolves strong thieves and outlaws many of them possibly mere brutal maniacs naked living in caves and coverts knowing no law but their own hunger rage and lust feeding often on human flesh and woe to the woman or child or unarmed man who fell into their ruthless clutch  orson and such like human brutes of the wilderness serve now to amuse children in fairy tales they were then ugly facts of flesh and blood  there were heathens there too in small colonies heathen saxons cruelest of all the tribes who worshipped at the irmensul and had an old bloodfeud against the franks heathen thuringer who had murdered st kilian the irishman at wurzburg heathen slaves of different tribes who had introduced into europe the custom of impaling their captives and woe to the christian priest who fell into any of their hands  to be knocked on the head before some ugly idol was the gentlest death which they were like to have  they would have called that martyrdom and the gate of eternal bliss but they were none the less brave men for going out to face it  and beside all these and worse than all these there were the terrors of the unseen world very real in those poor monks eyes though not in ours  there were nixes in the streams and kobolds in the caves and tannhauser in the dark pineglades who hated the christian man and would lure him to his death  there were fair swanmaidens and elfmaidens nay dame venus herself and herodias the dancer with all their rout of revellers who would tempt him to sin and having made him sell his soul destroy both body and soul in hell  there was satan and all the devils too plotting to stop the christian man from building the house of the lord and preaching the gospel to the heathen ready to call up storms and floods and forest fires to hurl the crag down from the cliffs or drop the rotting tree on their defenceless headsall real and terrible in those poor monks eyes as they walked on singing their psalms and reading their gospels and praying to god to save them for they could not save themselves and to guide them for they knew not like abraham whither they went and to show them the place where they should build the house of the lord and preach righteousness peace and joy in the holy spirit to the heathen round  we talk still thank heaven of heroes and understand what that great word should mean  but were not these poor monks heroes  knightserrant of god doing his work as they best knew how  we have a purer gospel than they we understand our bibles better  but if they had not done what they did where would have been now our gospel and our bible  we cannot tell  it was a wise old saw of our forefathersdo not speak ill of the bridge which carries you over  if sturmi had had a holy longing to get into the wild wood now he had a holy longing to go back and to find st boniface and tell him what a pleasant place hersfelt was and the quality of the soil and the direction of the watershed and the meadows and springs and so forth in a very practical way  and st boniface answered that the place seemed good enough but that he was afraid for them on account of the savage heathen saxons  they must go deeper into the forest and then they would be safe  so he went back to his fellowhermits and they made to themselves a canoe and went paddling up and down the fulda stream beneath the alder boughs trying the mouths of the mountainstreams and landing to survey the hills and ridgespioneers of civilization none the less because they pioneered in the name of him who made earth and heaven but they found nothing which they thought would suit the blessed st boniface save that they stayed a little at the place which is called ruohenbah the rough brook to see if it would suit but it would not so they went back to their birch huts to fast and pray once more  st boniface sent for sturmi after awhile probably to maintz to ask of his success and sturmi threw himself on his face before him and boniface raised him up and kissed him and made him sit by his sidewhich was a mighty honour for st boniface the penniless monk was at that moment one of the most powerful men of europe and he gave sturmi a good dinner of which no doubt he stood in need and bade him keep up heart and seek again for the place which god had surely prepared and would reveal in his good time  and this time sturmi probably wiser from experience determined to go alone but not on foot  so he took to him a trusty ass and as much food as he could pack on it and axe in hand rode away into the wild wood singing his psalms  and every night before he lay down to sleep he cut boughs and stuck them up for a ring fence round him and the ass to the discomfiture of the wolves which had and have still a great hankering after asses flesh  it is a quaint picture no doubt but let us respect it while we smile at it if we too be brave men  then one day he fell into a great peril  he came to the old road a roman one i presume for the teutons whether in england or elsewhere never dreamed of making roads till three hundred years ago but used the old roman ones which led out of the thuringen land to maintz  and at the ford over the fulda he met a great multitude bathing of sclavonian heathens going to the fair at maintz  and they smelt so strong the foul miscreants that sturmis donkey backed and refused to face them and sturmi himself was much of the donkeys mind for they began to mock him possibly he nearly went over the donkeys head and went about to hurt him  but says the chronicler the power of the lord held them back  then he went on right thankful at having escaped with his life up and down round and round exploring and surveyingfor what purpose we shall see hereafter  and at last he lost himself in the place which is called aihenloh the glade of oaks and at nightfall he heard the plash of water and knew not whether man or wild beast made it  and not daring to call out he tapped a treetrunk with his axe some backwoodsmans sign of those days we may presume and he was answered  and a forester came to him leading his lords horse a man from the wetterau who knew the woods far and wide and told him all that he wanted to know  and they slept side by side that night and in the morning they blest each other and each went his way  yes there were not merely kings and wars popes and councils in those old daysthere were real human beings just such as we might meet by the wayside any hour with human hearts and histories within them  and we will be thankful if but one of them now and then starts up out of the darkness of twelve hundred years like that good forester and looks at us with human eyes and goes his way again blessing and not unblest  and now sturmi knew all that he needed to know and after awhile following the counsel of the forester he came to the blessed place long ago prepared of the lord  and when he saw it he was filled with immense joy and went on exulting for he felt that by the merits and prayers of the holy bishop boniface that place had been revealed to him and he went about it and about it half the day and the more he looked on it the more he gave god thanks and those who know fulda say that sturmi had reason to give god thanks and must have had a keen eye moreover for that which man needs for wealth and prosperity in soil and water meadow and wood  so he blessed the place and signed it with the sign of the cross in token that it belonged thenceforth neither to devils nor fairies but to his rightful lord and maker and went back to his cell and thence a weary journey to st boniface to tell him of the fair place which he had found at last  and st boniface went his weary way either to paris or to aix to pepin and carloman kings of the franks and begged of them a grant of the aihenloh and all the land for four miles round and had it  and the nobles about gave up to him their rights of venison and vert and pasture and pannage of swine and sturmi and seven brethren set out thither in the year of our lord 744 in the first month april presumably in the twelfth day of the month unto the place prepared of the lord that they might do what  that they might build an abbey  yes but the question is what building an abbey meant not three hundred nor five hundred but eleven hundred years agofor centuries are long matters and men and their works change in them  and then it meant this clearing the back woods for a christian settlement an industrial colony in which every man was expected to spend his life in doing goodall and every good which he could for his fellowmen  whatever talent he had he threw into the common stock and worked as he was found fit to work at farming gardening carpentering writing doctoring teaching in the schools or preaching to the heathen round  in their common church they met to worship god but also to ask for grace and strength to do their work as christianizers and civilizers of mankind  what christianity and civilization they knew and they knew more than we are apt now to believe they taught it freely and therefore they were loved and looked up to as superior beings as modern missionaries wherever they do their work even decently well are looked up to now  so because the work could be done in that way and as far as men then or now can see in no other way pepin and carloman gave boniface the glade of oaks that they might clear the virgin forest and extend cultivation and win fresh souls to christ instead of fighting like the kings of this world for the land which was already cleared and the people who were already christian  in two months time they had cut down much of the forest and then came st boniface himself to see them and with him a great company of workmen and chose a place for a church  and st boniface went up to the hill which is yet called bishops mount that he might read his bible in peace away from kings and courts and the noise of the wicked world and his workmen felled trees innumerable and dug peat to burn lime withal and then all went back again and left the settlers to thrive and work  and thrive and work they did clearing more land building their church ploughing up their farm drawing to them more and more heathen converts more and more heathen schoolchildren and st boniface came to see them from time to time whenever he could get a holiday and spent happy days in prayer and study with his pupil and friend  and ten years after when st boniface was martyred at last by the friesland heathens and died as he had lived like an apostle of god then all the folk of maintz wanted to bring his corpse home to their town because he had been archbishop there  but he appeared in a dream to a certain deacon and said why delay ye to take me home to fulda to my rest in the wilderness which god bath prepared for me  so st boniface sleeps at fuldaunless the french republican armies dug up his bones and scattered them as they scattered holier things to the winds of heaven  and all men came to worship at his tomb after the fashion of those days  and fulda became a noble abbey with its domchurch library schools workshops farmsteads almshouses and all the appanages of such a place in the days when monks were monks indeed and sturmi became a great man and went through many troubles and slanders and conquered in them all because there was no fault found in him as in daniel of old and died in a good old age bewept by thousands who but for him would have been heathens still  and the aihenloh became rich cornland and garden and fulda an abbey borough and a principality where men lived in peace under mild rule while the feudal princes quarrelled and fought outside and a great literary centre whose old records are now precious to the diggers among the bones of bygone times and at last st sturmi and the aihenlob had so developed themselves that the latest record of the abbots of fulda which i have seen is this bearing date about 1710  the arms of the most illustrious lord and prince abbot of fulda archchancellor of the most serene empress primate of all germany and gaul and prince of the holy roman empire  developed certainly and not altogether in the right direction  for instead of the small beer which they had promised st boniface to drink to the end of the world the abbots of fulda had the best wine in germany and the best table too be that as it may to have cleared the timber off the aihenlob and planted a christian colony instead was enough to make st sturmi hope that he had not read his bible altogether in vain  surely such men as st sturmi were children of wisdom put what sense on the word you will  in a dark confused lawless cutthroat age while everything was decided by the sword they found that they could do no good to themselves or any man by throwing their swords into either scale  they would be men of peace and see what could be done so  was that not wise  so they set to work  they feared god exceedingly and walked with god  was not that wise  they wrought righteousness and were merciful and kind while kings and nobles were murdering around them pure and temperate while other men were lustful and drunken just and equal in all their ways while other men were unjust and capricious serving god faithfully according to their light while the people round them were half or wholly heathen content to do their work well on earth and look for their reward in heaven while the kings and nobles the holders of the land were full of insane ambition every man trying to seize a scrap of ground from his neighbour as if that would make them happier  was that not wise  which was the wiser the chief killing human beings to take from them some few square miles which men had brought into cultivation already or the monk leaving the cultivated land and going out into the backwoods to clear the forest and till the virgin soil  which was the child of wisdom i ask again  and do not tell me that the old monk worked only for fanatical and superstitious ends  it is not so  i know well his fanaticism and his superstition and the depths of its ignorance and silliness but he had more in him than that  had he not he would have worked no lasting work  he was not only the pioneer of civilization but he knew that he was such  he believed that all knowledge came from god even that which taught a man to clear the forest and plant corn instead and he determined to spread such knowledge as he had wherever he could  he was a wiser man than the heathen saxons even than the christian franks around him a better scholar a better thinker better handicraftsman better farmer and he did not keep his knowledge to himself  he did not as some tell you keep the bible to himself  it is not so and those who say so in this generation ought to be ashamed of themselves  the monk knew his bible well himself and he taught it  those who learnt from him to read learnt to read their bibles  those who did not learn of course the vast majority in days when there was no printing he taught by sermons by pictures afterward by mystery and miracle plays  the bible was not forbidden to the laity till centuries afterwardsand forbidden then why  because the laity throughout europe knew too much about the bible and not too little  because the early monks had so ingrained the mind of the masses throughout christendom with bible stories bible personages the great facts and the great doctrines of our lords life that the masses knew too much that they could contrast too easily and too freely the fallen and profligate monks of the 15th and 16th centuries with those bible examples which the old monks of centuries before had taught their forefathers  then the clergy tried to keep from the laity because it testified against themselves the very book which centuries before they had taught them to love and know too well  in a word the old monk missionary taught all he knew to all who would learn just as our best modern missionaries do and was loved and obeyed and looked on as a superior being as they are  of course he did not know how far civilization would extend  he could not foretell railroads and electric telegraphs any more than he could political economy or sanitary science  but the best that he knew he taughtand did also working with his own hands  he was faithful in a few things and god made him ruler over many things  for out of those monasteries sprangwhat did not spring  they restored again and again sound law and just government when the good old teutonic laws and the roman law also was trampled underfoot amid the lawless strife of ambition and fury  under their shadow sprang up the towns with their corporate rights their middle classes their artizan classes  they were the physicians the almsgivers the relieving officers the schoolmasters of the middleage world  they first taught us the great principle of the division of labour to which we owe at this moment that england is what she is instead of being covered with a horde of peasants each making and producing everything for himself and starving each upon his rood of ground  they transcribed or composed all the books of the then world many of them spent their lives in doing nothing but writing and the number of books even of those to be found in single monasteries considering the tedious labour of copying is altogether astonishing  they preserved to us the treasures of classical antiquity they discovered for us the germs of all our modern inventions  they brought in from abroad arts and new knowledge and while they taught men to know that they had a common humanity a common father in heaven taught them also to profit by each others wisdom instead of remaining in isolated ignorance  they too were the great witnesses against feudal caste  with them was neither highborn nor lowborn rich nor poor worth was their only test the meanest serf entering there might become the lord of knights and vassals the counsellor of kings and princes  men may talk of democracythose old monasteries were the most democratic institutions the world had ever till then seen  a mans a man for a that was not only talked of in them but carried out in practiceonly not in anarchy and as a cloak for licentiousness but under those safeguards of strict discipline and almost military order without which men may call themselves free and yet be really only slaves to their own passions  yes paradoxical as it may seem in those monasteries was preserved the sacred fire of modern liberty through those feudal centuries when all the outside world was doing its best to trample it out  remember as a single instance that in the abbots lodging at bury st edmunds the magna charta was drawn out before being presented to john at runymede  i know what they became afterwards better than most do here too well to defile my lips or your ears with tales too true they had done their work and they went  like all things born in time they died and decayed in time and the old order changed giving place to the new and god fulfilled himself in many ways  but in them too he fulfilled himself  they were the best things the world had seen the only method of christianizing and civilizing semibarbarous europe  like all human plans and conceptions they contained in themselves original sin idolatry celibacy inhuman fanaticism these were their three roots of bitterness and when they bore the natural fruit of immorality the monasteries fell with a great and just destruction  but had not those monasteries been good at first and noble at first had not the men in them been better and more useful men than the men outside do you think they would have endured for centuries  they would not even have established themselves at all  they would soon in those stormy times have been swept off the face of the earth  ill used they often were plundered and burnt down  but men found that they were good  their own plunderers found that they could not do without them and repented and humbled themselves and built them up again to be centres of justice and mercy and peace amid the wild weltering sea of war and misery  for all things endure even for a generation only by virtue of the good which is in them  by the spirit of god in them they live as do all created things and when he taketh away their breath they die and return again to their dust  and what was the original sin of them  we can hardly say that it was their superstitious and partially false creed because that they held in common with all europe  it was rather that they had identified themselves with and tried to realize on earth one of the worst falsehoods of that creedcelibacy  not being founded on the true and only ground of all society family life they were merely artificial and selfwilled arrangements of mans invention which could not develop to any higher form  and when the sanctity of marriage was revindicated at the reformation the monasteries having identified themselves with celibacy naturally fell  they could not partake in the reformation movement and rise with it into some higher form of life as the laity outside did  i say they were altogether artificial things  the abbot might be called the abba father of his monks but he was not their fatherjust as when young ladies now play at being nuns they call their superior mother but all the calling in the world will not make that sacred name a fact and a reality as they too often find out  and celibacy brought serious evils from the first  it induced an excited hysterical tone of mind which is most remarkable in the best men violent querulous suspicious irritable credulous visionary at best more womanly than manly alternately in tears and in raptures  you never get in their writings anything of that manly calmness which we so deservedly honour and at which we all aim for ourselves  they are bombastic excited perpetually mistaking virulence for strength putting us in mind for ever of the allocutions of the popes  read the writings of one of the best of monks and of men who ever lived the great st bernard and you will be painfully struck by this hysterical element  the fact is that their rule of life from the earliest to the latestfrom that of st benedict of casino father of all monks to that of loyola the jesuit was pitched not too low but too high  it was an ideal which for good or for evil could only be carried out by new converts by people in a state of high religious excitement and therefore the history of the monastic orders is just that of the protestant sects  we hear of continual fallings off from their first purity of continual excitements revivals and startings of new orders which hoped to realize the perfection which the old orders could not  you must bear this in mind as you read mediaeval history  you will be puzzled to know why continual new rules and new orders sprung up  they were so many revivals so many purist attempts at new sects  you will see this very clearly in the three great revivals which exercised such enormous influence on the history of the 13th the 16th and the 17th centuriesi mean the rise first of the franciscans and dominicans next of the jesuits and lastly of the port royalists  they each professed to restore monachism to what it had been at first to realize the unnatural and impossible ideal  another serious fault of these monasteries may be traced to their artificial celibate system  i mean their avarice  only one generation after st sturmi charlemagne had to make indignant laws against abbots who tried to get into their hands the property of everybody around them but in vain  the abbots became more and more the great landholders till their power was intolerable  the reasons are simple enough  an abbey had no children between whom to divide its wealth and therefore more land was always flowing in and concentrating and never breaking up again while almost every abbot left his personalities all his private savings and purchases to his successor  then again in an unhappy hour they discovered that the easiest way of getting rich was by persuading sinners and weak persons to secure the safety of their souls by leaving land to the church in return for the prayers and masses of monks and that shameful mine of wealth was worked by them for centuries in spite of statutes of mortmain and other checks which the civil power laid on them very often by most detestable means one is shocked to find good men lending themselves to such base tricks but we must recollect that there has always been among men a public and a private conscience and that these two alas have generally been very different  it is an old saying that committees have no consciences and it is too true  a body of men acting in concert for a public purpose will do things which they would shrink from with disgust if the same trick would merely put money into their private purses and this is too often the case when the public object is a good one  then the end seems to sanctify the means to almost any amount of chicanery  so it was with those old monks  an abbey had no conscience  an order of monks had no conscience  a benedictine a dominican a franciscan who had not himself a penny in the world and never intended to have one would play tricks lie cheat slander forge for the honour and the wealth of his order when for himself and in himself he may have been an honest godfearing man enough  so it was one more ugly fruit of an unnatural attempt to be not good men but something more than men by trying to be more than men they ended by being less than men  that was their sin and that sin when it had conceived brought forth death     lecture xthe lombard laws   i have tried to shew you how the teutonic nations were christianized  i have tried to explain to you why the clergy who converted them were nevertheless more or less permanently antagonistic to them  i shall have hereafter to tell you something of one of the most famous instances of that antagonism of the destruction of the liberties of the lombards by that latin clergy  but at first you ought to know something of the manners of these lombards and that you may learn best by studying their code  they are valuable to you as giving you a fair specimen of the laws of an old teutonic people  you may profitably compare them with the old gothic francosalic burgundian anglosaxon and scandinavian laws all formed on the same primaeval model agreeing often in minute details and betokening one primaeval origin of awful antiquity  by studying them moreover you may gain some notion of that primaeval liberty and self government common at first to all the race but preserved alone by englandto which the descendants of these very lombards are at this very moment so manfully working their way back  these laws were collected and published in writing by king rothar ad 643 76 years after alboin came into italy  the cause he says was the continual wearying of the poor and the superfluous exactions and even violence of the strong against those who were weak  they are the laws of our fathers as far as we have learnt them from ancient men and are published with the counsel and consent of our princes judges and all our most prosperous army ie the barons or freemen capable of bearing arms and are confirmed according to the custom of our nation by garathinx that is as far as i can ascertain from grimms german law by giving an earnest garant or warrant of the bargain  among these lombards as among our english forefathers when a man thingavit ie donavit a gift or bequest to any one it was necessary according to law clxxii to do it before gisiles witnesses and to give a garathinx or earnest of his bequesta halm of straw a turf a cup of drink a piece of moneyas to this day a drover seals his bargain with a shilling and a commercial traveller with a glass of liquor whether rothar gave the garathinx to his barons or his barons to him i do not understand but at least it is clear from the use of this one word that the publication of these laws was a social contracta distinct compact between king and people  from all which you will perceive at once that these lombards like all teutons were a free people under a rough kind of constitutional monarchy  they would have greeted with laughter the modern fable of the divine right of kings if by that they were expected to understand that the will of the king was law or that the eldest son of a certain family had any godgiven ipsofacto right to succeed his father  sixteen kings says the preface had reigned from agilmund to rothar and seven times had the royal race been changed  that the king should belong to one of the families who derived their pedigree from wodin and that a son should as natural succeed his father were old rules but the barons would as all history shews make little of crowning a younger son instead of an elder if the younger were a hero and the elder an argaa lazy loon and little also would they make of setting aside the whole royal family and crowning the man who would do their business best  the king was as this preface and these laws shew the commander in chief of the exercitus the militia and therefore of every free man in the state for all were bound to fight when required  he was also the supreme judge the head of the executive dispenser and fountain of law but with no more power of making the law of breaking the law or of arbitrarily depriving a man of his property than an english sovereign has now and his power was quamdiu se bene gesserit and no longer as history proves in every page  the doctrine of the divine right of kings as understood in england in the seventeenth century and still in some continental countries was as far as i can ascertain invented by the early popes not for the purpose of exalting the kings but of enslaving them and through them the nations a king and his sons sons had divine right to govern wrong not from god but from the vicar of god and the successor of st peter to whom god had given the dominion of the whole earth and who had the right to anoint or to depose whomsoever he would  even in these old laws we see that new idea obtruding itself  the kings heart says one of them is in the hand of god  that is a text of scripture  what it was meant to mean one cannot doubt or by whom it was inserted  the chancellor or whoever else transcribed those laws in latin was of course a cleric priest or monk  from his hand comes the first hint of arbitrary power the first small blot of a long dark stain of absolutism which was to darken and deepen through centuries of tyranny and shame  but to plead the divine right of kings in a country which has thrown off its allegiance to the pope is to assert the conclusion of a syllogism the major and minor premiss of which are both denied by the assertor  the arguments for such a right drawn from the old testament which were common among the highchurch party from james i to james ii and the nonjurors are really too inconsequent to require more than a passing smile  how can you prove that a king has the power to make laws from the history of the jewish nation when that very history represents it all through as bound by a primaeval and divinely revealed law to which kings and people were alike subject  how can you prove that the eldest sons eldest son has a divine right to wear the crown as gods anointed when the very persons to whom that title is given are generally either not eldest sons or not of royal race at all  the rule that the eldest sons eldest son should succeed has been proved by experience to be in practice a most excellent one but it rests as in england so in lombardy or spain or frankreich of old time simply upon the consent of the barons and the will of the thing or parliament  there is a sentimental admiration of imperialism growing up nowadays under the pretentious titles of heroworship and strong government and the british constitution is represented as a clumsy and artificial arrangement of the year 1688  1688 after christ  1688 before christ would be nearer the mark  it is as old in its essentials as the time when not only all the teutons formed one tribe but when teutons and scandinavians were still unitedand when that was who dare say  we at least brought the british constitution with us out of the bogs and moors of jutland along with our smockfrocks and leather gaiters brown bills and stone axes and it has done us good service and will do till we have carried it right round the world  as for these lombard kings they arose on this wise  after alboins death the lombards were for ten years under dukes and evil times came every man doing what was right in his own eyes enlarging their frontier by killing the roman landholders and making the survivors give them up a portion of their lands as odoacer first and the ostrogoths next had done  at last tired of lawlessness dissension and weakness and seemingly dreading an invasion from childebert king of the franks they chose a king autharis the son of cleph and called him flavius by which roman title the lombard kings were afterwards known  moreover they agreed to give him i conclude only once for all the half of all their substance to support the kingdom  there were certain tributes afterwards paid into the kings treasury every three years and certain fines and also certain portions of the property of those who died without direct heirs seem to have made up the revenue  whereon paul says perfect peace and justice followed  now for the laws which were reduced into writing about sixty years afterwards  the first thing that you will remark about these laws is that duel wager of battle under shield diremptio causae per pugnam sub uno scuto is the earliest form of settling a lawsuit  if you cannot agree fight it out fairly either by yourself or per campionem a champion or kemper man and god defend the right  then follows faida bloodfeud from generation to generation  to stop which a man is allowed to purge himself by oath his own and that of certain neighbours twelve in general who will swear their belief in his innocence  this was common to the northern nations and was the origin of our trial by jury  if guilty the offender has to pay the weregeld or legal price set upon the injury he has inflicted  when the composition is paid there is an end of the feud if after taking the composition the plaintiff avenges himself he has to pay it back  hence our system of fines  this method of composition by fines runs through all the teutonic laws and makes the punishment of death at least among freemen very rare  punishments by stripes by imprisonment or by cruel or degrading methods there are none  the person of a freeman is sacred vincire et verberare nefas as tacitus said of these germans 600 years before  the offences absolutely punishable by death seem to be treason against the kings life cowardice in battle concealment of robbers mutinies and attempts to escape out of the realm and therefore under the then military organization to escape from the duty of every freeman to bear arms in defence of the land  more than a hundred of these laws define the different fines or weregelds by which each offence is to be compounded for from 900 solidi aurei gold pieces for a murder downwards to the smallest breach of the peace  each limb has its special price  for the loss of an eye half the price of the whole man is to be paid  a front tooth is worth 16s solidi aurei their loss being a disfigurement but a back tooth is worth only 8s  a slaves tooth on the other hand is worth but 4s and in every case the weregeld of a slave is much less than that of a freeman  the sacredness of the household and the strong sense of the individual rights of property are to be remarked  one found in a court courtledge or homestead by night as we say in old english may be killed  you know i dare say that in many teutonic and scandinavian nations the principle that a mans house is his castle was so strongly held that men were not allowed to enter a condemned mans house to carry him off to execution but if he would not come out could only burn the house over his head  shooting or throwing a lance into any mans homestead costs 20s  oberos or curtis ruptura that is making violent entry into a mans homestead costs 20s also  nay merely to fetch your own goods out of another mans house secretly and without asking leave was likewise punished as oberos  so of personal honour  schelte or insult for instance to call a man arga ie a lazy loon is a serious offence  if the defendant will confess that he said it in a passion and will take oath that he never knew the plaintiff to be arga he must still pay 12s but if he will stand to his word then he must fight it out by duel sub uno scuto  the person for the same reason was sacred  if a man had lain in wait for a freeman cum virtute et solatio with valour and comfort ie with armed men to back him and had found him standing or walking simply and had shamefully held him or battiderit committed assault and battery on him he must pay half the mans weregeld the turpiter et ridiculum being considered for a freeman as half as bad as death  here you find in private life as well as in public the vincire et verberare nefas  if again one had a mind to lose 80 shillings of gold he need but to commit the offence of meerworphin a word which will puzzle you somewhat till you find it to signify mare warping to warp or throw ones neighbour off his mare or horse  a blow with the closed fist again costs three shillings but one with the open hand six  the latter is an insult as well as an injury  a freeman is struck with the fist but a slave with the palm of the hand breaking a mans head costs six solidi  but if one had broken his skull then as in the alemannic laws one must pay twelve shillings and twelve more for each fracture up to threeafter which they are not counted  but a piece of bone must come out which will make a sound when thrown into a shield twelve feet off which feet are to be measured by that of a man of middle stature  from which strange law may be deduced not only the toughness of the lombard brainpan but the extreme necessity of defining each particular in order to prevent subsequent disputes followed up by a bloodfeud which might be handed down from father to son  for by accepting the legal fine the injured man expressly renounced his primaeval right of feud  then follow some curious laws in favour of the masters of como magistri comacenes who seem to have been a guild of architects perhaps the original germ of the great society of freemasonsbelonging no doubt to the roman populationwho were settled about the lake of como and were hired on contract as the laws themselves express to build for the lombards who of course had no skill to make anything beyond a skin tent or a loghall  then follow laws against incendiaries a fine for damage by accidental housefire if the offender have carried fire more than nine feet from the hearth a law against leaving a fire alight on a journey as in the australian colonies now  then laws to protect mills important matters in those days being unknown to the lombards before their entrance into italy  then laws of inheritance on which i shall remark that natural sons if free are to have a portion of their fathers inheritance but less than the legitimate sons but that a natural son born of a slave remains a slave nisi pater liberum thingaverit  this cruel law was the law of rome and of the church our anglosaxon forefathers to their honour held the reverse rule  semper a patre non a matre generationis ordo texitur  next it is to be remarked that no free woman can live in lombardy or i believe in any teutonic state save under the mundium of some one  you should understand this word mund  among most of the teutonic races women slaves and youths at least not of age to carry arms were under the mund of some one  of course primarily the father head of the family and if he died an uncle elder brother c  the married woman was of course under the mund of her husband  he was answerable for the good conduct of all under his mund he had to pay their fines if they offended and he was bound on the other hand to protect them by all lawful means  this system still lingers in the legal status of women in england for good and evil the husband is more or less answerable for the wifes debts the wife till lately was unable to gain property apart from her husbands control the wife is supposed in certain cases of law to act under the husbands compulsion  all these and many others are relics of the old system of mund for women and that system has i verily believe succeeded  it has called out as no other system could have done chivalry in the man  it has made him feel it a duty and an honour to protect the physically weaker sex  it has made the woman feel that her influence whether in the state or in the family is to be not physical and legal but moral and spiritual and that it therefore rests on a ground really nobler and deeper than that of the man  the modern experiments for emancipating women from all mund and placing them on a physical and legal equality with the man may be right and may be ultimately successful  we must not hastily prejudge them  but of this we may be almost certain that if they succeed they will cause a wide spread revolution in society of which the patent danger will be the destruction of the feeling of chivalry and the consequent brutalization of the male sex  then follow laws relating to marriage and women of which i may remark that as in tacitus time the woman brings her dowry or fader fee to her husband and that the morning after the wedding she receives from him if he be content with her her morgen gap or morning gift which remains her own private property unless she misbehaves  the honour of women whether in fact or merely in fame is protected by many severe laws among which i shall only notice that the calling a free woman striga witch is severely punishable  if any one does so who has the mund of her except her father or brother he loses his mund  on the whole womans condition seems inferior to mans on some points but superior on others  eg a womans weregeldthe price of her lifeis 1200 solidi while the mans is only 900  for he can defend himself but she cannot  on the other hand if a man kill his wife he pays only the 1200 solidi and loses her dowry but if she kill him she dies  again  if a free man be caught thieving up to the amount of 20 siliquae beans ie one gold piecethough pope gregory makes the solidus aureus 24 siliquaehe replaces the theft and pays 80 solidi or dies and a slave one half or dies  but if a free woman is taken in theft she only replaces it for she has suffered for her wrongdoing and must lay it to her own shame that she has tried to do operam indecentem a foul deed  and if an aldia or slavewoman steals her master replaces the theft and pays 40 solidi minus the value of the stolen goodsand beats her afterwards i presume if he chooses  and now concerning slaves who seem to have been divided into three classes  the aldius and aldia masculine and feminine who were of a higher rank than other slaves  the aldius could marry a free woman while the slave marrying a free woman is punishable by death and as experimentum crucis if an aldius married an aldia or a free woman the children followed the father  if he married a slave the children followed the mother and became slaves of his lord  the aldius again may not sell his lords land or slaves which indicates that he held land and slaves under his lord  what the word means grimm does not seem to know  he thinks it synonymous with litus of whom we hear as early as tacitus time as one of the four classes nobles freemen liti slaves and therefore libertus a freedman  but the word does not merely mean it appears a slave half freed by his master but one rather hereditarily half free and holding a farm under his lord  dio however is said to be an old german word for a slave and it is possible that aldius a word only known seemingly in lombardy may have signified originally an old slave an old roman colonus or peasant of some sort found by the conquerors in possession of land and allowed to retain and till it from father to son  we in england had the same distinction between laet or villains settled on the land glebae adscripti and mere thralls or theows slaves pure and simple  no doubt such would have better terms than the mere mancipiaslaves taken in war or boughtfor the simple reason that they would be agriculturists practised in the roman tillage understanding the mysteries of irrigation artificial grasses and rotation of crops as well as the culture of vines fruit and olives  next to them you have different sorts of slaves servus massarius who seems to be also rusticanus one who takes care of his lords massa or farm and is allowed a peculium it seems some animals of his own which he may not sell though he may give them away  and again servus doctus an educated household slave whose weregeld is higher than that of others  the laws relating to fugitive slaves seem as merciful as such things can be and the lombards have always had the credit of being kind and easy masters  connected with fugitive slaves are laws about portunarii ferrymen who appear as you know in the old ballads as very important and generally formidable men  the fight between von troneg hagen and the old ferryman in the nibelungen lied is a famous instance of the ancient ferrymens prowess  one can easily understand how necessary strict laws were to prevent these ferrymen carrying over fugitive slaves outlaws and indeed any one without due caution for each man was bound to remain in his own province that he might be ready when called on for military service and a traveller to foreign parts was looked on as a deserter from his liege lord and country  then follow a great number of laws to me both amusing and instructive as giving us some glimpse of the country life of those lombards in the 8th century  scattered in the vast woodlands and marshes lie small farms enclosed by ditches and posts and rails from which if you steal a rail you are fined 1s if you steal a post 3s  there were stake fences which you must be careful in making for if a horse stakes himself by leaping in you pay nothing but if he does so by leaping out you pay the price of the horse  moreover you must leave no sharp stakes standing out of the hedge for if a man or beast wounds himself thereby in passing you have to pay full weregeld  walking over sown land or sending a woman of your mundium to do so in accordance with an ancient superstition is a severe offence so is injuring a vineyard or taking more than tres uvae bunches of grapes i presume from the vine  injuring landmarks cut on the trees theclaturas and signaturas or any other boundary mark is severely punishable either in a slave or in a freeman  in the vast woods range herds of swine and in the pastures horses cared for by law for to take a herd of swine or brood mares as pledge without the kings leave is punishable by death or a fine of 900s oxen or horses used to the yoke can be taken as pledge but only by leave of the king or of the schuldhais local magistrate on proof that the debtor has no other property for by them he gets his living  if however you find pigs routing in your enclosure you may kill one under certain restrictions but not the sornpair sounder boar who battit et vincit all the other boars in the sounder old english for herd  rival swineherds as is to be supposed battidunt inter se and scandalum faciunt often enough  whereon the law advises them to fight it out and then settle the damage between them  horses are cared for  to ride another mans horse costs 2s to dock or crop him eightfold the damage and so on of hurting another mans horse  moreover if your neighbours dog flies at you you may hit him with a stick or little sword and kill him but if you throw a stone after him and kill him you being then out of danger you must give the master a new dog  then there are quaint laws about hunting and damage caused by wild beasts caught in snares or brought to bay  a wounded stag belongs to the man who has wounded it for twentyfour hours but after that to anyone tame deer it is observable are kept and to kill a doe or fawn costs 6s to kill a buck 12s  tame hawks cranes and swans if taken in snares cost 6s  but any man may take flying hawks out of his neighbours wood but not out of the gaias regis the kings gehage haies hedges or enclosed parks  and now i have but one more law to mentionwould god that it had been in force in later centuries  let no one presume to kill another mans aldia or ancilla as a striga witch which is called masca because it is not to be believed by christian minds that a woman can eat up a live man from within and if any one does so he shall pay 60s as her price and for his fault half to her master and half to the king  this last strange law forces on us a serious question one which may have been suggesting itself to you throughout my lecture  if these were the old teutonic laws this the old teutonic liberty the respect for man as man for woman as woman whence came the opposite element  how is it that these liberties have been lost throughout almost all europe  how is it that a system of law prevailed over the whole continent up to the french revolution and prevails still in too many countries the very opposite of all this  i am afraid that i must answer mainly through the influence of the roman clergy during the middle age  the original difference of race between the clergy and the teutonic conquerors which i have already pointed out to you had a curious effect which lingers to this day  it placed the church in antagonism more or less open to the civil administration of justice  the criminal was looked on by the priest rather as a sufferer to be delivered than an offender to be punished  all who are conversant with the lives of saints must recollect cases in which the saint performs even miracles on behalf of the condemned  mediaeval tales are full of instances of the same feeling which prompted the italian brigands even in our own times to carry a leaden saints image in his hat as a safeguard  in an old french fabliau for instance we read how a certain highwayrobber was always careful to address his prayers to the blessed virgin before going out to murder and steal and found the practice pay him well  for when he was taken and hanged our lady put her mains blanches under his feet and supported him invisibly for a whole day till the executioner finding it impossible to kill him was forced to let him retire peaceably into a monastery where he lived and died devoutly  we may laugh at such fancies or express if we will our abhorrence of their immorality but it will be more useful to examine into the causes which produced them they seem to have been twofold  in the first place the church did not look on the teutonic laws whether frank burgund goth or lombard as law at all  her law whether ecclesiastical or civil was formed on the roman model and by it alone she wished herself and those who were under her protection to be judged  nextand this count is altogether to her honourlaw such as it was was too often administered especially by the franks capriciously and brutally while the servile population always the great majority can hardly be said to have been under the protection of law at all  no one can read the pages of fredegarius or gregory of tours without seeing that there must have been cases weekly even daily which called on the clergy in the name of justice and humanity to deliver if possible the poor from him that spoiled him which excused fully the rise of the right of sanctuary and of benefit of clergy afterwards so much abused which made it a pious duty in prelates to work themselves into power at court and there as the chancellors of princes try to get something like regular justice done and naturally enough to remodel the laws of each nation on the timehonoured and scientific roman form  nevertheless the antagonism of the church to the national and secular law remained for centuries  it died out first perhaps in england after the signature of magna charta  for then the english prelates began to take up that truly protestant and national attitude which issued in the great reformation but it lingers still in ireland and in italy  it lingered in france up to the french revolution as may be seen notably in the account of the execution of the marquise de brinvilliers by the priest who attended her  horror at her atrocious crimes is quite swallowed up in the mind of the good father by sympathy with her suffering and the mob snatch her bones from the funeral pile and keep them as the relics of a saint  but more  while the roman clergy did real good to europe in preserving the scientific elements of roman law they did harm by preserving therewith other elementsroman chicane and roman cruelty  in that respect as in others rome conquered her conquerors and the descendants of those roman lawyers whom the honest teutons called adders and as adders killed them down destroyed in course of time teutonic freedom  but those descendants were alas the clergy  weak they began early to adopt those arms of quibbling and craft which religious men too often fancy are the proper arms of the saints against the world  holding human nature in suspicion and contempt they early gave way to the maxim of the savage that every one is likely to be guilty till proved innocent and therefore licensed the stupid brutalities of torture to extract confession  holding selfdegradation to be a virtue and independence as a carnal vice glorying in being slaves themselves till to become under the name of holy obedience perinde ac cadaver was the ideal of a good monk and accustomed themselves to degrading corporal punishment they did not shrink from inflicting even on boys and women tortures as dastardly as indecent  looking on the world and on the future of the human race through a medium compared with which the darkest fancies of a modern fanatic are bright and clear they did not shrink from inflicting penalties the very mention of which makes the blood run cold  suspecting if not alternately envying and despising all women who were not nuns writing openly of the whole sex until unsexed as the snare and curse of mankind and possessed by a manichaean belief in the power and presence of innumerable demons whose especial victims were women they erected witchhunting into a science they pandered to and actually formalized and justified on scientific grounds the most cruel and cowardly superstitions of the mob and again and again raised literal crusades against women torturing exposing burning young and old not merely in the witchmania of the 17th century but through the whole middle age  it is a detestable page of history  i ask those who may think my statement exaggerated to consult the original authorities  let them contrast rothars law about the impossibility of witchcraft with the pages of the malleus maleficarum niders fornicarium or delrio the jesuit and see for themselves who were the false teachers  and if they be told that the cruelties of the inquisition were only those in vogue according to the secular law of the day let them recollect that the formulizers of that law were none other than the celibate roman clergy  i do not deny that there was in all this a just though a terrible nemesis  what was the essential fault of these lombard lawsindeed of all the teutonic codes  thisthat there was one law for the free man another for the slave  ecclesiastical dominion was necessary to make one law for all classes even though it were a law of common slavery  as the free had done to the slave even so and far worse would the roman clergy do to them  the albigense persecutors burning sixty ladies in one day conrad of marpurg scourging his

english bishops burning in smithfield anne askew the hapless courtbeauty and her fellowcourtier mr lascelles just as if they had been essex or berkshire peasantsall these evildoers were welding the different classes of the european nations by a community of suffering into nations into the belief that free and slave had one blood one humanity one conscience one capacity of suffering and at last one capacity of rebelling and making common cause high and low alike against him who reigned in italy under the romani nominis umbram  and if our english law our english ideas of justice and mercy have retained more than most european codes the freedom the truthfulness the kindliness of the old teutonic laws we owe it to the fact that england escaped more than any other land the taint of effete roman civilization that she therefore first of the lands in the 12th century rebelled against and first of them in the 16th century threw off the ultramontane yoke  and surely it will be so in due time with the descendants of these very lombards  we have seen them in these very years arise out of the dust and shame of centuries and determine to be lombards once again  we have seen a hero arise among them of the true old teuton stamp bearing worthily the name which his forefathers brought over the alps with alboingaribald the bold in war  may they succeed in the same noble struggle as that in which we succeeded and returning not in letter but in spirit to the old laws of rothar and their free forefathers become the leading race of a free and united italy     lecture xithe popes and the lombards   our lady the mother of god even virgin maria together with us protests to you adjuring you with great obligations and admonishes and commands you and with her the thrones dominations all the heavenly angels the martyrs and confessors of christ on behalf of the roman city committed to us by the lord god and the sheep of the lord dwelling in it  defend and free it speedily from the hands of the persecuting lombards lest my body which suffered torments for christ and my home in which it rests by the command of god be contaminated by the people of the lombards who are guilty of such iniquitous perjury and are proud transgressors of the divine scripture  so will i at the day of judgment reward you with my patronage and prepare for you in the kingdom of god most shining and glorious tabernacles promising you the reward of eternal retribution and the infinite joys of paradise  run by the true and living god i exhort you run and help before the living fountain whence you were consecrated and born again shall dry up before the little spark remaining of that brilliant flame from which you knew the light be extinguished before your spiritual mother the holy church of god in which you hope to receive eternal life shall be humiliated invaded violated and defiled by the impious  but if not may your provinces in return and your possessions be invaded by people whom you know not  separate not yourselves from my roman people so you will not be aliens and separate from the kingdom of god and eternal life  for whatever you shall ask of me i will surely give you and be your patron  assist my roman people your brothers and strive more perfectly for it is written no man receiveth the crown unless he strive lawfully  i conjure you most beloved by the living god leave not this my city of rome to be any longer torn by the lombards lest your bodies and souls be torn and tormented for ever in inextinguishable and tartarian fire with the devil and his pestiferous angels and let not the sheep of the lords flock which are the roman people be dispersed any more lest the lord disperse you and cast you forth as the people of israel was dispersed  you will conclude doubtless that this curious document can be nothing but a papal allocution  its peculiar scriptural style wrongly supposed to have been invented by the puritans who merely learnt it from the old roman clergy as well as the selfconceit which fancies the fate of the whole world to depend on the prosperity of a small halfruined city in italy will be to you sufficient marks of the roman hand  but you will be somewhat mistaken  it is hardly an epistle from the successor of st peter  it professes to be an epistle from st peter himself and sent by him through the hands of pope stephen iii to pepin the king of the franks in the year 755  you will have concluded also from it that catholic christianity is in its extreme agony that the worship and name of our lord and the fountains of sacramental grace are about to be extinguished for ever and that nothing but heresy or heathendom can follow  then you will be quite mistaken  these lombards are pious catholics  builders of churches and monasteries they are taking up the relics of the roman martyrs to transfer them to the churches of milan and pavia  they have just given pope stephen the most striking proof of their awe of his person and office  but they are quarrelling with him about the boundaries of his estates for the patrimony of st peter  they consider that he and his predecessors have grossly wronged them at different times and now last of all by calling in foreign invaders and they are at the gates of rome laying waste the country and demanding a polltax as ransom  that is all  the causes which led to this quarrel must be sought far back in history the original documents in which you will find the facts will be paulus diaconus as far as king luitprands death then the life and writings of gregory the great and then baronius annals especially his quotations from anastasius life of stephen iii bearing in mind that as with the ostrogoths we have only the roman papal story that the lombards have never stated their case not even through paulus diaconus who being a clergyman prudently holds his tongue about the whole matter  but by far the best account is to be found in dean milmans latin christianity vols  i and ii  rome you must understand has become gradually the patrimony of st peter the popes are the practical kings of rome possessing in the name of the church much land round rome and many estates scattered throughout italy and even in sicily gaul africa and the eastestates probably bequeathed by pious people  they have succeeded to this jurisdiction simply by default  they rule rome because there is no one else to rule it  we find st gregory the great feeding the paupermasses of rome on the first day of every month from the fruitful cornbearing estates in sicily keeping up the panem but substituting thank heaven for the circenses at least the services of the church  of course the man who could keep the roman people alive must needs become ipso facto their monarch  the pope acknowledges of course a certain allegiance to the emperor at constantinople and therefore to his representative the exarch of ravenna that is to say he meets them with flattery when they are working on his side with wrath when they oppose him  he intrigues with them too whenever he can safely do so against the lombards  thus the pope has become during the four centuries which followed the destruction of the western empire the sole surviving representative of that empire  he is the head of the gens togata of the senatus populusque romanus  in him rome has risen again out of her grave to awe the peoples once more by the romani nominis umbra and to found a new empire not as before on physical force and the awe of visible power but on the deeper and more enduring ground of spiritual force and the awe of the invisible world  an empire i say  the popes were becoming from the 5th to the 8th centuries not merely the lords of rome but the lords of the western church  their spiritual empire to do them justice was not so much deliberately sought by them as thrust upon them  as the clergy were all over the empire the representatives of the downtrodden romans so they naturally gravitated toward the eternal city their ancient mistress  like all disciplined and organized bodies they felt the need of unity of monarchy  where could they find it save at rome  rome was still practically and in fact the fountain of their doctrine of their superior civilization and to submit themselves to the pope of rome was their only means of keeping up one faith one practice and the strength which comes from union  to seat the pope upon the throne of the caesars to attribute to him powers weightier than all which the caesars had possest    it was a magnificent idea  a politic idea too for it would cover the priesthood with all the prestige of ancient rome and enable them to face the barbarian in the name of that great people whose very memory still awed him whose baths aqueducts palaces he looked on as the work of demons whose sages and poets were to him enchanters whose very gems dug out of the ruins by night in fear and trembling possest magic influence for healing for preservation for good fortune in peace or war  politic and in their eyes true  easy enough to be believed honestly by men who already believed honestly in their own divine mission  they were the representatives of christ on earth  of that fact there could be then or can be now no doubt whatsoever  whatsoever truth light righteousness there was in the west came to it through them  and christ was the king of kings  but he delayed his coming at moments he seemed to have deserted the earth and left mankind to tear itself in pieces with wild war and misrule  but it could not be so  if christ were absent he must at least have left an authority behind him to occupy till he came a head and ruler for his opprest and distracted church  and who could that be if not the pope of rome  it ought to be soit must be sothought they  and to men in that mood proofs that it was so soon came to hand and accumulated from generation to generation till the pope at last found himself proclaiming and what was more believing that god had given the whole world to st peter and through st peter to him and that he was the only source of power law kingship who could set up and pull down whom he would as the vicegerent of god on earth  such pretensions of course grew but slowly  it was not i believe till the year 875 180 years after the time of which i am speaking that pope john viii distinctly asserted his right as representative of the ancient roman empire to create the caesar and informed the synod of pavia that he had elected and approved charles the bald with the consent of his brothers the bishops of the other ministers of the holy roman church and significant though empty words of the roman senate and people  at the time of which i speak the power was still in embryo growing through many struggles but growing surely and strongly and destined speedily to avenge the fall of rome on the simple barbarians who were tearing each other to pieces over her spoils  it is not easy to explain the lasting and hereditary hatred of the popes to the lombards  its origin is simple enough but not so its continuance  why they should be nefandissimi in the eyes of pope gregory the great one sees but why 100 years afterwards they should be still nefandissimi and non dicenda gens langobardorum not to be called a nation is puzzling  at first of course the pope could only look on them as a fresh horde of barbarous conquerors half heathen half arian  their virtuous and loyal life within the boundaries of alboins conquestsof which paulus diaconus says that violence and treachery were unknownthat no one oppressed no one plunderedthat the traveller went where he would in perfect safetyall this would be hid from the pope by the plain fact that they were continually enlarging their frontier toward rome that they had founded two halfindependent dukedoms of beneventum and spoleto that autharis had swept over south italy and ridden his horse into the sea at reggio to strike with his lance a column in the waves and cry here ends the lombard kingdom  the pope gregory the great i am speaking of could only recollect again that during the lawless interregnum before autharis coronation the independent lombard dukes had plundered churches and monasteries slain the clergy and destroyed the people who had grown up again like corn  but as years rolled on these arian lombards had become good catholics and that in the lifetime of gregory the great  theodelinda the bavarian princess she to whom autharis had gone in disguise to her fathers court and only confessed himself at his departure by rising in his stirrups and burying his battleaxe in a tree stem with the cry thus smites autharis the lombardthis theodelinda i say had married after his death agilwulf his cousin and made him king of the lombards  she was a catholic and through her gregory the great converted autharis and the lombard nation  to her he addressed those famous dialogues of his full alike of true piety and earnestness and of childish superstition  but in judging them and him we must bear in mind that these lombards became at least by his means catholics and that arians would have believed in the superstitions just as much as catholics  and it is surely better to believe a great truth plus certain mistakes which do not affect it in the least than a great lie plus the very same mistakes likewise  which is best to believe that the road to london lies through bishopstortford and that there are dogheaded men on the road or that it lies through edinburgh but that there are dogheaded men on that road too  theodelinda had built at modicaea twelve miles above milan a fair basilica to john the baptist enriched by her and the lombard kings and dukes crowns crosses golden tables adorned with emeralds hyacinths amber carbuncles and pearls gold and silver altarcloths and that admirable cup of sapphire all which remained till the eighteenth century  there too was the famous iron crown of lombardy which austria still claims as her own so called from a thin ring of iron inserted in it made from a nail of the true cross which gregory had sent agilwulf just as he sent childebert the frankish king some filings of st peters chains which however he says did not always allow their sacred selves to be filed  in return agilwulf had restored the churchproperty which he had plundered had reinstated the bishops and why did not all go well  why are these lombards still the most wicked of men  again in the beginning of the eighth century came the days of the good luitprand wise and pious a lover of peace and mighty in war merciful to offenders chaste and modest instant in prayer bountiful in alms equal to the philosophers though he knew no letters a nourisher of his people an augmenter of the laws  he it was who when he had quarrelled with pope gregory ii and marched on rome was stopped at the gates of the vatican by the pontiffs prayers and threats  and a sacred awe fell on him and humbly entering st peters he worshipped there and laid on the apostles tomb his royal arms his silver cross and crown of gold and withdrawing his army went home again in peace  but why were this great kings good deeds towards the pope and the catholic faith rewarded by what we can only call detestable intrigue and treachery  again leo the iconoclast emperor destroyed the holy images in the east and sent commands to the exarch of ravenna to destroy them in western italy  pope gregory ii replied by renouncing allegiance to the emperor of constantinople and by two famous letters which are still preserved in which he tells the iconoclast emperor that if he went round the grammarschools at rome the children would throw their hornbooks at his head    that he implored christ to send the emperor a devil for the destruction of his body and the salvation of his soul    that if he attempted to destroy the images in rome the pontiff would take refuge with the lombards and then he might as well chase the wind that the popes were the mediators of peace between east and west and that the eyes of the nations were fixed on the popes humility and adored as a god on earth the apostle st peter  and that the pious barbarians kindled into rage thirsted to avenge the persecution of the east  then luitprand took up the cause of the pope and his images and of the mob who were furious at the loss of their idols and marched on ravenna which opened her gates to him so that he became master of the whole pentapolis and imageworship to which some plainspoken people give a harsher name was saved for ever and a day in italy  why did gregory ii in return call in orso the first venetian doge to expel from ravenna the very luitprand who had fought his battles for him and to restore that exarchate of ravenna of which it was confessed that its civil quarrels misrule and extortions made it the most miserable government in italy  and why did he enter into secret negotiations with the franks to come and invade italy  again when luitprand wanted to reduce the duchies of beneventum and spoleto which he considered as rebels against him their feudal suzerain why did the next pope gregory iii again send over the alps to charles martel to come and invade italy and deliver the church and christs people from ruin  and who were these franks the ancestors of that magnificent but profligate aristocracy whose destruction our grandfathers beheld in 1793 i have purposely abstained from describing them till they appear upon the stage of italy and take part in her fortuneswhich were then the fortunes of the world  they appear first on the roman frontier in ad 241 and from that time are never at rest till they have conquered the north of gaul  they are supposed with reason not to have been a race or tribe at all but a confederation of warriors who were simply franken free free companions or free lances as they would have been called a few centuries later who recruited themselves from any and every tribe who would join them in war and plunder  if this was the case if they had thrown away as adventurers much of the old teutonic respect for law for the royal races for family life for the sacred bonds of kindred many of their peculiarities are explained  falsehood brutality lawlessness ignorance and cruelty to the conquered romans were their special sins while their special and indeed only virtue was that indomitable daring which they transmitted to their descendants for so many hundred years  the buccaneers of the young world they were insensible to all influences save that of superstition  they had become under clovis orthodox christians but their conversion to judge from the notorious facts of history worked little improvement on their morals  the pages of gregory of tours are comparable for dreary monotony of horrors only to those of johnsons history of the pyrates  but as m sismondi well remarks their very ignorance and brutality made them the more easily the tools of the roman clergy cette haute veneration pour leglise et leur severe orthodoxie dautant plus facile a conserver que ne faisant aucune etude et ne disputant jamais sur la foi ils ne connaissaient pas meme les questions controversees leur donnerent dans le clerge de puissants auxiliaires  les francs se montrerent disposes a hair les ariens a les combattres et les depouiller sans les entendre les eveques en retour ne se montrerent pas scrupuleux sur le reste des enseignements moraux de la religion ils fermerent les yeux sur les violences le meurtre le dereglement des moeurs ils autoriserent en quelque sorte publiquement la poligamie et ils precherent le droit divin des rois et le devoir le lobeissance pour les peuples 279  a painful picture of the alliance but i fear too true  the history of these franks you must read for yourselves  you will find it well told in the pages of sismondi and in mr perrys excellent book the franks  it suffices now to say that in the days of luitprand these franks after centuries of confusion and bloodshed have been united into one great nation stretching from the rhine to the loire and the sea and encroaching continually to the southward and eastward  the government has long passed out of the hands of their faineant meerwing kings into that of the semihereditary majores domus or mayors of the palace and charles martel perhaps the greatest of that race of great men has just made himself mayor of austrasia the real teutonic centre of frank life and power neustria and burgundy  he has crushed eudo the duke of romanized aquitaine and has finally delivered france and christendom from the invading saracens  on his franks and on the lombards of italy rest for the moment the destinies of europe  for meanwhile another portent has appeared this time out of the far east  another swarm of destroyers has swept over the earth  the wild arabs of the desert awakening into sudden life and civilization under the influence of a new creed have overwhelmed the whole east the whole north of africa destroying the last relics of roman and greek civilization and with them the effete and semiidolatrous christianity of the empire  all the work of narses and belisarius is undone  arab emirs rule in the old kingdom of the vandals  the new human deluge has crossed the straits into europe  the visigoths enervated by the luxurious climate of spain have recoiled before the mussulman invaders roderick the last king of the goths is wandering as an unknown penitent in expiation of his sin against the fair cava which brought down so legends and ballads tell the scourge of god upon the hapless land and the remnants of the old visigoths and sueves are crushed together into the mountain fastnesses of asturias and gallicia thence to reissue after long centuries as the noble spanish nation wrought in the forges of adversity into the likeness of tempered steel and destined to reconquer foot by foot their native land from the moslem invader  but at present the crescent was master of the cross and beyond the pyrenees all was slavery and miscreance  the arabs invading france in 732 in countless thousands had been driven back at the great fight of tours with a slaughter so great that the excited imagination of paulus diaconus sees 375000 miscreants dead upon the field while only 1500 franks had perished  but home troubles had prevented the hammer of the moors from following up his victory  the saracens had returned in force in 737 and again in 739  they still held narbonne  the danger was imminent  there was no reason why they should not attempt a third invasion  why should they not spread along the shores of the mediterranean establishing themselves there as they were already doing in sicily and menacing rome from north as well as south  to unite therefore the two great catholic teutonic powers the frank and the lombard for the defence of christendom should have been the policy of him who called himself the chief pontiff in christendom  yet the pope preferred in the face of that great danger to set the teutonic nations on destroying each other rather than to unite them against the moslem  the bribe offered to the frank was significantthe title of roman consul beside which he was to have filings of st peters chains and the key of his tomb to preserve him body and soul from all evil  charles would not come  frank though he was he was too honourable to march at a priests bidding against luitprand his old brother in arms to whom he had sent the boy pepin his son that luitprand might take him on his knee and cut his long royal hair and become his fatherinarms after the good old teuton fashion luitprand who with his lombards had helped him to save christendom a second time from the mussulman in 737 the pope one would think should have remembered that good deed of the good lombards whereof his epitaph sings           deinceps tremuere feroces    usque saraceni quos dispulit impiger ipsos    cum premerent gallos karolo poscente juvari  so charles martel took the title of patrician from the pope but sent him no armies and the quarrel went on while charles filled up the measure of his iniquity by meddling with that churchproperty in gaul which his sword had saved from the hordes of the saracens and is now as st eucherius or bishop hincmar saw in a vision writhing therefore in the lowest abyss of hell  so one generation more passes by and then pepin le bref grown to manhood is less scrupulous than his father  he is bound to the pope by gratitude  the pope has confirmed him as king allowing him to depose the royal house of the merovingians and so assumed the right of making kingsa right which future popes will not forget  meanwhile the pope has persuaded the lombard king rachis to go into a monastery  astulf seizes the crown and attacks ravenna  the pope succeeding stephen iii opposes him and he marches on rome threatening to assault it unless the citizens redeem their lives by a polltax  stephen determines to go himself to pepin to ask for help and so awful has the name and person of a pope become that he is allowed to do it allowed to pass safely and unarmed through the very land upon which he is going to let loose all the horrors of invading warfare  it is a strange and instructive figure that  the dread of the unseen the fear of spiritual power has fallen on the wild teutons on frank and on lombard alike  the pope and his clergy are to them magicians against whom neither sword nor lance avails who can heal the sick and blast the sound who can call to their aid out of the clouds that pantheon of demi gods with which under the name of saints they have peopled heaven who can let loose on them the legions of fiends who dwell in every cave every forest every ruin every cloud who can by the sentence of excommunication destroy both body and soul in hell  they were very loth to fear god these wild teutons therefore they had instead as all men have who will not fear god to fear the devil  so pope stephen goes to pepin the eldest son of the church  he promises to come with all his franks  stephens conscience seems to have been touched he tries to have no fighting only negotiation but it is too late now  astolf will hear of no terms pepin sweeps over the alps and at the gates of pavia dictates his own terms to the lombards  the old lombard spirit seems to have past away  pepin goes back again and astolf refuses to fulfil his promises  the pope sends pepin that letter from st peter himself with which this lecture commenced  astolf has marched down as we heard to the walls of rome laying the land waste cutting down the vines carrying off consecrated vessels insulting the sacrament of the altar  the lombards have violated nuns and tried to kill them the pope says though if they had really tried one cannot see why they should not have succeeded  in fact pope stephens hysterical orations to pepin must be received with extreme caution  no catholic historian of that age cares to examine the truth of a fact which makes for him nothing is too bad to say of an enemy and really the man who would forge a letter from st peter might dare to tell a few lesser falsehoods into the bargain  pepin cannot but obey so august a summons and again he is in italy and the lombards dare not resist him  he seizes not only all that astolf had taken from the pope but the pentapolis and exarchate the property if of any one of the greek emperors and bestows them on stephen the pope and the holy roman republic  the popes commissioners received the keys of the towns which were placed upon the altar of st peter and this the dotation of pepin the dotation of the exarchate was the first legal temporal sovereignty of the popesborn in sin and conceived in iniquity as you may see  the lombard rule now broke up rapidly  the lombards of spoleto yielded to the double pressure of franks and romans asked to be taken into the service of st peter and clipt their long german locks after the roman fashion  charlemagne in his final invasion had little left to do  he confirmed pepins gift and even though he hardly kept his promise enlarged it to include the whole of italy from lombardy to the frontier of naples while he himself became king of lombardy and won the iron crown  and so by french armiesnot for the last timewas the pope propt up on his illgotten throne  but the mere support of french armies was not enough to seat the pope securely upon the throne of the western caesars  documentary evidence was required to prove that they possessed rome not as the vassals of the frankish kaisers or of any barbarian teutons whatsoever but in their own right as hereditary sovereigns of rome  and the documents when needed were forthcoming  under the name of st isidore some ready scribe produced the toofamous decretals and the donation of constantine and pope adrian i saw no reason against publishing them to charlemagne and to the world  it was discovered suddenly by means of these remarkable documents that constantine the great had been healed of leprosy and afterwards baptized by pope sylvester that he had in gratitude for his cure resigned to the popes his western throne and the patrimony of st peter and the sovereignty of italy and the west and that this was the true reason of his having founded constantinople as a new seat of government for the remnant of his empire  this astounding falsehood was of course accepted humbly by the unlettered teutons and did its work well for centuries to come  it is saidi trust not trulyto be still enrolled among the decrees of the canon law though reprobated by all enlightened roman catholics  be that as it may on the strength of this document the popes began to assume an all but despotic sovereignty over the western world andthe teutonic peoples and romes conquest of her conquerors was at last complete  what then were the causes of the papal hatred of a race who were good and devout catholics for the last 200 years of their rule  there were deep political reasons in the strictest and i am afraid lowest sense of the word but over and above them there were evidently moral reasons which lay even deeper still  a free plainspoken practical race like these lombards living by their own laws disbelieving in witchcraft and seemingly doing little for monasticism were not likely to find favour in the eyes of popes  they were not the material which the papacy could mould into the neapolitan ideal of little saintsand little asses  these lombards were not a superstitious race they did not like the franks and anglosaxons crowd into monasteries  i can only find four instances of lombard sovereigns founding monasteries in all paulus history  one of them strangely enough is that of the very astulf against whom the pope fulminated so loudly the letter from st peter which i read you  moreover it must be said in all fairnessthe lombards despised the romans exceedingly  so did all the teutons  we lombards says bishop luitprand saxons franks lorrainers bavarians sueves burgunds consider it a sufficient insult to call our enemy a roman comprehending in that one name of roman whatever is ignoble cowardly avaricious luxurious false in a word every vice  if this wasas it very probably wasthe feeling of the whole teutonic race and if it was repaidas it certainly wason the part of the roman by contempt for the barbarism and ignorance of the teuton what must have been the feeling between roman and lombard  contact must have embittered mutual contempt into an utter and internecine hatred in which the pope as representative of the roman people could not but share  as for the political reasons they are clear enough  it is absurd to say that they wished to free italy from lombard tyrants  what did they do but hand her over to frankish tyrants instead  no  the true reason was this  gradually there had arisen in the mind of all popes from gregory the great onward the idea of a spiritual supremacy independent of all kings of the earth  it was a great idea as the event proved it was a beneficent one for europe but a ruinous one for italy  for the popes were not content with spiritual power  they could not conceive of it as separated from temporal power and temporal power meant land  how early they set their hearts on the exarchate of ravenna we shall never know the fact is patent that it was a naboths vineyard to them and that to obtain it they called in the franks  their dread was evidently lest the lombards should become masters of the whole of italy  a united italy suited their views then no more than it does now  not only did they conceive of rome as still the centre of the western world but more their stock in trade was at rome  the chains of st peter the sepulchres of st peter and st paul the catacombs filled with the bones of innumerable martyrsthese were their stock in trade  by giving these selling these working miracles with these calling pilgrims from all parts of christendom to visit these in situ they kept up their power and their wealth  i do not accuse them of misusing that power and that wealth in those days  they used them on the contrary better than power and wealth had been ever used in the world before  but they were dependent on the sanctity attached to a particular spot and any power which like the lombard tended to give italy another centre than rome they dreaded and disliked  that lombard basilica near milan with all its treasures must have been in their eyes a formidable rival  still more frightful must it have been to them to see astulf when he encamped before the walls of rome searching for martyrs relics and carrying them off to milan  that as a fact seems to have been the exciting cause of stephens journey to pepin  this astulf was a good catholic  he founded a nunnery and put his own daughters in it  what could a man do more meritorious in the eyes of the pope  but he took away the lands of the church and worse the relics the reserved capital by which the church purchased lands  this was indeed a crime only to be expiated by the horrors of a frank invasion  on the same principle the popes supported the exarchs of ravenna and the independent duchies of spoleto and beneventum  well or ill ruled iconoclast or not they were necessary to keep italy divided and weak and having obtained what they wanted from pepin and charlemagne it was still their interest to pursue the same policy to compound for their own independence as they did with charlemagne and his successors by defending the pretences of foreign kings to the sovereignty of the rest of italy  this has been their policy for centuries  it is their policy still and that policy has been the curse of italy  this fatal gift of the patrimony of st peteras dante sawas machiavelli sawas all clearsighted italians have seenas we are seeing it now in these very dayshas kept her divided torn by civil wars conquered and reconquered by foreign invaders  unable as a celibate ecclesiastic to form his dominions into a strong hereditary kingdom unable as the hierophant of a priestly caste to unite his people in the bonds of national life unable as borgia tried to do to conquer the rest of italy for himself and form it into a kingdom large enough to have weight in the balance of power the pope has been forced again and again to keep himself on his throne by intriguing with foreign princes and calling in foreign arms and the bane of italy from the time of stephen iii to that of pius ix has been the temporal power of the pope  but on the popes also the nemesis came  in building their power on the roman relics on the fable that rome was the patrimony of peter they had built on a lie and that lie avenged itself  had they been independent of the locality of rome had they been really spiritual emperors by becoming cosmopolitan journeying it may be from nation to nation in regular progresses then their power might have been as boundless as they ever desired it should be  having committed themselves to the false position of being petty kings of a petty kingdom they had to endure continual treachery and tyranny from their foreign allies to see not merely italy but rome itself insulted and even sacked by faithful catholics and to become more and more as the centuries rolled on the tools of those very kings whom they had wished to make their tools  true they defended themselves long and with astonishing skill and courage  their sources of power were two the moral and the thaumaturgic and they used them both but when the former failed the latter became useless  as long as their moral power was real as long as they and their clergy were on the whole in spite of enormous faults the best men in europe so long the people believed in them and in their thaumaturgic relics likewise  but they became by no means the best men in europe  then they began to think that after all it was more easy to work the material than the moral powereasier to work the bones than to work righteousness  they were deceived  behold when the righteousness was gone the bones refused to work  people began to question the virtues of the bones and to ask we can believe that the bones may have worked miracles for good men but for bad men  we will examine whether they work any miracles at all  and then behold it came out that the bones did not work miracles and that possibly they were not saints bones at all and then the storm came and the lie as all lies do punished itself  the salt had lost its savour  the teutonic intellect appealed from its old masters to god and to gods universe of facts and emancipated itself once and for all  they who had been the light of europe became its darkness they who had been first became last a warning to mankind until the end of time that on truth and virtue depends the only abiding strength     lecture xiithe strategy of providence   i no not know whether any of you know much of the theory of war  i know very little myself  but something of it one is bound to know as professor of history  for unfortunately a large portion of the history of mankind is the history of war and the historian as a man who wants to know how things were doneas distinct from the philosopher the man who wants to know how things ought to have been doneought to know a little of the first of human artsthe art of killing  what little i know thereof i shall employ today in explaining to you the invasion of the teutons from a socalled mechanical point of view  i wish to shew you how it was possible for so small and uncivilized a people to conquer one so vast and so civilized and what circumstances which you may attribute to what cause you will but i to god enabled our race to conquer in the most vast and important campaign the world has ever seen  i call it a campaign rather than a war  though it lasted 200 years and more it seems to me it will i think seem to you if you look at the maps as but one campaign i had almost said one battle  there is but one problem to be solved and therefore the operations of our race take a sort of unity  the question is how to take rome and keep it by destroying the roman empire  let us consider the two combatantstheir numbers and their position  one glance at the map will shew you which are the most numerous  when you cast your eye over the vastness of the roman empire from east to westitaly switzerland half austria turkey and greece asia minor syria egypt north africa spain france britainand then compare it with the narrow german strip which reaches from the mouth of the danube to the mouth of the rhine the disparity of area is enormous ten times as great at least perhaps more if you accept as i am inclined to do the theory of dr latham that we were always markmen men of the marches occupying a narrow frontier between the slavs and the roman empire and that tacitus has included among germans from hearsay many tribes of the interior of bohemia prussia and poland who were slavs or others and that the numbers and area of our race has been on tacitus authority greatly overrated  what then were the causes of the success of the teutons  native courage and strength  they had these but you must recollect what i have told you that those very qualities were employed against them that they were hired in large numbers into the roman armies to fight against their own brothers  unanimity  of that alas one can say but little  the great teutonic army had not only to fight the romans but to fight each brigade the brigade before it to make them move on and the brigade behind it likewise to prevent their marching over them while too often two brigades quarrelled like children and destroyed each other on the spot  what then was the cause of their success  i think a great deal of it must be attributed to their admirable military position  look at a map of europe putting yourself first at the point to be attackedat rome and looking north follow the german frontier from the euxine up the danube and down the rhine  it is a convex arc but not nearly as long as the concave arc of the roman frontier opposed to it the roman frontier overlaps it to the northwest by all britain to the southwest by part of turkey and the whole of asia minor  that would seem to make it weak and liable to be outflanked on either wing  in reality it made it strong  both the german wings rested on the sea one on the euxine one on the north sea  that in itself would not have given strength for the roman fleets were masters of the seas  but the lands in the rear on either flank were deserts incapable of supporting an army  what would have been the fate of a force landed at the mouth of the weser on the north or at the mouth of the dnieper at the west  starvation among wild moors and bogs and steppes if they attempted to leave their base of operations on the coast  the romans saw this and never tried the plan to defend the centre of their position was the safest and easiest plan  look at this centre  it is complicated  the roman position is guarded by the walls of italy the gigantic earthwork of the alps  to storm them is impossible  but right and left of them the german position has two remarkable pointsstrategic points which decided the fate of the world  they are two salient angles promontories of the german frontier  the one is northeast of switzerland the allman country between the head waters of the danube and the upper rhine basle is its apex  mentz its northern point ratisbon its southern  that triangle encloses the end of the schwartzwald the black forest of primaeval oak  those oaks have saved europe  the advantages of a salient angle of that kind in invading an enemys country are manifest  you can break out on either side and return at once into your own country on lines of interior operation while the enemy has to march round the angle three feet for your one on lines of exterior operation  the early german invaders saw that and burst again and again into gaul from that angle  the romans saw it also admirable strategists as they were and built hadrians wall right across it from the maine to the danube to keep them back  and why did not hadrians wall keep them back  on account of the black forest  the roman never dared to face it to attempt to break our centre and to save italy by carrying the war into the heart of germany  they knew what the invaders of england will discover to their cost that a close woodland is a more formidable barrier than the alps themselves  the black forest i say was the key of our position and saved our race  from this salient angle and along the whole rhine above it the western teutons could throw their masses into gaul franks vandals alans suevi following each other in echellon  you know what an echellon means  when bodies of troops move in lines parallel to each other but each somewhat in the rear of the other so that their whole position resembles an echellea flight of steps  this mode of attack has two great advantages  it cannot be outflanked by the enemy and he dare not concentrate his forces on the foremost division and beat the divisions in detail  if he tries to do so he is outflanked himself and he is liable to be beaten in detail by continually fresh bodies of troops  thus only a part of his line is engaged at a time  now it was en echellon from necessity that the tribes moved down  they could not follow immediately in each others track because two armies following each other would not have found subsistence in the same country  they had to march in parallel lines those nearest to italy moving first and thus forming a vast echellon whose advanced left rested on and was protected by the alps  but you must remember and this is important that all these western attacks along the rhine and rhone were mistakes in as far as they were aimed at rome  the teutons were not aware i suppose that the alps turned to the south between gaul and italy and ran right down to the mediterranean  there they found themselves still cut off from rome by them  hannibals pass over the mont cenis they seem not to have known they had to range down to the mediterranean turn eastward along the genoese coast at nice and then far away from their base of operations were cut off again and again just as the cimbri and teutons were cut off by marius  all attempts to take rome from the piedmontese entrance into italy failed  but these western attacks had immense effects  they cut the roman position in two  and then came out the real weakness of that great illgotten empire conquered for conquerings sake  to the northwest the romans had extended their line far beyond what they could defend  the whole of north gaul was taken by the franks  britain was then isolated and had to be given up to its fate  south gaul being nearer to italy their base they could defend and did like splendid soldiers as they were but that defence only injured them  it thrust the foremost columns of the enemy on into spain  spain was too far from their base of operation to be defended and was lost likewise and seized by vandals and suevi the true point of attack was at the other salient angle of our position on the roman right centre  you know that the danube as you ascend it lies east and west from the black sea to belgrade but above the point where the save enters it it turns north almost at right angles  this is the second salient point the real key of the whole roman empire  for from this point the germans could menaceequally constantinople and turkey on the right i speak always as standing at rome and looking north and italy and rome on the left  the danube once crossed between them and constantinople was nothing but the rich rolling land of turkey between them and rome nothing but the easy passes of the carnic alps laybach to trieste trieste was the key of the roman position  it was and always will be a most important point  it might be the centre of a great kingdom  the nation which has it ought to spend its last bullet in defending it  the teutons did cross the danube as you know in 376 and had a great victory of which nothing came but moral force  they waited long in moesia before they found out the important step which they had made  the genius of alaric first discovered the key of the roman position and discovered that it was in his own hands  i do not say that no germans had crossed the laybach pass before him  on the contrary markmen quadi vandals seem to have come over it as early as 180 and appeared under the walls of aquileia  of course some one must have gone first or alaric would not have known of it  there were no maps then at least among our race  their great generals had to feel their way foot by foot trusting to hearsays of old adventurers deserters and what not as to whether a fruitful country or an impassable alp a great city or the worlds end was twenty miles ahead of them  yes they had great generals among them and alaric perhaps the greatest  if you consider alarics campaigns from ad 400 to ad 415 you will see that the eye of a genius planned them  he wanted rome as all teutons did  he was close to italy in the angle of which i just spoke but instead of going hither he resolved to go south and destroy greece and he did it  thereby if you will consider he cut the roman empire in two  he paralysed and destroyed the right wing of its forces which might if he had marched straight for italy have come up from greece and turkey to take him in flank and rear  he prevented their doing that he prevented also their succouring italy by sea by the same destruction  and then he was free to move on rome knowing that he leaves no strong place on his left flank save constantinople itself and that the ostrogoths and other tribes left behind would mask it for him  then he moved into italy over the carnic alps and was repulsed the first time at pollentia he was not disheartened he retired upon hungary waited five years tried it again and succeeded after a campaign of two years  yes  he was a great general  to be able to move vast masses of men safely through a hostile country and in face of an enemys army beside women and children requires an amount of talent bestowed on few  alaric could do it  dietrich the ostrogoth could do it  alboin the lombard could do it though not under such fearful disadvantages  there were generals before marlborough or napoleon  and do not fancy that the work was easy that the romans were degenerate enough to be an easy prey  alaric had been certainly beaten out of italy even though the victory of pollentia was exaggerated  and in 405 radagast with 200000 men had tried to take rome by alarics route and had simply from want of generalship been forced to capitulate under the walls of florence and the remnant of his army sold for slaves  why was alaric more fortunate  because he was a great genius  and why when he died did the goths lose all plan and wander wildly up italy and out into spain  because the great genius was gone  native teuton courage could ensure no permanent success against roman discipline and strategy unless guided by men like alaric or dietrich  you might fancy the campaign over now but it was not  along the country of the danube from the euxine to the alps the teutons had still the advantage of interior lines and vast bodies of menherules gepids ostrogoths lombardswere coming down in an enormous echellon similar to that which forced the rhine to force italy at the same fatal pointvenetia  the party who could command the last reserve would win as is the rule  and the last reserves were with our race  they must win  but not yet  they had in the mean time taken up a concave line a great arc running round the whole west of the mediterranean from italy france spain algeria as far as carthage  they could not move forces round that length of coast as fast as the romans could move them by sea and they had no fleets  although they had conquered the western empire they were in a very dangerous position and were about to be very nearly ruined  for you see the romans in turn had changed front at more than a right angle  they lay at first northwest and southeast  they lay in justinians time north and south  their right was constantinople their left pentapolis between those two points they held greece asia minor syria and egypt a position of wealth incalculable  meanwhile as we must remember always they were masters of the sea and therefore of the interior lines of operation  they had been forced into this position but like romans they had accepted it  with the boundless common sense of the race however fallen debauched pedantic they worked it out and with terrible effect  their right in constantinople was so strong that they cared nothing for it though it was the only exposed point  they would defend it by hiring the barbarians and when they could not pay them setting them on to kill down each other while they quietly drew into constantinople the boundless crops of asia syria and egypt  the strength of constantinople was infinitecommanding two seas and two continents  it is as the genius of constantinople sawas the genius of the czar nicholas sawthe strongest spot perhaps in the world  that fact was what enabled justinians empire to arise again and enabled belisarius and narses to reconquer africa and italy  remember that and see how strong the romans were still  the teutons meanwhile had changed their front by conquering the western mediterranean and were becoming weak because scattered on exterior lines to their extreme danger  i cannot exaggerate the danger of that position  it enabled the romans by rapid movements of their fleets to reconquer africa and italy  it might have enabled them to do much more  belisarius with great wisdom began by attacking the vandals at carthage on the extreme right  they had put themselves into an isolated position and were destroyed without help  then he moved on italy and the ostrogoths  he was going to force the positions in detail and drive them back behind the alps  what he did not finish narses did and the teutons were actually driven back behind the alps for some years  but narses had to stop at italy  even if not recalled he could have gone no further  the next move should have been on spain if he had really had strength in italy  but to attack spain from constantinople would have been to go too far from home  the franks would have crost the pyrenees and fallen on his flank  the visigoths even if beaten would have been only pushed across the straits of gibraltar to reconquer the vandal coast of africa while to take troops from italy for any such purpose would have been to let in the lombardswho came let in or not there were reserves in germany still of which narses knew full well for he had seen 5000 lombards besides herules and huns and avars fight for him at nuceria and destroy the ostrogoths and he knew well that they could if they chose fight against him  on the other hand the roman empire had no reserves while the campaign had just come to that point at which he who can bring up the last reserve wins  ours were so far from being exhausted that the heaviest of them the franks came into action stronger than ever 200 years after  but the roman reserves were gone  if greece if asia minor if egypt had been the holds of a hardy people the romans might have done stillheaven alone knows what  at least they might have extended their front once more to the line of carthage sicily italy  but the people of syria and egypt werewhat they were  no recruits as far as i know were drawn from them  had they been they would have been face to face with a frank or a lombard or a visigoth much whatnot a sikh a rohilla or a ghoorka but a bengalee properwould be face to face with an englishman  one thousand varangers might have walked from constantinople to alexandria without fighting a pitched battle if they had had only greeks and syrians to face  thus the romans were growing weak  if we had lost so had they  every wild teuton who came down to perish had destroyed a roman or more than one before he died  each column which the admirable skill and courage of the romans had destroyed had weakened them as much perhaps more than its destruction weakened the teutons and had by harrying the country destroyed the romans power of obtaining supplies  italy and turkey at last became too poor to be a fighting ground at all  but now comes in one of the strangest new elements in this strange epicmohammed and his arabs  suddenly these arab tribes under the excitement of the new mussulman creed burst forth of the unknown east  they take the eastern empire in the rear by such a rear attack as the world never saw before or since they cut it in two devour it up and save europe thereby  that may seem a strange speech  i must explain it  i have told you how the eastern empire and its military position was immensely strong that constantinople was a great maritime base of operations mistress of the mediterranean  what prevented the romans from reconquering all the shores of that sea and establishing themselves in strength in the morea or in sicily or in carthage or in any central base of operations  what forced them to cling to constantinople and fight a losing campaign thenceforth  simply this the mussulman had forced their position from the rear and deprived them of syria egypt africa  but the teutons could not have opposed them  during the 7th century the lombards in italy were lazy and divided the goths in spain lazier and more divided still the franks were tearing themselves in pieces by civil war  the years from ad 550 to ad 750 and the rise of the carlovingian dynasty were a period of exhaustion for our race such as follows on great victories and the consequent slaughter and collapse  this was the critical period of the teutonic race little talked of because little known but very perilous  nevertheless whatever the eastern empire might have done the saracens prevented its doing and if you hold with me that the welfare of the teutonic race is the welfare of the world then meaning nothing less the saracen invasion by crippling the eastern empire saved europe and our race  and now gentlemen was this vast campaign fought without a general  if trafalgar could not be won without the mind of a nelson or waterloo without the mind of a wellington was there no one mind to lead those innumerable armies on whose success depended the future of the whole human race  did no one marshal them in that impregnable convex front from the euxine to the north sea  no one guide them to the two great strategic centres of the black forest and trieste  no one cause them blind barbarians without maps or science to follow those rules of war without which victory in a protracted struggle is impossible and by the pressure of the huns behind force on their flagging myriads to an enterprise which their simplicity fancied at first beyond the powers of mortal men  believe it who will but i cannot  i may be told that they gravitated into their places as stones and mud do  be it so  they obeyed natural laws of course as all things do on earth when they obeyed the laws of war those too are natural laws explicable on simple mathematical principles  but while i believe that not a stone or a handful of mud gravitates into its place without the will of god that it was ordained ages since into what particular spot each grain of gold should be washed down from an australian quartz reef that a certain man might find it at a certain moment and crisis of his lifeif i be superstitious enough as thank god i am to hold that creed shall i not believe that though this great war had no general upon earth it may have had a general in heaven and that in spite of all their sins the hosts of our forefathers were the hosts of god     appendix the limits of exact science as applied to history   it is with a feeling of awe i had almost said of fear that i find myself in this place upon this errand  the responsibility of a teacher of history in cambridge is in itself very heavy but doubly heavy in the case of one who sees among his audience many men as fit it may be some more fit to fill this chair and again more heavy still when one succeeds to a man whose learning like his virtues one can never hope to equal  but a professor i trust is like other men capable of improvement and the great law docendo disces may be fulfilled in him as in other men  meanwhile i can only promise that such small powers as i possess will be honestly devoted to this professorate and that i shall endeavour to teach modern history after a method which shall give satisfaction to the rulers of this university  i shall do that best i believe by keeping in mind the lessons which i in common with thousands more have learnt from my wise and good predecessor  i do not mean merely patience in research and accuracy in fact  they are required of all men and they may be learnt from many men  but what sir james stephens life and writings should especially teach us is the beauty and the value of charity of that largehearted humanity which sympathizes with all noble generous earnest thought and endeavour in whatsoever shape they may have appeared a charity which without weakly or lazily confounding the eternal laws of right and wrong can make allowances for human frailty can separate the good from the evil in men and in theories can understand and can forgive because it loves  who can read sir james stephens works without feeling more kindly toward many a man and many a form of thought against which he has been more or less prejudiced without a more genial view of human nature a more hopeful view of human destiny a more full belief in the great saying that wisdom is justified of all her children  who too can read those works without seeing how charity enlightens the intellect just as bigotry darkens it how events which to the theorist and the pedant are merely monstrous and unmeaning may explain themselves easily enough to the man who will put himself in his fellowcreatures place who will give them credit for being men of like passions with himself who will see with their eyes feel with their hearts and take for his motto homo sum nil humani a me alienum puto  i entreat gentlemen who may hereafter attend my lectures to bear in mind this last saying  if they wish to understand history they must first try to understand men and women  for history is the history of men and women and of nothing else and he who knows men and women thoroughly will best understand the past work of the world and be best able to carry on its work now  the men who in the long run have governed the world have been those who understood the human heart and therefore it is to this day the statesman who keeps the reins in his hand and not the mere student  he is a man of the world he knows how to manage his fellowmen and therefore he can get work done which the mere student it may be has taught him ought to be done but which the mere student much less the mere trader or economist could not get done simply because his fellowmen would probably not listen to him and certainly outwit him  of course in proportion to the depth width soundness of his conception of human nature will be the greatness and wholesomeness of his power  he may appeal to the meanest or to the loftiest motives  he may be a fox or an eagle a borgia or a hildebrand a talleyrand or a napoleon a mary stuart or an elizabeth but however base however noble the power which he exercises is the same in essence  he makes history because he understands men  and you if you would understand history must understand men  if therefore any of you should ask me how to study history i should answertake by all means biographies wheresoever possible autobiographies and study them  fill your minds with live human figures men of like passions with yourselves see how each lived and worked in the time and place in which god put him  believe me that when you have thus made a friend of the dead and brought him to life again and let him teach you to see with his eyes and feel with his heart you will begin to understand more of his generation and his circumstances than all the mere historybooks of the period would teach you  in proportion as you understand the man and only so will you begin to understand the elements in which he worked  and not only to understand but to remember  names dates genealogies geographical details costumes fashions manners crabbed scraps of old law which you used perhaps to read up and forget again because they were not rooted but stuck into your brain as pins are into a pincushion to fall out at the first shakeall these you will remember because they will arrange and organize themselves around the central human figure just as if you have studied a portrait by some great artist you cannot think of the face in it without recollecting also the light and shadow the tone of colouring the dress the very details of the background and all the accessories which the painters art has grouped around each with a purpose and therefore each fixing itself duly in your mind  who for instance has not found that he can learn more french history from french memoirs than even from all the truly learned and admirable histories of france which have been written of late years  there are those too who will say of good old plutarchs lives nowadays i think too much neglected what some great man used to say of shakspeare and english historythat all the ancient history which they really knew they had got from plutarch  i am free to confess that i have learnt what little i know of the middleages what they were like how they came to be what they were and how they issued in the reformation not so much from the study of the books about them many and wise though they are as from the thumbing over for years the semimythical saints lives of surius and the bollandists  without doubt history obeys and always has obeyed in the long run certain laws  but those laws assert themselves and are to be discovered not in things but in persons in the actions of human beings and just in proportion as we understand human beings shall we understand the laws which they have obeyed or which have avenged themselves on their disobedience  this may seem a truism if it be such it is one which we cannot too often repeat to ourselves just now when the rapid progress of science is tempting us to look at human beings rather as things than as persons and at abstractions under the name of laws rather as persons than as things  discovering to our just delight order and law all around us in a thousand events which seemed to our fathers fortuitous and arbitrary we are dazzled just now by the magnificent prospect opening before us and fall too often into more than one serious mistake  first students try to explain too often all the facts which they meet by the very few laws which they know and especially moral phaenomena by physical or at least economic laws  there is an excuse for this last error  much which was thought a few centuries since to belong to the spiritual world is now found to belong to the material and the physician is consulted where the exorcist used to be called in  but it is a somewhat hasty corollary therefrom and one not likely to find favour in this university that moral laws and spiritual agencies have nothing at all to do with the history of the human race  we shall not be inclined here i trust to explain as some one tried to do lately the crusades by a hypothesis of overstocked labourmarkets on the continent  neither again shall we be inclined to class those same crusades among popular delusions and mere outbursts of folly and madness  this is a very easy and i am sorry to say a very common method of disposing of facts which will not fit into the theory too common of late that need and greed have been always and always ought to be the chief motives of mankind  need and greed heaven knows are powerful enough but i think that he who has something nobler in himself than need and greed will have eyes to discern something nobler than them in the most fantastic superstitions in the most ferocious outbursts of the most untutored masses  thank god that those who preach the opposite doctrine belie it so often by a happy inconsistency that he who declares selfinterest to be the mainspring of the world can live a life of virtuous selfsacrifice that he who denies with spinoza the existence of free will can disprove his own theory by willing like spinoza amid all the temptations of the world to live a life worthy of a roman stoic and that he who represents men as the puppets of material circumstance and who therefore has no logical right either to praise virtue or to blame vice can shew by a healthy admiration of the former a healthy scorn of the latter how little his heart has been corrupted by the eidola specus the phantoms of the study which have oppressed his brain  but though men are often thank heaven better than their doctrines yet the goodness of the man does not make his doctrine good and it is immoral as well as unphilosophical to call a thing hard names simply because it cannot be fitted into our theory of the universe  immoral because all harsh and hasty wholesale judgments are immoral unphilosophical because the only philosophical method of looking at the strangest of phaenomena is to believe that it too is the result of law perhaps a healthy result that it is not to be condemned as a product of disease before it is proven to be such and that if it be a product of disease disease has its laws as much as health and is a subject not for cursing but for induction so that to return to my example if every man who ever took part in the crusades were proved to have been simply mad our sole business would be to discover why he went mad upon that special matter and at that special time  and to do that we must begin by recollecting that in every man who went forth to the crusades or to any other strange adventure of humanity was a whole human heart and brain of like strength and weakness like hopes like temptations with our own and find out what may have driven him mad by considering what would have driven us mad in his place  may i be permitted to enlarge somewhat on this topic  there is as you are aware a demand just now for philosophies of history  the general spread of inductive science has awakened this appetite the admirable contemporary french historians have quickened it by feeding it till the more order and sequence we find in the facts of the past the more we wish to find  so it should be or why was man created a rational being and so it is and the requirements of the more educated are becoming so peremptory that many thinking men would be ready to say i should be sorry to endorse their opinion that if history is not studied according to exact scientific method it need not be studied at all  a very able anonymous writer has lately expressed this general tendency of modern thought in language so clear and forcible that i must beg leave to quote it  step by step he says the notion of evolution by law is transforming the whole field of our knowledge and opinion  it is not one order of conception which comes under its influence but it is the whole sphere of our ideas and with them the whole system of our action and conduct  not the physical world alone is now the domain of inductive science but the moral the intellectual and the spiritual are being added to its empire two coordinate ideas pervade the vision of every thinker physicist or moralist philosopher or priest  in the physical and the moral world in the natural and the human are ever seen two forcesinvariable rule and continual advance law and action order and progress these two powers working harmoniously together and the result inevitable sequence orderly movement irresistible growth  in the physical world indeed order is most prominent to our eyes in the moral world it is progress but both exist as truly in the one as in the other  in the scale of nature as we rise from the inorganic to the organic the idea of change becomes even more distinct just as when we rise through the gradations of the moral world the idea of order becomes more difficult to grasp  it was the last task of the astronomer to show eternal change even in the grand order of our solar system  it is the crown of philosophy to see immutable law even in the complex action of human life  in the latter indeed it is but the first germs which are clear  no rational thinker hopes to discover more than some few primary actions of law and some approximative theory of growth  much is dark and contradictory  numerous theories differing in method and degree are offered nor do we decide between them  we insist now only upon this that the principle of development in the moral as in the physical has been definitely admitted and something like a conception of one grand analogy through the whole sphere of knowledge has almost become a part of popular opinion  most men shrink from any broad statement of the principle though all in some special instances adopt it  it surrounds every idea of our life and is diffused in every branch of study  the press the platform the lectureroom and the pulpit ring with it in every variety of form  unconscious pedants are proving it  it flashes on the statistician through his registers it guides the hand of simple philanthropy it is obeyed by the instinct of the statesman  there is not an act of our public life which does not acknowledge it  no man denies that there are certain and even practical laws of political economy  they are nothing but laws of society  the conferences of social reformers the congresses for international statistics and for social science bear witness of its force  everywhere we hear of the development of the constitution of public law of public opinion of institutions of forms of society of theories of history  in a word whatever views of history may be inculcated on the universities by novelists or epigrammatists it is certain that the best intellects and spirits of our day are labouring to see more of that invariable order and of that principle of growth in the life of human societies and of the great society of mankind which nearly all men more or less acknowledge and partially and unconsciously confirm  this passage expresses admirably i think the tendencies of modern thought for good and evil  for good  for surely it is good and a thing to thank god for that men should be more and more expecting order searching for order welcoming order  but for evil also  for young sciences like young men have their time of wonder hope imagination and of passion too and haste and bigotry  dazzled and that pardonably by the beauty of the few laws they may have discovered they are too apt to erect them into gods and to explain by them all matters in heaven and earth and apt too as i think this author does to patch them where they are weakest by that most dangerous succedaneum of vague and grand epithets which very often contain each of them an assumption far more important than the law to which they are tacked  such surely are the words which so often occur in this passageinvariable continual immutable inevitable irresistible there is an ambiguity in these words which may leadwhich i believe does leadto most unphilosophical conclusions  they are used very much as synonyms not merely in this passage but in the mouths of men  are you aware that those who carelessly do so blink the whole of the world old arguments between necessity and freewill  whatever may be the rights of that quarrel they are certainly not to be assumed in a passing epithet  but what else does the writer do who tells us that an inevitable sequence an irresistible growth exists in the moral as well as in the physical world and then says as a seemingly identical statement that it is the crown of philosophy to see immutable law even in the complex action of human life  the crown of philosophy  doubtless it is so  but not a crown i should have thought which has been reserved as the special glory of these latter days  very early at least in the known history of mankind did philosophy under the humble names of religion and common sense see most immutable and even eternal laws in the complex action of human life even the laws of right and wrong and called them the everlasting judgments of god to which a confused and hardworked man was to look and take comfort for all would be well at last  by fair induction as i believe did man discover more or less clearly those eternal laws by repeated verifications of them in every age man has been rising and will yet rise to clearer insight into their essence their limits their practical results  and if it be these the old laws of right and wrong which this author and his school call invariable and immutable we shall i trust most heartily agree with them only wondering why a moral government of the world seems to them so very recent a discovery  but we shall not agree with them i trust when they represent these invariable and immutable laws as resulting in any inevitable sequence or irresistible growth  we shall not deny a sequencereason forbids that or again a growthexperience forbids that but we shall be puzzled to see why a law because it is immutable itself should produce inevitable results and if they quote the facts of material nature against us we shall be ready to meet them on that very ground and askyou say that as the laws of matter are inevitable so probably are the laws of human life  be it so but in what sense are the laws of matter inevitable potentially or actually  even in the seemingly most uniform and universal law where do we find the inevitable or the irresistible  is there not in nature a perpetual competition of law against law force against force producing the most endless and unexpected variety of results  cannot each law be interfered with at any moment by some other law so that the first law though it may struggle for the mastery shall be for an indefinite time utterly defeated  the law of gravity is immutable enough but do all stones inevitably fall to the ground certainly not if i choose to catch one and keep it in my hand  it remains there by laws and the law of gravity is there too making it feel heavy in my hand but it has not fallen to the ground and will not till i let it  so much for the inevitable action of the laws of gravity as of others  potentially it is immutable but actually it can be conquered by other laws  i really beg your pardon for occupying you here with such truisms but i must put the students of this university in mind of them as long as too many modern thinkers shall choose to ignore them  even if then as it seems to me the history of mankind depended merely on physical laws analogous to those which govern the rest of nature it would be a hopeless task for us to discover an inevitable sequence in history even though we might suppose that such existed  but as long as man has the mysterious power of breaking the laws of his own being such a sequence not only cannot be discovered but it cannot exist  for man can break the laws of his own being whether physical intellectual or moral  he breaks them every day and has always been breaking them  the greater number of them he cannot obey till he knows them  and too many of them he cannot know alas till he has broken them and paid the penalty of his ignorance  he does not like the brute or the vegetable thrive by laws of which he is not conscious but by laws of which he becomes gradually conscious and which he can disobey after all  and therefore it seems to me very like a juggle of words to draw analogies from the physical and irrational world and apply them to the moral and rational world and most unwise to bridge over the gulf between the two by such adjectives as irresistible or inevitable such nouns as order sequence lawwhich must bear an utterly different meaning according as they are applied to physical beings or to moral ones  indeed so patent is the ambiguity that i cannot fancy that it has escaped the author and his school and am driven by mere respect for their logical powers to suppose that they mean no ambiguity at all that they do not conceive of irrational beings as differing from rational beings or the physical from the moral or the body of man from his spirit in kind and property and that the immutable laws which they represent as governing human life and history have nothing at all to do with those laws of right and wrong which i intend to set forth to you as the everlasting judgments of god  in which case i fear they must go their way while we go ours confessing that there is an order and there is a law for man and that if he disturb that order or break that law in anywise they will prove themselves too strong for him and reassert themselves and go forward grinding him to powder if he stubbornly try to stop their way  but we must assert too that his disobedience to them even for a moment has disturbed the natural course of events and broken that inevitable sequence which we may find indeed in our own imaginations as long as we sit with a book in our studies but which vanishes the moment that we step outside into practical contact with life and instead of talking cheerfully of a necessary and orderly progress find ourselves more inclined to cry with the cynical man of the world     all the windy ways of men       are but dust that rises up    and is lightly laid again  the usual rejoinder to this argument is to fall back upon mans weakness and ignorance and to take refuge in the infinite unknown  man it is said may of course interfere a little with some of the less important laws of his being but who is he to grapple with the more vast and remote ones  because he can prevent a pebble from falling is he to suppose that he can alter the destiny of nations and grapple forsooth with the eternities and the immensities and so forth  the argument is very powerful but addrest rather to the imagination than the reason  it is after all another form of the old omne ignotum pro magnifico and we may answer i think fairlyabout the eternities and immensities we know nothing not having been there as yet but it is a mere assumption to suppose without proof that the more remote and impalpable laws are more vast in the sense of being more powerful the only sense which really bears upon the argument than the laws which are palpably at work around us all day long and if we are capable of interfering with almost every law of human life which we know of already it is more philosophical to believe till disproved by actual failure that we can interfere with those laws of our life which we may know hereafter  whether it will pay us to interfere with them is a different question  it is not prudent to interfere with the laws of health and it may not be with other laws hereafter to be discovered  i am only pleading that man can disobey the laws of his being that such power has always been a disturbing force in the progress of the human race which modern theories too hastily overlook and that the science of history unless the existence of the human will be denied must belong rather to the moral sciences than to that positive science which seems to me inclined to reduce all human phaenomena under physical laws hastily assumed by the old fallacy of greek text to apply where there is no proof whatsoever that they do or even can apply  as for the question of the existence of the human willi am not here i hope to argue that  i shall only beg leave to assume its existence for practical purposes  i may be told though i trust not in this university that it is like the undulatory theory of light an unphilosophical hypothesis  be that as it may it is very convenient and may be for a few centuries to come to retain the said hypothesis as one retains the undulatory theory and for the simple reason that with it one can explain the phaenomena tolerably and without it cannot explain them at all  a dread halfunconscious it may be of this last practical result seems to have crossed the mind of the author on whom i have been commenting for he confesses honestly enough and he writes throughout like an honest man that in human life no rational thinker hopes to discover more than some few primary actions of law and some approximative theory of growth  i have higher hopes of a possible science of history because i fall back on those old moral laws which i think he wishes to ignore but i can conceive that he will not because he cannot on his own definitions of law and growth  they are if i understand him aright to be irresistible and inevitable  i say that they are not so even in the case of trees and stones much more in the world of man  facts when he goes on to verify his theories will leave him with a very few primary actions of law a very faint approximative theory because his theories in plain english will not work  at the first step at every step they are stopped short by those disturbing forces or at least disturbed phaenomena which have been as yet and probably will be hereafter attributed as the only explanation of them to the existence for good and evil of a human will  let us look in detail at a few of these disturbances of anything like inevitable or irresistible movement  shall we not at the very first glance confessi am afraid only too soonthat there always have been fools therein fools of whom no man could guess or can yet what they were going to do next or why they were going to do it  and how pray can we talk of the inevitable in the face of that one miserable fact of human folly whether of ignorance or of passion folly still  there may be laws of folly as there are laws of disease and whether there are or not we may learn much wisdom from folly we may see what the true laws of humanity are by seeing the penalties which come from breaking them but as for laws which work of themselves by an irresistible movementhow can we discover such in a past in which every law which we know has been outraged again and again  take one of the highest instancesthe progress of the human intellecti do not mean just now the spread of conscious science but of that unconscious science which we call common sense  what hope have we of laying down exact laws for its growth in a world wherein it has been ignored insulted crushed a thousand times sometimes in whole nations and for whole generations by the stupidity tyranny greed caprice of a single ruler or if not so yet by the mere superstition laziness sensuality anarchy of the mob how again are we to arrive at any exact laws of the increase of population in a race which has had from the beginning the abnormal and truly monstrous habit of slaughtering each other not for foodfor in a race of normal cannibals the ratio of increase or decrease might easily be calculatedbut uselessly from rage hate fanaticism or even mere wantonness  no man is less inclined than i to undervalue vital statistics and their already admirable results but how can they help us and how can we help them in looking at such a past as that of three fourths of the nations of the world  lookas a single instance among too manyat that most noble nation of germany swept and stunned by peasant wars thirty years wars french wars and after each hurricane blossoming up again into brave industry and brave thought to be in its turn cut off by a fresh storm ere it could bear full fruit doing nevertheless such work against such fearful disadvantages as nation never did before and proving thereby what she might have done for humanity had not she the mother of all european life been devoured generation after generation by her own unnatural children  nevertheless she is their mother still and her history as i believe the roothistory of europe but it is hard to readthe sibylline leaves are so fantastically torn the characters so blotted out by tears and blood  and if such be the history of not one nation only but of the average how i ask are we to make calculations about such a species as man  many modern men of science wish to draw the normal laws of human life from the average of humanity i question whether they can do so because i do not believe the average man to be the normal man exhibiting the normal laws but a very abnormal man diseased and crippled but even if their method were correct it could work in practice only if the destinies of men were always decided by majorities and granting that the majority of men have common sense are the minority of fools to count for nothing  are they powerless  have they had no influence on history  have they even been always a minority and not at times a terrible majority doing each that which was right in the sight of his own eyes  you can surely answer that question for yourselves  as far as my small knowledge of history goes i think it may be proved from facts that any given people down to the lowest savages has at any period of its life known far more than it has done known quite enough to have enabled it to have got on comfortably thriven and developed if it had only done what no man does all that it knew it ought to do and could do  st pauls experience of himself is true of all mankindthe good which i would i do not and the evil which i would not that i do  the discrepancy between the amount of knowledge and the amount of work is one of the most patent and most painful facts which strikes us in the history of man and one not certainly to be explained on any theory of mans progress being the effect of inevitable laws or one which gives us much hope of ascertaining fixed laws for that progress  and bear in mind that fools are not always merely imbecile and obstructive they are at times ferocious dangerous mad  there is in human nature what goethe used to call a demoniac element defying all law and all induction and we can i fear from that one cause as easily calculate the progress of the human race as we can calculate that of the vines upon the slopes of aetna with the lava ready to boil up and overwhelm them at any and every moment  let us learn in gods name all we can from the short intervals of average peace and common sense let us or rather our grandchildren get precious lessons from them for the next period of sanity  but let us not be surprised much less disheartened if after learning a very little some unexpected and truly demoniac factor anabaptist war french revolution or other should toss all our calculations to the winds and set us to begin afresh sadder and wiser men  we may learn doubtless even more of the real facts of human nature the real laws of human history from these critical periods when the rootfibres of the human heart are laid bare for good and evil than from any smooth and respectable periods of peace and plenty nevertheless their lessons are not statistical but moral  but if human folly has been a disturbing force for evil surely human reason has been a disturbing force for good  man can not only disobey the laws of his being he can also choose between them to an extent which science widens every day and so become what he was meant to be an artificial being artificial in his manufactures habits society politywhat not  all day long he has a free choice between even physical laws which mere things have not and which make the laws of mere things inapplicable to him  take the simplest case  if he falls into the water he has his choice whether he will obey the laws of gravity and sink or by other laws perform the to him artificial process of swimming and get ashore  true both would happen by law but he has his choice which law shall conquer sink or swim  we have yet to learn why whole nations why all mankind may not use the same prudential power as to which law they shall obeywhich without breaking it they shall conquer and repress as long as seems good to them  it is true nature must be obeyed in order that she may he conquered but then she is to be conquered  it has been too much the fashion of late to travestie that great dictum of bacons into a very different one and say nature must be obeyed because she cannot be conquered thus proclaiming the impotence of science to discover anything save her own impotencea result as contrary to fact as to bacons own hopes of what science would do for the welfare of the human race  for what is all human invention but the transcending and conquering one natural law by another  what is the practical answer which all mankind has been making to nature and her pretensions whenever it has progressed one step since the foundation of the world by which all discoverers have discovered all teachers taught by which all polities kingdoms civilizations arts manufactures have established themselves all who have raised themselves above the mob have faced the mob and conquered the mob crucified by them first and worshipped by them afterwards by which the first savage conquered the natural law which put wild beasts in the forest by killing them conquered the natural law which makes raw meat wholesome by cooking it conquered the natural law which made weeds grow at his hut door by rooting them up and planting corn instead and won his first spurs in the great battle of man against nature proving thereby that he was a man and not an ape  what but thisnature is strong but i am stronger  i know her worth but i know my own  i trust her and her laws but my trusty servant she shall be and not my tyrant and if she interfere with my ideal even with my personal comfort then nature and i will fight it out to the last gasp and heaven defend the right  in forgetting this in my humble opinion lay the error of the early or laissez faire school of political economy  it was too much inclined to say to men you are the puppets of certain natural laws  your own freewill and choice if they really exist exist merely as a dangerous disease  all you can do is to submit to the laws and drift whithersoever they may carry you for good or evil  but not less certainly was the same blame to be attached to the french socialist school  it though based on a revolt from the philosophie du neant philosophie de la misere as it used to term the laissez faire school yet retained the worst fallacy of its foe namely that man was the creature of circumstances and denied him just as much as its antagonist the possession of freewill or at least the right to use freewill on any large scale  the laissez faire school was certainly the more logical of the two  with them if man was the creature of circumstances those circumstances were at least defined for him by external laws which he had not created while the socialists with fourier at their head as it has always seemed to me fell into the extraordinary paradox of supposing that though man was the creature of circumstances he was to become happy by creating the very circumstances which were afterwards to create him  but both of them erred surely in ignoring that selfarbitrating power of man by which he can for good or for evil rebel against and conquer circumstance  i am not surely overstepping my province as professor of history in alluding to this subject  just notions of political economy are absolutely necessary to just notions of history and i should wish those young gentlemen who may attend my lectures to go first were it possible to my more learned brother the professor of political economy and get from him not merely exact habits of thought but a knowledge which i cannot give and yet which they ought to possess  for to take the very lowest ground the first fact of history is bouche va toujours whatever men have or have not done they have always eaten or tried to eat and the laws which regulate the supply of the first necessaries of life are after all the first which should be learnt and the last which should be ignored  the more modern school however of political economy while giving due weight to circumstance has refused to acknowledge it as the force which ought to determine all human life and our greatest living political economist has in his essay on liberty put in a plea unequalled since the areopagitica of milton for the selfdetermining power of the individual and for his right to use that power  but my business is not with rights so much as with facts and as a fact surely one may say that this inventive reason of man has been in all ages interfering with any thing like an inevitable sequence or orderly progress of humanity  some of those writers indeed who are most anxious to discover an exact order are most loud in their complaints that it has been interfered with by overlegislation and rejoice that mankind is returning to a healthier frame of mind and leaving nature alone to her own work in her own way  i do not altogether agree with their complaints but of that i hope to speak in subsequent lectures meanwhile i must ask if as is said most good legislation nowadays consists in repealing old laws which ought never to have been passed if as is said the great fault of our forefathers was that they were continually setting things wrong by intermeddling in matters political economic religious which should have been let alone to develop themselves in their own way what becomes of the inevitable laws and the continuous progress of the human mind  look again at the disturbing power not merely of the general reason of the many but of the genius of the few  i am not sure but that the one fact that genius is occasionally present in the world is not enough to prevent our ever discovering any regular sequence in human progress past or future  let me explain myself  in addition to the infinite variety of individual characters continually born in itself a cause of perpetual disturbance man alone of all species has the faculty of producing from time to time individuals immeasurably superior to the average in some point or other whom we call men of genius  like mr babbages calculating machine human nature gives millions of orderly respectable commonplace results which any statistician can classify and enables hasty philosophers to sayit always has gone on thus it must go on thus always when behold after many millions of orderly results there turns up a seemingly disorderly a certainly unexpected result and the law seems broken being really superseded by some deeper law for that once and perhaps never again for centuries  even so it is with man and the physiological laws which determine the earthly appearance of men  laws there are doubt it not but they are beyond us and let our induction be as wide as it may they will baffle it and great nature just as we fancy we have found out her secret will smile in our faces as she brings into the world a man the like of whom we have never seen and cannot explain define classifyin one word a genius  such do as a fact become leaders of men into quite new and unexpected paths and for good or evil leave their stamp upon whole generations and races  notorious as this may be it is just i think what most modern theories of human progress ignore  they take the actions and the tendencies of the average many and from them construct their scheme a method not perhaps quite safe were they dealing with plants or animals but what if it be the very peculiarity of this fantastic and altogether unique creature called man not only that he develops from time to time these exceptional individuals but that they are the most important individuals of all that his course is decided for him not by the average many but by the extraordinary few that one mahommed one luther one bacon one napoleon shall change the thoughts and habits of millionsso that instead of saying that the history of mankind is the history of the masses it would be much more true to say that the history of mankind is the history of its great men and that a true philosophy of history ought to declare the lawscall them physical spiritual biological or what we chooseby which great minds have been produced into the world as necessary results each in his place and time  that would be a science indeed how far we are as yet from any such you know as well as i  as yet the appearance of great minds is as inexplicable to us as if they had dropped among us from another planet who will tell us why they have arisen when they did and why they did what they did and nothing else  i do not deny that such a science is conceivable because each mind however great or strange may be the result of fixed and unerring laws of life and it is conceivable too that such a science may so perfectly explain the past as to be able to predict the future and tell men when a fresh genius is likely to arise and of what form his intellect will be  conceivable but i fear only conceivable if for no other reason at least for this one  we may grant safely that the mind of luther was the necessary result of a combination of natural laws  we may go further and grant but by no means safely that luther was the creature of circumstances that there was no self moving originality in him but that his age made him what he was  to some modern minds these concessions remove all difficulty and mystery but not i trust to our minds  for does not the very puzzle de quo agitur remain equally real namely why the average of augustine monks the average of german men did not by being exposed to the same average circumstances as luther become what luther was  but whether we allow luther to have been a person with an originally different character from all others or whether we hold him to have been the mere puppet of outside influences the first step towards discovering how he became what he was will be to find out what he was  it will be more easy and i am sorry to say more common to settle beforehand our theory and explain by it such parts of luther as will fit it and call those which will not fit it hard names  history is often so taught and the method is popular and lucrative  but we here shall be of opinion i am sure that we only can learn causes through their effects we can only learn the laws which produced luther by learning luther himself by analyzing his whole character by gauging all his powers and thatunless the less can comprehend the greaterwe cannot do till we are more than luther himself  i repeat it  none can comprehend a man unless he be greater than that man  he must be not merely equal to him because none can see in another elements of character which he has not already seen in himself he must be greater because to comprehend him thoroughly he must be able to judge the mans failings as well as his excellencies to see not only why he did what he did but why he did not do more in a word he must be nearer than his object is to the ideal man  and if it be assumed that i am quibbling on the words comprehend and greater that the observer need be greater only potentially and not in act that all the comprehension required of him is to have in himself the germs of other mens faculties without having developed those germs in life i must still stand to my assertion  for such a rejoinder ignores the most mysterious element of all character which we call strength by virtue of which of two seemingly similar characters while one does nothing the other shall do great things while in one the germs of intellect and virtue remain comparatively embryonic passive and weak in the other these same germs shall develop into manhood action success  and in what that same strength consists not even the dramatic imagination of a shakespeare could discover  what are those heartrending sonnets of his but the confession that over and above all his powers he lacked one thing and knew not what it was or where to find itand that wasto be strong  and yet he who will give us a science of great men must begin by having a larger heart a keener insight a more varying human experience than shakespeares own while those who offer us a science of little men and attempt to explain history and progress by laws drawn from the average of mankind are utterly at sea the moment they come in contact with the very men whose actions make the history to whose thought the progress is due and why  because so at least i think the new science of little men can be no science at all because the average man is not the normal man and never yet has been because the great man is rather the normal man as approaching more nearly than his fellows to the true norma and standard of a complete human character and therefore to pass him by as a mere irregular sport of nature an accidental giant with six fingers and six toes and to turn to the mob for your theory of humanity is i think about as wise as to ignore the apollo and the theseus and to determine the proportions of the human figure from a crowd of dwarfs and cripples  no let us not weary ourselves with narrow theories with hasty inductions which will a century hence furnish mere matter for a smile let us confine ourselves at least in the present infantile state of the anthropologic sciences to facts to ascertaining honestly and patiently the thing which has been done trusting that if we make ourselves masters of them some rays of inductive light will be vouchsafed to us from him who truly comprehends mankind and knows what is in man because he is the son of man who has his own true theory of human progress his own sound method of educating the human race perfectly good and perfectly wise and at last perfectly victorious which nevertheless were it revealed to us tomorrow we could not understand for if he who would comprehend luther must be more than luther what must he be who would comprehend god  look again as a result of the disturbing force of genius at the effects of great inventionshow unexpected complex subtle all but miraculousthrowing out alike the path of human history and the calculations of the student  if physical discoveries produced only physical or economic resultsif the invention of printing had only produced more books and more knowledgeif the invention of gunpowder had only caused more or less men to be killedif the invention of the spinningjenny had only produced more cottonstuffs more employment and therefore more human beingsthen their effects would have been however complex more or less subjects of exact computation  but so strangely interwoven is the physical and spiritual history of man that material inventions produce continually the most unexpected spiritual results  printing becomes a religious agent causes not merely more books but a protestant reformation then again through the jesuit literature helps to a romanist counterreformation and by the clashing of the two is one of the great causes of the thirty years war one of the most disastrous checks which european progress ever suffered gunpowder again not content with killing men becomes unexpectedly a political agent the villanous saltpetre as ariosto and shakespeares fop complain does to death many a goodly gentleman and enables the masses to cope for the first time with knights in armour thus forming a most important agent in the rise of the middle classes while the spinningjenny not content with furnishing facts for the political economist and employment for millions helps to extend slavery in the united states and gives rise to moral and political questions which may have ere they be solved the most painful consequences to one of the greatest nations on earth  so far removed is the sequence of human history from any thing which we can call irresistible or inevitable  did one dare to deal in epithets crooked wayward mysterious incalculable would be those which would rather suggest themselves to a man looking steadily not at a few facts here and there and not again at some hasty birdseye sketch which he chooses to call a whole but at the actual whole fact by fact step by step and alas failure by failure and crime by crime  understand me i beg  i do not wish heaven forbid to discourage inductive thought i do not wish to undervalue exact science  i only ask that the moral world which is just as much the domain of inductive science as the physical one be not ignored that the tremendous difficulties of analyzing its phenomena be fairly faced and the hope given up at least for the present of forming any exact science of history and i wish to warn you off from the too common mistake of trying to explain the mysteries of the spiritual world by a few roughly defined physical laws for too much of our modern thought does little more than that and of ignoring as old fashioned or even superstitious those great moral laws of history which are sanctioned by the experience of ages  foremost among them stands a law which i must insist on boldly and perpetually if i wish as i do wish to follow in the footsteps of sir james stephen a law which man has been trying in all ages as now to deny or at least to ignore though he might have seen it if he had willed working steadily in all times and nations  and that isthat as the fruit of righteousness is wealth and peace strength and honour the fruit of unrighteousness is poverty and anarchy weakness and shame  it is an ancient doctrine and yet one ever young  the hebrew prophets preached it long ago in words which are fulfilling themselves around us every day and which no new discoveries of science will abrogate because they express the great rootlaw which disobeyed science itself cannot get a hearing  for not upon mind gentlemen not upon mind but upon morals is human welfare founded  the true subjective history of man is the history not of his thought but of his conscience the true objective history of man is not that of his inventions but of his vices and his virtues  so far from morals depending upon thought thought i believe depends on morals  in proportion as a nation is righteousin proportion as common justice is done between man and man will thought grow rapidly securely triumphantly will its discoveries be cheerfully accepted and faithfully obeyed to the welfare of the whole commonweal  but where a nation is corrupt that is where the majority of individuals in it are bad and justice is not done between man and man there thought will wither and science will be either crushed by frivolity and sensuality or abused to the ends of tyranny ambition profligacy till she herself perishes amid the general ruin of all good things as she had done in greece in rome in spain in china and many other lands  laws of economy of polity of health of all which makes human life endurable may be ignored and trampled under foot and are too often every day for the sake of present greed of present passion selfinterest may become and will become more and more blinded just in proportion as it is not enlightened by virtue till a nation may arrive though thank god but seldom at that state of frantic recklessness which salvian describes among his roman countrymen in gaul when while the franks were thundering at their gates and starved and halfburnt corpses lay about the unguarded streets the remnant like that in doomed jerusalem of old were drinking dicing ravishing robbing the orphan and the widow swindling the poor man out of his plot of ground and sending meanwhile to the tottering caesar at rome to ask not for armies but for circensian games  we cannot see how science could have bettered those poor gauls  and we can conceive surely a nation falling into the same madness and crying let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die in the midst of railroads spinningjennies electric telegraphs and crystal palaces with infinite bluebooks and scientific treatises ready to prove to them what they knew perfectly well already that they were making a very unprofitable investment both of money and of time  for science indeed is great but she is not the greatest  she is an instrument and not a power beneficent or deadly according as she is wielded by the hand of virtue or of vice  but her lawful mistress the only one which can use her aright the only one under whom she can truly grow and prosper and prove her divine descent is virtue the likeness of almighty god  this indeed the hebrew prophets who knew no science in one sense of the word do not expressly say but it is a corollary from their doctrine which we may discover for ourselves if we will look at the nations round us now if we will look at all the nations which have been  even voltaire himself acknowledged that and when he pointed to the chinese as the most prosperous nation upon earth ascribed their prosperity uniformly to their virtue  we now know that he was wrong in fact for we have discovered that chinese civilization is one not of peace and plenty but of anarchy and wretchedness  but that fact only goes to corroborate the belief which strange juxtaposition was common to voltaire and the old hebrew prophets at whom he scoffed namely that virtue is wealth and vice is ruin  for we have found that these chinese the ruling classes of them at least are an especially unrighteous people rotting upon the rotting remnants of the wisdom and virtue of their forefathers which now live only on their lips in flowery maxims about justice and mercy and truth as a cloak for practical hypocrisy and villany and we have discovered also as a patent fact just what the hebrew prophets would have foretold usthat the miseries and horrors which are now destroying the chinese empire are the direct and organic results of the moral profligacy of its inhabitants  i know no modern nation moreover which illustrates so forcibly as china the great historic law which the hebrew prophets proclaim and that is thisthat as the prosperity of a nation is the correlative of their morals so are their morals the correlative of their theology  as a people behaves so it thrives as it believes so it behaves  such as his gods are such will the man be down to that lowest point which too many of the chinese seem to have reached where having no gods he himself becomes no man but as i hear you see him at the australian diggings abhorred for his foul crimes even by the scum of europe  i do not say that the theology always produces the morals any more than that the morals always produce the theology  each is i think alternately cause and effect  men make the gods in their own likeness then they copy the likeness they have set up  but whichever be cause and whichever effect the law i believe stands true that on the two together depends the physical welfare of a people  history gives us many examples in which superstition many again in which profligacy have been the patent cause of a nations deoradation  it does not as far as i am aware give us a single case of a nations thriving and developing when deeply infected with either of those two vices  these the broad and simple laws of moral retribution we may see in history and i hope something more than them something of a general method something of an upward progress though any thing but an irresistible or inevitable one  for i have not argued that there is no order no progressgod forbid  were there no order to be found what could the student with a mans reason in him do but in due time go madwere there no progress what could the student with a mans heart within him do but in due time break his heart over the sight of a chaos of folly and misery irredeemablei only argue that the order and the progress of human history cannot be similar to those which govern irrational beings and cannot without extreme danger be described by metaphors for they are nothing stronger drawn from physical science  if there be an order a progress they must be moral fit for the guidance of moral beings limited by the obedience which those moral beings pay to what they know  and such an order such a progress as that i have good hope that we shall find in history  we shall find as i believe in all the ages god educating man protecting him till he can go alone furnishing him with the primary necessaries teaching him guiding him inspiring him as we should do to our children bearing with him and forgiving him too again and again as we should do but teaching him withal as we shall do if we be wise in great part by his own experience making him test for himself even by failure and pain the truth of the laws which have been given him discover for himself as much as possible fresh laws or fresh applications of laws and exercising his will and faculties by trusting him to himself wherever he can be trusted without his final destruction this is my conception of history especially of modern historyof history since the revelation of our lord jesus christ  i express myself feebly enough i know  and even could i express what i mean perfectly it would still be but a partial analogy not to be pushed into details as i said just now were the true law of human progress revealed to us to morrow we could not understand it  for suppose that the theory were true which dr temple of rugby has lately put into such noble words suppose that as he says the power whereby the present ever gathers into itself the results of the past transforms the human race into a colossal man whose life reaches from the creation to the day of judgment  the successive generations of men are days in this mans life  the discoveries and inventions which characterize the different epochs of the world are this mans works  the creeds and doctrines the opinions and principles of the successive ages are his thoughts  the state of society at different times are his manners  he grows in knowledge in selfcontrol in visible size just as we do  suppose all this and suppose too that god is educating this his colossal child as we educate our own children it will hardly follow from thence that his education would be as dr temple says it is precisely similar to ours  analogous it may be but not precisely similar and for this reason that the collective man in the theory must be infinitely more complex in his organization than the individuals of which he is composed  while between the educator of the one and of the other there is simply the difference between a man and god  how much more complex then must his education be how allinscrutable to human minds much in itoften as inscrutable as would our training of our children seem to the bird brooding over her young ones in the nest  the parental relations in all three cases may bethe scriptures say that they areexpansions of the same great law the key to all history may be contained in those great wordshow often would i have gathered thy children as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings  yet even there the analogy stops shortbut thou wouldest not expresses a new element which has no place in the training of the nestling by the dam though it has place in our training of our children even that selfwill that power of disobedience which is the dark side of mans prerogative as a rational and selfcultivating being  here that analogy fails as we should have expected it to do and in a hundred other points it fails or rather transcends so utterly its original type that mankind seems at moments the mere puppet of those laws of natural selection and competition of species of which we have heard so much of late and to give a single instance the seeming waste of human thought of human agony of human power seems but another instance of that inscrutable prodigality of nature by which of a thousand acorns dropping to the ground but one shall become the thing it can become and grow into a builder oak the rest be craunched up by the nearest swine  yet these dark passages of human life may be only necessary elements of the complex education of our race and as much mercy under a fearful shape as ours when we put the child we love under the surgeons knife at least we may believe so believe that they have a moral end though that end be unseen by us and without any rash or narrow prying into final causes a trick as fatal to historic research as bacon said it was to science we may justify god by faith where we cannot justify him by experience  surely this will be the philosophic method  if we seem to ourselves to have discovered a law we do not throw it away the moment we find phaenomena which will not be explained by it  we use those phaenomena to correct and to expand our law  and this belief that history is god educating man is no mere hypothesis it results from the observation of thousands of minds throughout thousands of years  it has long seemedi trust it will seem stillthe best explanation of the strange deeds of that strange being man and where we find in history facts which seem to contradict it we shall not cast away rashly or angrily either it or them but if we be bacons true disciples we shall use them patiently and reverently to correct and expand our notions of the law itself and rise thereby to more deep and just conceptions of education of man andit may beof god himself  in proportion as we look at history thus searching for effective rather than final causes and content to see god working everywhere without impertinently demanding of him a reason for his deeds we shall study in a frame of mind equally removed from superstition on the one hand and necessitarianism on the other  we shall not be afraid to confess natural agencies but neither shall we be afraid to confess those supernatural causes which underlie all existence save gods alone  we shall talk of more than of an overruling providence  that such exists will seem to us a patent fact  but it will seem to us somewhat manichaean to believe that the world is ill made mankind a failure and that all god has to do with them is to set them right here and there when they go intolerably wrong  we shall believe not merely in an over ruling providence but if i may dare to coin a word in an underruling one which has fixed for mankind eternal laws of life health growth both physical and spiritual in an aroundruling providence likewise by which circumstances that which stands around a man are perpetually arranged it may be are foreordained so that each law shall have at least an opportunity of taking effect on the right person in the right time and place and in an inruling providence too from whose inspiration comes all true thought all right feeling from whom we must believe man alone of all living things known to us inherits that mysterious faculty of perceiving the law beneath the phaenomena by virtue of which he is a man  but we can hold all this surely and equally hold all which natural science may teach us  hold what natural science teaches  we shall not dare not to hold it  it will be sacred in our eyes  all light which science political economic physiological or other can throw upon the past will be welcomed by us as coming from the author of all light  to ignore it even to receive it suspiciously and grudgingly we shall feel to be a sin against him  we shall dread no inroads of materialism because we shall be standing upon that spiritual ground which underliesay causesthe material  all discoveries of science whether political or economic whether laws of health or laws of climate will be accepted trustfully and cheerfully  and when we meet with such startling speculations as those on the influence of climate soil scenery on national character which have lately excited so much controversy we shall welcome them at first sight just because they give us hope of order where we had seen only disorder law where we fancied chance we shall verify them patiently correct them if they need correction and if proven believe that they have worked and still work greek text as factors in the great method of him who has appointed to all nations their times and the bounds of their habitation if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from any one of them for in him we live and move and have our being and are the offspring of god himself  i thus end what it seemed to me proper to say in this my inaugural lecture thanking you much for the patience with which you have heard me and if i have in it too often spoken of myself and my own opinions i can only answer that it is a fault which has been forced on me by my position and which will not occur again  it seemed to me that some sort of statement of my belief was necessary if only from respect to a university from which i have been long separated and to return to which is to me a high honour and a deep pleasure and i cannot but be aware it is best to be honest that there exists a prejudice against me in the minds of better men than i am on account of certain early writings of mine  that prejudice i trust with gods help i shall be able to dissipate  at least whatever i shall fail in doing this university will find that i shall do one thing and that is obey the apostolic precept study to be quiet and to do your own business     footnotes   1  grimm grammatik ii p 516  2  see grimm grammatik 2nd edit vol i p 108 vol ii p 581  3  lectures on the science of language vol ii p 232  4  forstemann mentions a latin
