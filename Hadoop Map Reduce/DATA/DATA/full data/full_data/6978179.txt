man  they were collected and republished while i was still a very young man and sent into the world with all their imperfections a good many on their heads  they comprise my first attempts at authorship—with the exception of certain tragedies achieved at the mature age of eight or ten and represented with great applause to overflowing nurseries  i am conscious of their often being extremely crude and illconsidered and bearing obvious marks of haste and inexperience particularly in that section of the present volume which is comprised under the general head of tales  but as this collection is not originated now and was very leniently and favourably received when it was first made i have not felt it right either to remodel or expunge beyond a few words and phrases here and there     our parish   chapter i—the beadle  the parish engine  the schoolmaster   how much is conveyed in those two short words—‘the parish’  and with how many tales of distress and misery of broken fortune and ruined hopes too often of unrelieved wretchedness and successful knavery are they associated  a poor man with small earnings and a large family just manages to live on from hand to mouth and to procure food from day to day he has barely sufficient to satisfy the present cravings of nature and can take no heed of the future  his taxes are in arrear quarterday passes by another quarterday arrives he can procure no more quarter for himself and is summoned by—the parish  his goods are distrained his children are crying with cold and hunger and the very bed on which his sick wife is lying is dragged from beneath her  what can he do  to whom is he to apply for relief  to private charity  to benevolent individuals  certainly not—there is his parish  there are the parish vestry the parish infirmary the parish surgeon the parish officers the parish beadle  excellent institutions and gentle kindhearted men the woman dies—she is buried by the parish  the children have no protector—they are taken care of by the parish  the man first neglects and afterwards cannot obtain work—he is relieved by the parish and when distress and drunkenness have done their work upon him he is maintained a harmless babbling idiot in the parish asylum  the parish beadle is one of the most perhaps the most important member of the local administration  he is not so well off as the churchwardens certainly nor is he so learned as the vestryclerk nor does he order things quite so much his own way as either of them  but his power is very great notwithstanding and the dignity of his office is never impaired by the absence of efforts on his part to maintain it the beadle of our parish is a splendid fellow  it is quite delightful to hear him as he explains the state of the existing poor laws to the deaf old women in the boardroom passage on business nights and to hear what he said to the senior churchwarden and what the senior churchwarden said to him and what ‘we’ the beadle and the other gentlemen came to the determination of doing  a miserablelooking woman is called into the boardroom and represents a case of extreme destitution affecting herself—a widow with six small children  ‘where do you live’ inquires one of the overseers  ‘i rents a twopair back gentlemen at mrs brown’s number 3 little king william’salley which has lived there this fifteen year and knows me to be very hardworking and industrious and when my poor husband was alive gentlemen as died in the hospital’—‘well well’ interrupts the overseer taking a note of the address ‘i’ll send simmons the beadle tomorrow morning to ascertain whether your story is correct and if so i suppose you must have an order into the house—simmons go to this woman’s the first thing tomorrow morning will you’  simmons bows assent and ushers the woman out  her previous admiration of ‘the board’ who all sit behind great books and with their hats on fades into nothing before her respect for her lacetrimmed conductor and her account of what has passed inside increases—if that be possible—the marks of respect shown by the assembled crowd to that solemn functionary  as to taking out a summons it’s quite a hopeless case if simmons attends it on behalf of the parish  he knows all the titles of the lord mayor by heart states the case without a single stammer and it is even reported that on one occasion he ventured to make a joke which the lord mayor’s head footman who happened to be present afterwards told an intimate friend confidentially was almost equal to one of mr hobler’s  see him again on sunday in his statecoat and cockedhat with a largeheaded staff for show in his left hand and a small cane for use in his right  how pompously he marshals the children into their places and how demurely the little urchins look at him askance as he surveys them when they are all seated with a glare of the eye peculiar to beadles the churchwardens and overseers being duly installed in their curtained pews he seats himself on a mahogany bracket erected expressly for him at the top of the aisle and divides his attention between his prayerbook and the boys  suddenly just at the commencement of the communion service when the whole congregation is hushed into a profound silence broken only by the voice of the officiating clergyman a penny is heard to ring on the stone floor of the aisle with astounding clearness  observe the generalship of the beadle  his involuntary look of horror is instantly changed into one of perfect indifference as if he were the only person present who had not heard the noise  the artifice succeeds  after putting forth his right leg now and then as a feeler the victim who dropped the money ventures to make one or two distinct dives after it and the beadle gliding softly round salutes his little round head when it again appears above the seat with divers double knocks administered with the cane before noticed to the intense delight of three young men in an adjacent pew who cough violently at intervals until the conclusion of the sermon  such are a few traits of the importance and gravity of a parish beadle—a gravity which has never been disturbed in any case that has come under our observation except when the services of that particularly useful machine a parish fireengine are required then indeed all is bustle two little boys run to the beadle as fast as their legs will carry them and report from their own personal observation that some neighbouring chimney is on fire the engine is hastily got out and a plentiful supply of boys being obtained and harnessed to it with ropes away they rattle over the pavement the beadle running—we do not exaggerate—running at the side until they arrive at some house smelling strongly of soot at the door of which the beadle knocks with considerable gravity for halfanhour  no attention being paid to these manual applications and the turncock having turned on the water the engine turns off amidst the shouts of the boys it pulls up once more at the workhouse and the beadle ‘pulls up’ the unfortunate householder next day for the amount of his legal reward  we never saw a parish engine at a regular fire but once  it came up in gallant style—three miles and a half an hour at least there was a capital supply of water and it was first on the spot bang went the pumps—the people cheered—the beadle perspired profusely but it was unfortunately discovered just as they were going to put the fire out that nobody understood the process by which the engine was filled with water and that eighteen boys and a man had exhausted themselves in pumping for twenty minutes without producing the slightest effect  the personages next in importance to the beadle are the master of the workhouse and the parish schoolmaster  the vestryclerk as everybody knows is a short pudgy little man in black with a thick gold watchchain of considerable length terminating in two large seals and a key  he is an attorney and generally in a bustle at no time more so than when he is hurrying to some parochial meeting with his gloves crumpled up in one hand and a large red book under the other arm  as to the churchwardens and overseers we exclude them altogether because all we know of them is that they are usually respectable tradesmen who wear hats with brims inclined to flatness and who occasionally testify in gilt letters on a blue ground in some conspicuous part of the church to the important fact of a gallery having being enlarged and beautified or an organ rebuilt  the master of the workhouse is not in our parish—nor is he usually in any other—one of that class of men the better part of whose existence has passed away and who drag out the remainder in some inferior situation with just enough thought of the past to feel degraded by and discontented with the present  we are unable to guess precisely to our own satisfaction what station the man can have occupied before we should think he had been an inferior sort of attorney’s clerk or else the master of a national school—whatever he was it is clear his present position is a change for the better  his income is small certainly as the rusty black coat and threadbare velvet collar demonstrate but then he lives free of houserent has a limited allowance of coals and candles and an almost unlimited allowance of authority in his petty kingdom  he is a tall thin bony man always wears shoes and black cotton stockings with his surtout and eyes you as you pass his parlourwindow as if he wished you were a pauper just to give you a specimen of his power  he is an admirable specimen of a small tyrant morose brutish and illtempered bullying to his inferiors cringing to his superiors and jealous of the influence and authority of the beadle  our schoolmaster is just the very reverse of this amiable official  he has been one of those men one occasionally hears of on whom misfortune seems to have set her mark nothing he ever did or was concerned in appears to have prospered  a rich old relation who had brought him up and openly announced his intention of providing for him left him 10000l in his will and revoked the bequest in a codicil  thus unexpectedly reduced to the necessity of providing for himself he procured a situation in a public office  the young clerks below him died off as if there were a plague among them but the old fellows over his head for the reversion of whose places he was anxiously waiting lived on and on as if they were immortal  he speculated and lost  he speculated again and won—but never got his money  his talents were great his disposition easy generous and liberal  his friends profited by the one and abused the other  loss succeeded loss misfortune crowded on misfortune each successive day brought him nearer the verge of hopeless penury and the quondam friends who had been warmest in their professions grew strangely cold and indifferent  he had children whom he loved and a wife on whom he doted  the former turned their backs on him the latter died brokenhearted  he went with the stream—it had ever been his failing and he had not courage sufficient to bear up against so many shocks—he had never cared for himself and the only being who had cared for him in his poverty and distress was spared to him no longer it was at this period that he applied for parochial relief  some kindhearted man who had known him in happier times chanced to be churchwarden that year and through his interest he was appointed to his present situation  he is an old man now  of the many who once crowded round him in all the hollow friendship of booncompanionship some have died some have fallen like himself some have prospered—all have forgotten him  time and misfortune have mercifully been permitted to impair his memory and use has habituated him to his present condition  meek uncomplaining and zealous in the discharge of his duties he has been allowed to hold his situation long beyond the usual period and he will no doubt continue to hold it until infirmity renders him incapable or death releases him as the greyheaded old man feebly paces up and down the sunny side of the little courtyard between school hours it would be difficult indeed for the most intimate of his former friends to recognise their once gay and happy associate in the person of the pauper schoolmaster    chapter ii—the curate  the old lady  the halfpay captain   we commenced our last chapter with the beadle of our parish because we are deeply sensible of the importance and dignity of his office  we will begin the present with the clergyman  our curate is a young gentleman of such prepossessing appearance and fascinating manners that within one month after his first appearance in the parish half the younglady inhabitants were melancholy with religion and the other half desponding with love  never were so many young ladies seen in our parish church on sunday before and never had the little round angels’ faces on mr tomkins’s monument in the side aisle beheld such devotion on earth as they all exhibited  he was about fiveandtwenty when he first came to astonish the parishioners  he parted his hair on the centre of his forehead in the form of a norman arch wore a brilliant of the first water on the fourth finger of his left hand which he always applied to his left cheek when he read prayers and had a deep sepulchral voice of unusual solemnity  innumerable were the calls made by prudent mammas on our new curate and innumerable the invitations with which he was assailed and which to do him justice he readily accepted  if his manner in the pulpit had created an impression in his favour the sensation was increased tenfold by his appearance in private circles pews in the immediate vicinity of the pulpit or readingdesk rose in value sittings in the centre aisle were at a premium an inch of room in the front row of the gallery could not be procured for love or money and some people even went so far as to assert that the three miss browns who had an obscure family pew just behind the churchwardens’ were detected one sunday in the free seats by the communiontable actually lying in wait for the curate as he passed to the vestry  he began to preach extempore sermons and even grave papas caught the infection  he got out of bed at halfpast twelve o’clock one winter’s night to halfbaptise a washerwoman’s child in a slopbasin and the gratitude of the parishioners knew no bounds—the very churchwardens grew generous and insisted on the parish defraying the expense of the watchbox on wheels which the new curate had ordered for himself to perform the funeral service in in wet weather  he sent three pints of gruel and a quarter of a pound of tea to a poor woman who had been brought to bed of four small children all at once—the parish were charmed  he got up a subscription for her—the woman’s fortune was made  he spoke for one hour and twentyfive minutes at an antislavery meeting at the goat and boots—the enthusiasm was at its height  a proposal was set on foot for presenting the curate with a piece of plate as a mark of esteem for his valuable services rendered to the parish  the list of subscriptions was filled up in no time the contest was not who should escape the contribution but who should be the foremost to subscribe  a splendid silver inkstand was made and engraved with an appropriate inscription the curate was invited to a public breakfast at the beforementioned goat and boots the inkstand was presented in a neat speech by mr gubbins the exchurchwarden and acknowledged by the curate in terms which drew tears into the eyes of all present—the very waiters were melted  one would have supposed that by this time the theme of universal admiration was lifted to the very pinnacle of popularity  no such thing the curate began to cough four fits of coughing one morning between the litany and the epistle and five in the afternoon service  here was a discovery—the curate was consumptive  how interestingly melancholy  if the young ladies were energetic before their sympathy and solicitude now knew no bounds  such a man as the curate—such a dear—such a perfect love—to be consumptive  it was too much  anonymous presents of blackcurrant jam and lozenges elastic waistcoats bosom friends and warm stockings poured in upon the curate until he was as completely fitted out with winter clothing as if he were on the verge of an expedition to the north pole verbal bulletins of the state of his health were circulated throughout the parish halfadozen times a day and the curate was in the very zenith of his popularity  about this period a change came over the spirit of the parish  a very quiet respectable dozing old gentleman who had officiated in our chapelofease for twelve years previously died one fine morning without having given any notice whatever of his intention  this circumstance gave rise to countersensation the first and the arrival of his successor occasioned countersensation the second  he was a pale thin cadaverous man with large black eyes and long straggling black hair his dress was slovenly in the extreme his manner ungainly his doctrines startling in short he was in every respect the antipodes of the curate  crowds of our female parishioners flocked to hear him at first because he was so oddlooking then because his face was so expressive then because he preached so well and at last because they really thought that after all there was something about him which it was quite impossible to describe  as to the curate he was all very well but certainly after all there was no denying that—that—in short the curate wasn’t a novelty and the other clergyman was  the inconstancy of public opinion is proverbial the congregation migrated one by one  the curate coughed till he was black in the face—it was in vain  he respired with difficulty—it was equally ineffectual in awakening sympathy  seats are once again to be had in any part of our parish church and the chapelofease is going to be enlarged as it is crowded to suffocation every sunday  the best known and most respected among our parishioners is an old lady who resided in our parish long before our name was registered in the list of baptisms  our parish is a suburban one and the old lady lives in a neat row of houses in the most airy and pleasant part of it  the house is her own and it and everything about it except the old lady herself who looks a little older than she did ten years ago is in just the same state as when the old gentleman was living  the little front parlour which is the old lady’s ordinary sittingroom is a perfect picture of quiet neatness the carpet is covered with brown holland the glass and pictureframes are carefully enveloped in yellow muslin the tablecovers are never taken off except when the leaves are turpentined and bees’waxed an operation which is regularly commenced every other morning at halfpast nine o’clock—and the little nicknacks are always arranged in precisely the same manner  the greater part of these are presents from little girls whose parents live in the same row but some of them such as the two oldfashioned watches which never keep the same time one being always a quarter of an hour too slow and the other a quarter of an hour too fast the little picture of the princess charlotte and prince leopold as they appeared in the royal box at drury lane theatre and others of the same class have been in the old lady’s possession for many years  here the old lady sits with her spectacles on busily engaged in needlework—near the window in summer time and if she sees you coming up the steps and you happen to be a favourite she trots out to open the streetdoor for you before you knock and as you must be fatigued after that hot walk insists on your swallowing two glasses of sherry before you exert yourself by talking  if you call in the evening you will find her cheerful but rather more serious than usual with an open bible on the table before her of which ‘sarah’ who is just as neat and methodical as her mistress regularly reads two or three chapters in the parlour aloud  the old lady sees scarcely any company except the little girls before noticed each of whom has always a regular fixed day for a periodical teadrinking with her to which the child looks forward as the greatest treat of its existence  she seldom visits at a greater distance than the next door but one on either side and when she drinks tea here sarah runs out first and knocks a doubleknock to prevent the possibility of her ‘missis’s’ catching cold by having to wait at the door  she is very scrupulous in returning these little invitations and when she asks mr and mrs soandso to meet mr and mrs somebodyelse sarah and she dust the urn and the best china teaservice and the pope joan board and the visitors are received in the drawingroom in great state  she has but few relations and they are scattered about in different parts of the country and she seldom sees them  she has a son in india whom she always describes to you as a fine handsome fellow—so like the profile of his poor dear father over the sideboard but the old lady adds with a mournful shake of the head that he has always been one of her greatest trials and that indeed he once almost broke her heart but it pleased god to enable her to get the better of it and she would prefer your never mentioning the subject to her again  she has a great number of pensioners and on saturday after she comes back from market there is a regular levee of old men and women in the passage waiting for their weekly gratuity  her name always heads the list of any benevolent subscriptions and hers are always the most liberal donations to the winter coal and soup distribution society  she subscribed twenty pounds towards the erection of an organ in our parish church and was so overcome the first sunday the children sang to it that she was obliged to be carried out by the pewopener  her entrance into church on sunday is always the signal for a little bustle in the side aisle occasioned by a general rise among the poor people who bow and curtsey until the pewopener has ushered the old lady into her accustomed seat dropped a respectful curtsey and shut the door and the same ceremony is repeated on her leaving church when she walks home with the family next door but one and talks about the sermon all the way invariably opening the conversation by asking the youngest boy where the text was  thus with the annual variation of a trip to some quiet place on the seacoast passes the old lady’s life  it has rolled on in the same unvarying and benevolent course for many years now and must at no distant period be brought to its final close  she looks forward to its termination with calmness and without apprehension  she has everything to hope and nothing to fear  a very different personage but one who has rendered himself very conspicuous in our parish is one of the old lady’s nextdoor neighbours he is an old naval officer on halfpay and his bluff and unceremonious behaviour disturbs the old lady’s domestic economy not a little  in the first place he will smoke cigars in the front court and when he wants something to drink with them—which is by no means an uncommon circumstance—he lifts up the old lady’s knocker with his walkingstick and demands to have a glass of table ale handed over the rails  in addition to this cool proceeding he is a bit of a jack of all trades or to use his own words ‘a regular robinson crusoe’ and nothing delights him better than to experimentalise on the old lady’s property  one morning he got up early and planted three or four roots of fullgrown marigolds in every bed of her front garden to the inconceivable astonishment of the old lady who actually thought when she got up and looked out of the window that it was some strange eruption which had come out in the night  another time he took to pieces the eightday clock on the front landing under pretence of cleaning the works which he put together again by some undiscovered process in so wonderful a manner that the large hand has done nothing but trip up the little one ever since  then he took to breeding silkworms which he would bring in two or three times a day in little paper boxes to show the old lady generally dropping a worm or two at every visit  the consequence was that one morning a very stout silkworm was discovered in the act of walking upstairs—probably with the view of inquiring after his friends for on further inspection it appeared that some of his companions had already found their way to every room in the house  the old lady went to the seaside in despair and during her absence he completely effaced the name from her brass doorplate in his attempts to polish it with aquafortis  but all this is nothing to his seditious conduct in public life  he attends every vestry meeting that is held always opposes the constituted authorities of the parish denounces the profligacy of the churchwardens contests legal points against the vestryclerk will make the taxgatherer call for his money till he won’t call any longer and then he sends it finds fault with the sermon every sunday says that the organist ought to be ashamed of himself offers to back himself for any amount to sing the psalms better than all the children put together male and female and in short conducts himself in the most turbulent and uproarious manner  the worst of it is that having a high regard for the old lady he wants to make her a convert to his views and therefore walks into her little parlour with his newspaper in his hand and talks violent politics by the hour  he is a charitable openhearted old fellow at bottom after all so although he puts the old lady a little out occasionally they agree very well in the main and she laughs as much at each feat of his handiwork when it is all over as anybody else    chapter iii—the four sisters   the row of houses in which the old lady and her troublesome neighbour reside comprises beyond all doubt a greater number of characters within its circumscribed limits than all the rest of the parish put together  as we cannot consistently with our present plan however extend the number of our parochial sketches beyond six it will be better perhaps to select the most peculiar and to introduce them at once without further preface  the four miss willises then settled in our parish thirteen years ago it is a melancholy reflection that the old adage ‘time and tide wait for no man’ applies with equal force to the fairer portion of the creation and willingly would we conceal the fact that even thirteen years ago the miss willises were far from juvenile  our duty as faithful parochial chroniclers however is paramount to every other consideration and we are bound to state that thirteen years since the authorities in matrimonial cases considered the youngest miss willis in a very precarious state while the eldest sister was positively given over as being far beyond all human hope  well the miss willises took a lease of the house it was fresh painted and papered from top to bottom the paint inside was all wainscoted the marble all cleaned the old grates taken down and registerstoves you could see to dress by put up four trees were planted in the back garden several small baskets of gravel sprinkled over the front one vans of elegant furniture arrived spring blinds were fitted to the windows carpenters who had been employed in the various preparations alterations and repairs made confidential statements to the different maidservants in the row relative to the magnificent scale on which the miss willises were commencing the maidservants told their ‘missises’ the missises told their friends and vague rumours were circulated throughout the parish that no 25 in gordonplace had been taken by four maiden ladies of immense property  at last the miss willises moved in and then the ‘calling’ began  the house was the perfection of neatness—so were the four miss willises everything was formal stiff and cold—so were the four miss willises not a single chair of the whole set was ever seen out of its place—not a single miss willis of the whole four was ever seen out of hers  there they always sat in the same places doing precisely the same things at the same hour  the eldest miss willis used to knit the second to draw the two others to play duets on the piano  they seemed to have no separate existence but to have made up their minds just to winter through life together  they were three long graces in drapery with the addition like a schooldinner of another long grace afterwards—the three fates with another sister—the siamese twins multiplied by two  the eldest miss willis grew bilious—the four miss willises grew bilious immediately  the eldest miss willis grew illtempered and religious—the four miss willises were illtempered and religious directly  whatever the eldest did the others did and whatever anybody else did they all disapproved of and thus they vegetated—living in polar harmony among themselves and as they sometimes went out or saw company ‘in a quietway’ at home occasionally icing the neighbours  three years passed over in this way when an unlooked for and extraordinary phenomenon occurred  the miss willises showed symptoms of summer the frost gradually broke up a complete thaw took place  was it possible one of the four miss willises was going to be married  now where on earth the husband came from by what feelings the poor man could have been actuated or by what process of reasoning the four miss willises succeeded in persuading themselves that it was possible for a man to marry one of them without marrying them all are questions too profound for us to resolve certain it is however that the visits of mr robinson a gentleman in a public office with a good salary and a little property of his own besides were received—that the four miss willises were courted in due form by the said mr robinson—that the neighbours were perfectly frantic in their anxiety to discover which of the four miss willises was the fortunate fair and that the difficulty they experienced in solving the problem was not at all lessened by the announcement of the eldest miss willis—‘we are going to marry mr robinson’  it was very extraordinary  they were so completely identified the one with the other that the curiosity of the whole row—even of the old lady herself—was roused almost beyond endurance  the subject was discussed at every little cardtable and teadrinking  the old gentleman of silkworm notoriety did not hesitate to express his decided opinion that mr robinson was of eastern descent and contemplated marrying the whole family at once and the row generally shook their heads with considerable gravity and declared the business to be very mysterious they hoped it might all end well—it certainly had a very singular appearance but still it would be uncharitable to express any opinion without good grounds to go upon and certainly the miss willises were quite old enough to judge for themselves and to be sure people ought to know their own business best and so forth  at last one fine morning at a quarter before eight o’clock am two glasscoaches drove up to the miss willises’ door at which mr robinson had arrived in a cab ten minutes before dressed in a lightblue coat and doublemilled kersey pantaloons white neckerchief pumps and dressgloves his manner denoting as appeared from the evidence of the housemaid at no 23 who was sweeping the doorsteps at the time a considerable degree of nervous excitement  it was also hastily reported on the same testimony that the cook who opened the door wore a large white bow of unusual dimensions in a much smarter headdress than the regulation cap to which the miss willises invariably restricted the somewhat excursive tastes of female servants in general  the intelligence spread rapidly from house to house  it was quite clear that the eventful morning had at length arrived the whole row stationed themselves behind their first and second floor blinds and waited the result in breathless expectation  at last the miss willises’ door opened the door of the first glasscoach did the same  two gentlemen and a pair of ladies to correspond—friends of the family no doubt up went the steps bang went the door off went the first classcoach and up came the second  the street door opened again the excitement of the whole row increased—mr robinson and the eldest miss willis  ‘i thought so’ said the lady at no 19 ‘i always said it was miss willis’—‘well i never’ ejaculated the young lady at no 18 to the young lady at no 17—‘did you ever dear’ responded the young lady at no 17 to the young lady at no 18  ‘it’s too ridiculous’ exclaimed a spinster of an uncertain age at no 16 joining in the conversation  but who shall portray the astonishment of gordonplace when mr robinson handed in all the miss willises one after the other and then squeezed himself into an acute angle of the glasscoach which forthwith proceeded at a brisk pace after the other glasscoach which other glasscoach had itself proceeded at a brisk pace in the direction of the parish church who shall depict the perplexity of the clergyman when all the miss willises knelt down at the communiontable and repeated the responses incidental to the marriage service in an audible voice—or who shall describe the confusion which prevailed when—even after the difficulties thus occasioned had been adjusted—all the miss willises went into hysterics at the conclusion of the ceremony until the sacred edifice resounded with their united wailings  as the four sisters and mr robinson continued to occupy the same house after this memorable occasion and as the married sister whoever she was never appeared in public without the other three we are not quite clear that the neighbours ever would have discovered the real mrs robinson but for a circumstance of the most gratifying description which will happen occasionally in the bestregulated families  three quarterdays elapsed and the row on whom a new light appeared to have been bursting for some time began to speak with a sort of implied confidence on the subject and to wonder how mrs robinson—the youngest miss willis that was—got on and servants might be seen running up the steps about nine or ten o’clock every morning with ‘missis’s compliments and wishes to know how mrs robinson finds herself this morning’  and the answer always was ‘mrs robinson’s compliments and she’s in very good spirits and doesn’t find herself any worse’  the piano was heard no longer the knittingneedles were laid aside drawing was neglected and mantuamaking and millinery on the smallest scale imaginable appeared to have become the favourite amusement of the whole family  the parlour wasn’t quite as tidy as it used to be and if you called in the morning you would see lying on a table with an old newspaper carelessly thrown over them two or three particularly small caps rather larger than if they had been made for a moderatesized doll with a small piece of lace in the shape of a horseshoe let in behind or perhaps a white robe not very large in circumference but very much out of proportion in point of length with a little tucker round the top and a frill round the bottom and once when we called we saw a long white roller with a kind of blue margin down each side the probable use of which we were at a loss to conjecture  then we fancied that dr dawson the surgeon c who displays a large lamp with a different colour in every pane of glass at the corner of the row began to be knocked up at night oftener than he used to be and once we were very much alarmed by hearing a hackneycoach stop at mrs robinson’s door at halfpast two o’clock in the morning out of which there emerged a fat old woman in a cloak and nightcap with a bundle in one hand and a pair of pattens in the other who looked as if she had been suddenly knocked up out of bed for some very special purpose  when we got up in the morning we saw that the knocker was tied up in an old white kid glove and we in our innocence we were in a state of bachelorship then wondered what on earth it all meant until we heard the eldest miss willis in propriâ personâ say with great dignity in answer to the next inquiry ‘my compliments and mrs robinson’s doing as well as can be expected and the little girl thrives wonderfully’ and then in common with the rest of the row our curiosity was satisfied and we began to wonder it had never occurred to us what the matter was before    chapter iv—the election for beadle   a great event has recently occurred in our parish  a contest of paramount interest has just terminated a parochial convulsion has taken place  it has been succeeded by a glorious triumph which the country—or at least the parish—it is all the same—will long remember  we have had an election an election for beadle  the supporters of the old beadle system have been defeated in their stronghold and the advocates of the great new beadle principles have achieved a proud victory  our parish which like all other parishes is a little world of its own has long been divided into two parties whose contentions slumbering for a while have never failed to burst forth with unabated vigour on any occasion on which they could by possibility be renewed  watchingrates lightingrates pavingrates sewer’srates churchrates poor’srates—all sorts of rates have been in their turns the subjects of a grand struggle and as to questions of patronage the asperity and determination with which they have been contested is scarcely credible  the leader of the official party—the steady advocate of the churchwardens and the unflinching supporter of the overseers—is an old gentleman who lives in our row  he owns some half a dozen houses in it and always walks on the opposite side of the way so that he may be able to take in a view of the whole of his property at once  he is a tall thin bony man with an interrogative nose and little restless perking eyes which appear to have been given him for the sole purpose of peeping into other people’s affairs with  he is deeply impressed with the importance of our parish business and prides himself not a little on his style of addressing the parishioners in vestry assembled  his views are rather confined than extensive his principles more narrow than liberal  he has been heard to declaim very loudly in favour of the liberty of the press and advocates the repeal of the stamp duty on newspapers because the daily journals who now have a monopoly of the public never give verbatim reports of vestry meetings  he would not appear egotistical for the world but at the same time he must say that there are speeches—that celebrated speech of his own on the emoluments of the sexton and the duties of the office for instance—which might be communicated to the public greatly to their improvement and advantage  his great opponent in public life is captain purday the old naval officer on halfpay to whom we have already introduced our readers  the captain being a determined opponent of the constituted authorities whoever they may chance to be and our other friend being their steady supporter with an equal disregard of their individual merits it will readily be supposed that occasions for their coming into direct collision are neither few nor far between  they divided the vestry fourteen times on a motion for heating the church with warm water instead of coals and made speeches about liberty and expenditure and prodigality and hot water which threw the whole parish into a state of excitement  then the captain when he was on the visiting committee and his opponent overseer brought forward certain distinct and specific charges relative to the management of the workhouse boldly expressed his total want of confidence in the existing authorities and moved for ‘a copy of the recipe by which the paupers’ soup was prepared together with any documents relating thereto’  this the overseer steadily resisted he fortified himself by precedent appealed to the established usage and declined to produce the papers on the ground of the injury that would be done to the public service if documents of a strictly private nature passing between the master of the workhouse and the cook were to be thus dragged to light on the motion of any individual member of the vestry the motion was lost by a majority of two and then the captain who never allows himself to be defeated moved for a committee of inquiry into the whole subject  the affair grew serious the question was discussed at meeting after meeting and vestry after vestry speeches were made attacks repudiated personal defiances exchanged explanations received and the greatest excitement prevailed until at last just as the question was going to be finally decided the vestry found that somehow or other they had become entangled in a point of form from which it was impossible to escape with propriety  so the motion was dropped and everybody looked extremely important and seemed quite satisfied with the meritorious nature of the whole proceeding  this was the state of affairs in our parish a week or two since when simmons the beadle suddenly died  the lamented deceased had overexerted himself a day or two previously in conveying an aged female highly intoxicated to the strong room of the workhouse  the excitement thus occasioned added to a severe cold which this indefatigable officer had caught in his capacity of director of the parish engine by inadvertently playing over himself instead of a fire proved too much for a constitution already enfeebled by age and the intelligence was conveyed to the board one evening that simmons had died and left his respects  the breath was scarcely out of the body of the deceased functionary when the field was filled with competitors for the vacant office each of whom rested his claims to public support entirely on the number and extent of his family as if the office of beadle were originally instituted as an encouragement for the propagation of the human species  ‘bung for beadle  five small children’—‘hopkins for beadle  seven small children’—‘timkins for beadle  nine small children’  such were the placards in large black letters on a white ground which were plentifully pasted on the walls and posted in the windows of the principal shops timkins’s success was considered certain several mothers of families half promised their votes and the nine small children would have run over the course but for the production of another placard announcing the appearance of a still more meritorious candidate  ‘spruggins for beadle  ten small children two of them twins and a wife’  there was no resisting this ten small children would have been almost irresistible in themselves without the twins but the touching parenthesis about that interesting production of nature and the still more touching allusion to mrs spruggins must ensure success  spruggins was the favourite at once and the appearance of his lady as she went about to solicit votes which encouraged confident hopes of a still further addition to the house of spruggins at no remote period increased the general prepossession in his favour  the other candidates bung alone excepted resigned in despair  the day of election was fixed and the canvass proceeded with briskness and perseverance on both sides  the members of the vestry could not be supposed to escape the contagious excitement inseparable from the occasion  the majority of the lady inhabitants of the parish declared at once for spruggins and the quondam overseer took the same side on the ground that men with large families always had been elected to the office and that although he must admit that in other respects spruggins was the least qualified candidate of the two still it was an old practice and he saw no reason why an old practice should be departed from  this was enough for the captain  he immediately sided with bung canvassed for him personally in all directions wrote squibs on spruggins and got his butcher to skewer them up on conspicuous joints in his shopfront frightened his neighbour the old lady into a palpitation of the heart by his awful denunciations of spruggins’s party and bounced in and out and up and down and backwards and forwards until all the sober inhabitants of the parish thought it inevitable that he must die of a brain fever long before the election began  the day of election arrived  it was no longer an individual struggle but a party contest between the ins and outs  the question was whether the withering influence of the overseers the domination of the churchwardens and the blighting despotism of the vestryclerk should be allowed to render the election of beadle a form—a nullity whether they should impose a vestryelected beadle on the parish to do their bidding and forward their views or whether the parishioners fearlessly asserting their undoubted rights should elect an independent beadle of their own  the nomination was fixed to take place in the vestry but so great was the throng of anxious spectators that it was found necessary to adjourn to the church where the ceremony commenced with due solemnity  the appearance of the churchwardens and overseers and the exchurchwardens and exoverseers with spruggins in the rear excited general attention spruggins was a little thin man in rusty black with a long pale face and a countenance expressive of care and fatigue which might either be attributed to the extent of his family or the anxiety of his feelings his opponent appeared in a castoff coat of the captain’s—a blue coat with bright buttons white trousers and that description of shoes familiarly known by the appellation of ‘highlows’  there was a serenity in the open countenance of bung—a kind of moral dignity in his confident air—an ‘i wish you may get it’ sort of expression in his eye—which infused animation into his supporters and evidently dispirited his opponents  the exchurchwarden rose to propose thomas spruggins for beadle  he had known him long  he had had his eye upon him closely for years he had watched him with twofold vigilance for months  a parishioner here suggested that this might be termed ‘taking a double sight’ but the observation was drowned in loud cries of ‘order’  he would repeat that he had had his eye upon him for years and this he would say that a more wellconducted a more wellbehaved a more sober a more quiet man with a more wellregulated mind he had never met with  a man with a larger family he had never known cheers  the parish required a man who could be depended on ‘hear’ from the spruggins side answered by ironical cheers from the bung party  such a man he now proposed ‘no’ ‘yes’ he would not allude to individuals the exchurchwarden continued in the celebrated negative style adopted by great speakers  he would not advert to a gentleman who had once held a high rank in the service of his majesty he would not say that that gentleman was no gentleman he would not assert that that man was no man he would not say that he was a turbulent parishioner he would not say that he had grossly misbehaved himself not only on this but on all former occasions he would not say that he was one of those discontented and treasonable spirits who carried confusion and disorder wherever they went he would not say that he harboured in his heart envy and hatred and malice and all uncharitableness  no  he wished to have everything comfortable and pleasant and therefore he would say—nothing about him cheers  the captain replied in a similar parliamentary style  he would not say he was astonished at the speech they had just heard he would not say he was disgusted cheers  he would not retort the epithets which had been hurled against him renewed cheering he would not allude to men once in office but now happily out of it who had mismanaged the workhouse ground the paupers diluted the beer slackbaked the bread boned the meat heightened the work and lowered the soup tremendous cheers  he would not ask what such men deserved a voice ‘nothing aday and find themselves’  he would not say that one burst of general indignation should drive them from the parish they polluted with their presence ‘give it him’  he would not allude to the unfortunate man who had been proposed—he would not say as the vestry’s tool but as beadle  he would not advert to that individual’s family he would not say that nine children twins and a wife were very bad examples for pauper imitation loud cheers  he would not advert in detail to the qualifications of bung  the man stood before him and he would not say in his presence what he might be disposed to say of him if he were absent  here mr bung telegraphed to a friend near him under cover of his hat by contracting his left eye and applying his right thumb to the tip of his nose  it had been objected to bung that he had only five children ‘hear hear’ from the opposition  well he had yet to learn that the legislature had affixed any precise amount of infantine qualification to the office of beadle but taking it for granted that an extensive family were a great requisite he entreated them to look to facts and compare data about which there could be no mistake  bung was 35 years of age spruggins—of whom he wished to speak with all possible respect—was 50 was it not more than possible—was it not very probable—that by the time bung attained the latter age he might see around him a family even exceeding in number and extent that to which spruggins at present laid claim deafening cheers and waving of handkerchiefs  the captain concluded amidst loud applause by calling upon the parishioners to sound the tocsin rush to the poll free themselves from dictation or be slaves for ever  on the following day the polling began and we never have had such a bustle in our parish since we got up our famous antislavery petition which was such an important one that the house of commons ordered it to be printed on the motion of the member for the district  the captain engaged two hackneycoaches and a cab for bung’s people—the cab for the drunken voters and the two coaches for the old ladies the greater portion of whom owing to the captain’s impetuosity were driven up to the poll and home again before they recovered from their flurry sufficiently to know with any degree of clearness what they had been doing  the opposite party wholly neglected these precautions and the consequence was that a great many ladies who were walking leisurely up to the church—for it was a very hot day—to vote for spruggins were artfully decoyed into the coaches and voted for bung  the captain’s arguments too had produced considerable effect the attempted influence of the vestry produced a greater  a threat of exclusive dealing was clearly established against the vestryclerk—a case of heartless and profligate atrocity  it appeared that the delinquent had been in the habit of purchasing six penn’orth of muffins weekly from an old woman who rents a small house in the parish and resides among the original settlers on her last weekly visit a message was conveyed to her through the medium of the cook couched in mysterious terms but indicating with sufficient clearness that the vestryclerk’s appetite for muffins in future depended entirely on her vote on the beadleship  this was sufficient the stream had been turning previously and the impulse thus administered directed its final course  the bung party ordered one shilling’sworth of muffins weekly for the remainder of the old woman’s natural life the parishioners were loud in their exclamations and the fate of spruggins was sealed  it was in vain that the twins were exhibited in dresses of the same pattern and nightcaps to match at the church door the boy in mrs spruggins’s right arm and the girl in her left—even mrs spruggins herself failed to be an object of sympathy any longer  the majority attained by bung on the gross poll was four hundred and twentyeight and the cause of the parishioners triumphed    chapter v—the broker’s man   the excitement of the late election has subsided and our parish being once again restored to a state of comparative tranquillity we are enabled to devote our attention to those parishioners who take little share in our party contests or in the turmoil and bustle of public life and we feel sincere pleasure in acknowledging here that in collecting materials for this task we have been greatly assisted by mr bung himself who has imposed on us a debt of obligation which we fear we can never repay  the life of this gentleman has been one of a very chequered description he has undergone transitions—not from grave to gay for he never was grave—not from lively to severe for severity forms no part of his disposition his fluctuations have been between poverty in the extreme and poverty modified or to use his own emphatic language ‘between nothing to eat and just half enough’  he is not as he forcibly remarks ‘one of those fortunate men who if they were to dive under one side of a barge starknaked would come up on the other with a new suit of clothes on and a ticket for soup in the waistcoatpocket’ neither is he one of those whose spirit has been broken beyond redemption by misfortune and want  he is just one of the careless goodfornothing happy fellows who float corklike on the surface for the world to play at hockey with knocked here and there and everywhere now to the right then to the left again up in the air and anon to the bottom but always reappearing and bounding with the stream buoyantly and merrily along  some few months before he was prevailed upon to stand a contested election for the office of beadle necessity attached him to the service of a broker and on the opportunities he here acquired of ascertaining the condition of most of the poorer inhabitants of the parish his patron the captain first grounded his claims to public support  chance threw the man in our way a short time since  we were in the first instance attracted by his prepossessing impudence at the election we were not surprised on further acquaintance to find him a shrewd knowing fellow with no inconsiderable power of observation and after conversing with him a little were somewhat struck as we dare say our readers have frequently been in other cases with the power some men seem to have not only of sympathising with but to all appearance of understanding feelings to which they themselves are entire strangers  we had been expressing to the new functionary our surprise that he should ever have served in the capacity to which we have just adverted when we gradually led him into one or two professional anecdotes  as we are induced to think on reflection that they will tell better in nearly his own words than with any attempted embellishments of ours we will at once entitle them                             mr bung’s narrative  ‘it’s very true as you say sir’ mr bung commenced ‘that a broker’s man’s is not a life to be envied and in course you know as well as i do though you don’t say it that people hate and scout ’em because they’re the ministers of wretchedness like to poor people  but what could i do sir  the thing was no worse because i did it instead of somebody else and if putting me in possession of a house would put me in possession of three and sixpence a day and levying a distress on another man’s goods would relieve my distress and that of my family it can’t be expected but what i’d take the job and go through with it  i never liked it god knows i always looked out for something else and the moment i got other work to do i left it  if there is anything wrong in being the agent in such matters—not the principal mind you—i’m sure the business to a beginner like i was at all events carries its own punishment along with it  i wished again and again that the people would only blow me up or pitch into me—that i wouldn’t have minded it’s all in my way but it’s the being shut up by yourself in one room for five days without so much as an old newspaper to look at or anything to see out o’ the winder but the roofs and chimneys at the back of the house or anything to listen to but the ticking perhaps of an old dutch clock the sobbing of the missis now and then the low talking of friends in the next room who speak in whispers lest “the man” should overhear them or perhaps the occasional opening of the door as a child peeps in to look at you and then runs halffrightened away—it’s all this that makes you feel sneaking somehow and ashamed of yourself and then if it’s wintertime they just give you fire enough to make you think you’d like more and bring in your grub as if they wished it ’ud choke you—as i dare say they do for the matter of that most heartily  if they’re very civil they make you up a bed in the room at night and if they don’t your master sends one in for you but there you are without being washed or shaved all the time shunned by everybody and spoken to by no one unless some one comes in at dinnertime and asks you whether you want any more in a tone as much to say “i hope you don’t” or in the evening to inquire whether you wouldn’t rather have a candle after you’ve been sitting in the dark half the night  when i was left in this way i used to sit think think thinking till i felt as lonesome as a kitten in a washhouse copper with the lid on but i believe the old brokers’ men who are regularly trained to it never think at all  i have heard some on ’em say indeed that they don’t know how  ‘i put in a good many distresses in my time continued mr bung and in course i wasn’t long in finding that some people are not as much to be pitied as others are and that people with good incomes who get into difficulties which they keep patching up day after day and week after week get so used to these sort of things in time that at last they come scarcely to feel them at all  i remember the very first place i was put in possession of was a gentleman’s house in this parish here that everybody would suppose couldn’t help having money if he tried  i went with old fixem my old master ’bout half arter eight in the morning rang the areabell servant in livery opened the door “governor at home”—“yes he is” says the man “but he’s breakfasting just now” “never mind” says fixem “just you tell him there’s a gentleman here as wants to speak to him partickler”  so the servant he opens his eyes and stares about him all ways—looking for the gentleman as it struck me for i don’t think anybody but a man as was stoneblind would mistake fixem for one and as for me i was as seedy as a cheap cowcumber  hows’ever he turns round and goes to the breakfastparlour which was a little snug sort of room at the end of the passage and fixem as we always did in that profession without waiting to be announced walks in arter him and before the servant could get out “please sir here’s a man as wants to speak to you” looks in at the door as familiar and pleasant as may be  “who the devil are you and how dare you walk into a gentleman’s house without leave” says the master as fierce as a bull in fits  “my name” says fixem winking to the master to send the servant away and putting the warrant into his hands folded up like a note “my name’s smith” says he “and i called from johnson’s about that business of thompson’s”—“oh” says the other quite down on him directly “how is thompson” says he “pray sit down mr smith john leave the room” out went the servant and the gentleman and fixem looked at one another till they couldn’t look any longer and then they varied the amusements by looking at me who had been standing on the mat all this time “hundred and fifty pounds i see” said the gentleman at last  “hundred and fifty pound” said fixem “besides cost of levy sheriff’s poundage and all other incidental expenses”—“um” says the gentleman “i shan’t be able to settle this before tomorrow afternoon”—“very sorry but i shall be obliged to leave my man here till then” replies fixem pretending to look very miserable over it  “that’s very unfort’nate” says the gentleman “for i have got a large party here tonight and i’m ruined if those fellows of mine get an inkling of the matter—just step here mr smith” says he after a short pause  so fixem walks with him up to the window and after a good deal of whispering and a little chinking of suverins and looking at me he comes back and says “bung you’re a handy fellow and very honest i know  this gentleman wants an assistant to clean the plate and wait at table today and if you’re not particularly engaged” says old fixem grinning like mad and shoving a couple of suverins into my hand “he’ll be very glad to avail himself of your services”  well i laughed and the gentleman laughed and we all laughed and i went home and cleaned myself leaving fixem there and when i went back fixem went away and i polished up the plate and waited at table and gammoned the servants and nobody had the least idea i was in possession though it very nearly came out after all for one of the last gentlemen who remained came downstairs into the hall where i was sitting pretty late at night and putting halfacrown into my hand says “here my man” says he “run and get me a coach will you”  i thought it was a do to get me out of the house and was just going to say so sulkily enough when the gentleman who was up to everything came running downstairs as if he was in great anxiety  “bung” says he pretending to be in a consuming passion  “sir” says i  “why the devil an’t you looking after that plate”—“i was just going to send him for a coach for me” says the other gentleman  “and i was just agoing to say” says i—“anybody else my dear fellow” interrupts the master of the house pushing me down the passage to get out of the way—“anybody else but i have put this man in possession of all the plate and valuables and i cannot allow him on any consideration whatever to leave the house  bung you scoundrel go and count those forks in the breakfastparlour instantly”  you may be sure i went laughing pretty hearty when i found it was all right  the money was paid next day with the addition of something else for myself and that was the best job that i and i suspect old fixem too ever got in that line  ‘but this is the bright side of the picture sir after all’ resumed mr bung laying aside the knowing look and flash air with which he had repeated the previous anecdote—‘and i’m sorry to say it’s the side one sees very very seldom in comparison with the dark one  the civility which money will purchase is rarely extended to those who have none and there’s a consolation even in being able to patch up one difficulty to make way for another to which very poor people are strangers  i was once put into a house down george’syard—that little dirty court at the back of the gasworks and i never shall forget the misery of them people dear me  it was a distress for half a year’s rent—two pound ten i think  there was only two rooms in the house and as there was no passage the lodgers upstairs always went through the room of the people of the house as they passed in and out and every time they did so—which on the average was about four times every quarter of an hour—they blowed up quite frightful for their things had been seized too and included in the inventory  there was a little piece of enclosed dust in front of the house with a cinderpath leading up to the door and an open rainwater butt on one side  a dirty striped curtain on a very slack string hung in the window and a little triangular bit of broken lookingglass rested on the sill inside  i suppose it was meant for the people’s use but their appearance was so wretched and so miserable that i’m certain they never could have plucked up courage to look themselves in the face a second time if they survived the fright of doing so once  there was two or three chairs that might have been worth in their best days from eightpence to a shilling apiece a small deal table an old corner cupboard with nothing in it and one of those bedsteads which turn up half way and leave the bottom legs sticking out for you to knock your head against or hang your hat upon no bed no bedding  there was an old sack by way of rug before the fireplace and four or five children were grovelling about among the sand on the floor the execution was only put in to get ’em out of the house for there was nothing to take to pay the expenses and here i stopped for three days though that was a mere form too for in course i knew and we all knew they could never pay the money  in one of the chairs by the side of the place where the fire ought to have been was an old ’ooman—the ugliest and dirtiest i ever see—who sat rocking herself backwards and forwards backwards and forwards without once stopping except for an instant now and then to clasp together the withered hands which with these exceptions she kept constantly rubbing upon her knees just raising and depressing her fingers convulsively in time to the rocking of the chair on the other side sat the mother with an infant in her arms which cried till it cried itself to sleep and when it ’woke cried till it cried itself off again  the old ’ooman’s voice i never heard she seemed completely stupefied and as to the mother’s it would have been better if she had been so too for misery had changed her to a devil  if you had heard how she cursed the little naked children as was rolling on the floor and seen how savagely she struck the infant when it cried with hunger you’d have shuddered as much as i did  there they remained all the time the children ate a morsel of bread once or twice and i gave ’em best part of the dinners my missis brought me but the woman ate nothing they never even laid on the bedstead nor was the room swept or cleaned all the time  the neighbours were all too poor themselves to take any notice of ’em but from what i could make out from the abuse of the woman upstairs it seemed the husband had been transported a few weeks before  when the time was up the landlord and old fixem too got rather frightened about the family and so they made a stir about it and had ’em taken to the workhouse  they sent the sick couch for the old ’ooman and simmons took the children away at night  the old ’ooman went into the infirmary and very soon died  the children are all in the house to this day and very comfortable they are in comparison  as to the mother there was no taming her at all  she had been a quiet hardworking woman i believe but her misery had actually drove her wild so after she had been sent to the house of correction halfadozen times for throwing inkstands at the overseers blaspheming the churchwardens and smashing everybody as come near her she burst a bloodvessel one mornin’ and died too and a happy release it was both for herself and the old paupers male and female which she used to tip over in all directions as if they were so many skittles and she the ball  ‘now this was bad enough’ resumed mr bung taking a halfstep towards the door as if to intimate that he had nearly concluded  ‘this was bad enough but there was a sort of quiet misery—if you understand what i mean by that sir—about a lady at one house i was put into as touched me a good deal more  it doesn’t matter where it was exactly indeed i’d rather not say but it was the same sort o’ job  i went with fixem in the usual way—there was a year’s rent in arrear a very small servantgirl opened the door and three or four finelooking little children was in the front parlour we were shown into which was very clean but very scantily furnished much like the children themselves “bung” says fixem to me in a low voice when we were left alone for a minute “i know something about this here family and my opinion is it’s no go”  “do you think they can’t settle” says i quite anxiously for i liked the looks of them children  fixem shook his head and was just about to reply when the door opened and in come a lady as white as ever i see any one in my days except about the eyes which were red with crying  she walked in as firm as i could have done shut the door carefully after her and sat herself down with a face as composed as if it was made of stone  “what is the matter gentlemen” says she in a surprisin’ steady voice  “is this an execution”  “it is mum” says fixem  the lady looked at him as steady as ever she didn’t seem to have understood him  “it is mum” says fixem again “this is my warrant of distress mum” says he handing it over as polite as if it was a newspaper which had been bespoke arter the next gentleman  ‘the lady’s lip trembled as she took the printed paper  she cast her eye over it and old fixem began to explain the form but saw she wasn’t reading it plain enough poor thing  “oh my god” says she suddenly abursting out crying letting the warrant fall and hiding her face in her hands  “oh my god what will become of us”  the noise she made brought in a young lady of about nineteen or twenty who i suppose had been alistening at the door and who had got a little boy in her arms she sat him down in the lady’s lap without speaking and she hugged the poor little fellow to her bosom and cried over him till even old fixem put on his blue spectacles to hide the two tears that was atrickling down one on each side of his dirty face  “now dear ma” says the young lady “you know how much you have borne  for all our sakes—for pa’s sake” says she “don’t give way to this”—“no no i won’t” says the lady gathering herself up hastily and drying her eyes “i am very foolish but i’m better now—much better”  and then she roused herself up went with us into every room while we took the inventory opened all the drawers of her own accord sorted the children’s little clothes to make the work easier and except doing everything in a strange sort of hurry seemed as calm and composed as if nothing had happened  when we came downstairs again she hesitated a minute or two and at last says “gentlemen” says she “i am afraid i have done wrong and perhaps it may bring you into trouble  i secreted just now” she says “the only trinket i have left in the world—here it is”  so she lays down on the table a little miniature mounted in gold  “it’s a miniature” she says “of my poor dear father  i little thought once that i should ever thank god for depriving me of the original but i do and have done for years back most fervently  take it away sir” she says “it’s a face that never turned from me in sickness and distress and i can hardly bear to turn from it now when god knows i suffer both in no ordinary degree” i couldn’t say nothing but i raised my head from the inventory which i was filling up and looked at fixem the old fellow nodded to me significantly so i ran my pen through the “mini” i had just written and left the miniature on the table  ‘well sir to make short of a long story i was left in possession and in possession i remained and though i was an ignorant man and the master of the house a clever one i saw what he never did but what he would give worlds now if he had ’em to have seen in time  i saw sir that his wife was wasting away beneath cares of which she never complained and griefs she never told  i saw that she was dying before his eyes i knew that one exertion from him might have saved her but he never made it  i don’t blame him i don’t think he could rouse himself  she had so long anticipated all his wishes and acted for him that he was a lost man when left to himself  i used to think when i caught sight of her in the clothes she used to wear which looked shabby even upon her and would have been scarcely decent on any one else that if i was a gentleman it would wring my very heart to see the woman that was a smart and merry girl when i courted her so altered through her love for me  bitter cold and damp weather it was yet though her dress was thin and her shoes none of the best during the whole three days from morning to night she was out of doors running about to try and raise the money  the money was raised and the execution was paid out the whole family crowded into the room where i was when the money arrived  the father was quite happy as the inconvenience was removed—i dare say he didn’t know how the children looked merry and cheerful again the eldest girl was bustling about making preparations for the first comfortable meal they had had since the distress was put in and the mother looked pleased to see them all so  but if ever i saw death in a woman’s face i saw it in hers that night  ‘i was right sir’ continued mr bung hurriedly passing his coatsleeve over his face ‘the family grew more prosperous and good fortune arrived  but it was too late  those children are motherless now and their father would give up all he has since gained—house home goods money all that he has or ever can have to restore the wife he has lost’    chapter vi—the ladies’ societies   our parish is very prolific in ladies’ charitable institutions  in winter when wet feet are common and colds not scarce we have the ladies’ soup distribution society the ladies’ coal distribution society and the ladies’ blanket distribution society in summer when stone fruits flourish and stomach aches prevail we have the ladies’ dispensary and the ladies’ sick visitation committee and all the year round we have the ladies’ child’s examination society the ladies’ bible and prayerbook circulation society and the ladies’ childbedlinen monthly loan society  the two latter are decidedly the most important whether they are productive of more benefit than the rest it is not for us to say but we can take upon ourselves to affirm with the utmost solemnity that they create a greater stir and more bustle than all the others put together  we should be disposed to affirm on the first blush of the matter that the bible and prayerbook society is not so popular as the childbedlinen society the bible and prayerbook society has however considerably increased in importance within the last year or two having derived some adventitious aid from the factious opposition of the child’s examination society which factious opposition originated in manner following—when the young curate was popular and all the unmarried ladies in the parish took a serious turn the charity children all at once became objects of peculiar and especial interest  the three miss browns enthusiastic admirers of the curate taught and exercised and examined and reexamined the unfortunate children until the boys grew pale and the girls consumptive with study and fatigue  the three miss browns stood it out very well because they relieved each other but the children having no relief at all exhibited decided symptoms of weariness and care  the unthinking part of the parishioners laughed at all this but the more reflective portion of the inhabitants abstained from expressing any opinion on the subject until that of the curate had been clearly ascertained  the opportunity was not long wanting  the curate preached a charity sermon on behalf of the charity school and in the charity sermon aforesaid expatiated in glowing terms on the praiseworthy and indefatigable exertions of certain estimable individuals  sobs were heard to issue from the three miss browns’ pew the pewopener of the division was seen to hurry down the centre aisle to the vestry door and to return immediately bearing a glass of water in her hand  a low moaning ensued two more pewopeners rushed to the spot and the three miss browns each supported by a pewopener were led out of the church and led in again after the lapse of five minutes with white pockethandkerchiefs to their eyes as if they had been attending a funeral in the churchyard adjoining  if any doubt had for a moment existed as to whom the allusion was intended to apply it was at once removed  the wish to enlighten the charity children became universal and the three miss browns were unanimously besought to divide the school into classes and to assign each class to the superintendence of two young ladies  a little learning is a dangerous thing but a little patronage is more so the three miss browns appointed all the old maids and carefully excluded the young ones  maiden aunts triumphed mammas were reduced to the lowest depths of despair and there is no telling in what act of violence the general indignation against the three miss browns might have vented itself had not a perfectly providential occurrence changed the tide of public feeling  mrs johnson parker the mother of seven extremely fine girls—all unmarried—hastily reported to several other mammas of several other unmarried families that five old men six old women and children innumerable in the free seats near her pew were in the habit of coming to church every sunday without either bible or prayerbook  was this to be borne in a civilised country  could such things be tolerated in a christian land  never  a ladies’ bible and prayerbook distribution society was instantly formed president mrs johnson parker treasurers auditors and secretary the misses johnson parker subscriptions were entered into books were bought all the freeseat people provided therewith and when the first lesson was given out on the first sunday succeeding these events there was such a dropping of books and rustling of leaves that it was morally impossible to hear one word of the service for five minutes afterwards  the three miss browns and their party saw the approaching danger and endeavoured to avert it by ridicule and sarcasm  neither the old men nor the old women could read their books now they had got them said the three miss browns  never mind they could learn replied mrs johnson parker  the children couldn’t read either suggested the three miss browns  no matter they could be taught retorted mrs johnson parker a balance of parties took place  the miss browns publicly examined—popular feeling inclined to the child’s examination society the miss johnson parkers publicly distributed—a reaction took place in favour of the prayerbook distribution  a feather would have turned the scale and a feather did turn it  a missionary returned from the west indies he was to be presented to the dissenters’ missionary society on his marriage with a wealthy widow  overtures were made to the dissenters by the johnson parkers  their object was the same and why not have a joint meeting of the two societies  the proposition was accepted  the meeting was duly heralded by public announcement and the room was crowded to suffocation  the missionary appeared on the platform he was hailed with enthusiasm  he repeated a dialogue he had heard between two negroes behind a hedge on the subject of distribution societies the approbation was tumultuous  he gave an imitation of the two negroes in broken english the roof was rent with applause  from that period we date with one trifling exception a daily increase in the popularity of the distribution society and an increase of popularity which the feeble and impotent opposition of the examination party has only tended to augment  now the great points about the childbedlinen monthly loan society are that it is less dependent on the fluctuations of public opinion than either the distribution or the child’s examination and that come what may there is never any lack of objects on which to exercise its benevolence  our parish is a very populous one and if anything contributes we should be disposed to say rather more than its due share to the aggregate amount of births in the metropolis and its environs the consequence is that the monthly loan society flourishes and invests its members with a most enviable amount of bustling patronage  the society whose only notion of dividing time would appear to be its allotment into months holds monthly teadrinkings at which the monthly report is received a secretary elected for the month ensuing and such of the monthly boxes as may not happen to be out on loan for the month carefully examined  we were never present at one of these meetings from all of which it is scarcely necessary to say gentlemen are carefully excluded but mr bung has been called before the board once or twice and we have his authority for stating that its proceedings are conducted with great order and regularity not more than four members being allowed to speak at one time on any pretence whatever  the regular committee is composed exclusively of married ladies but a vast number of young unmarried ladies of from eighteen to twentyfive years of age respectively are admitted as honorary members partly because they are very useful in replenishing the boxes and visiting the confined partly because it is highly desirable that they should be initiated at an early period into the more serious and matronly duties of afterlife and partly because prudent mammas have not unfrequently been known to turn this circumstance to wonderfully good account in matrimonial speculations  in addition to the loan of the monthly boxes which are always painted blue with the name of the society in large white letters on the lid the society dispense occasional grants of beeftea and a composition of warm beer spice eggs and sugar commonly known by the name of ‘candle’ to its patients  and here again the services of the honorary members are called into requisition and most cheerfully conceded deputations of twos or threes are sent out to visit the patients and on these occasions there is such a tasting of candle and beeftea such a stirring about of little messes in tiny saucepans on the hob such a dressing and undressing of infants such a tying and folding and pinning such a nursing and warming of little legs and feet before the fire such a delightful confusion of talking and cooking bustle importance and officiousness as never can be enjoyed in its full extent but on similar occasions  in rivalry of these two institutions and as a last expiring effort to acquire parochial popularity the child’s examination people determined the other day on having a grand public examination of the pupils and the large schoolroom of the national seminary was by and with the consent of the parish authorities devoted to the purpose  invitation circulars were forwarded to all the principal parishioners including of course the heads of the other two societies for whose especial behoof and edification the display was intended and a large audience was confidently anticipated on the occasion  the floor was carefully scrubbed the day before under the immediate superintendence of the three miss browns forms were placed across the room for the accommodation of the visitors specimens in writing were carefully selected and as carefully patched and touched up until they astonished the children who had written them rather more than the company who read them sums in compound addition were rehearsed and rerehearsed until all the children had the totals by heart and the preparations altogether were on the most laborious and most comprehensive scale  the morning arrived the children were yellowsoaped and flannelled and towelled till their faces shone again every pupil’s hair was carefully combed into his or her eyes as the case might be the girls were adorned with snowwhite tippets and caps bound round the head by a single purple ribbon the necks of the elder boys were fixed into collars of startling dimensions  the doors were thrown open and the misses brown and co were discovered in plain white muslin dresses and caps of the same—the child’s examination uniform  the room filled the greetings of the company were loud and cordial  the distributionists trembled for their popularity was at stake  the eldest boy fell forward and delivered a propitiatory address from behind his collar  it was from the pen of mr henry brown the applause was universal and the johnson parkers were aghast  the examination proceeded with success and terminated in triumph  the child’s examination society gained a momentary victory and the johnson parkers retreated in despair  a secret council of the distributionists was held that night with mrs johnson parker in the chair to consider of the best means of recovering the ground they had lost in the favour of the parish  what could be done  another meeting  alas who was to attend it  the missionary would not do twice and the slaves were emancipated  a bold step must be taken  the parish must be astonished in some way or other but no one was able to suggest what the step should be  at length a very old lady was heard to mumble in indistinct tones ‘exeter hall’  a sudden light broke in upon the meeting  it was unanimously resolved that a deputation of old ladies should wait upon a celebrated orator imploring his assistance and the favour of a speech and the deputation should also wait on two or three other imbecile old women not resident in the parish and entreat their attendance  the application was successful the meeting was held the orator an irishman came  he talked of green isles—other shores—vast atlantic—bosom of the deep—christian charity—blood and extermination—mercy in hearts—arms in hands—altars and homes—household gods  he wiped his eyes he blew his nose and he quoted latin  the effect was tremendous—the latin was a decided hit  nobody knew exactly what it was about but everybody knew it must be affecting because even the orator was overcome  the popularity of the distribution society among the ladies of our parish is unprecedented and the child’s examination is going fast to decay    chapter vii—our nextdoor neighbour   we are very fond of speculating as we walk through a street on the character and pursuits of the people who inhabit it and nothing so materially assists us in these speculations as the appearance of the house doors  the various expressions of the human countenance afford a beautiful and interesting study but there is something in the physiognomy of streetdoor knockers almost as characteristic and nearly as infallible  whenever we visit a man for the first time we contemplate the features of his knocker with the greatest curiosity for we well know that between the man and his knocker there will inevitably be a greater or less degree of resemblance and sympathy  for instance there is one description of knocker that used to be common enough but which is fast passing away—a large round one with the jolly face of a convivial lion smiling blandly at you as you twist the sides of your hair into a curl or pull up your shirtcollar while you are waiting for the door to be opened we never saw that knocker on the door of a churlish man—so far as our experience is concerned it invariably bespoke hospitality and another bottle  no man ever saw this knocker on the door of a small attorney or billbroker they always patronise the other lion a heavy ferociouslooking fellow with a countenance expressive of savage stupidity—a sort of grand master among the knockers and a great favourite with the selfish and brutal  then there is a little pert egyptian knocker with a long thin face a pinchedup nose and a very sharp chin he is most in vogue with your governmentoffice people in light drabs and starched cravats little spare priggish men who are perfectly satisfied with their own opinions and consider themselves of paramount importance  we were greatly troubled a few years ago by the innovation of a new kind of knocker without any face at all composed of a wreath depending from a hand or small truncheon  a little trouble and attention however enabled us to overcome this difficulty and to reconcile the new system to our favourite theory  you will invariably find this knocker on the doors of cold and formal people who always ask you why you don’t come and never say do  everybody knows the brass knocker is common to suburban villas and extensive boardingschools and having noticed this genus we have recapitulated all the most prominent and stronglydefined species  some phrenologists affirm that the agitation of a man’s brain by different passions produces corresponding developments in the form of his skull  do not let us be understood as pushing our theory to the full length of asserting that any alteration in a man’s disposition would produce a visible effect on the feature of his knocker  our position merely is that in such a case the magnetism which must exist between a man and his knocker would induce the man to remove and seek some knocker more congenial to his altered feelings  if you ever find a man changing his habitation without any reasonable pretext depend upon it that although he may not be aware of the fact himself it is because he and his knocker are at variance  this is a new theory but we venture to launch it nevertheless as being quite as ingenious and infallible as many thousands of the learned speculations which are daily broached for public good and private fortunemaking  entertaining these feelings on the subject of knockers it will be readily imagined with what consternation we viewed the entire removal of the knocker from the door of the next house to the one we lived in some time ago and the substitution of a bell  this was a calamity we had never anticipated  the bare idea of anybody being able to exist without a knocker appeared so wild and visionary that it had never for one instant entered our imagination  we sauntered moodily from the spot and bent our steps towards eatonsquare then just building  what was our astonishment and indignation to find that bells were fast becoming the rule and knockers the exception  our theory trembled beneath the shock  we hastened home and fancying we foresaw in the swift progress of events its entire abolition resolved from that day forward to vent our speculations on our nextdoor neighbours in person  the house adjoining ours on the left hand was uninhabited and we had therefore plenty of leisure to observe our nextdoor neighbours on the other side  the house without the knocker was in the occupation of a city clerk and there was a neatlywritten bill in the parlour window intimating that lodgings for a single gentleman were to be let within  it was a neat dull little house on the shady side of the way with new narrow floorcloth in the passage and new narrow staircarpets up to the first floor  the paper was new and the paint was new and the furniture was new and all three paper paint and furniture bespoke the limited means of the tenant  there was a little red and black carpet in the drawingroom with a border of flooring all the way round a few stained chairs and a pembroke table  a pink shell was displayed on each of the little sideboards which with the addition of a teatray and caddy a few more shells on the mantelpiece and three peacock’s feathers tastefully arranged above them completed the decorative furniture of the apartment  this was the room destined for the reception of the single gentleman during the day and a little back room on the same floor was assigned as his sleeping apartment by night  the bill had not been long in the window when a stout goodhumoured looking gentleman of about fiveandthirty appeared as a candidate for the tenancy  terms were soon arranged for the bill was taken down immediately after his first visit  in a day or two the single gentleman came in and shortly afterwards his real character came out  first of all he displayed a most extraordinary partiality for sitting up till three or four o’clock in the morning drinking whiskeyandwater and smoking cigars then he invited friends home who used to come at ten o’clock and begin to get happy about the small hours when they evinced their perfect contentment by singing songs with halfadozen verses of two lines each and a chorus of ten which chorus used to be shouted forth by the whole strength of the company in the most enthusiastic and vociferous manner to the great annoyance of the neighbours and the special discomfort of another single gentleman overhead  now this was bad enough occurring as it did three times a week on the average but this was not all for when the company did go away instead of walking quietly down the street as anybody else’s company would have done they amused themselves by making alarming and frightful noises and counterfeiting the shrieks of females in distress and one night a redfaced gentleman in a white hat knocked in the most urgent manner at the door of the powderedheaded old gentleman at no 3 and when the powderedheaded old gentleman who thought one of his married daughters must have been taken ill prematurely had groped downstairs and after a great deal of unbolting and keyturning opened the street door the redfaced man in the white hat said he hoped he’d excuse his giving him so much trouble but he’d feel obliged if he’d favour him with a glass of cold spring water and the loan of a shilling for a cab to take him home on which the old gentleman slammed the door and went upstairs and threw the contents of his water jug out of window—very straight only it went over the wrong man and the whole street was involved in confusion  a joke’s a joke and even practical jests are very capital in their way if you can only get the other party to see the fun of them but the population of our street were so dull of apprehension as to be quite lost to a sense of the drollery of this proceeding and the consequence was that our nextdoor neighbour was obliged to tell the single gentleman that unless he gave up entertaining his friends at home he really must be compelled to part with him  the single gentleman received the remonstrance with great goodhumour and promised from that time forward to spend his evenings at a coffeehouse—a determination which afforded general and unmixed satisfaction  the next night passed off very well everybody being delighted with the change but on the next the noises were renewed with greater spirit than ever  the single gentleman’s friends being unable to see him in his own house every alternate night had come to the determination of seeing him home every night and what with the discordant greetings of the friends at parting and the noise created by the single gentleman in his passage upstairs and his subsequent struggles to get his boots off the evil was not to be borne  so our nextdoor neighbour gave the single gentleman who was a very good lodger in other respects notice to quit and the single gentleman went away and entertained his friends in other lodgings  the next applicant for the vacant first floor was of a very different character from the troublesome single gentleman who had just quitted it he was a tall thin young gentleman with a profusion of brown hair reddish whiskers and very slightly developed moustaches  he wore a braided surtout with frogs behind light grey trousers and washleather gloves and had altogether rather a military appearance  so unlike the roystering single gentleman  such insinuating manners and such a delightful address  so seriously disposed too  when he first came to look at the lodgings he inquired most particularly whether he was sure to be able to get a seat in the parish church and when he had agreed to take them he requested to have a list of the different local charities as he intended to subscribe his mite to the most deserving among them  our nextdoor neighbour was now perfectly happy  he had got a lodger at last of just his own way of thinking—a serious welldisposed man who abhorred gaiety and loved retirement  he took down the bill with a light heart and pictured in imagination a long series of quiet sundays on which he and his lodger would exchange mutual civilities and sunday papers  the serious man arrived and his luggage was to arrive from the country next morning  he borrowed a clean shirt and a prayerbook from our nextdoor neighbour and retired to rest at an early hour requesting that he might be called punctually at ten o’clock next morning—not before as he was much fatigued  he was called and did not answer he was called again but there was no reply  our nextdoor neighbour became alarmed and burst the door open  the serious man had left the house mysteriously carrying with him the shirt the prayerbook a teaspoon and the bedclothes  whether this occurrence coupled with the irregularities of his former lodger gave our nextdoor neighbour an aversion to single gentlemen we know not we only know that the next bill which made its appearance in the parlour window intimated generally that there were furnished apartments to let on the first floor  the bill was soon removed  the new lodgers at first attracted our curiosity and afterwards excited our interest  they were a young lad of eighteen or nineteen and his mother a lady of about fifty or it might be less  the mother wore a widow’s weeds and the boy was also clothed in deep mourning  they were poor—very poor for their only means of support arose from the pittance the boy earned by copying writings and translating for booksellers  they had removed from some country place and settled in london partly because it afforded better chances of employment for the boy and partly perhaps with the natural desire to leave a place where they had been in better circumstances and where their poverty was known  they were proud under their reverses and above revealing their wants and privations to strangers  how bitter those privations were and how hard the boy worked to remove them no one ever knew but themselves  night after night two three four hours after midnight could we hear the occasional raking up of the scanty fire or the hollow and halfstifled cough which indicated his being still at work and day after day could we see more plainly that nature had set that unearthly light in his plaintive face which is the beacon of her worst disease  actuated we hope by a higher feeling than mere curiosity we contrived to establish first an acquaintance and then a close intimacy with the poor strangers  our worst fears were realised the boy was sinking fast through a part of the winter and the whole of the following spring and summer his labours were unceasingly prolonged and the mother attempted to procure needlework embroidery—anything for bread  a few shillings now and then were all she could earn  the boy worked steadily on dying by minutes but never once giving utterance to complaint or murmur  one beautiful autumn evening we went to pay our customary visit to the invalid  his little remaining strength had been decreasing rapidly for two or three days preceding and he was lying on the sofa at the open window gazing at the setting sun  his mother had been reading the bible to him for she closed the book as we entered and advanced to meet us  ‘i was telling william’ she said ‘that we must manage to take him into the country somewhere so that he may get quite well  he is not ill you know but he is not very strong and has exerted himself too much lately’  poor thing  the tears that streamed through her fingers as she turned aside as if to adjust her close widow’s cap too plainly showed how fruitless was the attempt to deceive herself  we sat down by the head of the sofa but said nothing for we saw the breath of life was passing gently but rapidly from the young form before us  at every respiration his heart beat more slowly  the boy placed one hand in ours grasped his mother’s arm with the other drew her hastily towards him and fervently kissed her cheek  there was a pause  he sunk back upon his pillow and looked long and earnestly in his mother’s face  ‘william william’ murmured the mother after a long interval ‘don’t look at me so—speak to me dear’  the boy smiled languidly but an instant afterwards his features resolved into the same cold solemn gaze  ‘william dear william rouse yourself don’t look at me so love—pray don’t  oh my god what shall i do’ cried the widow clasping her hands in agony—‘my dear boy he is dying’  the boy raised himself by a violent effort and folded his hands together—‘mother dear dear mother bury me in the open fields—anywhere but in these dreadful streets  i should like to be where you can see my grave but not in these close crowded streets they have killed me kiss me again mother put your arm round my neck—’  he fell back and a strange expression stole upon his features not of pain or suffering but an indescribable fixing of every line and muscle  the boy was dead     scenes   chapter i—the streets—morning   the appearance presented by the streets of london an hour before sunrise on a summer’s morning is most striking even to the few whose unfortunate pursuits of pleasure or scarcely less unfortunate pursuits of business cause them to be well acquainted with the scene  there is an air of cold solitary desolation about the noiseless streets which we are accustomed to see thronged at other times by a busy eager crowd and over the quiet closelyshut buildings which throughout the day are swarming with life and bustle that is very impressive  the last drunken man who shall find his way home before sunlight has just staggered heavily along roaring out the burden of the drinking song of the previous night the last houseless vagrant whom penury and police have left in the streets has coiled up his chilly limbs in some paved comer to dream of food and warmth  the drunken the dissipated and the wretched have disappeared the more sober and orderly part of the population have not yet awakened to the labours of the day and the stillness of death is over the streets its very hue seems to be imparted to them cold and lifeless as they look in the grey sombre light of daybreak  the coachstands in the larger thoroughfares are deserted the nighthouses are closed and the chosen promenades of profligate misery are empty  an occasional policeman may alone be seen at the street corners listlessly gazing on the deserted prospect before him and now and then a rakishlooking cat runs stealthily across the road and descends his own area with as much caution and slyness—bounding first on the waterbutt then on the dusthole and then alighting on the flagstones—as if he were conscious that his character depended on his gallantry of the preceding night escaping public observation  a partially opened bedroomwindow here and there bespeaks the heat of the weather and the uneasy slumbers of its occupant and the dim scanty flicker of the rushlight through the windowblind denotes the chamber of watching or sickness  with these few exceptions the streets present no signs of life nor the houses of habitation  an hour wears away the spires of the churches and roofs of the principal buildings are faintly tinged with the light of the rising sun and the streets by almost imperceptible degrees begin to resume their bustle and animation  marketcarts roll slowly along the sleepy waggoner impatiently urging on his tired horses or vainly endeavouring to awaken the boy who luxuriously stretched on the top of the fruitbaskets forgets in happy oblivion his longcherished curiosity to behold the wonders of london  rough sleepylooking animals of strange appearance something between ostlers and hackneycoachmen begin to take down the shutters of early publichouses and little deal tables with the ordinary preparations for a street breakfast make their appearance at the customary stations numbers of men and women principally the latter carrying upon their heads heavy baskets of fruit toil down the park side of piccadilly on their way to coventgarden and following each other in rapid succession form a long straggling line from thence to the turn of the road at knightsbridge  here and there a bricklayer’s labourer with the day’s dinner tied up in a handkerchief walks briskly to his work and occasionally a little knot of three or four schoolboys on a stolen bathing expedition rattle merrily over the pavement their boisterous mirth contrasting forcibly with the demeanour of the little sweep who having knocked and rung till his arm aches and being interdicted by a merciful legislature from endangering his lungs by calling out sits patiently down on the doorstep until the housemaid may happen to awake  coventgarden market and the avenues leading to it are thronged with carts of all sorts sizes and descriptions from the heavy lumbering waggon with its four stout horses to the jingling costermonger’s cart with its consumptive donkey  the pavement is already strewed with decayed cabbageleaves broken haybands and all the indescribable litter of a vegetable market men are shouting carts backing horses neighing boys fighting basketwomen talking piemen expatiating on the excellence of their pastry and donkeys braying  these and a hundred other sounds form a compound discordant enough to a londoner’s ears and remarkably disagreeable to those of country gentlemen who are sleeping at the hummums for the first time  another hour passes away and the day begins in good earnest  the servant of all work who under the plea of sleeping very soundly has utterly disregarded ‘missis’s’ ringing for half an hour previously is warned by master whom missis has sent up in his drapery to the landingplace for that purpose that it’s halfpast six whereupon she awakes all of a sudden with wellfeigned astonishment and goes downstairs very sulkily wishing while she strikes a light that the principle of spontaneous combustion would extend itself to coals and kitchen range  when the fire is lighted she opens the streetdoor to take in the milk when by the most singular coincidence in the world she discovers that the servant next door has just taken in her milk too and that mr todd’s young man over the way is by an equally extraordinary chance taking down his master’s shutters  the inevitable consequence is that she just steps milkjug in hand as far as next door just to say ‘good morning’ to betsy clark and that mr todd’s young man just steps over the way to say ‘good morning’ to both of ’em and as the aforesaid mr todd’s young man is almost as goodlooking and fascinating as the baker himself the conversation quickly becomes very interesting and probably would become more so if betsy clark’s missis who always will be afollowin’ her about didn’t give an angry tap at her bedroom window on which mr todd’s young man tries to whistle coolly as he goes back to his shop much faster than he came from it and the two girls run back to their respective places and shut their streetdoors with surprising softness each of them poking their heads out of the front parlour window a minute afterwards however ostensibly with the view of looking at the mail which just then passes by but really for the purpose of catching another glimpse of mr todd’s young man who being fond of mails but more of females takes a short look at the mails and a long look at the girls much to the satisfaction of all parties concerned  the mail itself goes on to the coachoffice in due course and the passengers who are going out by the early coach stare with astonishment at the passengers who are coming in by the early coach who look blue and dismal and are evidently under the influence of that odd feeling produced by travelling which makes the events of yesterday morning seem as if they had happened at least six months ago and induces people to wonder with considerable gravity whether the friends and relations they took leave of a fortnight before have altered much since they have left them  the coachoffice is all alive and the coaches which are just going out are surrounded by the usual crowd of jews and nondescripts who seem to consider heaven knows why that it is quite impossible any man can mount a coach without requiring at least sixpennyworth of oranges a penknife a pocketbook a last year’s annual a pencilcase a piece of sponge and a small series of caricatures  half an hour more and the sun darts his bright rays cheerfully down the still halfempty streets and shines with sufficient force to rouse the dismal laziness of the apprentice who pauses every other minute from his task of sweeping out the shop and watering the pavement in front of it to tell another apprentice similarly employed how hot it will be today or to stand with his right hand shading his eyes and his left resting on the broom gazing at the ‘wonder’ or the ‘tallyho’ or the ‘nimrod’ or some other fast coach till it is out of sight when he reenters the shop envying the passengers on the outside of the fast coach and thinking of the old red brick house ‘down in the country’ where he went to school the miseries of the milk and water and thick bread and scrapings fading into nothing before the pleasant recollection of the green field the boys used to play in and the green pond he was caned for presuming to fall into and other schoolboy associations  cabs with trunks and bandboxes between the drivers’ legs and outside the apron rattle briskly up and down the streets on their way to the coachoffices or steampacket wharfs and the cabdrivers and hackneycoachmen who are on the stand polish up the ornamental part of their dingy vehicles—the former wondering how people can prefer ‘them wild beast cariwans of homnibuses to a riglar cab with a fast trotter’ and the latter admiring how people can trust their necks into one of ‘them crazy cabs when they can have a ’spectable ’ackney cotche with a pair of ’orses as von’t run away with no vun’ a consolation unquestionably founded on fact seeing that a hackneycoach horse never was known to run at all ‘except’ as the smart cabman in front of the rank observes ‘except one and he run back’ards’  the shops are now completely opened and apprentices and shopmen are busily engaged in cleaning and decking the windows for the day  the bakers’ shops in town are filled with servants and children waiting for the drawing of the first batch of rolls—an operation which was performed a full hour ago in the suburbs for the early clerk population of somers and camden towns islington and pentonville are fast pouring into the city or directing their steps towards chancerylane and the inns of court  middleaged men whose salaries have by no means increased in the same proportion as their families plod steadily along apparently with no object in view but the countinghouse knowing by sight almost everybody they meet or overtake for they have seen them every morning sunday excepted during the last twenty years but speaking to no one if they do happen to overtake a personal acquaintance they just exchange a hurried salutation and keep walking on either by his side or in front of him as his rate of walking may chance to be  as to stopping to shake hands or to take the friend’s arm they seem to think that as it is not included in their salary they have no right to do it  small office lads in large hats who are made men before they are boys hurry along in pairs with their first coat carefully brushed and the white trousers of last sunday plentifully besmeared with dust and ink  it evidently requires a considerable mental struggle to avoid investing part of the day’s dinnermoney in the purchase of the stale tarts so temptingly exposed in dusty tins at the pastrycooks’ doors but a consciousness of their own importance and the receipt of seven shillings aweek with the prospect of an early rise to eight comes to their aid and they accordingly put their hats a little more on one side and look under the bonnets of all the milliners’ and staymakers’ apprentices they meet—poor girls—the hardest worked the worst paid and too often the worst used class of the community  eleven o’clock and a new set of people fill the streets  the goods in the shopwindows are invitingly arranged the shopmen in their white neckerchiefs and spruce coats look as it they couldn’t clean a window if their lives depended on it the carts have disappeared from coventgarden the waggoners have returned and the costermongers repaired to their ordinary ‘beats’ in the suburbs clerks are at their offices and gigs cabs omnibuses and saddlehorses are conveying their masters to the same destination  the streets are thronged with a vast concourse of people gay and shabby rich and poor idle and industrious and we come to the heat bustle and activity of noon    chapter ii—the streets—night   but the streets of london to be beheld in the very height of their glory should be seen on a dark dull murky winter’s night when there is just enough damp gently stealing down to make the pavement greasy without cleansing it of any of its impurities and when the heavy lazy mist which hangs over every object makes the gaslamps look brighter and the brilliantlylighted shops more splendid from the contrast they present to the darkness around  all the people who are at home on such a night as this seem disposed to make themselves as snug and comfortable as possible and the passengers in the streets have excellent reason to envy the fortunate individuals who are seated by their own firesides  in the larger and better kind of streets dining parlour curtains are closely drawn kitchen fires blaze brightly up and savoury steams of hot dinners salute the nostrils of the hungry wayfarer as he plods wearily by the area railings  in the suburbs the muffin boy rings his way down the little street much more slowly than he is wont to do for mrs macklin of no 4 has no sooner opened her little streetdoor and screamed out ‘muffins’ with all her might than mrs walker at no 5 puts her head out of the parlourwindow and screams ‘muffins’ too and mrs walker has scarcely got the words out of her lips than mrs peplow over the way lets loose master peplow who darts down the street with a velocity which nothing but buttered muffins in perspective could possibly inspire and drags the boy back by main force whereupon mrs macklin and mrs walker just to save the boy trouble and to say a few neighbourly words to mrs peplow at the same time run over the way and buy their muffins at mrs peplow’s door when it appears from the voluntary statement of mrs walker that her ‘kittle’s jist abiling and the cups and sarsers ready laid’ and that as it was such a wretched night out o’ doors she’d made up her mind to have a nice hot comfortable cup o’ tea—a determination at which by the most singular coincidence the other two ladies had simultaneously arrived  after a little conversation about the wretchedness of the weather and the merits of tea with a digression relative to the viciousness of boys as a rule and the amiability of master peplow as an exception mrs walker sees her husband coming down the street and as he must want his tea poor man after his dirty walk from the docks she instantly runs across muffins in hand and mrs macklin does the same and after a few words to mrs walker they all pop into their little houses and slam their little streetdoors which are not opened again for the remainder of the evening except to the nine o’clock ‘beer’ who comes round with a lantern in front of his tray and says as he lends mrs walker ‘yesterday’s ‘tiser’ that he’s blessed if he can hardly hold the pot much less feel the paper for it’s one of the bitterest nights he ever felt ’cept the night when the man was frozen to death in the brickfield  after a little prophetic conversation with the policeman at the streetcorner touching a probable change in the weather and the settingin of a hard frost the nine o’clock beer returns to his master’s house and employs himself for the remainder of the evening in assiduously stirring the taproom fire and deferentially taking part in the conversation of the worthies assembled round it  the streets in the vicinity of the marshgate and victoria theatre present an appearance of dirt and discomfort on such a night which the groups who lounge about them in no degree tend to diminish  even the little blocktin temple sacred to baked potatoes surmounted by a splendid design in variegated lamps looks less gay than usual and as to the kidneypie stand its glory has quite departed  the candle in the transparent lamp manufactured of oilpaper embellished with ‘characters’ has been blown out fifty times so the kidneypie merchant tired with running backwards and forwards to the next winevaults to get a light has given up the idea of illumination in despair and the only signs of his ‘whereabout’ are the bright sparks of which a long irregular train is whirled down the street every time he opens his portable oven to hand a hot kidneypie to a customer  flatfish oyster and fruit vendors linger hopelessly in the kennel in vain endeavouring to attract customers and the ragged boys who usually disport themselves about the streets stand crouched in little knots in some projecting doorway or under the canvas blind of a cheesemonger’s where great flaring gaslights unshaded by any glass display huge piles of blight red and pale yellow cheeses mingled with little fivepenny dabs of dingy bacon various tubs of weekly dorset and cloudy rolls of ‘best fresh’  here they amuse themselves with theatrical converse arising out of their last halfprice visit to the victoria gallery admire the terrific combat which is nightly encored and expatiate on the inimitable manner in which bill thompson can ‘come the double monkey’ or go through the mysterious involutions of a sailor’s hornpipe  it is nearly eleven o’clock and the cold thin rain which has been drizzling so long is beginning to pour down in good earnest the bakedpotato man has departed—the kidneypie man has just walked away with his warehouse on his arm—the cheesemonger has drawn in his blind and the boys have dispersed  the constant clicking of pattens on the slippy and uneven pavement and the rustling of umbrellas as the wind blows against the shopwindows bear testimony to the inclemency of the night and the policeman with his oilskin cape buttoned closely round him seems as he holds his hat on his head and turns round to avoid the gust of wind and rain which drives against him at the streetcorner to be very far from congratulating himself on the prospect before him  the little chandler’s shop with the cracked bell behind the door whose melancholy tinkling has been regulated by the demand for quarterns of sugar and halfounces of coffee is shutting up  the crowds which have been passing to and fro during the whole day are rapidly dwindling away and the noise of shouting and quarrelling which issues from the publichouses is almost the only sound that breaks the melancholy stillness of the night  there was another but it has ceased  that wretched woman with the infant in her arms round whose meagre form the remnant of her own scanty shawl is carefully wrapped has been attempting to sing some popular ballad in the hope of wringing a few pence from the compassionate passerby  a brutal laugh at her weak voice is all she has gained  the tears fall thick and fast down her own pale face the child is cold and hungry and its low halfstifled wailing adds to the misery of its wretched mother as she moans aloud and sinks despairingly down on a cold damp doorstep  singing  how few of those who pass such a miserable creature as this think of the anguish of heart the sinking of soul and spirit which the very effort of singing produces  bitter mockery  disease neglect and starvation faintly articulating the words of the joyous ditty that has enlivened your hours of feasting and merriment god knows how often  it is no subject of jeering  the weak tremulous voice tells a fearful tale of want and famishing and the feeble singer of this roaring song may turn away only to die of cold and hunger  one o’clock  parties returning from the different theatres foot it through the muddy streets cabs hackneycoaches carriages and theatre omnibuses roll swiftly by watermen with dim dirty lanterns in their hands and large brass plates upon their breasts who have been shouting and rushing about for the last two hours retire to their wateringhouses to solace themselves with the creature comforts of pipes and purl the halfprice pit and box frequenters of the theatres throng to the different houses of refreshment and chops kidneys rabbits oysters stout cigars and ‘goes’ innumerable are served up amidst a noise and confusion of smoking running knifeclattering and waiterchattering perfectly indescribable  the more musical portion of the playgoing community betake themselves to some harmonic meeting  as a matter of curiosity let us follow them thither for a few moments  in a lofty room of spacious dimensions are seated some eighty or a hundred guests knocking little pewter measures on the tables and hammering away with the handles of their knives as if they were so many trunkmakers  they are applauding a glee which has just been executed by the three ‘professional gentlemen’ at the top of the centre table one of whom is in the chair—the little pompous man with the bald head just emerging from the collar of his green coat  the others are seated on either side of him—the stout man with the small voice and the thinfaced dark man in black  the little man in the chair is a most amusing personage—such condescending grandeur and such a voice  ‘bass’ as the young gentleman near us with the blue stock forcibly remarks to his companion ‘bass  i b’lieve you he can go down lower than any man so low sometimes that you can’t hear him’  and so he does to hear him growling away gradually lower and lower down till he can’t get back again is the most delightful thing in the world and it is quite impossible to witness unmoved the impressive solemnity with which he pours forth his soul in ‘my ’art’s in the ’ighlands’ or ‘the brave old hoak’  the stout man is also addicted to sentimentality and warbles ‘fly fly from the world my bessy with me’ or some such song with ladylike sweetness and in the most seductive tones imaginable  ‘pray give your orders gen’l’m’n—pray give your orders’—says the palefaced man with the red head and demands for ‘goes’ of gin and ‘goes’ of brandy and pints of stout and cigars of peculiar mildness are vociferously made from all parts of the room  the ‘professional gentlemen’ are in the very height of their glory and bestow condescending nods or even a word or two of recognition on the betterknown frequenters of the room in the most bland and patronising manner possible  the little roundfaced man with the small brown surtout white stockings and shoes is in the comic line the mixed air of selfdenial and mental consciousness of his own powers with which he acknowledges the call of the chair is particularly gratifying  ‘gen’l’men’ says the little pompous man accompanying the word with a knock of the president’s hammer on the table—‘gen’l’men allow me to claim your attention—our friend mr smuggins will oblige’—‘bravo’ shout the company and smuggins after a considerable quantity of coughing by way of symphony and a most facetious sniff or two which afford general delight sings a comic song with a falderal—tolderal chorus at the end of every verse much longer than the verse itself  it is received with unbounded applause and after some aspiring genius has volunteered a recitation and failed dismally therein the little pompous man gives another knock and says ‘gen’l’men we will attempt a glee if you please’  this announcement calls forth tumultuous applause and the more energetic spirits express the unqualified approbation it affords them by knocking one or two stout glasses off their legs—a humorous device but one which frequently occasions some slight altercation when the form of paying the damage is proposed to be gone through by the waiter  scenes like these are continued until three or four o’clock in the morning and even when they close fresh ones open to the inquisitive novice  but as a description of all of them however slight would require a volume the contents of which however instructive would be by no means pleasing we make our bow and drop the curtain    chapter iii—shops and their tenants   what inexhaustible food for speculation do the streets of london afford we never were able to agree with sterne in pitying the man who could travel from dan to beersheba and say that all was barren we have not the slightest commiseration for the man who can take up his hat and stick and walk from coventgarden to st paul’s churchyard and back into the bargain without deriving some amusement—we had almost said instruction—from his perambulation  and yet there are such beings we meet them every day  large black stocks and light waistcoats jet canes and discontented countenances are the characteristics of the race other people brush quickly by you steadily plodding on to business or cheerfully running after pleasure  these men linger listlessly past looking as happy and animated as a policeman on duty  nothing seems to make an impression on their minds nothing short of being knocked down by a porter or run over by a cab will disturb their equanimity  you will meet them on a fine day in any of the leading thoroughfares peep through the window of a westend cigar shop in the evening if you can manage to get a glimpse between the blue curtains which intercept the vulgar gaze and you see them in their only enjoyment of existence  there they are lounging about on round tubs and pipe boxes in all the dignity of whiskers and gilt watchguards whispering soft nothings to the young lady in amber with the large earrings who as she sits behind the counter in a blaze of adoration and gaslight is the admiration of all the female servants in the neighbourhood and the envy of every milliner’s apprentice within two miles round  one of our principal amusements is to watch the gradual progress—the rise or fall—of particular shops  we have formed an intimate acquaintance with several in different parts of town and are perfectly acquainted with their whole history  we could name offhand twenty at least which we are quite sure have paid no taxes for the last six years  they are never inhabited for more than two months consecutively and we verily believe have witnessed every retail trade in the directory  there is one whose history is a sample of the rest in whose fate we have taken especial interest having had the pleasure of knowing it ever since it has been a shop  it is on the surrey side of the water—a little distance beyond the marshgate  it was originally a substantial goodlooking private house enough the landlord got into difficulties the house got into chancery the tenant went away and the house went to ruin  at this period our acquaintance with it commenced the paint was all worn off the windows were broken the area was green with neglect and the overflowings of the waterbutt the butt itself was without a lid and the streetdoor was the very picture of misery  the chief pastime of the children in the vicinity had been to assemble in a body on the steps and to take it in turn to knock loud double knocks at the door to the great satisfaction of the neighbours generally and especially of the nervous old lady next door but one  numerous complaints were made and several small basins of water discharged over the offenders but without effect  in this state of things the marinestore dealer at the corner of the street in the most obliging manner took the knocker off and sold it and the unfortunate house looked more wretched than ever  we deserted our friend for a few weeks  what was our surprise on our return to find no trace of its existence  in its place was a handsome shop fast approaching to a state of completion and on the shutters were large bills informing the public that it would shortly be opened with ‘an extensive stock of linendrapery and haberdashery’  it opened in due course there was the name of the proprietor ‘and co’ in gilt letters almost too dazzling to look at  such ribbons and shawls and two such elegant young men behind the counter each in a clean collar and white neckcloth like the lover in a farce  as to the proprietor he did nothing but walk up and down the shop and hand seats to the ladies and hold important conversations with the handsomest of the young men who was shrewdly suspected by the neighbours to be the ‘co’  we saw all this with sorrow we felt a fatal presentiment that the shop was doomed—and so it was  its decay was slow but sure  tickets gradually appeared in the windows then rolls of flannel with labels on them were stuck outside the door then a bill was pasted on the streetdoor intimating that the first floor was to let unfurnished then one of the young men disappeared altogether and the other took to a black neckerchief and the proprietor took to drinking  the shop became dirty broken panes of glass remained unmended and the stock disappeared piecemeal  at last the company’s man came to cut off the water and then the linendraper cut off himself leaving the landlord his compliments and the key  the next occupant was a fancy stationer  the shop was more modestly painted than before still it was neat but somehow we always thought as we passed that it looked like a poor and struggling concern  we wished the man well but we trembled for his success  he was a widower evidently and had employment elsewhere for he passed us every morning on his road to the city  the business was carried on by his eldest daughter  poor girl she needed no assistance  we occasionally caught a glimpse of two or three children in mourning like herself as they sat in the little parlour behind the shop and we never passed at night without seeing the eldest girl at work either for them or in making some elegant little trifle for sale  we often thought as her pale face looked more sad and pensive in the dim candlelight that if those thoughtless females who interfere with the miserable market of poor creatures such as these knew but onehalf of the misery they suffer and the bitter privations they endure in their honourable attempts to earn a scanty subsistence they would perhaps resign even opportunities for the gratification of vanity and an immodest love of selfdisplay rather than drive them to a last dreadful resource which it would shock the delicate feelings of these charitable ladies to hear named  but we are forgetting the shop  well we continued to watch it and every day showed too clearly the increasing poverty of its inmates  the children were clean it is true but their clothes were threadbare and shabby no tenant had been procured for the upper part of the house from the letting of which a portion of the means of paying the rent was to have been derived and a slow wasting consumption prevented the eldest girl from continuing her exertions  quarterday arrived  the landlord had suffered from the extravagance of his last tenant and he had no compassion for the struggles of his successor he put in an execution as we passed one morning the broker’s men were removing the little furniture there was in the house and a newlyposted bill informed us it was again ‘to let’  what became of the last tenant we never could learn we believe the girl is past all suffering and beyond all sorrow  god help her  we hope she is  we were somewhat curious to ascertain what would be the next stage—for that the place had no chance of succeeding now was perfectly clear  the bill was soon taken down and some alterations were being made in the interior of the shop  we were in a fever of expectation we exhausted conjecture—we imagined all possible trades none of which were perfectly reconcilable with our idea of the gradual decay of the tenement  it opened and we wondered why we had not guessed at the real state of the case before  the shop—not a large one at the best of times—had been converted into two one was a bonnetshape maker’s the other was opened by a tobacconist who also dealt in walkingsticks and sunday newspapers the two were separated by a thin partition covered with tawdry striped paper  the tobacconist remained in possession longer than any tenant within our recollection  he was a redfaced impudent goodfornothing dog evidently accustomed to take things as they came and to make the best of a bad job  he sold as many cigars as he could and smoked the rest  he occupied the shop as long as he could make peace with the landlord and when he could no longer live in quiet he very coolly locked the door and bolted himself  from this period the two little dens have undergone innumerable changes  the tobacconist was succeeded by a theatrical hairdresser who ornamented the window with a great variety of ‘characters’ and terrific combats  the bonnetshape maker gave place to a greengrocer and the histrionic barber was succeeded in his turn by a tailor  so numerous have been the changes that we have of late done little more than mark the peculiar but certain indications of a house being poorly inhabited  it has been progressing by almost imperceptible degrees  the occupiers of the shops have gradually given up room after room until they have only reserved the little parlour for themselves first there appeared a brass plate on the private door with ‘ladies’ school’ legibly engraved thereon shortly afterwards we observed a second brass plate then a bell and then another bell  when we paused in front of our old friend and observed these signs of poverty which are not to be mistaken we thought as we turned away that the house had attained its lowest pitch of degradation  we were wrong when we last passed it a ‘dairy’ was established in the area and a party of melancholylooking fowls were amusing themselves by running in at the front door and out at the back one    chapter iv—scotlandyard   scotlandyard is a small—a very smalltract of land bounded on one side by the river thames on the other by the gardens of northumberland house abutting at one end on the bottom of northumberlandstreet at the other on the back of whitehallplace  when this territory was first accidentally discovered by a country gentleman who lost his way in the strand some years ago the original settlers were found to be a tailor a publican two eatinghouse keepers and a fruitpie maker and it was also found to contain a race of strong and bulky men who repaired to the wharfs in scotlandyard regularly every morning about five or six o’clock to fill heavy waggons with coal with which they proceeded to distant places up the country and supplied the inhabitants with fuel when they had emptied their waggons they again returned for a fresh supply and this trade was continued throughout the year  as the settlers derived their subsistence from ministering to the wants of these primitive traders the articles exposed for sale and the places where they were sold bore strong outward marks of being expressly adapted to their tastes and wishes  the tailor displayed in his window a lilliputian pair of leather gaiters and a diminutive round frock while each doorpost was appropriately garnished with a model of a coalsack the two eatinghouse keepers exhibited joints of a magnitude and puddings of a solidity which coalheavers alone could appreciate and the fruitpie maker displayed on his wellscrubbed windowboard large white compositions of flour and dripping ornamented with pink stains giving rich promise of the fruit within which made their huge mouths water as they lingered past  but the choicest spot in all scotlandyard was the old publichouse in the corner  here in a dark wainscotedroom of ancient appearance cheered by the glow of a mighty fire and decorated with an enormous clock whereof the face was white and the figures black sat the lusty coalheavers quaffing large draughts of barclay’s best and puffing forth volumes of smoke which wreathed heavily above their heads and involved the room in a thick dark cloud  from this apartment might their voices be heard on a winter’s night penetrating to the very bank of the river as they shouted out some sturdy chorus or roared forth the burden of a popular song dwelling upon the last few words with a strength and length of emphasis which made the very roof tremble above them  here too would they tell old legends of what the thames was in ancient times when the patent shot manufactory wasn’t built and waterloobridge had never been thought of and then they would shake their heads with portentous looks to the deep edification of the rising generation of heavers who crowded round them and wondered where all this would end whereat the tailor would take his pipe solemnly from his mouth and say how that he hoped it might end well but he very much doubted whether it would or not and couldn’t rightly tell what to make of it—a mysterious expression of opinion delivered with a semiprophetic air which never failed to elicit the fullest concurrence of the assembled company and so they would go on drinking and wondering till ten o’clock came and with it the tailor’s wife to fetch him home when the little party broke up to meet again in the same room and say and do precisely the same things on the following evening at the same hour  about this time the barges that came up the river began to bring vague rumours to scotlandyard of somebody in the city having been heard to say that the lord mayor had threatened in so many words to pull down the old londonbridge and build up a new one  at first these rumours were disregarded as idle tales wholly destitute of foundation for nobody in scotlandyard doubted that if the lord mayor contemplated any such dark design he would just be clapped up in the tower for a week or two and then killed off for high treason  by degrees however the reports grew stronger and more frequent and at last a barge laden with numerous chaldrons of the best wallsend brought up the positive intelligence that several of the arches of the old bridge were stopped and that preparations were actually in progress for constructing the new one  what an excitement was visible in the old taproom on that memorable night  each man looked into his neighbour’s face pale with alarm and astonishment and read therein an echo of the sentiments which filled his own breast  the oldest heaver present proved to demonstration that the moment the piers were removed all the water in the thames would run clean off and leave a dry gully in its place what was to become of the coalbarges—of the trade of scotlandyard—of the very existence of its population  the tailor shook his head more sagely than usual and grimly pointing to a knife on the table bid them wait and see what happened  he said nothing—not he but if the lord mayor didn’t fall a victim to popular indignation why he would be rather astonished that was all  they did wait barge after barge arrived and still no tidings of the assassination of the lord mayor  the first stone was laid it was done by a duke—the king’s brother  years passed away and the bridge was opened by the king himself  in course of time the piers were removed and when the people in scotlandyard got up next morning in the confident expectation of being able to step over to pedlar’s acre without wetting the soles of their shoes they found to their unspeakable astonishment that the water was just where it used to be  a result so different from that which they had anticipated from this first improvement produced its full effect upon the inhabitants of scotlandyard  one of the eatinghouse keepers began to court public opinion and to look for customers among a new class of people  he covered his little diningtables with white cloths and got a painter’s apprentice to inscribe something about hot joints from twelve to two in one of the little panes of his shopwindow  improvement began to march with rapid strides to the very threshold of scotlandyard  a new market sprung up at hungerford and the police commissioners established their office in whitehallplace  the traffic in scotlandyard increased fresh members were added to the house of commons the metropolitan representatives found it a near cut and many other foot passengers followed their example  we marked the advance of civilisation and beheld it with a sigh  the eatinghouse keeper who manfully resisted the innovation of tablecloths was losing ground every day as his opponent gained it and a deadly feud sprung up between them  the genteel one no longer took his evening’s pint in scotlandyard but drank gin and water at a ‘parlour’ in parliamentstreet  the fruitpie maker still continued to visit the old room but he took to smoking cigars and began to call himself a pastrycook and to read the papers  the old heavers still assembled round the ancient fireplace but their talk was mournful and the loud song and the joyous shout were heard no more  and what is scotlandyard now  how have its old customs changed and how has the ancient simplicity of its inhabitants faded away  the old tottering publichouse is converted into a spacious and lofty ‘winevaults’ gold leaf has been used in the construction of the letters which emblazon its exterior and the poet’s art has been called into requisition to intimate that if you drink a certain description of ale you must hold fast by the rail  the tailor exhibits in his window the pattern of a foreignlooking brown surtout with silk buttons a fur collar and fur cuffs  he wears a stripe down the outside of each leg of his trousers and we have detected his assistants for he has assistants now in the act of sitting on the shopboard in the same uniform  at the other end of the little row of houses a bootmaker has established himself in a brick box with the additional innovation of a first floor and here he exposes for sale boots—real wellington boots—an article which a few years ago none of the original inhabitants had ever seen or heard of  it was but the other day that a dressmaker opened another little box in the middle of the row and when we thought that the spirit of change could produce no alteration beyond that a jeweller appeared and not content with exposing gilt rings and copper bracelets out of number put up an announcement which still sticks in his window that ‘ladies’ ears may be pierced within’  the dressmaker employs a young lady who wears pockets in her apron and the tailor informs the public that gentlemen may have their own materials made up  amidst all this change and restlessness and innovation there remains but one old man who seems to mourn the downfall of this ancient place he holds no converse with human kind but seated on a wooden bench at the angle of the wall which fronts the crossing from whitehallplace watches in silence the gambols of his sleek and wellfed dogs  he is the presiding genius of scotlandyard  years and years have rolled over his head but in fine weather or in foul hot or cold wet or dry hail rain or snow he is still in his accustomed spot  misery and want are depicted in his countenance his form is bent by age his head is grey with length of trial but there he sits from day to day brooding over the past and thither he will continue to drag his feeble limbs until his eyes have closed upon scotlandyard and upon the world together  a few years hence and the antiquary of another generation looking into some mouldy record of the strife and passions that agitated the world in these times may glance his eye over the pages we have just filled and not all his knowledge of the history of the past not all his blackletter lore or his skill in bookcollecting not all the dry studies of a long life or the dusty volumes that have cost him a fortune may help him to the whereabouts either of scotlandyard or of any one of the landmarks we have mentioned in describing it    chapter v—seven dials   we have always been of opinion that if tom king and the frenchman had not immortalised seven dials seven dials would have immortalised itself seven dials the region of song and poetry—first effusions and last dying speeches hallowed by the names of catnach and of pitts—names that will entwine themselves with costermongers and barrelorgans when penny magazines shall have superseded penny yards of song and capital punishment be unknown  look at the construction of the place  the gordian knot was all very well in its way so was the maze of hampton court so is the maze at the beulah spa so were the ties of stiff white neckcloths when the difficulty of getting one on was only to be equalled by the apparent impossibility of ever getting it off again  but what involutions can compare with those of seven dials  where is there such another maze of streets courts lanes and alleys  where such a pure mixture of englishmen and irishmen as in this complicated part of london  we boldly aver that we doubt the veracity of the legend to which we have adverted  we can suppose a man rash enough to inquire at random—at a house with lodgers too—for a mr thompson with all but the certainty before his eyes of finding at least two or three thompsons in any house of moderate dimensions but a frenchman—a frenchman in seven dials pooh  he was an irishman  tom king’s education had been neglected in his infancy and as he couldn’t understand half the man said he took it for granted he was talking french  the stranger who finds himself in ‘the dials’ for the first time and stands belzonilike at the entrance of seven obscure passages uncertain which to take will see enough around him to keep his curiosity and attention awake for no inconsiderable time  from the irregular square into which he has plunged the streets and courts dart in all directions until they are lost in the unwholesome vapour which hangs over the housetops and renders the dirty perspective uncertain and confined and lounging at every corner as if they came there to take a few gasps of such fresh air as has found its way so far but is too much exhausted already to be enabled to force itself into the narrow alleys around are groups of people whose appearance and dwellings would fill any mind but a regular londoner’s with astonishment  on one side a little crowd has collected round a couple of ladies who having imbibed the contents of various ‘threeouts’ of gin and bitters in the course of the morning have at length differed on some point of domestic arrangement and are on the eve of settling the quarrel satisfactorily by an appeal to blows greatly to the interest of other ladies who live in the same house and tenements adjoining and who are all partisans on one side or other  ‘vy don’t you pitch into her sarah’ exclaims one halfdressed matron by way of encouragement  ‘vy don’t you if my ’usband had treated her with a drain last night unbeknown to me i’d tear her precious eyes out—a wixen’  ‘what’s the matter ma’am’ inquires another old woman who has just bustled up to the spot  ‘matter’ replies the first speaker talking at the obnoxious combatant ‘matter  here’s poor dear mrs sulliwin as has five blessed children of her own can’t go out a charing for one arternoon but what hussies must be a comin’ and ’ticing avay her oun’ ’usband as she’s been married to twelve year come next easter monday for i see the certificate ven i vas a drinkin’ a cup o’ tea vith her only the werry last blessed ven’sday as ever was sent  i ’appen’d to say promiscuously “mrs sulliwin” says i—’  ‘what do you mean by hussies’ interrupts a champion of the other party who has evinced a strong inclination throughout to get up a branch fight on her own account ‘hooroar’ ejaculates a potboy in parenthesis ‘put the kyebosk on her mary’ ‘what do you mean by hussies’ reiterates the champion  ‘niver mind’ replies the opposition expressively ‘niver mind you go home and ven you’re quite sober mend your stockings’  this somewhat personal allusion not only to the lady’s habits of intemperance but also to the state of her wardrobe rouses her utmost ire and she accordingly complies with the urgent request of the bystanders to ‘pitch in’ with considerable alacrity  the scuffle became general and terminates in minor playbill phraseology with ‘arrival of the policemen interior of the stationhouse and impressive dénouement’  in addition to the numerous groups who are idling about the ginshops and squabbling in the centre of the road every post in the open space has its occupant who leans against it for hours with listless perseverance it is odd enough that one class of men in london appear to have no enjoyment beyond leaning against posts  we never saw a regular bricklayer’s labourer take any other recreation fighting excepted  pass through st giles’s in the evening of a weekday there they are in their fustian dresses spotted with brickdust and whitewash leaning against posts  walk through seven dials on sunday morning there they are again drab or light corduroy trousers blucher boots blue coats and great yellow waistcoats leaning against posts  the idea of a man dressing himself in his best clothes to lean against a post all day  the peculiar character of these streets and the close resemblance each one bears to its neighbour by no means tends to decrease the bewilderment in which the unexperienced wayfarer through ‘the dials’ finds himself involved  he traverses streets of dirty straggling houses with now and then an unexpected court composed of buildings as illproportioned and deformed as the halfnaked children that wallow in the kennels  here and there a little dark chandler’s shop with a cracked bell hung up behind the door to announce the entrance of a customer or betray the presence of some young gentleman in whom a passion for shop tills has developed itself at an early age others as if for support against some handsome lofty building which usurps the place of a low dingy publichouse long rows of broken and patched windows expose plants that may have flourished when ‘the dials’ were built in vessels as dirty as ‘the dials’ themselves and shops for the purchase of rags bones old iron and kitchenstuff vie in cleanliness with the birdfanciers and rabbitdealers which one might fancy so many arks but for the irresistible conviction that no bird in its proper senses who was permitted to leave one of them would ever come back again  brokers’ shops which would seem to have been established by humane individuals as refuges for destitute bugs interspersed with announcements of dayschools penny theatres petitionwriters mangles and music for balls or routs complete the ‘still life’ of the subject and dirty men filthy women squalid children fluttering shuttlecocks noisy battledores reeking pipes bad fruit more than doubtful oysters attenuated cats depressed dogs and anatomical fowls are its cheerful accompaniments  if the external appearance of the houses or a glance at their inhabitants present but few attractions a closer acquaintance with either is little calculated to alter one’s first impression  every room has its separate tenant and every tenant is by the same mysterious dispensation which causes a country curate to ‘increase and multiply’ most marvellously generally the head of a numerous family  the man in the shop perhaps is in the baked ‘jemmy’ line or the firewood and hearthstone line or any other line which requires a floating capital of eighteenpence or thereabouts and he and his family live in the shop and the small back parlour behind it  then there is an irish labourer and his family in the back kitchen and a jobbing man—carpetbeater and so forth—with his family in the front one  in the front onepair there’s another man with another wife and family and in the back onepair there’s ‘a young ’oman as takes in tambourwork and dresses quite genteel’ who talks a good deal about ‘my friend’ and can’t ‘abear anything low’  the second floor front and the rest of the lodgers are just a second edition of the people below except a shabbygenteel man in the back attic who has his halfpint of coffee every morning from the coffeeshop next door but one which boasts a little front den called a coffeeroom with a fireplace over which is an inscription politely requesting that ‘to prevent mistakes’ customers will ‘please to pay on delivery’  the shabbygenteel man is an object of some mystery but as he leads a life of seclusion and never was known to buy anything beyond an occasional pen except halfpints of coffee penny loaves and ha’porths of ink his fellowlodgers very naturally suppose him to be an author and rumours are current in the dials that he writes poems for mr warren  now anybody who passed through the dials on a hot summer’s evening and saw the different women of the house gossiping on the steps would be apt to think that all was harmony among them and that a more primitive set of people than the native diallers could not be imagined

policeofficer the result    chapter vi—meditations in monmouthstreet   we have always entertained a particular attachment towards monmouthstreet as the only true and real emporium for secondhand wearing apparel  monmouthstreet is venerable from its antiquity and respectable from its usefulness  holywellstreet we despise the redheaded and redwhiskered jews who forcibly haul you into their squalid houses and thrust you into a suit of clothes whether you will or not we detest  the inhabitants of monmouthstreet are a distinct class a peaceable and retiring race who immure themselves for the most part in deep cellars or small back parlours and who seldom come forth into the world except in the dusk and coolness of the evening when they may be seen seated in chairs on the pavement smoking their pipes or watching the gambols of their engaging children as they revel in the gutter a happy troop of infantine scavengers  their countenances bear a thoughtful and a dirty cast certain indications of their love of traffic and their habitations are distinguished by that disregard of outward appearance and neglect of personal comfort so common among people who are constantly immersed in profound speculations and deeply engaged in sedentary pursuits  we have hinted at the antiquity of our favourite spot  ‘a monmouthstreet laced coat’ was a byword a century ago and still we find monmouthstreet the same  pilot greatcoats with wooden buttons have usurped the place of the ponderous laced coats with full skirts embroidered waistcoats with large flaps have yielded to doublebreasted checks with rollcollars and threecornered hats of quaint appearance have given place to the low crowns and broad brims of the coachman school but it is the times that have changed not monmouthstreet through every alteration and every change monmouthstreet has still remained the burialplace of the fashions and such to judge from all present appearances it will remain until there are no more fashions to bury  we love to walk among these extensive groves of the illustrious dead and to indulge in the speculations to which they give rise now fitting a deceased coat then a dead pair of trousers and anon the mortal remains of a gaudy waistcoat upon some being of our own conjuring up and endeavouring from the shape and fashion of the garment itself to bring its former owner before our mind’s eye  we have gone on speculating in this way until whole rows of coats have started from their pegs and buttoned up of their own accord round the waists of imaginary wearers lines of trousers have jumped down to meet them waistcoats have almost burst with anxiety to put themselves on and half an acre of shoes have suddenly found feet to fit them and gone stumping down the street with a noise which has fairly awakened us from our pleasant reverie and driven us slowly away with a bewildered stare an object of astonishment to the good people of monmouthstreet and of no slight suspicion to the policemen at the opposite street corner  we were occupied in this manner the other day endeavouring to fit a pair of laceup halfboots on an ideal personage for whom to say the truth they were full a couple of sizes too small when our eyes happened to alight on a few suits of clothes ranged outside a shopwindow which it immediately struck us must at different periods have all belonged to and been worn by the same individual and had now by one of those strange conjunctions of circumstances which will occur sometimes come to be exposed together for sale in the same shop  the idea seemed a fantastic one and we looked at the clothes again with a firm determination not to be easily led away  no we were right the more we looked the more we were convinced of the accuracy of our previous impression  there was the man’s whole life written as legibly on those clothes as if we had his autobiography engrossed on parchment before us  the first was a patched and muchsoiled skeleton suit one of those straight blue cloth cases in which small boys used to be confined before belts and tunics had come in and old notions had gone out an ingenious contrivance for displaying the full symmetry of a boy’s figure by fastening him into a very tight jacket with an ornamental row of buttons over each shoulder and then buttoning his trousers over it so as to give his legs the appearance of being hooked on just under the armpits this was the boy’s dress  it had belonged to a town boy we could see there was a shortness about the legs and arms of the suit and a bagging at the knees peculiar to the rising youth of london streets  a small dayschool he had been at evidently  if it had been a regular boys’ school they wouldn’t have let him play on the floor so much and rub his knees so white  he had an indulgent mother too and plenty of halfpence as the numerous smears of some sticky substance about the pockets and just below the chin which even the salesman’s skill could not succeed in disguising sufficiently betokened  they were decent people but not overburdened with riches or he would not have so far outgrown the suit when he passed into those corduroys with the round jacket in which he went to a boys’ school however and learnt to write—and in ink of pretty tolerable blackness too if the place where he used to wipe his pen might be taken as evidence  a black suit and the jacket changed into a diminutive coat  his father had died and the mother had got the boy a messagelad’s place in some office  a longworn suit that one rusty and threadbare before it was laid aside but clean and free from soil to the last  poor woman  we could imagine her assumed cheerfulness over the scanty meal and the refusal of her own small portion that her hungry boy might have enough her constant anxiety for his welfare her pride in his growth mingled sometimes with the thought almost too acute to bear that as he grew to be a man his old affection might cool old kindnesses fade from his mind and old promises be forgotten—the sharp pain that even then a careless word or a cold look would give her—all crowded on our thoughts as vividly as if the very scene were passing before us  these things happen every hour and we all know it and yet we felt as much sorrow when we saw or fancied we saw—it makes no difference which—the change that began to take place now as if we had just conceived the bare possibility of such a thing for the first time  the next suit smart but slovenly meant to be gay and yet not half so decent as the threadbare apparel redolent of the idle lounge and the blackguard companions told us we thought that the widow’s comfort had rapidly faded away  we could imagine that coat—imagine we could see it we had seen it a hundred times—sauntering in company with three or four other coats of the same cut about some place of profligate resort at night  we dressed from the same shopwindow in an instant half a dozen boys of from fifteen to twenty and putting cigars into their mouths and their hands into their pockets watched them as they sauntered down the street and lingered at the corner with the obscene jest and the oftrepeated oath  we never lost sight of them till they had cocked their hats a little more on one side and swaggered into the publichouse and then we entered the desolate home where the mother sat late in the night alone we watched her as she paced the room in feverish anxiety and every now and then opened the door looked wistfully into the dark and empty street and again returned to be again and again disappointed  we beheld the look of patience with which she bore the brutish threat nay even the drunken blow and we heard the agony of tears that gushed from her very heart as she sank upon her knees in her solitary and wretched apartment  a long period had elapsed and a greater change had taken place by the time of casting off the suit that hung above  it was that of a stout broadshouldered sturdychested man and we knew at once as anybody would who glanced at that broadskirted green coat with the large metal buttons that its wearer seldom walked forth without a dog at his heels and some idle ruffian the very counterpart of himself at his side  the vices of the boy had grown with the man and we fancied his home then—if such a place deserve the name  we saw the bare and miserable room destitute of furniture crowded with his wife and children pale hungry and emaciated the man cursing their lamentations staggering to the taproom from whence he had just returned followed by his wife and a sickly infant clamouring for bread and heard the streetwrangle and noisy recrimination that his striking her occasioned  and then imagination led us to some metropolitan workhouse situated in the midst of crowded streets and alleys filled with noxious vapours and ringing with boisterous cries where an old and feeble woman imploring pardon for her son lay dying in a close dark room with no child to clasp her hand and no pure air from heaven to fan her brow  a stranger closed the eyes that settled into a cold unmeaning glare and strange ears received the words that murmured from the white and halfclosed lips  a coarse round frock with a worn cotton neckerchief and other articles of clothing of the commonest description completed the history  a prison and the sentence—banishment or the gallows  what would the man have given then to be once again the contented humble drudge of his boyish years to have been restored to life but for a week a day an hour a minute only for so long a time as would enable him to say one word of passionate regret to and hear one sound of heartfelt forgiveness from the cold and ghastly form that lay rotting in the pauper’s grave the children wild in the streets the mother a destitute widow both deeply tainted with the deep disgrace of the husband and father’s name and impelled by sheer necessity down the precipice that had led him to a lingering death possibly of many years’ duration thousands of miles away  we had no clue to the end of the tale but it was easy to guess its termination  we took a step or two further on and by way of restoring the naturally cheerful tone of our thoughts began fitting visionary feet and legs into a cellarboard full of boots and shoes with a speed and accuracy that would have astonished the most expert artist in leather living  there was one pair of boots in particular—a jolly goodtempered heartylooking pair of tops that excited our warmest regard and we had got a fine redfaced jovial fellow of a marketgardener into them before we had made their acquaintance half a minute  they were just the very thing for him  there was his huge fat legs bulging over the tops and fitting them too tight to admit of his tucking in the loops he had pulled them on by and his kneecords with an interval of stocking and his blue apron tucked up round his waist and his red neckerchief and blue coat and a white hat stuck on one side of his head and there he stood with a broad grin on his great red face whistling away as if any other idea but that of being happy and comfortable had never entered his brain  this was the very man after our own heart we knew all about him we had seen him coming up to coventgarden in his green chaisecart with the fat tubby little horse half a thousand times and even while we cast an affectionate look upon his boots at that instant the form of a coquettish servantmaid suddenly sprung into a pair of denmark satin shoes that stood beside them and we at once recognised the very girl who accepted his offer of a ride just on this side the hammersmith suspensionbridge the very last tuesday morning we rode into town from richmond  a very smart female in a showy bonnet stepped into a pair of grey cloth boots with black fringe and binding that were studiously pointing out their toes on the other side of the topboots and seemed very anxious to engage his attention but we didn’t observe that our friend the marketgardener appeared at all captivated with these blandishments for beyond giving a knowing wink when they first began as if to imply that he quite understood their end and object he took no further notice of them  his indifference however was amply recompensed by the excessive gallantry of a very old gentleman with a silverheaded stick who tottered into a pair of large list shoes that were standing in one corner of the board and indulged in a variety of gestures expressive of his admiration of the lady in the cloth boots to the immeasurable amusement of a young fellow we put into a pair of longquartered pumps who we thought would have split the coat that slid down to meet him with laughing  we had been looking on at this little pantomime with great satisfaction for some time when to our unspeakable astonishment we perceived that the whole of the characters including a numerous corps de ballet of boots and shoes in the background into which we had been hastily thrusting as many feet as we could press into the service were arranging themselves in order for dancing and some music striking up at the moment to it they went without delay  it was perfectly delightful to witness the agility of the marketgardener  out went the boots first on one side then on the other then cutting then shuffling then setting to the denmark satins then advancing then retreating then going round and then repeating the whole of the evolutions again without appearing to suffer in the least from the violence of the exercise  nor were the denmark satins a bit behindhand for they jumped and bounded about in all directions and though they were neither so regular nor so true to the time as the cloth boots still as they seemed to do it from the heart and to enjoy it more we candidly confess that we preferred their style of dancing to the other  but the old gentleman in the list shoes was the most amusing object in the whole party for besides his grotesque attempts to appear youthful and amorous which were sufficiently entertaining in themselves the young fellow in the pumps managed so artfully that every time the old gentleman advanced to salute the lady in the cloth boots he trod with his whole weight on the old fellow’s toes which made him roar with anguish and rendered all the others like to die of laughing  we were in the full enjoyment of these festivities when we heard a shrill and by no means musical voice exclaim ‘hope you’ll know me agin imperence’ and on looking intently forward to see from whence the sound came we found that it proceeded not from the young lady in the cloth boots as we had at first been inclined to suppose but from a bulky lady of elderly appearance who was seated in a chair at the head of the cellarsteps apparently for the purpose of superintending the sale of the articles arranged there  a barrelorgan which had been in full force close behind us ceased playing the people we had been fitting into the shoes and boots took to flight at the interruption and as we were conscious that in the depth of our meditations we might have been rudely staring at the old lady for half an hour without knowing it we took to flight too and were soon immersed in the deepest obscurity of the adjacent ‘dials’    chapter vii—hackneycoach stands   we maintain that hackneycoaches properly so called belong solely to the metropolis  we may be told that there are hackneycoach stands in edinburgh and not to go quite so far for a contradiction to our position we may be reminded that liverpool manchester ‘and other large towns’ as the parliamentary phrase goes have their hackneycoach stands  we readily concede to these places the possession of certain vehicles which may look almost as dirty and even go almost as slowly as london hackneycoaches but that they have the slightest claim to compete with the metropolis either in point of stands drivers or cattle we indignantly deny  take a regular ponderous rickety london hackneycoach of the old school and let any man have the boldness to assert if he can that he ever beheld any object on the face of the earth which at all resembles it unless indeed it were another hackneycoach of the same date  we have recently observed on certain stands and we say it with deep regret rather dapper green chariots and coaches of polished yellow with four wheels of the same colour as the coach whereas it is perfectly notorious to every one who has studied the subject that every wheel ought to be of a different colour and a different size  these are innovations and like other miscalled improvements awful signs of the restlessness of the public mind and the little respect paid to our timehonoured institutions  why should hackneycoaches be clean  our ancestors found them dirty and left them so  why should we with a feverish wish to ‘keep moving’ desire to roll along at the rate of six miles an hour while they were content to rumble over the stones at four  these are solemn considerations  hackneycoaches are part and parcel of the law of the land they were settled by the legislature plated and numbered by the wisdom of parliament  then why have they been swamped by cabs and omnibuses  or why should people be allowed to ride quickly for eightpence a mile after parliament had come to the solemn decision that they should pay a shilling a mile for riding slowly  we pause for a reply—and having no chance of getting one begin a fresh paragraph  our acquaintance with hackneycoach stands is of long standing  we are a walking book of fares feeling ourselves half bound as it were to be always in the right on contested points  we know all the regular watermen within three miles of coventgarden by sight and should be almost tempted to believe that all the hackneycoach horses in that district knew us by sight too if onehalf of them were not blind  we take great interest in hackneycoaches but we seldom drive having a knack of turning ourselves over when we attempt to do so  we are as great friends to horses hackneycoach and otherwise as the renowned mr martin of costermonger notoriety and yet we never ride  we keep no horse but a clotheshorse enjoy no saddle so much as a saddle of mutton and following our own inclinations have never followed the hounds  leaving these fleeter means of getting over the ground or of depositing oneself upon it to those who like them by hackneycoach stands we take our stand  there is a hackneycoach stand under the very window at which we are writing there is only one coach on it now but it is a fair specimen of the class of vehicles to which we have alluded—a great lumbering square concern of a dingy yellow colour like a bilious brunette with very small glasses but very large frames the panels are ornamented with a faded coat of arms in shape something like a dissected bat the axletree is red and the majority of the wheels are green  the box is partially covered by an old greatcoat with a multiplicity of capes and some extraordinarylooking clothes and the straw with which the canvas cushion is stuffed is sticking up in several places as if in rivalry of the hay which is peeping through the chinks in the boot  the horses with drooping heads and each with a mane and tail as scanty and straggling as those of a wornout rockinghorse are standing patiently on some damp straw occasionally wincing and rattling the harness and now and then one of them lifts his mouth to the ear of his companion as if he were saying in a whisper that he should like to assassinate the coachman  the coachman himself is in the wateringhouse and the waterman with his hands forced into his pockets as far as they can possibly go is dancing the ‘double shuffle’ in front of the pump to keep his feet warm  the servantgirl with the pink ribbons at no 5 opposite suddenly opens the streetdoor and four small children forthwith rush out and scream ‘coach’ with all their might and main  the waterman darts from the pump seizes the horses by their respective bridles and drags them and the coach too round to the house shouting all the time for the coachman at the very top or rather very bottom of his voice for it is a deep bass growl  a response is heard from the taproom the coachman in his woodensoled shoes makes the street echo again as he runs across it and then there is such a struggling and backing and grating of the kennel to get the coachdoor opposite the housedoor that the children are in perfect ecstasies of delight  what a commotion  the old lady who has been stopping there for the last month is going back to the country  out comes box after box and one side of the vehicle is filled with luggage in no time the children get into everybody’s way and the youngest who has upset himself in his attempts to carry an umbrella is borne off wounded and kicking  the youngsters disappear and a short pause ensues during which the old lady is no doubt kissing them all round in the back parlour  she appears at last followed by her married daughter all the children and both the servants who with the joint assistance of the coachman and waterman manage to get her safely into the coach  a cloak is handed in and a little basket which we could almost swear contains a small black bottle and a paper of sandwiches up go the steps bang goes the door ‘goldencross charingcross tom’ says the waterman ‘goodbye grandma’ cry the children off jingles the coach at the rate of three miles an hour and the mamma and children retire into the house with the exception of one little villain who runs up the street at the top of his speed pursued by the servant not illpleased to have such an opportunity of displaying her attractions she brings him back and after casting two or three gracious glances across the way which are either intended for us or the potboy we are not quite certain which shuts the door and the hackneycoach stand is again at a standstill  we have been frequently amused with the intense delight with which ‘a servant of all work’ who is sent for a coach deposits herself inside and the unspeakable gratification which boys who have been despatched on a similar errand appear to derive from mounting the box  but we never recollect to have been more amused with a hackneycoach party than one we saw early the other morning in tottenhamcourtroad  it was a weddingparty and emerged from one of the inferior streets near fitzroysquare  there were the bride with a thin white dress and a great red face and the bridesmaid a little dumpy goodhumoured young woman dressed of course in the same appropriate costume and the bridegroom and his chosen friend in blue coats yellow waistcoats white trousers and berlin gloves to match  they stopped at the corner of the street and called a coach with an air of indescribable dignity the moment they were in the bridesmaid threw a red shawl which she had no doubt brought on purpose negligently over the number on the door evidently to delude pedestrians into the belief that the hackneycoach was a private carriage and away they went perfectly satisfied that the imposition was successful and quite unconscious that there was a great staring number stuck up behind on a plate as large as a schoolboy’s slate  a shilling a mile—the ride was worth five at least to them  what an interesting book a hackneycoach might produce if it could carry as much in its head as it does in its body  the autobiography of a brokendown hackneycoach would surely be as amusing as the autobiography of a brokendown hackneyed dramatist and it might tell as much of its travels with the pole as others have of their expeditions to it  how many stories might be related of the different people it had conveyed on matters of business or profit—pleasure or pain  and how many melancholy tales of the same people at different periods  the countrygirl—the showy overdressed woman—the drunken prostitute  the raw apprentice—the dissipated spendthrift—the thief  talk of cabs  cabs are all very well in cases of expedition when it’s a matter of neck or nothing life or death your temporary home or your long one  but besides a cab’s lacking that gravity of deportment which so peculiarly distinguishes a hackneycoach let it never be forgotten that a cab is a thing of yesterday and that he never was anything better  a hackneycab has always been a hackneycab from his first entry into life whereas a hackneycoach is a remnant of past gentility a victim to fashion a hangeron of an old english family wearing their arms and in days of yore escorted by men wearing their livery stripped of his finery and thrown upon the world like a oncesmart footman when he is no longer sufficiently juvenile for his office progressing lower and lower in the scale of fourwheeled degradation until at last it comes to—a stand    chapter viii—doctors’ commons   walking without any definite object through st paul’s churchyard a little while ago we happened to turn down a street entitled ‘paul’schain’ and keeping straight forward for a few hundred yards found ourself as a natural consequence in doctors’ commons  now doctors’ commons being familiar by name to everybody as the place where they grant marriagelicenses to lovesick couples and divorces to unfaithful ones register the wills of people who have any property to leave and punish hasty gentlemen who call ladies by unpleasant names we no sooner discovered that we were really within its precincts than we felt a laudable desire to become better acquainted therewith and as the first object of our curiosity was the court whose decrees can even unloose the bonds of matrimony we procured a direction to it and bent our steps thither without delay  crossing a quiet and shady courtyard paved with stone and frowned upon by old red brick houses on the doors of which were painted the names of sundry learned civilians we paused before a small greenbaized brassheadednailed door which yielding to our gentle push at once admitted us into an old quaintlooking apartment with sunken windows and black carved wainscoting at the upper end of which seated on a raised platform of semicircular shape were about a dozen solemnlooking gentlemen in crimson gowns and wigs  at a more elevated desk in the centre sat a very fat and redfaced gentleman in tortoiseshell spectacles whose dignified appearance announced the judge and round a long greenbaized table below something like a billiardtable without the cushions and pockets were a number of very selfimportantlooking personages in stiff neckcloths and black gowns with white fur collars whom we at once set down as proctors  at the lower end of the billiardtable was an individual in an armchair and a wig whom we afterwards discovered to be the registrar and seated behind a little desk near the door were a respectablelooking man in black of about twentystone weight or thereabouts and a fatfaced smirking civillooking body in a black gown black kid gloves knee shorts and silks with a shirtfrill in his bosom curls on his head and a silver staff in his hand whom we had no difficulty in recognising as the officer of the court  the latter indeed speedily set our mind at rest upon this point for advancing to our elbow and opening a conversation forthwith he had communicated to us in less than five minutes that he was the apparitor and the other the courtkeeper that this was the arches court and therefore the counsel wore red gowns and the proctors fur collars and that when the other courts sat there they didn’t wear red gowns or fur collars either with many other scraps of intelligence equally interesting  besides these two officers there was a little thin old man with long grizzly hair crouched in a remote corner whose duty our communicative friend informed us was to ring a large handbell when the court opened in the morning and who for aught his appearance betokened to the contrary might have been similarly employed for the last two centuries at least  the redfaced gentleman in the tortoiseshell spectacles had got all the talk to himself just then and very well he was doing it too only he spoke very fast but that was habit and rather thick but that was good living  so we had plenty of time to look about us  there was one individual who amused us mightily  this was one of the bewigged gentlemen in the red robes who was straddling before the fire in the centre of the court in the attitude of the brazen colossus to the complete exclusion of everybody else  he had gathered up his robe behind in much the same manner as a slovenly woman would her petticoats on a very dirty day in order that he might feel the full warmth of the fire  his wig was put on all awry with the tail straggling about his neck his scanty grey trousers and short black gaiters made in the worst possible style imported an additional inelegant appearance to his uncouth person and his limp badlystarched shirtcollar almost obscured his eyes  we shall never be able to claim any credit as a physiognomist again for after a careful scrutiny of this gentleman’s countenance we had come to the conclusion that it bespoke nothing but conceit and silliness when our friend with the silver staff whispered in our ear that he was no other than a doctor of civil law and heaven knows what besides  so of course we were mistaken and he must be a very talented man  he conceals it so well though—perhaps with the merciful view of not astonishing ordinary people too much—that you would suppose him to be one of the stupidest dogs alive  the gentleman in the spectacles having concluded his judgment and a few minutes having been allowed to elapse to afford time for the buzz of the court to subside the registrar called on the next cause which was ‘the office of the judge promoted by bumple against sludberry’  a general movement was visible in the court at this announcement and the obliging functionary with silver staff whispered us that ‘there would be some fun now for this was a brawling case’  we were not rendered much the wiser by this piece of information till we found by the opening speech of the counsel for the promoter that under a halfobsolete statute of one of the edwards the court was empowered to visit with the penalty of excommunication any person who should be proved guilty of the crime of ‘brawling’ or ‘smiting’ in any church or vestry adjoining thereto and it appeared by some eightandtwenty affidavits which were duly referred to that on a certain night at a certain vestrymeeting in a certain parish particularly set forth thomas sludberry the party appeared against in that suit had made use of and applied to michael bumple the promoter the words ‘you be blowed’ and that on the said michael bumple and others remonstrating with the said thomas sludberry on the impropriety of his conduct the said thomas sludberry repeated the aforesaid expression ‘you be blowed’ and furthermore desired and requested to know whether the said michael bumple ‘wanted anything for himself’ adding ‘that if the said michael bumple did want anything for himself he the said thomas sludberry was the man to give it him’ at the same time making use of other heinous and sinful expressions all of which bumple submitted came within the intent and meaning of the act and therefore he for the soul’s health and chastening of sludberry prayed for sentence of excommunication against him accordingly  upon these facts a long argument was entered into on both sides to the great edification of a number of persons interested in the parochial squabbles who crowded the court and when some very long and grave speeches had been made pro and con the redfaced gentleman in the tortoiseshell spectacles took a review of the case which occupied half an hour more and then pronounced upon sludberry the awful sentence of excommunication for a fortnight and payment of the costs of the suit upon this sludberry who was a little redfaced slylooking gingerbeer seller addressed the court and said if they’d be good enough to take off the costs and excommunicate him for the term of his natural life instead it would be much more convenient to him for he never went to church at all  to this appeal the gentleman in the spectacles made no other reply than a look of virtuous indignation and sludberry and his friends retired  as the man with the silver staff informed us that the court was on the point of rising we retired too—pondering as we walked away upon the beautiful spirit of these ancient ecclesiastical laws the kind and neighbourly feelings they are calculated to awaken and the strong attachment to religious institutions which they cannot fail to engender  we were so lost in these meditations that we had turned into the street and run up against a doorpost before we recollected where we were walking  on looking upwards to see what house we had stumbled upon the words ‘prerogativeoffice’ written in large characters met our eye and as we were in a sightseeing humour and the place was a public one we walked in  the room into which we walked was a long busylooking place partitioned off on either side into a variety of little boxes in which a few clerks were engaged in copying or examining deeds  down the centre of the room were several desks nearly breast high at each of which three or four people were standing poring over large volumes  as we knew that they were searching for wills they attracted our attention at once  it was curious to contrast the lazy indifference of the attorneys’ clerks who were making a search for some legal purpose with the air of earnestness and interest which distinguished the strangers to the place who were looking up the will of some deceased relative the former pausing every now and then with an impatient yawn or raising their heads to look at the people who passed up and down the room the latter stooping over the book and running down column after column of names in the deepest abstraction  there was one little dirtyfaced man in a blue apron who after a whole morning’s search extending some fifty years back had just found the will to which he wished to refer which one of the officials was reading to him in a low hurried voice from a thick vellum book with large clasps it was perfectly evident that the more the clerk read the less the man with the blue apron understood about the matter  when the volume was first brought down he took off his hat smoothed down his hair smiled with great selfsatisfaction and looked up in the reader’s face with the air of a man who had made up his mind to recollect every word he heard the first two or three lines were intelligible enough but then the technicalities began and the little man began to look rather dubious then came a whole string of complicated trusts and he was regularly at sea  as the reader proceeded it was quite apparent that it was a hopeless case and the little man with his mouth open and his eyes fixed upon his face looked on with an expression of bewilderment and perplexity irresistibly ludicrous  a little further on a hardfeatured old man with a deeplywrinkled face was intently perusing a lengthy will with the aid of a pair of horn spectacles occasionally pausing from his task and slily noting down some brief memorandum of the bequests contained in it  every wrinkle about his toothless mouth and sharp keen eyes told of avarice and cunning  his clothes were nearly threadbare but it was easy to see that he wore them from choice and not from necessity all his looks and gestures down to the very small pinches of snuff which he every now and then took from a little tin canister told of wealth and penury and avarice  as he leisurely closed the register put up his spectacles and folded his scraps of paper in a large leathern pocketbook we thought what a nice hard bargain he was driving with some povertystricken legatee who tired of waiting year after year until some lifeinterest should fall in was selling his chance just as it began to grow most valuable for a twelfth part of its worth  it was a good speculation—a very safe one the old man stowed his pocketbook carefully in the breast of his greatcoat and hobbled away with a leer of triumph  that will had made him ten years younger at the lowest computation  having commenced our observations we should certainly have extended them to another dozen of people at least had not a sudden shutting up and putting away of the wormeaten old books warned us that the time for closing the office had arrived and thus deprived us of a pleasure and spared our readers an infliction  we naturally fell into a train of reflection as we walked homewards upon the curious old records of likings and dislikings of jealousies and revenges of affection defying the power of death and hatred pursued beyond the grave which these depositories contain silent but striking tokens some of them of excellence of heart and nobleness of soul melancholy examples others of the worst passions of human nature  how many men as they lay speechless and helpless on the bed of death would have given worlds but for the strength and power to blot out the silent evidence of animosity and bitterness which now stands registered against them in doctors’ commons    chapter ix—london recreations   the wish of persons in the humbler classes of life to ape the manners and customs of those whom fortune has placed above them is often the subject of remark and not unfrequently of complaint  the inclination may and no doubt does exist to a great extent among the small gentility—the wouldbe aristocrats—of the middle classes  tradesmen and clerks with fashionable novelreading families and circulatinglibrarysubscribing daughters get up small assemblies in humble imitation of almack’s and promenade the dingy ‘large room’ of some secondrate hotel with as much complacency as the enviable few who are privileged to exhibit their magnificence in that exclusive haunt of fashion and foolery  aspiring young ladies who read flaming accounts of some ‘fancy fair in high life’ suddenly grow desperately charitable visions of admiration and matrimony float before their eyes some wonderfully meritorious institution which by the strangest accident in the world has never been heard of before is discovered to be in a languishing condition thomson’s great room or johnson’s nurseryground is forthwith engaged and the aforesaid young ladies from mere charity exhibit themselves for three days from twelve to four for the small charge of one shilling per head  with the exception of these classes of society however and a few weak and insignificant persons we do not think the attempt at imitation to which we have alluded prevails in any great degree  the different character of the recreations of different classes has often afforded us amusement and we have chosen it for the subject of our present sketch in the hope that it may possess some amusement for our readers  if the regular city man who leaves lloyd’s at five o’clock and drives home to hackney clapton stamfordhill or elsewhere can be said to have any daily recreation beyond his dinner it is his garden  he never does anything to it with his own hands but he takes great pride in it notwithstanding and if you are desirous of paying your addresses to the youngest daughter be sure to be in raptures with every flower and shrub it contains  if your poverty of expression compel you to make any distinction between the two we would certainly recommend your bestowing more admiration on his garden than his wine  he always takes a walk round it before he starts for town in the morning and is particularly anxious that the fishpond should be kept specially neat  if you call on him on sunday in summertime about an hour before dinner you will find him sitting in an armchair on the lawn behind the house with a straw hat on reading a sunday paper  a short distance from him you will most likely observe a handsome paroquet in a large brasswire cage ten to one but the two eldest girls are loitering in one of the side walks accompanied by a couple of young gentlemen who are holding parasols over them—of course only to keep the sun off—while the younger children with the under nurserymaid are strolling listlessly about in the shade beyond these occasions his delight in his garden appears to arise more from the consciousness of possession than actual enjoyment of it  when he drives you down to dinner on a weekday he is rather fatigued with the occupations of the morning and tolerably cross into the bargain but when the cloth is removed and he has drank three or four glasses of his favourite port he orders the french windows of his diningroom which of course look into the garden to be opened and throwing a silk handkerchief over his head and leaning back in his armchair descants at considerable length upon its beauty and the cost of maintaining it this is to impress you—who are a young friend of the family—with a due sense of the excellence of the garden and the wealth of its owner and when he has exhausted the subject he goes to sleep  there is another and a very different class of men whose recreation is their garden  an individual of this class resides some short distance from town—say in the hampsteadroad or the kilburnroad or any other road where the houses are small and neat and have little slips of back garden  he and his wife—who is as clean and compact a little body as himself—have occupied the same house ever since he retired from business twenty years ago  they have no family  they once had a son who died at about five years old  the child’s portrait hangs over the mantelpiece in the best sittingroom and a little cart he used to draw about is carefully preserved as a relic  in fine weather the old gentleman is almost constantly in the garden and when it is too wet to go into it he will look out of the window at it by the hour together  he has always something to do there and you will see him digging and sweeping and cutting and planting with manifest delight  in springtime there is no end to the sowing of seeds and sticking little bits of wood over them with labels which look like epitaphs to their memory and in the evening when the sun has gone down the perseverance with which he lugs a great wateringpot about is perfectly astonishing  the only other recreation he has is the newspaper which he peruses every day from beginning to end generally reading the most interesting pieces of intelligence to his wife during breakfast  the old lady is very fond of flowers as the hyacinthglasses in the parlourwindow and geraniumpots in the little front court testify  she takes great pride in the garden too and when one of the four fruittrees produces rather a larger gooseberry than usual it is carefully preserved under a wineglass on the sideboard for the edification of visitors who are duly informed that mr soandso planted the tree which produced it with his own hands  on a summer’s evening when the large wateringpot has been filled and emptied some fourteen times and the old couple have quite exhausted themselves by trotting about you will see them sitting happily together in the little summerhouse enjoying the calm and peace of the twilight and watching the shadows as they fall upon the garden and gradually growing thicker and more sombre obscure the tints of their gayest flowers—no bad emblem of the years that have silently rolled over their heads deadening in their course the brightest hues of early hopes and feelings which have long since faded away  these are their only recreations and they require no more  they have within themselves the materials of comfort and content and the only anxiety of each is to die before the other  this is no ideal sketch  there used to be many old people of this description their numbers may have diminished and may decrease still more  whether the course female education has taken of late days—whether the pursuit of giddy frivolities and empty nothings has tended to unfit women for that quiet domestic life in which they show far more beautifully than in the most crowded assembly is a question we should feel little gratification in discussing we hope not  let us turn now to another portion of the london population whose recreations present about as strong a contrast as can well be conceived—we mean the sunday pleasurers and let us beg our readers to imagine themselves stationed by our side in some wellknown rural ‘teagardens’  the heat is intense this afternoon and the people of whom there are additional parties arriving every moment look as warm as the tables which have been recently painted and have the appearance of being redhot  what a dust and noise  men and women—boys and girls—sweethearts and married people—babies in arms and children in chaises—pipes and shrimps—cigars and periwinkles—tea and tobacco gentlemen in alarming waistcoats and steel watchguards promenading about three abreast with surprising dignity or as the gentleman in the next box facetiously observes ‘cutting it uncommon fat’—ladies with great long white pockethandkerchiefs like small tablecloths in their hands chasing one another on the grass in the most playful and interesting manner with the view of attracting the attention of the aforesaid gentlemen—husbands in perspective ordering bottles of gingerbeer for the objects of their affections with a lavish disregard of expense and the said objects washing down huge quantities of ‘shrimps’ and ‘winkles’ with an equal disregard of their own bodily health and subsequent comfort—boys with great silk hats just balanced on the top of their heads smoking cigars and trying to look as if they liked them—gentlemen in pink shirts and blue waistcoats occasionally upsetting either themselves or somebody else with their own canes  some of the finery of these people provokes a smile but they are all clean and happy and disposed to be goodnatured and sociable  those two motherlylooking women in the smart pelisses who are chatting so confidentially inserting a ‘ma’am’ at every fourth word scraped an acquaintance about a quarter of an hour ago it originated in admiration of the little boy who belongs to one of them—that diminutive specimen of mortality in the threecornered pink satin hat with black feathers  the two men in the blue coats and drab trousers who are walking up and down smoking their pipes are their husbands  the party in the opposite box are a pretty fair specimen of the generality of the visitors  these are the father and mother and old grandmother a young man and woman and an individual addressed by the euphonious title of ‘uncle bill’ who is evidently the wit of the party  they have some halfdozen children with them but it is scarcely necessary to notice the fact for that is a matter of course here  every woman in ‘the gardens’ who has been married for any length of time must have had twins on two or three occasions it is impossible to account for the extent of juvenile population in any other way  observe the inexpressible delight of the old grandmother at uncle bill’s splendid joke of ‘tea for four breadandbutter for forty’ and the loud explosion of mirth which follows his wafering a paper ‘pigtail’ on the waiter’s collar  the young man is evidently ‘keeping company’ with uncle bill’s niece and uncle bill’s hints—such as ‘don’t forget me at the dinner you know’ ‘i shall look out for the cake sally’ ‘i’ll be godfather to your first—wager it’s a boy’ and so forth are equally embarrassing to the young people and delightful to the elder ones  as to the old grandmother she is in perfect ecstasies and does nothing but laugh herself into fits of coughing until they have finished the ‘ginandwater warm with’ of which uncle bill ordered ‘glasses round’ after tea ‘just to keep the night air out and to do it up comfortable and riglar arter sitch an astonishing hot day’  it is getting dark and the people begin to move  the field leading to town is quite full of them the little handchaises are dragged wearily along the children are tired and amuse themselves and the company generally by crying or resort to the much more pleasant expedient of going to sleep—the mothers begin to wish they were at home again—sweethearts grow more sentimental than ever as the time for parting arrives—the gardens look mournful enough by the light of the two lanterns which hang against the trees for the convenience of smokers—and the waiters who have been running about incessantly for the last six hours think they feel a little tired as they count their glasses and their gains    chapter x—the river   ‘are you fond of the water’ is a question very frequently asked in hot summer weather by amphibiouslooking young men  ‘very’ is the general reply  ‘an’t you’—‘hardly ever off it’ is the response accompanied by sundry adjectives expressive of the speaker’s heartfelt admiration of that element  now with all respect for the opinion of society in general and cutter clubs in particular we humbly suggest that some of the most painful reminiscences in the mind of every individual who has occasionally disported himself on the thames must be connected with his aquatic recreations  who ever heard of a successful waterparty—or to put the question in a still more intelligible form who ever saw one  we have been on water excursions out of number but we solemnly declare that we cannot call to mind one single occasion of the kind which was not marked by more miseries than any one would suppose could be reasonably crowded into the space of some eight or nine hours  something has always gone wrong  either the cork of the saladdressing has come out or the most anxiously expected member of the party has not come out or the most disagreeable man in company would come out or a child or two have fallen into the water or the gentleman who undertook to steer has endangered everybody’s life all the way or the gentlemen who volunteered to row have been ‘out of practice’ and performed very alarming evolutions putting their oars down into the water and not being able to get them up again or taking terrific pulls without putting them in at all in either case pitching over on the backs of their heads with startling violence and exhibiting the soles of their pumps to the ‘sitters’ in the boat in a very humiliating manner  we grant that the banks of the thames are very beautiful at richmond and twickenham and other distant havens often sought though seldom reached but from the ‘redus’ back to blackfriarsbridge the scene is wonderfully changed  the penitentiary is a noble building no doubt and the sportive youths who ‘go in’ at that particular part of the river on a summer’s evening may be all very well in perspective but when you are obliged to keep in shore coming home and the young ladies will colour up and look perseveringly the other way while the married dittos cough slightly and stare very hard at the water you feel awkward—especially if you happen to have been attempting the most distant approach to sentimentality for an hour or two previously  although experience and suffering have produced in our minds the result we have just stated we are by no means blind to a proper sense of the fun which a lookeron may extract from the amateurs of boating  what can be more amusing than searle’s yard on a fine sunday morning  it’s a richmond tide and some dozen boats are preparing for the reception of the parties who have engaged them  two or three fellows in great rough trousers and guernsey shirts are getting them ready by easy stages now coming down the yard with a pair of sculls and a cushion—then having a chat with the ‘jack’ who like all his tribe seems to be wholly incapable of doing anything but lounging about—then going back again and returning with a rudderline and a stretcher—then solacing themselves with another chat—and then wondering with their hands in their capacious pockets ‘where them gentlemen’s got to as ordered the six’  one of these the head man with the legs of his trousers carefully tucked up at the bottom to admit the water we presume—for it is an element in which he is infinitely more at home than on land—is quite a character and shares with the defunct oysterswallower the celebrated name of ‘dando’ watch him as taking a few minutes’ respite from his toils he negligently seats himself on the edge of a boat and fans his broad bushy chest with a cap scarcely half so furry  look at his magnificent though reddish whiskers and mark the somewhat native humour with which he ‘chaffs’ the boys and ’prentices or cunningly gammons the gen’lm’n into the gift of a glass of gin of which we verily believe he swallows in one day as much as any six ordinary men without ever being one atom the worse for it  but the party arrives and dando relieved from his state of uncertainty starts up into activity  they approach in full aquatic costume with round blue jackets striped shirts and caps of all sizes and patterns from the velvet skullcap of french manufacture to the easy headdress familiar to the students of the old spellingbooks as having on the authority of the portrait formed part of the costume of the reverend mr dilworth  this is the most amusing time to observe a regular sunday waterparty there has evidently been up to this period no inconsiderable degree of boasting on everybody’s part relative to his knowledge of navigation the sight of the water rapidly cools their courage and the air of selfdenial with which each of them insists on somebody else’s taking an oar is perfectly delightful  at length after a great deal of changing and fidgeting consequent upon the election of a strokeoar the inability of one gentleman to pull on this side of another to pull on that and of a third to pull at all the boat’s crew are seated  ‘shove her off’ cries the cockswain who looks as easy and comfortable as if he were steering in the bay of biscay  the order is obeyed the boat is immediately turned completely round and proceeds towards westminsterbridge amidst such a splashing and struggling as never was seen before except when the royal george went down  ‘back wa’ater sir’ shouts dando ‘back wa’ater you sir aft’ upon which everybody thinking he must be the individual referred to they all back water and back comes the boat stern first to the spot whence it started  ‘back water you sir aft pull round you sir for’ad can’t you’ shouts dando in a frenzy of excitement  ‘pull round tom can’t you’ reechoes one of the party  ‘tom an’t for’ad’ replies another  ‘yes he is’ cries a third and the unfortunate young man at the imminent risk of breaking a bloodvessel pulls and pulls until the head of the boat fairly lies in the direction of vauxhallbridge  ‘that’s right—now pull all on you’ shouts dando again adding in an undertone to somebody by him ‘blowed if hever i see sich a set of muffs’ and away jogs the boat in a zigzag direction every one of the six oars dipping into the water at a different time and the yard is once more clear until the arrival of the next party  a wellcontested rowingmatch on the thames is a very lively and interesting scene  the water is studded with boats of all sorts kinds and descriptions places in the coalbarges at the different wharfs are let to crowds of spectators beer and tobacco flow freely about men women and children wait for the start in breathless expectation cutters of six and eight oars glide gently up and down waiting to accompany their protégés during the race bands of music add to the animation if not to the harmony of the scene groups of watermen are assembled at the different stairs discussing the merits of the respective candidates and the prize wherry which is rowed slowly about by a pair of sculls is an object of general interest  two o’clock strikes and everybody looks anxiously in the direction of the bridge through which the candidates for the prize will come—halfpast two and the general attention which has been preserved so long begins to flag when suddenly a gun is heard and a noise of distant hurra’ing along each bank of the river—every head is bent forward—the noise draws nearer and nearer—the boats which have been waiting at the bridge start briskly up the river and a wellmanned galley shoots through the arch the sitters cheering on the boats behind them which are not yet visible  ‘here they are’ is the general cry—and through darts the first boat the men in her stripped to the skin and exerting every muscle to preserve the advantage they have gained—four other boats follow close astern there are not two boats’ length between them—the shouting is tremendous and the interest intense  ‘go on pink’—‘give it her red’—‘sulliwin for ever’—‘bravo  george’—‘now tom now—now—now—why don’t your partner stretch out’—‘two pots to a pint on yellow’ c c  every little publichouse fires its gun and hoists its flag and the men who win the heat come in amidst a splashing and shouting and banging and confusion which no one can imagine who has not witnessed it and of which any description would convey a very faint idea  one of the most amusing places we know is the steamwharf of the london bridge or st katharine’s dock company on a saturday morning in summer when the gravesend and margate steamers are usually crowded to excess and as we have just taken a glance at the river above bridge we hope our readers will not object to accompany us on board a gravesend packet  coaches are every moment setting down at the entrance to the wharf and the stare of bewildered astonishment with which the ‘fares’ resign themselves and their luggage into the hands of the porters who seize all the packages at once as a matter of course and run away with them heaven knows where is laughable in the extreme  a margate boat lies alongside the wharf the gravesend boat which starts first lies alongside that again and as a temporary communication is formed between the two by means of a plank and handrail the natural confusion of the scene is by no means diminished  ‘gravesend’ inquires a stout father of a stout family who follow him under the guidance of their mother and a servant at the no small risk of two or three of them being left behind in the confusion  ‘gravesend’  ‘pass on if you please sir’ replies the attendant—‘other boat sir’  hereupon the stout father being rather mystified and the stout mother rather distracted by maternal anxiety the whole party deposit themselves in the margate boat and after having congratulated himself on having secured very comfortable seats the stout father sallies to the chimney to look for his luggage which he has a faint recollection of having given some man something to take somewhere  no luggage however bearing the most remote resemblance to his own in shape or form is to be discovered on which the stout father calls very loudly for an officer to whom he states the case in the presence of another father of another family—a little thin man—who entirely concurs with him the stout father in thinking that it’s high time something was done with these steam companies and that as the corporation bill failed to do it something else must for really people’s property is not to be sacrificed in this way and that if the luggage isn’t restored without delay he will take care it shall be put in the papers for the public is not to be the victim of these great monopolies  to this the officer in his turn replies that that company ever since it has been st kat’rine’s dock company has protected life and property that if it had been the london bridge wharf company indeed he shouldn’t have wondered seeing that the morality of that company they being the opposition can’t be answered for by no one but as it is he’s convinced there must be some mistake and he wouldn’t mind making a solemn oath afore a magistrate that the gentleman’ll find his luggage afore he gets to margate  here the stout father thinking he is making a capital point replies that as it happens he is not going to margate at all and that ‘passenger to gravesend’ was on the luggage in letters of full two inches long on which the officer rapidly explains the mistake and the stout mother and the stout children and the servant are hurried with all possible despatch on board the gravesend boat which they reached just in time to discover that their luggage is there and that their comfortable seats are not  then the bell which is the signal for the gravesend boat starting begins to ring most furiously and people keep time to the bell by running in and out of our boat at a doublequick pace  the bell stops the boat starts people who have been taking leave of their friends on board are carried away against their will and people who have been taking leave of their friends on shore find that they have performed a very needless ceremony in consequence of their not being carried away at all  the regular passengers who have season tickets go below to breakfast people who have purchased morning papers compose themselves to read them and people who have not been down the river before think that both the shipping and the water look a great deal better at a distance  when we get down about as far as blackwall and begin to move at a quicker rate the spirits of the passengers appear to rise in proportion old women who have brought large wicker handbaskets with them set seriously to work at the demolition of heavy sandwiches and pass round a wineglass which is frequently replenished from a flat bottle like a stomachwarmer with considerable glee handing it first to the gentleman in the foragingcap who plays the harp—partly as an expression of satisfaction with his previous exertions and partly to induce him to play ‘dumbledumbdeary’ for ‘alick’ to dance to which being done alick who is a damp earthy child in red worsted socks takes certain small jumps upon the deck to the unspeakable satisfaction of his family circle  girls who have brought the first volume of some new novel in their reticule become extremely plaintive and expatiate to mr brown or young mr o’brien who has been looking over them on the blueness of the sky and brightness of the water on which mr brown or mr o’brien as the case may be remarks in a low voice that he has been quite insensible of late to the beauties of nature that his whole thoughts and wishes have centred in one object alone—whereupon the young lady looks up and failing in her attempt to appear unconscious looks down again and turns over the next leaf with great difficulty in order to afford opportunity for a lengthened pressure of the hand  telescopes sandwiches and glasses of brandyandwater cold without begin to be in great requisition and bashful men who have been looking down the hatchway at the engine find to their great relief a subject on which they can converse with one another—and a copious one too—steam  ‘wonderful thing steam sir’  ‘ah a deepdrawn sigh it is indeed sir’  ‘great power sir’  ‘immense—immense’  ‘great deal done by steam sir’  ‘ah another sigh at the immensity of the subject and a knowing shake of the head you may say that sir’  ‘still in its infancy they say sir’  novel remarks of this kind are generally the commencement of a conversation which is prolonged until the conclusion of the trip and perhaps lays the foundation of a speaking acquaintance between halfadozen gentlemen who having their families at gravesend take season tickets for the boat and dine on board regularly every afternoon    chapter xi—astley’s   we never see any very large staring black roman capitals in a book or shopwindow or placarded on a wall without their immediately recalling to our mind an indistinct and confused recollection of the time when we were first initiated in the mysteries of the alphabet  we almost fancy we see the pin’s point following the letter to impress its form more strongly on our bewildered imagination and wince involuntarily as we remember the hard knuckles with which the reverend old lady who instilled into our mind the first principles of education for ninepence per week or ten and sixpence per quarter was wont to poke our juvenile head occasionally by way of adjusting the confusion of ideas in which we were generally involved  the same kind of feeling pursues us in many other instances but there is no place which recalls so strongly our recollections of childhood as astley’s  it was not a ‘royal amphitheatre’ in those days nor had ducrow arisen to shed the light of classic taste and portable gas over the sawdust of the circus but the whole character of the place was the same the pieces were the same the clown’s jokes were the same the ridingmasters were equally grand the comic performers equally witty the tragedians equally hoarse and the ‘highlytrained chargers’ equally spirited  astley’s has altered for the better—we have changed for the worse  our histrionic taste is gone and with shame we confess that we are far more delighted and amused with the audience than with the pageantry we once so highly appreciated  we like to watch a regular astley’s party in the easter or midsummer holidays—pa and ma and nine or ten children varying from five foot six to two foot eleven from fourteen years of age to four  we had just taken our seat in one of the boxes in the centre of the house the other night when the next was occupied by just such a party as we should have attempted to describe had we depicted our beau idéal of a group of astley’s visitors  first of all there came three little boys and a little girl who in pursuance of pa’s directions issued in a very audible voice from the boxdoor occupied the front row then two more little girls were ushered in by a young lady evidently the governess  then came three more little boys dressed like the first in blue jackets and trousers with laydown shirtcollars then a child in a braided frock and high state of astonishment with very large round eyes opened to their utmost width was lifted over the seats—a process which occasioned a considerable display of little pink legs—then came ma and pa and then the eldest son a boy of fourteen years old who was evidently trying to look as if he did not belong to the family  the first five minutes were occupied in taking the shawls off the little girls and adjusting the bows which ornamented their hair then it was providentially discovered that one of the little boys was seated behind a pillar and could not see so the governess was stuck behind the pillar and the boy lifted into her place  then pa drilled the boys and directed the stowing away of their pockethandkerchiefs and ma having first nodded and winked to the governess to pull the girls’ frocks a little more off their shoulders stood up to review the little troop—an inspection which appeared to terminate much to her own satisfaction for she looked with a complacent air at pa who was standing up at the further end of the seat  pa returned the glance and blew his nose very emphatically and the poor governess peeped out from behind the pillar and timidly tried to catch ma’s eye with a look expressive of her high admiration of the whole family  then two of the little boys who had been discussing the point whether astley’s was more than twice as large as drury lane agreed to refer it to ‘george’ for his decision at which ‘george’ who was no other than the young gentleman before noticed waxed indignant and remonstrated in no very gentle terms on the gross impropriety of having his name repeated in so loud a voice at a public place on which all the children laughed very heartily and one of the little boys wound up by expressing his opinion that ‘george began to think himself quite a man now’ whereupon both pa and ma laughed too and george who carried a dress cane and was cultivating whiskers muttered that ‘william always was encouraged in his impertinence’ and assumed a look of profound contempt which lasted the whole evening  the play began and the interest of the little boys knew no bounds  pa was clearly interested too although he very unsuccessfully endeavoured to look as if he wasn’t  as for ma she was perfectly overcome by the drollery of the principal comedian and laughed till every one of the immense bows on her ample cap trembled at which the governess peeped out from behind the pillar again and whenever she could catch ma’s eye put her handkerchief to her mouth and appeared as in duty bound to be in convulsions of laughter also  then when the man in the splendid armour vowed to rescue the lady or perish in the attempt the little boys applauded vehemently especially one little fellow who was apparently on a visit to the family and had been carrying on a child’s flirtation the whole evening with a small coquette of twelve years old who looked like a model of her mamma on a reduced scale and who in common with the other little girls who generally speaking have even more coquettishness about them than much older ones looked very properly shocked when the knight’s squire kissed the princess’s confidential chambermaid  when the scenes in the circle commenced the children were more delighted than ever and the wish to see what was going forward completely conquering pa’s dignity he stood up in the box and applauded as loudly as any of them  between each feat of horsemanship the governess leant across to ma and retailed the clever remarks of the children on that which had preceded and ma in the openness of her heart offered the governess an acidulated drop and the governess gratified to be taken notice of retired behind her pillar again with a brighter countenance and the whole party seemed quite happy except the exquisite in the back of the box who being too grand to take any interest in the children and too insignificant to be taken notice of by anybody else occupied himself from time to time in rubbing the place where the whiskers ought to be and was completely alone in his glory  we defy any one who has been to astley’s two or three times and is consequently capable of appreciating the perseverance with which precisely the same jokes are repeated night after night and season after season not to be amused with one part of the performances at least—we mean the scenes in the circle  for ourself we know that when the hoop composed of jets of gas is let down the curtain drawn up for the convenience of the halfprice on their ejectment from the ring the orangepeel cleared away and the sawdust shaken with mathematical precision into a complete circle we feel as much enlivened as the youngest child present and actually join in the laugh which follows the clown’s shrill shout of ‘here we are’ just for old acquaintance’ sake nor can we quite divest ourself of our old feeling of reverence for the ridingmaster who follows the clown with a long whip in his hand and bows to the audience with graceful dignity  he is none of your secondrate ridingmasters in nankeen dressinggowns with brown frogs but the regular gentlemanattendant on the principal riders who always wears a military uniform with a tablecloth inside the breast of the coat in which costume he forcibly reminds one of a fowl trussed for roasting  he is—but why should we attempt to describe that of which no description can convey an adequate idea  everybody knows the man and everybody remembers his polished boots his graceful demeanour stiff as some misjudging persons have in their jealousy considered it and the splendid head of black hair parted high on the forehead to impart to the countenance an appearance of deep thought and poetic melancholy  his soft and pleasing voice too is in perfect unison with his noble bearing as he humours the clown by indulging in a little badinage and the striking recollection of his own dignity with which he exclaims ‘now sir if you please inquire for miss woolford sir’ can never be forgotten  the graceful air too with which he introduces miss woolford into the arena and after assisting her to the saddle follows her fairy courser round the circle can never fail to create a deep impression in the bosom of every female servant present  when miss woolford and the horse and the orchestra all stop together to take breath he urbanely takes part in some such dialogue as the following commenced by the clown ‘i say sir’—‘well sir’ it’s always conducted in the politest manner—‘did you ever happen to hear i was in the army sir’—‘no sir’—‘oh yes sir—i can go through my exercise sir’—‘indeed sir’—‘shall i do it now sir’—‘if you please sir come sir—make haste’ a cut with the long whip and ‘ha’ done now—i don’t like it’ from the clown  here the clown throws himself on the ground and goes through a variety of gymnastic convulsions doubling himself up and untying himself again and making himself look very like a man in the most hopeless extreme of human agony to the vociferous delight of the gallery until he is interrupted by a second cut from the long whip and a request to see ‘what miss woolford’s stopping for’  on which to the inexpressible mirth of the gallery he exclaims ‘now miss woolford what can i come for to go for to fetch for to bring for to carry for to do for you ma’am’  on the lady’s announcing with a sweet smile that she wants the two flags they are with sundry grimaces procured and handed up the clown facetiously observing after the performance of the latter ceremony—‘he he oh  i say sir miss woolford knows me she smiled at me’  another cut from the whip a burst from the orchestra a start from the horse and round goes miss woolford again on her graceful performance to the delight of every member of the audience young or old  the next pause affords an opportunity for similar witticisms the only additional fun being that of the clown making ludicrous grimaces at the ridingmaster every time his back is turned and finally quitting the circle by jumping over his head having previously directed his attention another way  did any of our readers ever notice the class of people who hang about the stagedoors of our minor theatres in the daytime  you will rarely pass one of these entrances without seeing a group of three or four men conversing on the pavement with an indescribable publichouseparlour swagger and a kind of conscious air peculiar to people of this description  they always seem to think they are exhibiting the lamps are ever before them  that young fellow in the faded brown coat and very full light green trousers pulls down the wristbands of his check shirt as ostentatiously as if it were of the finest linen and cocks the white hat of the summerbeforelast as knowingly over his right eye as if it were a purchase of yesterday  look at the dirty white berlin gloves and the cheap silk handkerchief stuck in the bosom of his threadbare coat  is it possible to see him for an instant and not come to the conclusion that he is the walking gentleman who wears a blue surtout clean collar and white trousers for half an hour and then shrinks into his wornout scanty clothes who has to boast night after night of his splendid fortune with the painful consciousness of a pound aweek and his boots to find to talk of his father’s mansion in the country with a dreary recollection of his own twopair back in the new cut and to be envied and flattered as the favoured lover of a rich heiress remembering all the while that the exdancer at home is in the family way and out of an engagement  next to him perhaps you will see a thin pale man with a very long face in a suit of shining black thoughtfully knocking that part of his boot which once had a heel with an ash stick  he is the man who does the heavy business such as prosy fathers virtuous servants curates landlords and so forth  by the way talking of fathers we should very much like to see some piece in which all the dramatis personae were orphans  fathers are invariably great nuisances on the stage and always have to give the hero or heroine a long explanation of what was done before the curtain rose usually commencing with ‘it is now nineteen years my dear child since your blessed mother here the old villain’s voice falters confided you to my charge  you were then an infant’ c c  or else they have to discover all of a sudden that somebody whom they have been in constant communication with during three long acts without the slightest suspicion is their own child in which case they exclaim ‘ah what do i see  this bracelet  that smile  these documents  those eyes  can i believe my senses—it must be—yes—it is it is my child’—‘my father’ exclaims the child and they fall into each other’s arms and look over each other’s shoulders and the audience give three rounds of applause  to return from this digression we were about to say that these are the sort of people whom you see talking and attitudinising outside the stagedoors of our minor theatres  at astley’s they are always more numerous than at any other place  there is generally a groom or two sitting on the windowsill and two or three dirty shabbygenteel men in checked neckerchiefs and sallow linen lounging about and carrying perhaps under one arm a pair of stage shoes badly wrapped up in a piece of old newspaper  some years ago we used to stand looking openmouthed at these men with a feeling of mysterious curiosity the very recollection of which provokes a smile at the moment we are writing  we could not believe that the beings of light and elegance in milkwhite tunics salmoncoloured legs and blue scarfs who flitted on sleek creamcoloured horses before our eyes at night with all the aid of lights music and artificial flowers could be the pale dissipatedlooking creatures we beheld by day  we can hardly believe it now  of the lower class of actors we have seen something and it requires no great exercise of imagination to identify the walking gentleman with the ‘dirty swell’ the comic singer with the publichouse chairman or the leading tragedian with drunkenness and distress but these other men are mysterious beings never seen out of the ring never beheld but in the costume of gods and sylphs  with the exception of ducrow who can scarcely be classed among them who ever knew a rider at astley’s or saw him but on horseback  can our friend in the military uniform ever appear in threadbare attire or descend to the comparatively unwadded costume of everyday life  impossible  we cannot—we will not—believe it    chapter xii—greenwich fair   if the parks be ‘the lungs of london’ we wonder what greenwich fair is—a periodical breaking out we suppose a sort of springrash a three days’ fever which cools the blood for six months afterwards and at the expiration of which london is restored to its old habits of plodding industry as suddenly and completely as if nothing had ever happened to disturb them  in our earlier days we were a constant frequenter of greenwich fair for years  we have proceeded to and returned from it in almost every description of vehicle  we cannot conscientiously deny the charge of having once made the passage in a springvan accompanied by thirteen gentlemen fourteen ladies an unlimited number of children and a barrel of beer and we have a vague recollection of having in later days found ourself the eighth outside on the top of a hackneycoach at something past four o’clock in the morning with a rather confused idea of our own name or place of residence  we have grown older since then and quiet and steady liking nothing better than to spend our easter and all our other holidays in some quiet nook with people of whom we shall never tire but we think we still remember something of greenwich fair and of those who resort to it  at all events we will try  the road to greenwich during the whole of easter monday is in a state of perpetual bustle and noise  cabs hackneycoaches ‘shay’ carts coalwaggons stages omnibuses sociables gigs donkeychaises—all crammed with people for the question never is what the horse can draw but what the vehicle will hold roll along at their utmost speed the dust flies in clouds gingerbeer corks go off in volleys the balcony of every publichouse is crowded with people smoking and drinking half the private houses are turned into teashops fiddles are in great request every little fruitshop displays its stall of gilt gingerbread and penny toys turnpike men are in despair horses won’t go on and wheels will come off ladies in ‘carawans’ scream with fright at every fresh concussion and their admirers find it necessary to sit remarkably close to them by way of encouragement servantsofallwork who are not allowed to have followers and have got a holiday for the day make the most of their time with the faithful admirer who waits for a stolen interview at the corner of the street every night when they go to fetch the beer—apprentices grow sentimental and strawbonnet makers kind everybody is anxious to get on and actuated by the common wish to be at the fair or in the park as soon as possible  pedestrians linger in groups at the roadside unable to resist the allurements of the stout proprietress of the ‘jackinthebox three shies a penny’ or the more splendid offers of the man with three thimbles and a pea on a little round board who astonishes the bewildered crowd with some such address as ‘here’s the sort o’ game to make you laugh seven years arter you’re dead and turn ev’ry air on your ed gray vith delight  three thimbles and vun little pea—with a vun two three and a two three vun catch him who can look on keep your eyes open and niver say die niver mind the change and the expense all fair and above board them as don’t play can’t vin and luck attend the ryal sportsman  bet any gen’lm’n any sum of money from harfacrown up to a suverin as he doesn’t name the thimble as kivers the pea’  here some greenhorn whispers his friend that he distinctly saw the pea roll under the middle thimble—an impression which is immediately confirmed by a gentleman in topboots who is standing by and who in a low tone regrets his own inability to bet in consequence of having unfortunately left his purse at home but strongly urges the stranger not to neglect such a golden opportunity  the ‘plant’ is successful the bet is made the stranger of course loses and the gentleman with the thimbles consoles him as he pockets the money with an assurance that it’s ‘all the fortin of war this time i vin next time you vin niver mind the loss of two bob and a bender  do it up in a small parcel and break out in a fresh place  here’s the sort o’ game’ c—and the eloquent harangue with such variations as the speaker’s exuberant fancy suggests is again repeated to the gaping crowd reinforced by the accession of several newcomers  the chief place of resort in the daytime after the publichouses is the park in which the principal amusement is to drag young ladies up the steep hill which leads to the observatory and then drag them down again at the very top of their speed greatly to the derangement of their curls and bonnetcaps and much to the edification of lookerson from below ‘kiss in the ring’ and ‘threading my grandmother’s needle’ too are sports which receive their full share of patronage  lovesick swains under the influence of ginandwater and the tender passion become violently affectionate and the fair objects of their regard enhance the value of stolen kisses by a vast deal of struggling and holding down of heads and cries of ‘oh  ha’ done then george—oh do tickle him for me mary—well i never’ and similar lucretian ejaculations  little old men and women with a small basket under one arm and a wineglass without a foot in the other hand tender ‘a drop o’ the right sort’ to the different groups and young ladies who are persuaded to indulge in a drop of the aforesaid right sort display a pleasing degree of reluctance to taste it and cough afterwards with great propriety  the old pensioners who for the moderate charge of a penny exhibit the masthouse the thames and shipping the place where the men used to hang in chains and other interesting sights through a telescope are asked questions about objects within the range of the glass which it would puzzle a solomon to answer and requested to find out particular houses in particular streets which it would have been a task of some difficulty for mr horner not the young gentleman who ate mincepies with his thumb but the man of colosseum notoriety to discover  here and there where some three or four couple are sitting on the grass together you will see a sunburnt woman in a red cloak ‘telling fortunes’ and prophesying husbands which it requires no extraordinary observation to describe for the originals are before her  thereupon the lady concerned laughs and blushes and ultimately buries her face in an imitation cambric handkerchief and the gentleman described looks extremely foolish and squeezes her hand and fees the gipsy liberally and the gipsy goes away perfectly satisfied herself and leaving those behind her perfectly satisfied also and the prophecy like many other prophecies of greater importance fulfils itself in time  but it grows dark the crowd has gradually dispersed and only a few stragglers are left behind  the light in the direction of the church shows that the fair is illuminated and the distant noise proves it to be filling fast  the spot which half an hour ago was ringing with the shouts of boisterous mirth is as calm and quiet as if nothing could ever disturb its serenity the fine old trees the majestic building at their feet with the noble river beyond glistening in the moonlight appear in all their beauty and under their most favourable aspect the voices of the boys singing their evening hymn are borne gently on the air and the humblest mechanic who has been lingering on the grass so pleasant to the feet that beat the same dull round from week to week in the paved streets of london feels proud to think as he surveys the scene before him that he belongs to the country which has selected such a spot as a retreat for its oldest and best defenders in the decline of their lives  five minutes’ walking brings you to the fair a scene calculated to awaken very different feelings  the entrance is occupied on either side by the vendors of gingerbread and toys the stalls are gaily lighted up the most attractive goods profusely disposed and unbonneted young ladies in their zeal for the interest of their employers seize you by the coat and use all the blandishments of ‘do dear’—‘there’s a love’—‘don’t be cross now’ c to induce you to purchase half a pound of the real spice nuts of which the majority of the regular fairgoers carry a pound or two as a present supply tied up in a cotton pockethandkerchief  occasionally you pass a deal table on which are exposed pen’orths of pickled salmon fennel included in little white saucers oysters with shells as large as cheeseplates and divers specimens of a species of snail wilks we think they are called floating in a somewhat biliouslooking green liquid  cigars too are in great demand gentlemen must smoke of course and here they are two a penny in a regular authentic cigarbox with a lighted tallow candle in the centre  imagine yourself in an extremely dense crowd which swings you to and fro and in and out and every way but the right one add to this the screams of women the shouts of boys the clanging of gongs the firing of pistols the ringing of bells the bellowings of speakingtrumpets the squeaking of penny dittos the noise of a dozen bands with three drums in each all playing different tunes at the same time the hallooing of showmen and an occasional roar from the wildbeast shows and you are in the very centre and heart of the fair  this immense booth with the large stage in front so brightly illuminated with variegated lamps and pots of burning fat is ‘richardson’s’ where you have a melodrama with three murders and a ghost a pantomime a comic song an overture and some incidental music all done in fiveandtwenty minutes  the company are now promenading outside in all the dignity of wigs spangles redochre and whitening  see with what a ferocious air the gentleman who personates the mexican chief paces up and down and with what an eye of calm dignity the principal tragedian gazes on the crowd below or converses confidentially with the harlequin  the four clowns who are engaged in a mock broadsword combat may be all very well for the lowminded holidaymakers but these are the people for the reflective portion of the community  they look so noble in those roman dresses with their yellow legs and arms long black curly heads bushy eyebrows and scowl expressive of assassination and vengeance and everything else that is grand and solemn  then the ladies—were there ever such innocent and awfullooking beings as they walk up and down the platform in twos and threes with their arms round each other’s waists or leaning for support on one of those majestic men  their spangled muslin dresses and blue satin shoes and sandals a leetle the worse for wear are the admiration of all beholders and the playful manner in which they check the advances of the clown is perfectly enchanting  ‘just agoing to begin  pray come for’erd come for’erd’ exclaims the man in the countryman’s dress for the seventieth time and people force their way up the steps in crowds  the band suddenly strikes up the harlequin and columbine set the example reels are formed in less than no time the roman heroes place their arms akimbo and dance with considerable agility and the leading tragic actress and the gentleman who enacts the ‘swell’ in the pantomime foot it to perfection  ‘all in to begin’ shouts the manager when no more people can be induced to ‘come for’erd’ and away rush the leading members of the company to do the dreadful in the first piece  a change of performance takes place every day during the fair but the story of the tragedy is always pretty much the same  there is a rightful heir who loves a young lady and is beloved by her and a wrongful heir who loves her too and isn’t beloved by her and the wrongful heir gets hold of the rightful heir and throws him into a dungeon just to kill him off when convenient for which purpose he hires a couple of assassins—a good one and a bad one—who the moment they are left alone get up a little murder on their own account the good one killing the bad one and the bad one wounding the good one  then the rightful heir is discovered in prison carefully holding a long chain in his hands and seated despondingly in a large armchair and the young lady comes in to two bars of soft music and embraces the rightful heir and then the wrongful heir comes in to two bars of quick music technically called ‘a hurry’ and goes on in the most shocking manner throwing the young lady about as if she was nobody and calling the rightful heir ‘arrecreant—arwretch’ in a very loud voice which answers the double purpose of displaying his passion and preventing the sound being deadened by the sawdust  the interest becomes intense the wrongful heir draws his sword and rushes on the rightful heir a blue smoke is seen a gong is heard and a tall white figure who has been all this time behind the armchair covered over with a tablecloth slowly rises to the tune of ‘oft in the stilly night’  this is no other than the ghost of the rightful heir’s father who was killed by the wrongful heir’s father at sight of which the wrongful heir becomes apoplectic and is literally ‘struck all of a heap’ the stage not being large enough to admit of his falling down at full length  then the good assassin staggers in and says he was hired in conjunction with the bad assassin by the wrongful heir to kill the rightful heir and he’s killed a good many people in his time but he’s very sorry for it and won’t do so any more—a promise which he immediately redeems by dying off hand without any nonsense about it  then the rightful heir throws down his chain and then two men a sailor and a young woman the tenantry of the rightful heir come in and the ghost makes dumb motions to them which they by supernatural interference understand—for no one else can and the ghost who can’t do anything without blue fire blesses the rightful heir and the young lady by half suffocating them with smoke and then a muffinbell rings and the curtain drops  the exhibitions next in popularity to these itinerant theatres are the travelling menageries or to speak more intelligibly the ‘wildbeast shows’ where a military band in beefeater’s costume with leopardskin caps play incessantly and where large highlycoloured representations of tigers tearing men’s heads open and a lion being burnt with redhot irons to induce him to drop his victim are hung up outside by way of attracting visitors  the principal officer at these places is generally a very tall hoarse man in a scarlet coat with a cane in his hand with which he occasionally raps the pictures we have just noticed by way of illustrating his description—something in this way  ‘here here here the lion the lion tap exactly as he is represented on the canvas outside three taps no waiting remember no deception  the ferocious lion tap tap who bit off the gentleman’s head last cambervel vos a twelvemonth and has killed on the awerage three keepers ayear ever since he arrived at matoority  no extra charge on this account recollect the price of admission is only sixpence’  this address never fails to produce a considerable sensation and sixpences flow into the treasury with wonderful rapidity  the dwarfs are also objects of great curiosity and as a dwarf a giantess a living skeleton a wild indian ‘a young lady of singular beauty with perfectly white hair and pink eyes’ and two or three other natural curiosities are usually exhibited together for the small charge of a penny they attract very numerous audiences  the best thing about a dwarf is that he has always a little box about two feet six inches high into which by long practice he can just manage to get by doubling himself up like a bootjack this box is painted outside like a sixroomed house and as the crowd see him ring a bell or fire a pistol out of the firstfloor window they verily believe that it is his ordinary town residence divided like other mansions into drawingrooms diningparlour and bedchambers  shut up in this case the unfortunate little object is brought out to delight the throng by holding a facetious dialogue with the proprietor in the course of which the dwarf who is always particularly drunk pledges himself to sing a comic song inside and pays various compliments to the ladies which induce them to ‘come for’erd’ with great alacrity  as a giant is not so easily moved a pair of indescribables of most capacious dimensions and a huge shoe are usually brought out into which two or three stout men get all at once to the enthusiastic delight of the crowd who are quite satisfied with the solemn assurance that these habiliments form part of the giant’s everyday costume  the grandest and most numerouslyfrequented booth in the whole fair however is ‘the crown and anchor’—a temporary ballroom—we forget how many hundred feet long the price of admission to which is one shilling immediately on your right hand as you enter after paying your money is a refreshment place at which cold beef roast and boiled french rolls stout wine tongue ham even fowls if we recollect right are displayed in tempting array  there is a raised orchestra and the place is boarded all the way down in patches just wide enough for a country dance  there is no master of the ceremonies in this artificial eden—all is primitive unreserved and unstudied  the dust is blinding the heat insupportable the company somewhat noisy and in the highest spirits possible the ladies in the height of their innocent animation dancing in the gentlemen’s hats and the gentlemen promenading ‘the gay and festive scene’ in the ladies’ bonnets or with the more expensive ornaments of false noses and lowcrowned tinderboxlooking hats playing children’s drums and accompanied by ladies on the penny trumpet  the noise of these various instruments the orchestra the shouting the ‘scratchers’ and the dancing is perfectly bewildering  the dancing itself beggars description—every figure lasts about an hour and the ladies bounce up and down the middle with a degree of spirit which is quite indescribable  as to the gentlemen they stamp their feet against the ground every time ‘hands four round’ begins go down the middle and up again with cigars in their mouths and silk handkerchiefs in their hands and whirl their partners round nothing loth scrambling and falling and embracing and knocking up against the other couples until they are fairly tired out and can move no longer  the same scene is repeated again and again slightly varied by an occasional ‘row’ until a late hour at night and a great many clerks and ’prentices find themselves next morning with aching heads empty pockets damaged hats and a very imperfect recollection of how it was they did not get home    chapter xiii—private theatres       ‘richard the third—duke of glo’ster 2l earl of richmond 1l     duke of buckingham 15s catesby 12s tressel 10s 6d     lord stanley 5s lord mayor of london 2s 6d’  such are the written placards wafered up in the gentlemen’s dressingroom or the greenroom where there is any at a private theatre and such are the sums extracted from the shoptill or overcharged in the office expenditure by the donkeys who are prevailed upon to pay for permission to exhibit their lamentable ignorance and boobyism on the stage of a private theatre  this they do in proportion to the scope afforded by the character for the display of their imbecility  for instance the duke of glo’ster is well worth two pounds because he has it all to himself he must wear a real sword and what is better still he must draw it several times in the course of the piece the soliloquies alone are well worth fifteen shillings then there is the stabbing king henry—decidedly cheap at threeandsixpence that’s eighteenandsixpence bullying the coffinbearers—say eighteenpence though it’s worth much more—that’s a pound  then the love scene with lady ann and the bustle of the fourth act can’t be dear at ten shillings more—that’s only one pound ten including the ‘off with his head’—which is sure to bring down the applause and it is very easy to do—‘orf with his ed’ very quick and loud—then slow and sneeringly—‘so much for buuuuckingham’  lay the emphasis on the ’uck’ get yourself gradually into a corner and work with your right hand while you’re saying it as if you were feeling your way and it’s sure to do  the tent scene is confessedly worth halfasovereign and so you have the fight in gratis and everybody knows what an effect may be produced by a good combat one—two—three—four—over then one—two—three—four—under then thrust then dodge and slide about then fall down on one knee then fight upon it and then get up again and stagger  you may keep on doing this as long as it seems to take—say ten minutes—and then fall down backwards if you can manage it without hurting yourself and die game nothing like it for producing an effect  they always do it at astley’s and sadler’s wells and if they don’t know how to do this sort of thing who in the world does  a small child or a female in white increases the interest of a combat materially—indeed we are not aware that a regular legitimate terrific broadsword combat could be done without but it would be rather difficult and somewhat unusual to introduce this effect in the last scene of richard the third so the only thing to be done is just to make the best of a bad bargain and be as long as possible fighting it out  the principal patrons of private theatres are dirty boys low copyingclerks in attorneys’ offices capaciousheaded youths from city countinghouses jews whose business as lenders of fancy dresses is a sure passport to the amateur stage shopboys who now and then mistake their masters’ money for their own and a choice miscellany of idle vagabonds  the proprietor of a private theatre may be an exscenepainter a low coffeehousekeeper a disappointed eighthrate actor a retired smuggler or uncertificated bankrupt  the theatre itself may be in catherinestreet strand the purlieus of the city the neighbourhood of gray’sinnlane or the vicinity of sadler’s wells or it may perhaps form the chief nuisance of some shabby street on the surrey side of waterloobridge  the lady performers pay nothing for their characters and it is needless to add are usually selected from one class of society the audiences are necessarily of much the same character as the performers who receive in return for their contributions to the management tickets to the amount of the money they pay  all the minor theatres in london especially the lowest constitute the centre of a little stagestruck neighbourhood  each of them has an audience exclusively its own and at any you will see dropping into the pit at halfprice or swaggering into the back of a box if the price of admission be a reduced one divers boys of from fifteen to twentyone years of age who throw back their coat and turn up their wristbands after the portraits of count d’orsay hum tunes and whistle when the curtain is down by way of persuading the people near them that they are not at all anxious to have it up again and speak familiarly of the inferior performers as bill suchaone and ned soandso or tell each other how a new piece called the unknown bandit of the invisible cavern is in rehearsal how mister palmer is to play the unknown bandit how charley scarton is to take the part of an english sailor and fight a broadsword combat with six unknown bandits at one and the same time one theatrical sailor is always equal to half a dozen men at least how mister palmer and charley scarton are to go through a double hornpipe in fetters in the second act how the interior of the invisible cavern is to occupy the whole extent of the stage and other townsurprising theatrical announcements  these gentlemen are the amateurs—the richards shylocks beverleys and othellos—the young dorntons rovers captain absolutes and charles surfaces—a private theatre  see them at the neighbouring publichouse or the theatrical coffeeshop they are the kings of the place supposing no real performers to be present and roll about hats on one side and arms akimbo as if they had actually come into possession of eighteen shillings aweek and a share of a ticket night  if one of them does but know an astley’s supernumerary he is a happy fellow  the mingled air of envy and admiration with which his companions will regard him as he converses familiarly with some mouldylooking man in a fancy neckerchief whose partially corked eyebrows and halfrouged face testify to the fact of his having just left the stage or the circle sufficiently shows in what high admiration these public characters are held  with the double view of guarding against the discovery of friends or employers and enhancing the interest of an assumed character by attaching a highsounding name to its representative these geniuses assume fictitious names which are not the least amusing part of the playbill of a private theatre  belville melville treville berkeley randolph byron st clair and so forth are among the humblest and the less imposing titles of jenkins walker thomson barker solomons c are completely laid aside  there is something imposing in this and it is an excellent apology for shabbiness into the bargain  a shrunken faded coat a decayed hat a patched and soiled pair of trousers—nay even a very dirty shirt and none of these appearances are very uncommon among the members of the corps dramatique may be worn for the purpose of disguise and to prevent the remotest chance of recognition  then it prevents any troublesome inquiries or explanations about employment and pursuits everybody is a gentleman at large for the occasion and there are none of those unpleasant and unnecessary distinctions to which even genius must occasionally succumb elsewhere  as to the ladies god bless them they are quite above any formal absurdities the mere circumstance of your being behind the scenes is a sufficient introduction to their society—for of course they know that none but strictly respectable persons would be admitted into that close fellowship with them which acting engenders  they place implicit reliance on the manager no doubt and as to the manager he is all affability when he knows you well—or in other words when he has pocketed your money once and entertains confident hopes of doing so again  a quarter before eight—there will be a full house tonight—six parties in the boxes already four little boys and a woman in the pit and two fiddles and a flute in the orchestra who have got through five overtures since seven o’clock the hour fixed for the commencement of the performances and have just begun the sixth  there will be plenty of it though when it does begin for there is enough in the bill to last six hours at least  that gentleman in the white hat and checked shirt brown coat and brass buttons lounging behind the stagebox on the o p side is mr horatio st julien alias jem larkins  his line is genteel comedy—his father’s coal and potato  he does alfred highflier in the last piece and very well he’ll do it—at the price  the party of gentlemen in the opposite box to whom he has just nodded are friends and supporters of mr beverley otherwise loggins the macbeth of the night  you observe their attempts to appear easy and gentlemanly each member of the party with his feet cocked upon the cushion in front of the box  they let them do these things here upon the same humane principle which permits poor people’s children to knock double knocks at the door of an empty house—because they can’t do it anywhere else  the two stout men in the centre box with an operaglass ostentatiously placed before them are friends of the proprietor—opulent country managers as he confidentially informs every individual among the crew behind the curtain—opulent country managers looking out for recruits a representation which mr nathan the dresser who is in the manager’s interest and has just arrived with the costumes offers to confirm upon oath if required—corroborative evidence however is quite unnecessary for the gulls believe it at once  the stout jewess who has just entered is the mother of the pale bony little girl with the necklace of blue glass beads sitting by her she is being brought up to ‘the profession’  pantomime is to be her line and she is coming out tonight in a hornpipe after the tragedy  the short thin man beside mr st julien whose white face is so deeply seared with the smallpox and whose dirty shirtfront is inlaid with openwork and embossed with coral studs like ladybirds is the low comedian and comic singer of the establishment  the remainder of the audience—a tolerably numerous one by this time—are a motley group of dupes and blackguards  the footlights have just made their appearance the wicks of the six little oil lamps round the only tier of boxes are being turned up and the additional light thus afforded serves to show the presence of dirt and absence of paint which forms a prominent feature in the audience part of the house  as these preparations however announce the speedy commencement of the play let us take a peep ‘behind’ previous to the ringingup  the little narrow passages beneath the stage are neither especially clean nor too brilliantly lighted and the absence of any flooring together with the damp mildewy smell which pervades the place does not conduce in any great degree to their comfortable appearance  don’t fall over this plate basket—it’s one of the ‘properties’—the caldron for the witches’ cave and the three uncouthlooking figures with broken clothesprops in their hands who are drinking ginandwater out of a pint pot are the weird sisters  this miserable room lighted by candles in sconces placed at lengthened intervals round the wall is the dressingroom common to the gentlemen performers and the square hole in the ceiling is the trapdoor of the stage above  you will observe that the ceiling is ornamented with the beams that support the boards and tastefully hung with cobwebs  the characters in the tragedy are all dressed and their own clothes are scattered in hurried confusion over the wooden dresser which surrounds the room  that snuffshoplooking figure in front of the glass is banquo and the young lady with the liberal display of legs who is kindly painting his face with a hare’s foot is dressed for fleance the large woman who is consulting the stage directions in cumberland’s edition of macbeth is the lady macbeth of the night she is always selected to play the part because she is tall and stout and looks a little like mrs siddons—at a considerable distance  that stupidlooking milksop with light hair and bow legs—a kind of man whom you can warrant townmade—is fresh caught he plays malcolm tonight just to accustom himself to an audience  he will get on better by degrees he will play othello in a month and in a month more will very probably be apprehended on a charge of embezzlement  the blackeyed female with whom he is talking so earnestly is dressed for the ‘gentlewoman’  it is her first appearance too—in that character  the boy of fourteen who is having his eyebrows smeared with soap and whitening is duncan king of scotland and the two dirty men with the corked countenances in very old green tunics and dirty drab boots are the ‘army’  ‘look sharp below there gents’ exclaims the dresser a redheaded and redwhiskered jew calling through the trap ‘they’re agoing to ring up the flute says he’ll be blowed if he plays any more and they’re getting precious noisy in front’  a general rush immediately takes place to the halfdozen little steep steps leading to the stage and the heterogeneous group are soon assembled at the side scenes in breathless anxiety and motley confusion  ‘now’ cries the manager consulting the written list which hangs behind the first p s wing ‘scene 1 open country—lamps down—thunder and lightning—all ready white’  this is addressed to one of the army ‘all ready’—‘very well  scene 2 front chamber  is the front chamber down’—‘yes’—‘very well’—‘jones’ to the other army who is up in the flies  ‘hallo’—‘wind up the open country when we ring up’—‘i’ll take care’—‘scene 3 back perspective with practical bridge  bridge ready white  got the tressels there’—‘all right’  ‘very well  clear the stage’ cries the manager hastily packing every member of the company into the little space there is between the wings and the wall and one wing and another  ‘places places  now then witches—duncan—malcolm—bleeding officer—where’s the bleeding officer’—‘here’ replies the officer who has been rosepinking for the character  ‘get ready then now white ring the second musicbell’ the actors who are to be discovered are hastily arranged and the actors who are not to be discovered place themselves in their anxiety to peep at the house just where the audience can see them  the bell rings and the orchestra in acknowledgment of the call play three distinct chords the bell rings—the tragedy  opens—and our description closes    chapter xiv—vauxhallgardens by day   there was a time when if a man ventured to wonder how vauxhallgardens would look by day he was hailed with a shout of derision at the absurdity of the idea  vauxhall by daylight  a porterpot without porter the house of commons without the speaker a gaslamp without the gas—pooh nonsense the thing was not to be thought of  it was rumoured too in those times that vauxhallgardens by day were the scene of secret and hidden experiments that there carvers were exercised in the mystic art of cutting a moderatesized ham into slices thin enough to pave the whole of the grounds that beneath the shade of the tall trees studious men were constantly engaged in chemical experiments with the view of discovering how much water a bowl of negus could possibly bear and that in some retired nooks appropriated to the study of ornithology other sage and learned men were by a process known only to themselves incessantly employed in reducing fowls to a mere combination of skin and bone  vague rumours of this kind together with many others of a similar nature cast over vauxhallgardens an air of deep mystery and as there is a great deal in the mysterious there is no doubt that to a good many people at all events the pleasure they afforded was not a little enhanced by this very circumstance  of this class of people we confess to having made one  we loved to wander among these illuminated groves thinking of the patient and laborious researches which had been carried on there during the day and witnessing their results in the suppers which were served up beneath the light of lamps and to the sound of music at night  the temples and saloons and cosmoramas and fountains glittered and sparkled before our eyes the beauty of the lady singers and the elegant deportment of the gentlemen captivated our hearts a few hundred thousand of additional lamps dazzled our senses a bowl or two of punch bewildered our brains and we were happy  in an evil hour the proprietors of vauxhallgardens took to opening them by day  we regretted this as rudely and harshly disturbing that veil of mystery which had hung about the property for many years and which none but the noonday sun and the late mr simpson had ever penetrated  we shrunk from going at this moment we scarcely know why  perhaps a morbid consciousness of approaching disappointment—perhaps a fatal presentiment—perhaps the weather whatever it was we did not go until the second or third announcement of a race between two balloons tempted us and we went  we paid our shilling at the gate and then we saw for the first time that the entrance if there had been any magic about it at all was now decidedly disenchanted being in fact nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughlypainted boards and sawdust  we glanced at the orchestra and supperroom as we hurried past—we just recognised them and that was all  we bent our steps to the fireworkground there at least we should not be disappointed  we reached it and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment  that the moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre and daubs of crimson and yellow all round like a gigantic watchcase  that the place where night after night we had beheld the undaunted mr blackmore make his terrific ascent surrounded by flames of fire and peals of artillery and where the white garments of madame somebody we forget even her name now who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks had so often been seen fluttering in the wind as she called up a red blue or partycoloured light to illumine her temple  that the—but at this moment the bell rung the people scampered away pellmell to the spot from whence the sound proceeded and we from the mere force of habit found ourself running among the first as if for very life  it was for the concert in the orchestra  a small party of dismal men in cocked hats were ‘executing’ the overture to tancredi and a numerous assemblage of ladies and gentlemen with their families had rushed from their halfemptied stout mugs in the supper boxes and crowded to the spot  intense was the low murmur of admiration when a particularly small gentleman in a dress coat led on a particularly tall lady in a blue sarcenet pelisse and bonnet of the same ornamented with large white feathers and forthwith commenced a plaintive duet  we knew the small gentleman well we had seen a lithographed semblance of him on many a piece of music with his mouth wide open as if in the act of singing a wineglass in his hand and a table with two decanters and four pineapples on it in the background  the tall lady too we had gazed on lost in raptures of admiration many and many a time—how different people do look by daylight and without punch to be sure it was a beautiful duet first the small gentleman asked a question and then the tall lady answered it then the small gentleman and the tall lady sang together most melodiously then the small gentleman went through a little piece of vehemence by himself and got very tenor indeed in the excitement of his feelings to which the tall lady responded in a similar manner then the small gentleman had a shake or two after which the tall lady had the same and then they both merged imperceptibly into the original air and the band wound themselves up to a pitch of fury and the small gentleman handed the tall lady out and the applause was rapturous  the comic singer however was the especial favourite we really thought that a gentleman with his dinner in a pockethandkerchief who stood near us would have fainted with excess of joy  a marvellously facetious gentleman that comic singer is his distinguishing characteristics are a wig approaching to the flaxen and an aged countenance and he bears the name of one of the english counties if we recollect right  he sang a very good song about the seven ages the first halfhour of which afforded the assembly the purest delight of the rest we can make no report as we did not stay to hear any more  we walked about and met with a disappointment at every turn our favourite views were mere patches of paint the fountain that had sparkled so showily by lamplight presented very much the appearance of a waterpipe that had burst all the ornaments were dingy and all the walks gloomy  there was a spectral attempt at ropedancing in the little open theatre  the sun shone upon the spangled dresses of the performers and their evolutions were about as inspiriting and appropriate as a countrydance in a family vault  so we retraced our steps to the fireworkground and mingled with the little crowd of people who were contemplating mr green  some halfdozen men were restraining the impetuosity of one of the balloons which was completely filled and had the car already attached and as rumours had gone abroad that a lord was ‘going up’ the crowd were more than usually anxious and talkative  there was one little man in faded black with a dirty face and a rusty black neckerchief with a red border tied in a narrow wisp round his neck who entered into conversation with everybody and had something to say upon every remark that was made within his hearing  he was standing with his arms folded staring up at the balloon and every now and then vented his feelings of reverence for the aëronaut by saying as he looked round to catch somebody’s eye ‘he’s a rum ’un is green think o’ this here being up’ards of his two hundredth ascent ecod the man as is ekal to green never had the toothache yet nor won’t have within this hundred year and that’s all about it  when you meets with real talent and native too encourage it that’s what i say’ and when he had delivered himself to this effect he would fold his arms with more determination than ever and stare at the balloon with a sort of admiring defiance of any other man alive beyond himself and green that impressed the crowd with the opinion that he was an oracle  ‘ah you’re very right sir’ said another gentleman with his wife and children and mother and wife’s sister and a host of female friends in all the gentility of white pockethandkerchiefs frills and spencers ‘mr green is a steady hand sir and there’s no fear about him’  ‘fear’ said the little man ‘isn’t it a lovely thing to see him and his wife a going up in one balloon and his own son and his wife a jostling up against them in another and all of them going twenty or thirty mile in three hours or so and then coming back in pochayses  i don’t know where this here science is to stop mind you that’s what bothers me’  here there was a considerable talking among the females in the spencers  ‘what’s the ladies a laughing at sir’ inquired the little man condescendingly  ‘it’s only my sister mary’ said one of the girls ‘as says she hopes his lordship won’t be frightened when he’s in the car and want to come out again’  ‘make yourself easy about that there my dear’ replied the little man ‘if he was so much as to move a inch without leave green would jist fetch him a crack over the head with the telescope as would send him into the bottom of the basket in no time and stun him till they come down again’  ‘would he though’ inquired the other man  ‘yes would he’ replied the little one ‘and think nothing of it neither if he was the king himself  green’s presence of mind is wonderful’  just at this moment all eyes were directed to the preparations which were being made for starting  the car was attached to the second balloon the two were brought pretty close together and a military band commenced playing with a zeal and fervour which would render the most timid man in existence but too happy to accept any means of quitting that particular spot of earth on which they were stationed  then mr green sen and his noble companion entered one car and mr green jun and his companion the other and then the balloons went up and the aërial travellers stood up and the crowd outside roared with delight and the two gentlemen who had never ascended before tried to wave their flags as if they were not nervous but held on very fast all the while and the balloons were wafted gently away our little friend solemnly protesting long after they were reduced to mere specks in the air that he could still distinguish the white hat of mr green  the gardens disgorged their multitudes boys ran up and down screaming ‘balloon’ and in all the crowded thoroughfares people rushed out of their shops into the middle of the road and having stared up in the air at two little black objects till they almost dislocated their necks walked slowly in again perfectly satisfied  the next day there was a grand account of the ascent in the morning papers and the public were informed how it was the finest day but four in mr green’s remembrance how they retained sight of the earth till they lost it behind the clouds and how the reflection of the balloon on the undulating masses of vapour was gorgeously picturesque together with a little science about the refraction of the sun’s rays and some mysterious hints respecting atmospheric heat and eddying currents of air  there was also an interesting account how a man in a boat was distinctly heard by mr green jun to exclaim ‘my eye’ which mr green jun attributed to his voice rising to the balloon and the sound being thrown back from its surface into the car and the whole concluded with a slight allusion to another ascent next wednesday all of which was very instructive and very amusing as our readers will see if they look to the papers  if we have forgotten to mention the date they have only to wait till next summer and take the account of the first ascent and it will answer the purpose equally well    chapter xv—early coaches   we have often wondered how many months’ incessant travelling in a postchaise it would take to kill a man and wondering by analogy we should very much like to know how many months of constant travelling in a succession of early coaches an unfortunate mortal could endure breaking a man alive upon the wheel would be nothing to breaking his rest his peace his heart—everything but his fast—upon four and the punishment of ixion the only practical person bythebye who has discovered the secret of the perpetual motion would sink into utter insignificance before the one we have suggested  if we had been a powerful churchman in those good times when blood was shed as freely as water and men were mowed down like grass in the sacred cause of religion we would have lain by very quietly till we got hold of some especially obstinate miscreant who positively refused to be converted to our faith and then we would have booked him for an inside place in a small coach which travelled day and night and securing the remainder of the places for stout men with a slight tendency to coughing and spitting we would have started him forth on his last travels leaving him mercilessly to all the tortures which the waiters landlords coachmen guards boots chambermaids and other familiars on his line of road might think proper to inflict  who has not experienced the miseries inevitably consequent upon a summons to undertake a hasty journey  you receive an intimation from your place of business—wherever that may be or whatever you may be—that it will be necessary to leave town without delay  you and your family are forthwith thrown into a state of tremendous excitement an express is immediately dispatched to the washerwoman’s everybody is in a bustle and you yourself with a feeling of dignity which you cannot altogether conceal sally forth to the bookingoffice to secure your place  here a painful consciousness of your own unimportance first rushes on your mind—the people are as cool and collected as if nobody were going out of town or as if a journey of a hundred odd miles were a mere nothing  you enter a mouldylooking room ornamented with large postingbills the greater part of the place enclosed behind a huge lumbering rough counter and fitted up with recesses that look like the dens of the smaller animals in a travelling menagerie without the bars  some halfdozen people are ‘booking’ brownpaper parcels which one of the clerks flings into the aforesaid recesses with an air of recklessness which you remembering the new carpetbag you bought in the morning feel considerably annoyed at porters looking like so many atlases keep rushing in and out with large packages on their shoulders and while you are waiting to make the necessary inquiries you wonder what on earth the bookingoffice clerks can have been before they were bookingoffice clerks one of them with his pen behind his ear and his hands behind him is standing in front of the fire like a fulllength portrait of napoleon the other with his hat half off his head enters the passengers’ names in the books with a coolness which is inexpressibly provoking and the villain whistles—actually whistles—while a man asks him what the fare is outside all the way to holyhead—in frosty weather too  they are clearly an isolated race evidently possessing no sympathies or feelings in common with the rest of mankind  your turn comes at last and having paid the fare you tremblingly inquire—‘what time will it be necessary for me to be here in the morning’—‘six o’clock’ replies the whistler carelessly pitching the sovereign you have just parted with into a wooden bowl on the desk  ‘rather before than arter’ adds the man with the semiroasted unmentionables with just as much ease and complacency as if the whole world got out of bed at five  you turn into the street ruminating as you bend your steps homewards on the extent to which men become hardened in cruelty by custom  if there be one thing in existence more miserable than another it most unquestionably is the being compelled to rise by candlelight  if you have ever doubted the fact you are painfully convinced of your error on the morning of your departure  you left strict orders overnight to be called at halfpast four and you have done nothing all night but doze for five minutes at a time and start up suddenly from a terrific dream of a large churchclock with the small hand running round with astonishing rapidity to every figure on the dialplate  at last completely exhausted you fall gradually into a refreshing sleep—your thoughts grow confused—the stagecoaches which have been ‘going off’ before your eyes all night become less and less distinct until they go off altogether one moment you are driving with all the skill and smartness of an experienced whip—the next you are exhibiting à la ducrow on the offleader anon you are closely muffled up inside and have just recognised in the person of the guard an old schoolfellow whose funeral even in your dream you remember to have attended eighteen years ago  at last you fall into a state of complete oblivion from which you are aroused as if into a new state of existence by a singular illusion  you are apprenticed to a trunkmaker how or why or when or wherefore you don’t take the trouble to inquire but there you are pasting the lining in the lid of a portmanteau  confound that other apprentice in the back shop how he is hammering—rap rap rap—what an industrious fellow he must be you have heard him at work for half an hour past and he has been hammering incessantly the whole time  rap rap rap again—he’s talking now—what’s that he said  five o’clock  you make a violent exertion and start up in bed  the vision is at once dispelled the trunkmaker’s shop is your own bedroom and the other apprentice your shivering servant who has been vainly endeavouring to wake you for the last quarter of an hour at the imminent risk of breaking either his own knuckles or the panels of the door  you proceed to dress yourself with all possible dispatch  the flaring flat candle with the long snuff gives light enough to show that the things you want are not where they ought to be and you undergo a trifling delay in consequence of having carefully packed up one of your boots in your overanxiety of the preceding night  you soon complete your toilet however for you are not particular on such an occasion and you shaved yesterday evening so mounting your petersham greatcoat and green travelling shawl and grasping your carpetbag in your right hand you walk lightly downstairs lest you should awaken any of the family and after pausing in the common sittingroom for one moment just to have a cup of coffee the said common sittingroom looking remarkably comfortable with everything out of its place and strewed with the crumbs of last night’s supper you undo the chain and bolts of the streetdoor and find yourself fairly in the street  a thaw by all that is miserable  the frost is completely broken up you look down the long perspective of oxfordstreet the gaslights mournfully reflected on the wet pavement and can discern no speck in the road to encourage the belief that there is a cab or a coach to be had—the very coachmen have gone home in despair  the cold sleet is drizzling down with that gentle regularity which betokens a duration of fourandtwenty hours at least the damp hangs upon the housetops and lampposts and clings to you like an invisible cloak  the water is ‘coming in’ in every area the pipes have burst the waterbutts are running over the kennels seem to be doing matches against time pumphandles descend of their own accord horses in marketcarts fall down and there’s no one to help them up again policemen look as if they had been carefully sprinkled with powdered glass here and there a milkwoman trudges slowly along with a bit of list round each foot to keep her from slipping boys who ‘don’t sleep in the house’ and are not allowed much sleep out of it can’t wake their masters by thundering at the shopdoor and cry with the cold—the compound of ice snow and water on the pavement is a couple of inches thick—nobody ventures to walk fast to keep himself warm and nobody could succeed in keeping himself warm if he did  it strikes a quarter past five as you trudge down waterlooplace on your way to the golden cross and you discover for the first time that you were called about an hour too early  you have not time to go back there is no place open to go into and you have therefore no resource but to go forward which you do feeling remarkably satisfied with yourself and everything about you  you arrive at the office and look wistfully up the yard for the birmingham highflier which for aught you can see may have flown away altogether for preparations appear to be on foot for the departure of any vehicle in the shape of a coach  you wander into the bookingoffice which with the gaslights and blazing fire looks quite comfortable by contrast—that is to say if any place can look comfortable at halfpast five on a winter’s morning  there stands the identical bookkeeper in the same position as if he had not moved since you saw him yesterday  as he informs you that the coach is up the yard and will be brought round in about a quarter of an hour you leave your bag and repair to ‘the tap’—not with any absurd idea of warming yourself because you feel such a result to be utterly hopeless but for the purpose of procuring some hot brandyandwater which you do—when the kettle boils an event which occurs exactly two minutes and a half before the time fixed for the starting of the coach  the first stroke of six peals from st martin’s church steeple just as you take the first sip of the boiling liquid  you find yourself at the bookingoffice in two seconds and the tapwaiter finds himself much comforted by your brandyandwater in about the same period  the coach is out the horses are in and the guard and two or three porters are stowing the luggage away and running up the steps of the bookingoffice and down the steps of the bookingoffice with breathless rapidity  the place which a few minutes ago was so still and quiet is now all bustle the early vendors of the morning papers have arrived and you are assailed on all sides with shouts of ‘times gen’lm’n times’ ‘here’s chron—chron—chron’ ‘herald ma’am’  ‘highly interesting murder gen’lm’n’ ‘curious case o’ breach o’ promise ladies’  the inside passengers are already in their dens and the outsides with the exception of yourself are pacing up and down the pavement to keep themselves warm they consist of two young men with very long hair to which the sleet has communicated the appearance of crystallised rats’ tails one thin young woman cold and peevish one old gentleman ditto ditto and something in a cloak and cap intended to represent a military officer every member of the party with a large stiff shawl over his chin looking exactly as if he were playing a set of pan’s pipes  ‘take off the cloths bob’ says the coachman who now appears for the first time in a rough blue greatcoat of which the buttons behind are so far apart that you can’t see them both at the same time  ‘now gen’lm’n’ cries the guard with the waybill in his hand  ‘five minutes behind time already’  up jump the passengers—the two young men smoking like limekilns and the old gentleman grumbling audibly  the thin young woman is got upon the roof by dint of a great deal of pulling and pushing and helping and trouble and she repays it by expressing her solemn conviction that she will never be able to get down again  ‘all right’ sings out the guard at last jumping up as the coach starts and blowing his horn directly afterwards in proof of the soundness of his wind  ‘let ’em go harry give ’em their heads’ cries the coachman—and off we start as briskly as if the morning were ‘all right’ as well as the coach and looking forward as anxiously to the termination of our journey as we fear our readers will have done long since to the conclusion of our paper    chapter xvi—omnibuses   it is very generally allowed that public conveyances afford an extensive field for amusement and observation  of all the public conveyances that have been constructed since the days of the ark—we think that is the earliest on record—to the present time commend us to an omnibus  a long stage is not to be despised but there you have only six insides and the chances are that the same people go all the way with you—there is no change no variety  besides after the first twelve hours or so people get cross and sleepy and when you have seen a man in his nightcap you lose all respect for him at least that is the case with us  then on smooth roads people frequently get prosy and tell long stories and even those who don’t talk may have very unpleasant predilections  we once travelled four hundred miles inside a stagecoach with a stout man who had a glass of rumandwater warm handed in at the window at every place where we changed horses  this was decidedly unpleasant  we have also travelled occasionally with a small boy of a pale aspect with light hair and no perceptible neck coming up to town from school under the protection of the guard and directed to be left at the cross keys till called for  this is perhaps even worse than rumandwater in a close atmosphere  then there is the whole train of evils consequent on a change of the coachman and the misery of the discovery—which the guard is sure to make the moment you begin to doze—that he wants a brownpaper parcel which he distinctly remembers to have deposited under the seat on which you are reposing  a great deal of bustle and groping takes place and when you are thoroughly awakened and severely cramped by holding your legs up by an almost supernatural exertion while he is looking behind them it suddenly occurs to him that he put it in the foreboot bang goes the door the parcel is immediately found off starts the coach again and the guard plays the keybugle as loud as he can play it as if in mockery of your wretchedness  now you meet with none of these afflictions in an omnibus sameness there can never be  the passengers change as often in the course of one journey as the figures in a kaleidoscope and though not so glittering are far more amusing  we believe there is no instance on record of a man’s having gone to sleep in one of these vehicles  as to long stories would any man venture to tell a long story in an omnibus and even if he did where would be the harm nobody could possibly hear what he was talking about  again children though occasionally are not often to be found in an omnibus and even when they are if the vehicle be full as is generally the case somebody sits upon them and we are unconscious of their presence  yes after mature reflection and considerable experience we are decidedly of opinion that of all known vehicles from the glasscoach in which we were taken to be christened to that sombre caravan in which we must one day make our last earthly journey there is nothing like an omnibus  we will back the machine in which we make our daily peregrination from the top of oxfordstreet to the city against any ‘buss’ on the road whether it be for the gaudiness of its exterior the perfect simplicity of its interior or the native coolness of its cad  this young gentleman is a singular instance of selfdevotion his somewhat intemperate zeal on behalf of his employers is constantly getting him into trouble and occasionally into the house of correction  he is no sooner emancipated however than he resumes the duties of his profession with unabated ardour  his principal distinction is his activity  his great boast is ‘that he can chuck an old gen’lm’n into the buss shut him in and rattle off afore he knows where it’s agoing to’—a feat which he frequently performs to the infinite amusement of every one but the old gentleman concerned who somehow or other never can see the joke of the thing  we are not aware that it has ever been precisely ascertained how many passengers our omnibus will contain  the impression on the cad’s mind evidently is that it is amply sufficient for the accommodation of any number of persons that can be enticed into it  ‘any room’ cries a hot pedestrian  ‘plenty o’ room sir’ replies the conductor gradually opening the door and not disclosing the real state of the case until the wretched man is on the steps  ‘where’ inquires the entrapped individual with an attempt to back out again  ‘either side sir’ rejoins the cad shoving him in and slamming the door  ‘all right bill’  retreat is impossible the newcomer rolls about till he falls down somewhere and there he stops  as we get into the city a little before ten four or five of our party are regular passengers  we always take them up at the same places and they generally occupy the same seats they are always dressed in the same manner and invariably discuss the same topics—the increasing rapidity of cabs and the disregard of moral obligations evinced by omnibus men there is a little testy old man with a powdered head who always sits on the righthand side of the door as you enter with his hands folded on the top of his umbrella  he is extremely impatient and sits there for the purpose of keeping a sharp eye on the cad with whom he generally holds a running dialogue  he is very officious in helping people in and out and always volunteers to give the cad a poke with his umbrella when any one wants to alight  he usually recommends ladies to have sixpence ready to prevent delay and if anybody puts a window down that he can reach he immediately puts it up again  ‘now what are you stopping for’ says the little man every morning the moment there is the slightest indication of ‘pulling up’ at the corner of regentstreet when some such dialogue as the following takes place between him and the cad  ‘what are you stopping for’  here the cad whistles and affects not to hear the question  ‘i say a poke what are you stopping for’  ‘for passengers sir  ba—nk—ty’  ‘i know you’re stopping for passengers but you’ve no business to do so why are you stopping’  ‘vy sir that’s a difficult question  i think it is because we perfer stopping here to going on’  ‘now mind’ exclaims the little old man with great vehemence ‘i’ll pull you up tomorrow i’ve often threatened to do it now i will’  ‘thankee sir’ replies the cad touching his hat with a mock expression of gratitude—‘werry much obliged to you indeed sir’  here the young men in the omnibus laugh very heartily and the old gentleman gets very red in the face and seems highly exasperated  the stout gentleman in the white neckcloth at the other end of the vehicle looks very prophetic and says that something must shortly be done with these fellows or there’s no saying where all this will end and the shabbygenteel man with the green bag expresses his entire concurrence in the opinion as he has done regularly every morning for the last six months  a second omnibus now comes up and stops immediately behind us  another old gentleman elevates his cane in the air and runs with all his might towards our omnibus we watch his progress with great interest the door is opened to receive him he suddenly disappears—he has been spirited away by the opposition  hereupon the driver of the opposition taunts our people with his having ‘regularly done ’em out of that old swell’ and the voice of the ‘old swell’ is heard vainly protesting against this unlawful detention  we rattle off the other omnibus rattles after us and every time we stop to take up a passenger they stop to take him too sometimes we get him sometimes they get him but whoever don’t get him say they ought to have had him and the cads of the respective vehicles abuse one another accordingly  as we arrive in the vicinity of lincoln’sinnfields bedfordrow and other legal haunts we drop a great many of our original passengers and take up fresh ones who meet with a very sulky reception  it is rather remarkable that the people already in an omnibus always look at newcomers as if they entertained some undefined idea that they have no business to come in at all  we are quite persuaded the little old man has some notion of this kind and that he considers their entry as a sort of negative impertinence  conversation is now entirely dropped each person gazes vacantly through the window in front of him and everybody thinks that his opposite neighbour is staring at him  if one man gets out at shoelane and another at the corner of farringdonstreet the little old gentleman grumbles and suggests to the latter that if he had got out at shoelane too he would have saved them the delay of another stoppage whereupon the young men laugh again and the old gentleman looks very solemn and says nothing more till he gets to the bank when he trots off as fast as he can leaving us to do the same and to wish as we walk away that we could impart to others any portion of the amusement we have gained for ourselves    chapter xvii—the last cabdriver and the first omnibus cad   of all the cabrioletdrivers whom we have ever had the honour and gratification of knowing by sight—and our acquaintance in this way has been most extensive—there is one who made an impression on our mind which can never be effaced and who awakened in our bosom a feeling of admiration and respect which we entertain a fatal presentiment will never be called forth again by any human being  he was a man of most simple and prepossessing appearance  he was a brownwhiskered whitehatted nocoated cabman his nose was generally red and his bright blue eye not unfrequently stood out in bold relief against a black border of artificial workmanship his boots were of the wellington form pulled up to meet his corduroy kneesmalls or at least to approach as near them as their dimensions would admit of and his neck was usually garnished with a bright yellow handkerchief  in summer he carried in his mouth a flower in winter a straw—slight but to a contemplative mind certain indications of a love of nature and a taste for botany  his cabriolet was gorgeously painted—a bright red and wherever we went city or west end paddington or holloway north east west or south there was the red cab bumping up against the posts at the street corners and turning in and out among hackneycoaches and drays and carts and waggons and omnibuses and contriving by some strange means or other to get out of places which no other vehicle but the red cab could ever by any possibility have contrived to get into at all  our fondness for that red cab was unbounded  how we should have liked to have seen it in the circle at astley’s  our life upon it that it should have performed such evolutions as would have put the whole company to shame—indian chiefs knights swiss peasants and all  some people object to the exertion of getting into cabs and others object to the difficulty of getting out of them we think both these are objections which take their rise in perverse and illconditioned minds the getting into a cab is a very pretty and graceful process which when well performed is essentially melodramatic  first there is the expressive pantomime of every one of the eighteen cabmen on the stand the moment you raise your eyes from the ground  then there is your own pantomime in reply—quite a little ballet  four cabs immediately leave the stand for your especial accommodation and the evolutions of the animals who draw them are beautiful in the extreme as they grate the wheels of the cabs against the curbstones and sport playfully in the kennel  you single out a particular cab and dart swiftly towards it one bound and you are on the first step turn your body lightly round to the right and you are on the second bend gracefully beneath the reins working round to the left at the same time and you are in the cab there is no difficulty in finding a seat the apron knocks you comfortably into it at once and off you go  the getting out of a cab is perhaps rather more complicated in its theory and a shade more difficult in its execution  we have studied the subject a great deal and we think the best way is to throw yourself out and trust to chance for alighting on your feet  if you make the driver alight first and then throw yourself upon him you will find that he breaks your fall materially  in the event of your contemplating an offer of eightpence on no account make the tender or show the money until you are safely on the pavement  it is very bad policy attempting to save the fourpence  you are very much in the power of a cabman and he considers it a kind of fee not to do you any wilful damage  any instruction however in the art of getting out of a cab is wholly unnecessary if you are going any distance because the probability is that you will be shot lightly out before you have completed the third mile  we are not aware of any instance on record in which a cabhorse has performed three consecutive miles without going down once  what of that it is all excitement  and in these days of derangement of the nervous system and universal lassitude people are content to pay handsomely for excitement where can it be procured at a cheaper rate  but to return to the red cab it was omnipresent  you had but to walk down holborn or fleetstreet or any of the principal thoroughfares in which there is a great deal of traffic and judge for yourself  you had hardly turned into the street when you saw a trunk or two lying on the ground an uprooted post a hatbox a portmanteau and a carpetbag strewed about in a very picturesque manner a horse in a cab standing by looking about him with great unconcern and a crowd shouting and screaming with delight cooling their flushed faces against the glass windows of a chemist’s shop—‘what’s the matter here can you tell me’—‘o’ny a cab sir’—‘anybody hurt do you know’—‘o’ny the fare sir i see him a turnin’ the corner and i ses to another gen’lm’n “that’s a reg’lar little oss that and he’s a comin’ along rayther sweet an’t he”—“he just is” ses the other gen’lm’n ven bump they cums agin the post and out flies the fare like bricks’  need we say it was the red cab or that the gentleman with the straw in his mouth who emerged so coolly from the chemist’s shop and philosophically climbing into the little dickey started off at full gallop was the red cab’s licensed driver  the ubiquity of this red cab and the influence it exercised over the risible muscles of justice itself was perfectly astonishing  you walked into the justiceroom of the mansionhouse the whole court resounded with merriment  the lord mayor threw himself back in his chair in a state of frantic delight at his own joke every vein in mr hobler’s countenance was swollen with laughter partly at the lord mayor’s facetiousness but more at his own the constables and policeofficers were as in duty bound in ecstasies at mr hobler and the lord mayor combined and the very paupers glancing respectfully at the beadle’s countenance tried to smile as even he relaxed  a tall weazenfaced man with an impediment in his speech would be endeavouring to state a case of imposition against the red cab’s driver and the red cab’s driver and the lord mayor and mr hobler would be having a little fun among themselves to the inordinate delight of everybody but the complainant  in the end justice would be so tickled with the red cabdriver’s native humour that the fine would be mitigated and he would go away full gallop in the red cab to impose on somebody else without loss of time  the driver of the red cab confident in the strength of his own moral principles like many other philosophers was wont to set the feelings and opinions of society at complete defiance  generally speaking perhaps he would as soon carry a fare safely to his destination as he would upset him—sooner perhaps because in that case he not only got the money but had the additional amusement of running a longer heat against some smart rival  but society made war upon him in the shape of penalties and he must make war upon society in his own way  this was the reasoning of the red cabdriver  so he bestowed a searching look upon the fare as he put his hand in his waistcoat pocket when he had gone half the mile to get the money ready and if he brought forth eightpence out he went  the last time we saw our friend was one wet evening in tottenhamcourtroad when he was engaged in a very warm and somewhat personal altercation with a loquacious little gentleman in a green coat poor fellow there were great excuses to be made for him he had not received above eighteenpence more than his fare and consequently laboured under a great deal of very natural indignation  the dispute had attained a pretty considerable height when at last the loquacious little gentleman making a mental calculation of the distance and finding that he had already paid more than he ought avowed his unalterable determination to ‘pull up’ the cabman in the morning  ‘now just mark this young man’ said the little gentleman ‘i’ll pull you up tomorrow morning’  ‘no will you though’ said our friend with a sneer  ‘i will’ replied the little gentleman ‘mark my words that’s all  if i live till tomorrow morning you shall repent this’  there was a steadiness of purpose and indignation of speech about the little gentleman as he took an angry pinch of snuff after this last declaration which made a visible impression on the mind of the red cabdriver  he appeared to hesitate for an instant  it was only for an instant his resolve was soon taken  ‘you’ll pull me up will you’ said our friend  ‘i will’ rejoined the little gentleman with even greater vehemence an before  ‘very well’ said our friend tucking up his shirt sleeves very calmly ‘there’ll be three veeks for that  wery good that’ll bring me up to the middle o’ next month  three veeks more would carry me on to my birthday and then i’ve got ten pound to draw  i may as well get board lodgin’ and washin’ till then out of the county as pay for it myself consequently here goes’  so without more ado the red cabdriver knocked the little gentleman down and then called the police to take himself into custody with all the civility in the world  a story is nothing without the sequel and therefore we may state that to our certain knowledge the board lodging and washing were all provided in due course  we happen to know the fact for it came to our knowledge thus we went over the house of correction for the county of middlesex shortly after to witness the operation of the silent system and looked on all the ‘wheels’ with the greatest anxiety in search of our longlost friend  he was nowhere to be seen however and we began to think that the little gentleman in the green coat must have relented when as we were traversing the kitchengarden which lies in a sequestered part of the prison we were startled by hearing a voice which apparently proceeded from the wall pouring forth its soul in the plaintive air of ‘all round my hat’ which was then just beginning to form a recognised portion of our national music  we started—‘what voice is that’ said we  the governor shook his head  ‘sad fellow’ he replied ‘very sad  he positively refused to work on the wheel so after many trials i was compelled to order him into solitary confinement  he says he likes it very much though and i am afraid he does for he lies on his back on the floor and sings comic songs all day’  shall we add that our heart had not deceived us and that the comic singer was no other than our eagerlysought friend the red cabdriver  we have never seen him since but we have strong reason to suspect that this noble individual was a distant relative of a waterman of our acquaintance who on one occasion when we were passing the coachstand over which he presides after standing very quietly to see a tall man struggle into a cab ran up very briskly when it was all over as his brethren invariably do and touching his hat asked as a matter of course for ‘a copper for the waterman’  now the fare was by no means a handsome man and waxing very indignant at the demand he replied—‘money  what for  coming up and looking at me i suppose’—‘vell sir’ rejoined the waterman with a smile of immovable complacency ‘that’s worth twopence’  the identical waterman afterwards attained a very prominent station in society and as we know something of his life and have often thought of telling what we do know perhaps we shall never have a better opportunity than the present  mr william barker then for that was the gentleman’s name mr william barker was born—but why need we relate where mr william barker was born or when  why scrutinise the entries in parochial ledgers or seek to penetrate the lucinian mysteries of lyingin hospitals  mr william barker was born or he had never been  there is a son—there was a father  there is an effect—there was a cause  surely this is sufficient information for the most fatimalike curiosity and if it be not we regret our inability to supply any further evidence on the point  can there be a more satisfactory or more strictly parliamentary course impossible  we at once avow a similar inability to record at what precise period or by what particular process this gentleman’s patronymic of william barker became corrupted into ‘bill boorker’ mr barker acquired a high standing and no inconsiderable reputation among the members of that profession to which he more peculiarly devoted his energies and to them he was generally known either by the familiar appellation of ‘bill boorker’ or the flattering designation of ‘aggerawatin bill’ the latter being a playful and expressive sobriquet illustrative of mr barker’s great talent in ‘aggerawatin’ and rendering wild such subjects of her majesty as are conveyed from place to place through the instrumentality of omnibuses  of the early life of mr barker little is known and even that little is involved in considerable doubt and obscurity  a want of application a restlessness of purpose a thirsting after porter a love of all that is roving and cadgerlike in nature shared in common with many other great geniuses appear to have been his leading characteristics  the busy hum of a parochial freeschool and the shady repose of a county gaol were alike inefficacious in producing the slightest alteration in mr barker’s disposition  his feverish attachment to change and variety nothing could repress his native daring no punishment could subdue  if mr barker can be fairly said to have had any weakness in his earlier years it was an amiable one—love love in its most comprehensive form—a love of ladies liquids and pockethandkerchiefs  it was no selfish feeling it was not confined to his own possessions which but too many men regard with exclusive complacency  no it was a nobler love—a general principle  it extended itself with equal force to the property of other people  there is something very affecting in this  it is still more affecting to know that such philanthropy is but imperfectly rewarded  bowstreet newgate and millbank are a poor return for general benevolence evincing itself in an irrepressible love for all created objects  mr barker felt it so  after a lengthened interview with the highest legal authorities he quitted his ungrateful country with the consent and at the expense of its government proceeded to a distant shore and there employed himself like another cincinnatus in clearing and cultivating the soil—a peaceful pursuit in which a term of seven years glided almost imperceptibly away  whether at the expiration of the period we have just mentioned the british government required mr barker’s presence here or did not require his residence abroad we have no distinct means of ascertaining we should be inclined however to favour the latter position inasmuch as we do not find that he was advanced to any other public post on his return than the post at the corner of the haymarket where he officiated as assistantwaterman to the hackneycoach stand  seated in this capacity on a couple of tubs near the curbstone with a brass plate and number suspended round his neck by a massive chain and his ankles curiously enveloped in haybands he is supposed to have made those observations on human nature which exercised so material an influence over all his proceedings in later life  mr barker had not officiated for many months in this capacity when the appearance of the first omnibus caused the public mind to go in a new direction and prevented a great many hackneycoaches from going in any direction at all  the genius of mr barker at once perceived the whole extent of the injury that would be eventually inflicted on cab and coach stands and by consequence on watermen also by the progress of the system of which the first omnibus was a part  he saw too the necessity of adopting some more profitable profession and his active mind at once perceived how much might be done in the way of enticing the youthful and unwary and shoving the old and helpless into the wrong buss and carrying them off until reduced to despair they ransomed themselves by the payment of sixpence ahead or to adopt his own figurative expression in all its native beauty ‘till they was rig’larly done over and forked out the stumpy’  an opportunity for realising his fondest anticipations soon presented itself  rumours were rife on the hackneycoach stands that a buss was building to run from lissongrove to the bank down oxfordstreet and holborn and the rapid increase of busses on the paddingtonroad encouraged the idea  mr barker secretly and cautiously inquired in the proper quarters  the report was correct the ‘royal william’ was to make its first journey on the following monday  it was a crack affair altogether  an enterprising young cabman of established reputation as a dashing whip—for he had compromised with the parents of three scrunched children and just ‘worked out’ his fine for knocking down an old lady—was the driver and the spirited proprietor knowing mr barker’s qualifications appointed him to the vacant office of cad on the very first application  the buss began to run and mr barker entered into a new suit of clothes and on a new sphere of action  to recapitulate all the improvements introduced by this extraordinary man into the omnibus system—gradually indeed but surely—would occupy a far greater space than we are enabled to devote to this imperfect memoir  to him is universally assigned the original suggestion of the practice which afterwards became so general—of the driver of a second buss keeping constantly behind the first one and driving the pole of his vehicle either into the door of the other every time it was opened or through the body of any lady or gentleman who might make an attempt to get into it a humorous and pleasant invention exhibiting all that originality of idea and fine bold flow of spirits so conspicuous in every action of this great man  mr barker had opponents of course what man in public life has not  but even his worst enemies cannot deny that he has taken more old ladies and gentlemen to paddington who wanted to go to the bank and more old ladies and gentlemen to the bank who wanted to go to paddington than any six men on the road and however much malevolent spirits may pretend to doubt the accuracy of the statement they well know it to be an established fact that he has forcibly conveyed a variety of ancient persons of either sex to both places who had not the slightest or most distant intention of going anywhere at all  mr barker was the identical cad who nobly distinguished himself some time since by keeping a tradesman on the step—the omnibus going at full speed all the time—till he had thrashed him to his entire satisfaction and finally throwing him away when he had quite done with him  mr barker it ought to have been who honestly indignant at being ignominiously ejected from a house of public entertainment kicked the landlord in the knee and thereby caused his death  we say it ought to have been mr barker because the action was not a common one and could have emanated from no ordinary mind  it has now become matter of history it is recorded in the newgate calendar and we wish we could attribute this piece of daring heroism to mr barker  we regret being compelled to state that it was not performed by him  would for the family credit we could add that it was achieved by his brother  it was in the exercise of the nicer details of his profession that mr barker’s knowledge of human nature was beautifully displayed  he could tell at a glance where a passenger wanted to go to and would shout the name of the place accordingly without the slightest reference to the real destination of the vehicle  he knew exactly the kind of old lady that would be too much flurried by the process of pushing in and pulling out of the caravan to discover where she had been put down until too late had an intuitive perception of what was passing in a passenger’s mind when he inwardly resolved to ‘pull that cad up tomorrow morning’ and never failed to make himself agreeable to female servants whom he would place next the door and talk to all the way  human judgment is never infallible and it would occasionally happen that mr barker experimentalised with the timidity or forbearance of the wrong person in which case a summons to a policeoffice was on more than one occasion followed by a committal to prison  it was not in the power of trifles such as these however to subdue the freedom of his spirit  as soon as they passed away he resumed the duties of his profession with unabated ardour  we have spoken of mr barker and of the red cabdriver in the past tense  alas mr barker has again become an absentee and the class of men to which they both belonged is fast disappearing  improvement has peered beneath the aprons of our cabs and penetrated to the very innermost recesses of our omnibuses  dirt and fustian will vanish before cleanliness and livery  slang will be forgotten when civility becomes general and that enlightened eloquent sage and profound body the magistracy of london will be deprived of half their amusement and half their occupation    chapter xviii—a parliamentary sketch   we hope our readers will not be alarmed at this rather ominous title  we assure them that we are not about to become political neither have we the slightest intention of being more prosy than usual—if we can help it it has occurred to us that a slight sketch of the general aspect of ‘the house’ and the crowds that resort to it on the night of an important debate would be productive of some amusement and as we have made some few calls at the aforesaid house in our time—have visited it quite often enough for our purpose and a great deal too often for our personal peace and comfort—we have determined to attempt the description  dismissing from our minds therefore all that feeling of awe which vague ideas of breaches of privilege serjeantatarms heavy denunciations and still heavier fees are calculated to awaken we enter at once into the building and upon our subject  halfpast four o’clock—and at five the mover of the address will be ‘on his legs’ as the newspapers announce sometimes by way of novelty as if speakers were occasionally in the habit of standing on their heads  the members are pouring in one after the other in shoals  the few spectators who can obtain standingroom in the passages scrutinise them as they pass with the utmost interest and the man who can identify a member occasionally becomes a person of great importance  every now and then you hear earnest whispers of ‘that’s sir john thomson’  ‘which him with the gilt order round his neck’  ‘no no that’s one of the messengers—that other with the yellow gloves is sir john thomson’ ‘here’s mr smith’  ‘lor’  ‘yes how d’ye do sir—he is our new member—how do you do sir’  mr smith stops turns round with an air of enchanting urbanity for the rumour of an intended dissolution has been very extensively circulated this morning seizes both the hands of his gratified constituent and after greeting him with the most enthusiastic warmth darts into the lobby with an extraordinary display of ardour in the public cause leaving an immense impression in his favour on the mind of his ‘fellowtownsman’  the arrivals increase in number and the heat and noise increase in very unpleasant proportion  the livery servants form a complete lane on either side of the passage and you reduce yourself into the smallest possible space to avoid being turned out  you see that stout man with the hoarse voice in the blue coat queercrowned broadbrimmed hat white corduroy breeches and great boots who has been talking incessantly for half an hour past and whose importance has occasioned no small quantity of mirth among the strangers  that is the great conservator of the peace of westminster  you cannot fail to have remarked the grace with which he saluted the noble lord who passed just now or the excessive dignity of his air as he expostulates with the crowd  he is rather out of temper now in consequence of the very irreverent behaviour of those two young fellows behind him who have done nothing but laugh all the time they have been here  ‘will they divide tonight do you think mr ’ timidly inquires a little thin man in the crowd hoping to conciliate the man of office  ‘how can you ask such questions sir’ replies the functionary in an incredibly loud key and pettishly grasping the thick stick he carries in his right hand  ‘pray do not sir  i beg of you pray do not sir’ the little man looks remarkably out of his element and the uninitiated part of the throng are in positive convulsions of laughter  just at this moment some unfortunate individual appears with a very smirking air at the bottom of the long passage  he has managed to elude the vigilance of the special constable downstairs and is evidently congratulating himself on having made his way so far  ‘go back sir—you must not come here’ shouts the hoarse one with tremendous emphasis of voice and gesture the moment the offender catches his eye  the stranger pauses  ‘do you hear sir—will you go back’ continues the official dignitary gently pushing the intruder some halfdozen yards  ‘come don’t push me’ replies the stranger turning angrily round  ‘i will sir’  ‘you won’t sir’  ‘go out sir’  ‘take your hands off me sir’  ‘go out of the passage sir’  ‘you’re a jackinoffice sir’  ‘a what’ ejaculates he of the boots  ‘a jackinoffice sir and a very insolent fellow’ reiterates the stranger now completely in a passion  ‘pray do not force me to put you out sir’ retorts the other—‘pray do not—my instructions are to keep this passage clear—it’s the speaker’s orders sir’  ‘dn the speaker sir’ shouts the intruder  ‘here wilson—collins’ gasps the officer actually paralysed at this insulting expression which in his mind is all but high treason ‘take this man out—take him out i say  how dare you sir’ and down goes the unfortunate man five stairs at a time turning round at every stoppage to come back again and denouncing bitter vengeance against the commanderinchief and all his supernumeraries  ‘make way gentlemen—pray make way for the members i beg of you’ shouts the zealous officer turning back and preceding a whole string of the liberal and independent  you see this ferociouslooking gentleman with a complexion almost as sallow as his linen and whose large black moustache would give him the appearance of a figure in a hairdresser’s window if his countenance possessed the thought which is communicated to those waxen caricatures of the human face divine  he is a militiaofficer and the most amusing person in the house  can anything be more exquisitely absurd than the burlesque grandeur of his air as he strides up to the lobby his eyes rolling like those of a turk’s head in a cheap dutch clock  he never appears without that bundle of dirty papers which he carries under his left arm and which are generally supposed to be the miscellaneous estimates for 1804 or some equally important documents  he is very punctual in his attendance at the house and his selfsatisfied ‘hearhear’ is not unfrequently the signal for a general titter  this is the gentleman who once actually sent a messenger up to the strangers’ gallery in the old house of commons to inquire the name of an individual who was using an eyeglass in order that he might complain to the speaker that the person in question was quizzing him  on another occasion he is reported to have repaired to bellamy’s kitchen—a refreshmentroom where persons who are not members are admitted on sufferance as it were—and perceiving two or three gentlemen at supper who he was aware were not members and could not in that place very well resent his behaviour he indulged in the pleasantry of sitting with his booted leg on the table at which they were supping  he is generally harmless though and always amusing  by dint of patience and some little interest with our friend the constable we have contrived to make our way to the lobby and you can just manage to catch an occasional glimpse of the house as the door is opened for the admission of members  it is tolerably full already and little groups of members are congregated together here discussing the interesting topics of the day  that smartlooking fellow in the black coat with velvet facings and cuffs who wears his d’orsay hat so rakishly is ‘honest tom’ a metropolitan representative and the large man in the cloak with the white lining—not the man by the pillar the other with the light hair hanging over his coat collar behind—is his colleague  the quiet gentlemanlylooking man in the blue surtout gray trousers white neckerchief and gloves whose closelybuttoned coat displays his manly figure and broad chest to great advantage is a very wellknown character  he has fought a great many battles in his time and conquered like the heroes of old with no other arms than those the gods gave him the old hardfeatured man who is standing near him is really a good specimen of a class of men now nearly extinct  he is a county member and has been from time whereof the memory of man is not to the contrary look at his loose wide brown coat with capacious pockets on each side the kneebreeches and boots the immensely long waistcoat and silver watchchain dangling below it the widebrimmed brown hat and the white handkerchief tied in a great bow with straggling ends sticking out beyond his shirtfrill  it is a costume one seldom sees nowadays and when the few who wear it have died off it will be quite extinct  he can tell you long stories of fox pitt sheridan and canning and how much better the house was managed in those times when they used to get up at eight or nine o’clock except on regular fielddays of which everybody was apprised beforehand  he has a great contempt for all young members of parliament and thinks it quite impossible that a man can say anything worth hearing unless he has sat in the house for fifteen years at least without saying anything at all  he is of opinion that ‘that young macaulay’ was a regular impostor he allows that lord stanley may do something one of these days but ‘he’s too young sir—too young’  he is an excellent authority on points of precedent and when he grows talkative after his wine will tell you how sir somebody something when he was whipperin for the government brought four men out of their beds to vote in the majority three of whom died on their way home again how the house once divided on the question that fresh candles be now brought in how the speaker was once upon a time left in the chair by accident at the conclusion of business and was obliged to sit in the house by himself for three hours till some member could be knocked up and brought back again to move the adjournment and a great many other anecdotes of a similar description  there he stands leaning on his stick looking at the throng of exquisites around him with most profound contempt and conjuring up before his mind’s eye the scenes he beheld in the old house in days gone by when his own feelings were fresher and brighter and when as he imagines wit talent and patriotism flourished more brightly too  you are curious to know who that young man in the rough greatcoat is who has accosted every member who has entered the house since we have been standing here  he is not a member he is only an ‘hereditary bondsman’ or in other words an irish correspondent of an irish newspaper who has just procured his fortysecond frank from a member whom he never saw in his life before  there he goes again—another bless the man he has his hat and pockets full already  we will try our fortune at the strangers’ gallery though the nature of the debate encourages very little hope of success  what on earth are you about  holding up your order as if it were a talisman at whose command the wicket would fly open  nonsense  just preserve the order for an autograph if it be worth keeping at all and make your appearance at the door with your thumb and forefinger expressively inserted in your waistcoatpocket  this tall stout man in black is the doorkeeper  ‘any room’  ‘not an inch—two or three dozen gentlemen waiting downstairs on the chance of somebody’s going out’  pull out your purse—‘are you quite sure there’s no room’—‘i’ll go and look’ replies the doorkeeper with a wistful glance at your purse ‘but i’m afraid there’s not’  he returns and with real feeling assures you that it is morally impossible to get near the gallery  it is of no use waiting  when you are refused admission into the strangers’ gallery at the house of commons under such circumstances you may return home thoroughly satisfied that the place must be remarkably full indeed 122  retracing our steps through the long passage descending the stairs and crossing palaceyard we halt at a small temporary doorway adjoining the king’s entrance to the house of lords  the order of the serjeantatarms will admit you into the reporters’ gallery from whence you can obtain a tolerably good view of the house  take care of the stairs they are none of the best through this little wicket—there  as soon as your eyes become a little used to the mist of the place and the glare of the chandeliers below you you will see that some unimportant personage on the ministerial side of the house to your right hand is speaking amidst a hum of voices and confusion which would rival babel but for the circumstance of its being all in one language  the ‘hear hear’ which occasioned that laugh proceeded from our warlike friend with the moustache he is sitting on the back seat against the wall behind the member who is speaking looking as ferocious and intellectual as usual  take one look around you and retire  the body of the house and the side galleries are full of members some with their legs on the back of the opposite seat some with theirs stretched out to their utmost length on the floor some going out others coming in all talking laughing lounging coughing ohing questioning or groaning presenting a conglomeration of noise and confusion to be met with in no other place in existence not even excepting smithfield on a marketday or a cockpit in its glory  but let us not omit to notice bellamy’s kitchen or in other words the refreshmentroom common to both houses of parliament where ministerialists and oppositionists whigs and tories radicals peers and destructives strangers from the gallery and the more favoured strangers from below the bar are alike at liberty to resort where divers honourable members prove their perfect independence by remaining during the whole of a heavy debate solacing themselves with the creature comforts and whence they are summoned by whippersin when the house is on the point of dividing either to give their ‘conscientious votes’ on questions of which they are conscientiously innocent of knowing anything whatever or to find a vent for the playful exuberance of their wineinspired fancies in boisterous shouts of ‘divide’ occasionally varied with a little howling barking crowing or other ebullitions of senatorial pleasantry  when you have ascended the narrow staircase which in the present temporary house of commons leads to the place we are describing you will probably observe a couple of rooms on your right hand with tables spread for dining  neither of these is the kitchen although they are both devoted to the same purpose the kitchen is further on to our left up these halfdozen stairs  before we ascend the staircase however we must request you to pause in front of this little barplace with the sashwindows and beg your particular attention to the steady honestlooking old fellow in black who is its sole occupant  nicholas we do not mind mentioning the old fellow’s name for if nicholas be not a public man who is—and public men’s names are public property—nicholas is the butler of bellamy’s and has held the same place dressed exactly in the same manner and said precisely the same things ever since the oldest of its present visitors can remember  an excellent servant nicholas is—an unrivalled compounder of saladdressing—an admirable preparer of sodawater and lemon—a special mixer of cold grog and punch—and above all an unequalled judge of cheese  if the old man have such a thing as vanity in his composition this is certainly his pride and if it be possible to imagine that anything in this world could disturb his impenetrable calmness we should say it would be the doubting his judgment on this important point  we needn’t tell you all this however for if you have an atom of observation one glance at his sleek knowinglooking head and face—his prim white neckerchief with the wooden tie into which it has been regularly folded for twenty years past merging by imperceptible degrees into a smallplaited shirtfrill—and his comfortablelooking form encased in a wellbrushed suit of black—would give you a better idea of his real character than a column of our poor description could convey  nicholas is rather out of his element now he cannot see the kitchen as he used to in the old house there one window of his glasscase opened into the room and then for the edification and behoof of more juvenile questioners he would stand for an hour together answering deferential questions about sheridan and percival and castlereagh and heaven knows who beside with manifest delight always inserting a ‘mister’ before every commoner’s name  nicholas like all men of his age and standing has a great idea of the degeneracy of the times  he seldom expresses any political opinions but we managed to ascertain just before the passing of the reform bill that nicholas was a thorough reformer  what was our astonishment to discover shortly after the meeting of the first reformed parliament that he was a most inveterate and decided tory  it was very odd some men change their opinions from necessity others from expediency others from inspiration but that nicholas should undergo any change in any respect was an event we had never contemplated and should have considered impossible  his strong opinion against the clause which empowered the metropolitan districts to return members to parliament too was perfectly unaccountable  we discovered the secret at last the metropolitan members always dined at home  the rascals  as for giving additional members to ireland it was even worse—decidedly unconstitutional  why sir an irish member would go up there and eat more dinner than three english members put together  he took no wine drank tablebeer by the halfgallon and went home to manchesterbuildings or millbankstreet for his whiskeyandwater  and what was the consequence  why the concern lost—actually lost sir—by his patronage  a queer old fellow is nicholas and as completely a part of the building as the house itself we wonder he ever left the old place and fully expected to see in the papers the morning after the fire a pathetic account of an old gentleman in black of decent appearance who was seen at one of the upper windows when the flames were at their height and declared his resolute intention of falling with the floor  he must have been got out by force  however he was got out—here he is again looking as he always does as if he had been in a bandbox ever since the last session  there he is at his old post every night just as we have described him and as characters are scarce and faithful servants scarcer long may he be there say we  now when you have taken your seat in the kitchen and duly noticed the large fire and roastingjack at one end of the room—the little table for washing glasses and draining jugs at the other—the clock over the window opposite st margaret’s church—the deal tables and wax candles—the damask tablecloths and bare floor—the plate and china on the tables and the gridiron on the fire and a few other anomalies peculiar to the place—we will point out to your notice two or three of the people present whose station or absurdities render them the most worthy of remark  it is halfpast twelve o’clock and as the division is not expected for an hour or two a few members are lounging away the time here in preference to standing at the bar of the house or sleeping in one of the side galleries  that singularly awkward and ungainlylooking man in the brownishwhite hat with the straggling black trousers which reach about halfway down the leg of his boots who is leaning against the meatscreen apparently deluding himself into the belief that he is thinking about something is a splendid sample of a member of the house of commons concentrating in his own person the wisdom of a constituency observe the wig of a dark hue but indescribable colour for if it be naturally brown it has acquired a black tint by long service and if it be naturally black the same cause has imparted to it a tinge of rusty brown and remark how very materially the great blinkerlike spectacles assist the expression of that most intelligent face  seriously speaking did you ever see a countenance so expressive of the most hopeless extreme of heavy dulness or behold a form so strangely put together  he is no great speaker but when he does address the house the effect is absolutely irresistible  the small gentleman with the sharp nose who has just saluted him is a member of parliament an exalderman and a sort of amateur fireman  he and the celebrated fireman’s dog were observed to be remarkably active at the conflagration of the two houses of parliament—they both ran up and down and in and out getting under people’s feet and into everybody’s way fully impressed with the belief that they were doing a great deal of good and barking tremendously  the dog went quietly back to his kennel with the engine but the gentleman kept up such an incessant noise for some weeks after the occurrence that he became a positive nuisance  as no more parliamentary fires have occurred however and as he has consequently had no more opportunities of writing to the newspapers to relate how by way of preserving pictures he cut them out of their frames and performed other great national services he has gradually relapsed into his old state of calmness  that female in black—not the one whom the lord’sdaybill baronet has just chucked under the chin the shorter of the two—is ‘jane’ the hebe of bellamy’s  jane is as great a character as nicholas in her way  her leading features are a thorough contempt for the great majority of her visitors her predominant quality love of admiration as you cannot fail to observe if you mark the glee with which she listens to something the young member near her mutters somewhat unintelligibly in her ear for his speech is rather thick from some cause or other and how playfully she digs the handle of a fork into the arm with which he detains her by way of reply  jane is no bad hand at repartees and showers them about with a degree of liberality and total absence of reserve or constraint which occasionally excites no small amazement in the minds of strangers  she cuts jokes with nicholas too but looks up to him with a great deal of respect—the immovable stolidity with which nicholas receives the aforesaid jokes and looks on at certain pastoral friskings and rompings jane’s only recreations and they are very innocent too which occasionally take place in the passage is not the least amusing part of his character  the two persons who are seated at the table in the corner at the farther end of the room have been constant guests here for many years past and one of them has feasted within these walls many a time with the most brilliant characters of a brilliant period  he has gone up to the other house since then the greater part of his boon companions have shared yorick’s fate and his visits to bellamy’s are comparatively few  if he really be eating his supper now at what hour can he possibly have dined  a second solid mass of rumpsteak has disappeared and he eat the first in four minutes and three quarters by the clock over the window was there ever such a personification of falstaff  mark the air with which he gloats over that stilton as he removes the napkin which has been placed beneath his chin to catch the superfluous gravy of the steak and with what gusto he imbibes the porter which has been fetched expressly for him in the pewter pot  listen to the hoarse sound of that voice kept down as it is by layers of solids and deep draughts of rich wine and tell us if you ever saw such a perfect picture of a regular gourmand and whether he is not exactly the man whom you would pitch upon as having been the partner of sheridan’s parliamentary carouses the volunteer driver of the hackneycoach that took him home and the involuntary upsetter of the whole party  what an amusing contrast between his voice and appearance and that of the spare squeaking old man who sits at the same table and who elevating a little cracked bantam sort of voice to its highest pitch invokes damnation upon his own eyes or somebody else’s at the commencement of every sentence he utters  ‘the captain’ as they call him is a very old frequenter of bellamy’s much addicted to stopping ‘after the house is up’ an inexpiable crime in jane’s eyes and a complete walking reservoir of spirits and water  the old peer—or rather the old man—for his peerage is of comparatively recent date—has a huge tumbler of hot punch brought him and the other damns and drinks and drinks and damns and smokes  members arrive every moment in a great bustle to report that ‘the chancellor of the exchequer’s up’ and to get glasses of brandyandwater to sustain them during the division people who have ordered supper countermand it and prepare to go downstairs when suddenly a bell is heard to ring with tremendous violence and a cry of ‘division’ is heard in the passage this is enough away rush the members pellmell  the room is cleared in an instant the noise rapidly dies away you hear the creaking of the last boot on the last stair and are left alone with the leviathan of rumpsteaks    chapter xix—public dinners   all public dinners in london from the lord mayor’s annual banquet at guildhall to the chimneysweepers’ anniversary at white conduit house from the goldsmiths’ to the butchers’ from the sheriffs’ to the licensed victuallers’ are amusing scenes  of all entertainments of this description however we think the annual dinner of some public charity is the most amusing  at a company’s dinner the people are nearly all alike—regular old stagers who make it a matter of business and a thing not to be laughed at  at a political dinner everybody is disagreeable and inclined to speechify—much the same thing bythebye but at a charity dinner you see people of all sorts kinds and descriptions  the wine may not be remarkably special to be sure and we have heard some hardhearted monsters grumble at the collection but we really think the amusement to be derived from the occasion sufficient to counterbalance even these disadvantages  let us suppose you are induced to attend a dinner of this description—‘indigent orphans’ friends’ benevolent institution’ we think it is  the name of the charity is a line or two longer but never mind the rest  you have a distinct recollection however that you purchased a ticket at the solicitation of some charitable friend and you deposit yourself in a hackneycoach the driver of which—no doubt that you may do the thing in style—turns a deaf ear to your earnest entreaties to be set down at the corner of great queenstreet and persists in carrying you to the very door of the freemasons’ round which a crowd of people are assembled to witness the entrance of the indigent orphans’ friends  you hear great speculations as you pay the fare on the possibility of your being the noble lord who is announced to fill the chair on the occasion and are highly gratified to hear it eventually decided that you are only a ‘wocalist’  the first thing that strikes you on your entrance is the astonishing importance of the committee  you observe a door on the first landing carefully guarded by two waiters in and out of which stout gentlemen with very red faces keep running with a degree of speed highly unbecoming the gravity of persons of their years and corpulency  you pause quite alarmed at the bustle and thinking in your innocence that two or three people must have been carried out of the diningroom in fits at least  you are immediately undeceived by the waiter—‘upstairs if you please sir this is the committeeroom’  upstairs you go accordingly wondering as you mount what the duties of the committee can be and whether they ever do anything beyond confusing each other and running over the waiters  having deposited your hat and cloak and received a remarkably small scrap of pasteboard in exchange which as a matter of course you lose before you require it again you enter the hall down which there are three long tables for the less distinguished guests with a cross table on a raised platform at the upper end for the reception of the very particular friends of the indigent orphans  being fortunate enough to find a plate without anybody’s card in it you wisely seat yourself at once and have a little leisure to look about you  waiters with winebaskets in their hands are placing decanters of sherry down the tables at very respectable distances melancholylooking saltcellars and decayed vinegarcruets which might have belonged to the parents of the indigent orphans in their time are scattered at distant intervals on the cloth and the knives and forks look as if they had done duty at every public dinner in london since the accession of george the first the musicians are scraping and grating and screwing tremendously—playing no notes but notes of preparation and several gentlemen are gliding along the sides of the tables looking into plate after plate with frantic eagerness the expression of their countenances growing more and more dismal as they meet with everybody’s card but their own  you turn round to take a look at the table behind you and—not being in the habit of attending public dinners—are somewhat struck by the appearance of the party on which your eyes rest  one of its principal members appears to be a little man with a long and rather inflamed face and gray hair brushed bolt upright in front he wears a wisp of black silk round his neck without any stiffener as an apology for a neckerchief and is addressed by his companions by the familiar appellation of ‘fitz’ or some such monosyllable  near him is a stout man in a white neckerchief and buff waistcoat with shining dark hair cut very short in front and a great round healthylooking face on which he studiously preserves a half sentimental simper  next him again is a largeheaded man with black hair and bushy whiskers and opposite them are two or three others one of whom is a little roundfaced person in a dressstock and blue underwaistcoat  there is something peculiar in their air and manner though you could hardly describe what it is you cannot divest yourself of the idea that they have come for some other purpose than mere eating and drinking  you have no time to debate the matter however for the waiters who have been arranged in lines down the room placing the dishes on table retire to the lower end the dark man in the blue coat and bright buttons who has the direction of the music looks up to the gallery and calls out ‘band’ in a very loud voice out burst the orchestra up rise the visitors in march fourteen stewards each with a long wand in his hand like the evil genius in a pantomime then the chairman then the titled visitors they all make their way up the room as fast as they can bowing and smiling and smirking and looking remarkably amiable  the applause ceases grace is said the clatter of plates and dishes begins and every one appears highly gratified either with the presence of the distinguished visitors or the commencement of the anxiouslyexpected dinner  as to the dinner itself—the mere dinner—it goes off much the same everywhere  tureens of soup are emptied with awful rapidity—waiters take plates of turbot away to get lobstersauce and bring back plates of lobstersauce without turbot people who can carve poultry are great fools if they own it and people who can’t have no wish to learn  the knives and forks form a pleasing accompaniment to auber’s music and auber’s music would form a pleasing accompaniment to the dinner if you could hear anything besides the cymbals  the substantials disappear—moulds of jelly vanish like lightning—hearty eaters wipe their foreheads and appear rather overcome by their recent exertions—people who have looked very cross hitherto become remarkably bland and ask you to take wine in the most friendly manner possible—old gentlemen direct your attention to the ladies’ gallery and take great pains to impress you with the fact that the charity is always peculiarly favoured in this respect—every one appears disposed to become talkative—and the hum of conversation is loud and general  ‘pray silence gentlemen if you please for non nobis’ shouts the toastmaster with stentorian lungs—a toastmaster’s shirtfront waistcoat and neckerchief bythebye always exhibit three distinct shades of cloudywhite—‘pray silence gentlemen for non nobis’  the singers whom you discover to be no other than the very party that excited your curiosity at first after ‘pitching’ their voices immediately begin tootooing most dismally on which the regular old stagers burst into occasional cries of—‘sh—sh—waiters—silence waiters—stand still waiters—keep back waiters’ and other exorcisms delivered in a tone of indignant remonstrance  the grace is soon concluded and the company resume their seats  the uninitiated portion of the guests applaud non nobis as vehemently as if it were a capital comic song greatly to the scandal and indignation of the regular diners who immediately attempt to quell this sacrilegious approbation by cries of ‘hush hush’ whereupon the others mistaking these sounds for hisses applaud more tumultuously than before and by way of placing their approval beyond the possibility of doubt shout ‘encore’ most vociferously  the moment the noise ceases up starts the toastmaster—‘gentlemen charge your glasses if you please’  decanters having been handed about and glasses filled the toastmaster proceeds in a regular ascending scale—‘gentlemen—air—you—all charged  pray—silence—gentlemen—for—the chair’  the chairman rises and after stating that he feels it quite unnecessary to preface the toast he is about to propose with any observations whatever wanders into a maze of sentences and flounders about in the most extraordinary manner presenting a lamentable spectacle of mystified humanity until he arrives at the words ‘constitutional sovereign of these realms’ at which elderly gentlemen exclaim ‘bravo’ and hammer the table tremendously with their knifehandles  ‘under any circumstances it would give him the greatest pride it would give him the greatest pleasure—he might almost say it would afford him satisfaction cheers to propose that toast  what must be his feelings then when he has the gratification of announcing that he has received her majesty’s commands to apply to the treasurer of her majesty’s household for her majesty’s annual donation of 25l in aid of the funds of this charity’  this announcement which has been regularly made by every chairman since the first foundation of the charity fortytwo years ago calls forth the most vociferous applause the toast is drunk with a great deal of cheering and knocking and ‘god save the queen’ is sung by the ‘professional gentlemen’ the unprofessional gentlemen joining in the chorus and giving the national anthem an effect which the newspapers with great justice describe as ‘perfectly electrical’  the other ‘loyal and patriotic’ toasts having been drunk with all due enthusiasm a comic song having been well sung by the gentleman with the small neckerchief and a sentimental one by the second of the party we come to the most important toast of the evening—‘prosperity to the charity’  here again we are compelled to adopt newspaper phraseology and to express our regret at being ‘precluded from giving even the substance of the noble lord’s observations’  suffice it to say that the speech which is somewhat of the longest is rapturously received and the toast having been drunk the stewards looking more important than ever leave the room and presently return heading a procession of indigent orphans boys and girls who walk round the room curtseying and bowing and treading on each other’s heels and looking very much as if they would like a glass of wine apiece to the high gratification of the company generally and especially of the lady patronesses in the gallery  exeunt children and reenter stewards each with a blue plate in his hand  the band plays a lively air the majority of the company put their hands in their pockets and look rather serious and the noise of sovereigns rattling on crockery is heard from all parts of the room  after a short interval occupied in singing and toasting the secretary puts on his spectacles and proceeds to read the report and list of subscriptions the latter being listened to with great attention  ‘mr smith one guinea—mr tompkins one guinea—mr wilson one guinea—mr hickson one guinea—mr nixon one guinea—mr charles nixon one guinea—hear hear—mr james nixon one guinea—mr thomas nixon one pound one tremendous applause  lord fitz binkle the chairman of the day in addition to an annual donation of fifteen pounds—thirty guineas prolonged knocking several gentlemen knock the stems off their wineglasses in the vehemence of their approbation  lady fitz binkle in addition to an annual donation of ten pound—twenty pound’ protracted knocking and shouts of ‘bravo’  the list being at length concluded the chairman rises and proposes the health of the secretary than whom he knows no more zealous or estimable individual  the secretary in returning thanks observes that he knows no more excellent individual than the chairman—except the senior officer of the charity whose health he begs to propose  the senior officer in returning thanks observes that he knows no more worthy man than the secretary—except mr walker the auditor whose health he begs to propose  mr walker in returning thanks discovers some other estimable individual to whom alone the senior officer is inferior—and so they go on toasting and lauding and thanking the only other toast of importance being ‘the lady patronesses now present’ on which all the gentlemen turn their faces towards the ladies’ gallery shouting tremendously and little priggish men who have imbibed more wine than usual kiss their hands and exhibit distressing contortions of visage  we have protracted our dinner to so great a length that we have hardly time to add one word by way of grace  we can only entreat our readers not to imagine because we have attempted to extract some amusement from a charity dinner that we are at all disposed to underrate either the excellence of the benevolent institutions with which london abounds or the estimable motives of those who support them    chapter xx—the first of may       ‘now ladies up in the skyparlour only once a year if you please’                                                young lady with brass ladle      ‘sweep—sweep—sweep’                                                          illegal watchword  the first of may  there is a merry freshness in the sound calling to our minds a thousand thoughts of all that is pleasant in nature and beautiful in her most delightful form  what man is there over whose mind a bright spring morning does not exercise a magic influence—carrying him back to the days of his childish sports and conjuring up before him the old green field with its gentlywaving trees where the birds sang as he has never heard them since—where the butterfly fluttered far more gaily than he ever sees him now in all his ramblings—where the sky seemed bluer and the sun shone more brightly—where the air blew more freshly over greener grass and sweetersmelling flowers—where everything wore a richer and more brilliant hue than it is ever dressed in now such are the deep feelings of childhood and such are the impressions which every lovely object stamps upon its heart  the hardy traveller wanders through the maze of thick and pathless woods where the sun’s rays never shone and heaven’s pure air never played he stands on the brink of the roaring waterfall and giddy and bewildered watches the foaming mass as it leaps from stone to stone and from crag to crag he lingers in the fertile plains of a land of perpetual sunshine and revels in the luxury of their balmy breath  but what are the deep forests or the thundering waters or the richest landscapes that bounteous nature ever spread to charm the eyes and captivate the senses of man compared with the recollection of the old scenes of his early youth  magic scenes indeed for the fancies of childhood dressed them in colours brighter than the rainbow and almost as fleeting  in former times spring brought with it not only such associations as these connected with the past but sports and games for the present—merry dances round rustic pillars adorned with emblems of the season and reared in honour of its coming  where are they now  pillars we have but they are no longer rustic ones and as to dancers they are used to rooms and lights and would not show well in the open air think of the immorality too  what would your sabbath enthusiasts say to an aristocratic ring encircling the duke of york’s column in carltonterrace—a grand poussette of the middle classes round alderman waithman’s monument in fleetstreet—or a general handsfourround of tenpound householders at the foot of the obelisk in st george’sfields  alas romance can make no head against the riot act and pastoral simplicity is not understood by the police  well many years ago we began to be a steady and matteroffact sort of people and dancing in spring being beneath our dignity we gave it up and in course of time it descended to the sweeps—a fall certainly because though sweeps are very good fellows in their way and moreover very useful in a civilised community they are not exactly the sort of people to give the tone to the little elegances of society  the sweeps however got the dancing to themselves and they kept it up and handed it down  this was a severe blow to the romance of springtime but it did not entirely destroy it either for a portion of it descended to the sweeps with the dancing and rendered them objects of great interest  a mystery hung over the sweeps in those days  legends were in existence of wealthy gentlemen who had lost children and who after many years of sorrow and suffering had found them in the character of sweeps  stories were related of a young boy who having been stolen from his parents in his infancy and devoted to the occupation of chimneysweeping was sent in the course of his professional career to sweep the chimney of his mother’s bedroom and how being hot and tired when he came out of the chimney he got into the bed he had so often slept in as an infant and was discovered and recognised therein by his mother who once every year of her life thereafter requested the pleasure of the company of every london sweep at halfpast one o’clock to roast beef plumpudding porter and sixpence  such stories as these and there were many such threw an air of mystery round the sweeps and produced for them some of those good effects which animals derive from the doctrine of the transmigration of souls  no one except the masters thought of illtreating a sweep because no one knew who he might be or what nobleman’s or gentleman’s son he might turn out chimneysweeping was by many believers in the marvellous considered as a sort of probationary term at an earlier or later period of which divers young noblemen were to come into possession of their rank and titles and the profession was held by them in great respect accordingly  we remember in our young days a little sweep about our own age with curly hair and white teeth whom we devoutly and sincerely believed to be the lost son and heir of some illustrious personage—an impression which was resolved into an unchangeable conviction on our infant mind by the subject of our speculations informing us one day in reply to our question propounded a few moments before his ascent to the summit of the kitchen chimney ‘that he believed he’d been born in the vurkis but he’d never know’d his father’  we felt certain from that time forth that he would one day be owned by a lord and we never heard the churchbells ring or saw a flag hoisted in the neighbourhood without thinking that the happy event had at last occurred and that his longlost parent had arrived in a coach and six to take him home to grosvenorsquare  he never came however and at the present moment the young gentleman in question is settled down as a master sweep in the neighbourhood of battlebridge his distinguishing characteristics being a decided antipathy to washing himself and the possession of a pair of legs very inadequate to the support of his unwieldy and corpulent body  the romance of spring having gone out before our time we were fain to console ourselves as we best could with the uncertainty that enveloped the birth and parentage of its attendant dancers the sweeps and we did console ourselves with it for many years  but even this wicked source of comfort received a shock from which it has never recovered—a shock which has been in reality its deathblow  we could not disguise from ourselves the fact that whole families of sweeps were regularly born of sweeps in the rural districts of somers town and camden town—that the eldest son succeeded to the father’s business that the other branches assisted him therein and commenced on their own account that their children again were educated to the profession and that about their identity there could be no mistake whatever  we could not be blind we say to this melancholy truth but we could not bring ourselves to admit it nevertheless and we lived on for some years in a state of voluntary ignorance  we were roused from our pleasant slumber by certain dark insinuations thrown out by a friend of ours to the effect that children in the lower ranks of life were beginning to choose chimneysweeping as their particular walk that applications had been made by various boys to the constituted authorities to allow them to pursue the object of their ambition with the full concurrence and sanction of the law that the affair in short was becoming one of mere legal contract  we turned a deaf ear to these rumours at first but slowly and surely they stole upon us  month after month week after week nay day after day at last did we meet with accounts of similar applications  the veil was removed all mystery was at an end and chimneysweeping had become a favourite and chosen pursuit  there is no longer any occasion to steal boys for boys flock in crowds to bind themselves  the romance of the trade has fled and the chimneysweeper of the present day is no more like unto him of thirty years ago than is a fleetstreet pickpocket to a spanish brigand or paul pry to caleb williams  this gradual decay and disuse of the practice of leading noble youths into captivity and compelling them to ascend chimneys was a severe blow if we may so speak to the romance of chimneysweeping and to the romance of spring at the same time  but even this was not all for some few years ago the dancing on mayday began to decline small sweeps were observed to congregate in twos or threes unsupported by a ‘green’ with no ‘my lord’ to act as master of the ceremonies and no ‘my lady’ to preside over the exchequer  even in companies where there was a ‘green’ it was an absolute nothing—a mere sprout—and the instrumental accompaniments rarely extended beyond the shovels and a set of panpipes better known to the many as a ‘mouthorgan’  these were signs of the times portentous omens of a coming change and what was the result which they shadowed forth  why the master sweeps influenced by a restless spirit of innovation actually interposed their authority in opposition to the dancing and substituted a dinner—an anniversary dinner at white conduit house—where clean faces appeared in lieu of black ones smeared with rose pink and knee cords and tops superseded nankeen drawers and rosetted shoes  gentlemen who were in the habit of riding shy horses and steadygoing people who have no vagrancy in their souls lauded this alteration to the skies and the conduct of the master sweeps was described beyond the reach of praise  but how stands the real fact  let any man deny if he can that when the cloth had been removed fresh pots and pipes laid upon the table and the customary loyal and patriotic toasts proposed the celebrated mr sluffen of adamandevecourt whose authority not the most malignant of our opponents can call in question expressed himself in a manner following ‘that now he’d cotcht the cheerman’s hi he vished he might be jolly vell blessed if he worn’t a goin’ to have his innings vich he vould say these here obserwashuns—that how some mischeevus coves as know’d nuffin about the consarn had tried to sit people agin the mas’r swips and take the shine out o’ their bis’nes and the bread out o’ the traps o’ their preshus kids by a makin’ o’ this here remark as chimblies could be as vell svept by ‘sheenery as by boys and that the makin’ use o’ boys for that there purpuss vos barbareous vereas he ’ad been a chummy—he begged the cheerman’s parding for usin’ such a wulgar hexpression—more nor thirty year—he might say he’d been born in a chimbley—and he know’d uncommon vell as ‘sheenery vos vus nor o’ no use and as to kerhewelty to the boys everybody in the chimbley line know’d as vell as he did that they liked the climbin’ better nor nuffin as vos’  from this day we date the total fall of the last lingering remnant of mayday dancing among the élite of the profession and from this period we commence a new era in that portion of our spring associations which relates to the first of may  we are aware that the unthinking part of the population will meet us here with the assertion that dancing on mayday still continues—that ‘greens’ are annually seen to roll along the streets—that youths in the garb of clowns precede them giving vent to the ebullitions of their sportive fancies and that lords and ladies follow in their wake  granted  we are ready to acknowledge that in outward show these processions have greatly improved we do not deny the introduction of solos on the drum we will even go so far as to admit an occasional fantasia on the triangle but here our admissions end  we positively deny that the sweeps have art or part in these proceedings  we distinctly charge the dustmen with throwing what they ought to clear away into the eyes of the public  we accuse scavengers brickmakers and gentlemen who devote their energies to the costermongering line with obtaining money once ayear under false pretences  we cling with peculiar fondness to the custom of days gone by and have shut out conviction as long as we could but it has forced itself upon us and we now proclaim to a deluded public that the mayday dancers are not sweeps  the size of them alone is sufficient to repudiate the idea it is a notorious fact that the widelyspread taste for registerstoves has materially increased the demand for small boys whereas the men who under a fictitious character dance about the streets on the first of may nowadays would be a tight fit in a kitchen flue to say nothing of the parlour  this is strong presumptive evidence but we have positive proof—the evidence of our own senses  and here is our testimony  upon the morning of the second of the merry month of may in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and thirtysix we went out for a stroll with a kind of forlorn hope of seeing something or other which might induce us to believe that it was really spring and not christmas after wandering as far as copenhagen house without meeting anything calculated to dispel our impression that there was a mistake in the almanacks we turned back down maidenlane with the intention of passing through the extensive colony lying between it and battlebridge which is inhabited by proprietors of donkeycarts boilers of horseflesh makers of tiles and sifters of cinders through which colony we should have passed without stoppage or interruption if a little crowd gathered round a shed had not attracted our attention and induced us to pause  when we say a ‘shed’ we do not mean the conservatory sort of building which according to the old song love tenanted when he was a young man but a wooden house with windows stuffed with rags and paper and a small yard at the side with one dustcart two baskets a few shovels and little heaps of cinders and fragments of china and tiles scattered about it  before this inviting spot we paused and the longer we looked the more we wondered what exciting circumstance it could be that induced the foremost members of the crowd to flatten their noses against the parlour window in the vain hope of catching a glimpse of what was going on inside  after staring vacantly about us for some minutes we appealed touching the cause of this assemblage to a gentleman in a suit of tarpaulin who was smoking his pipe on our right hand but as the only answer we obtained was a playful inquiry whether our mother had disposed of her mangle we determined to await the issue in silence  judge of our virtuous indignation when the streetdoor of the shed opened and a party emerged therefrom clad in the costume and emulating the appearance of mayday sweeps  the first person who appeared was ‘my lord’ habited in a blue coat and bright buttons with gilt paper tacked over the seams yellow kneebreeches pink cotton stockings and shoes a cocked hat ornamented with shreds of variouscoloured paper on his head a bouquet the size of a prize cauliflower in his buttonhole a long belcher handkerchief in his right hand and a thin cane in his left  a murmur of applause ran through the crowd which was chiefly composed of his lordship’s personal friends when this graceful figure made his appearance which swelled into a burst of applause as his fair partner in the dance bounded forth to join him  her ladyship was attired in pink crape over bedfurniture with a low body and short sleeves  the symmetry of her ankles was partially concealed by a very perceptible pair of frilled trousers and the inconvenience which might have resulted from the circumstance of her white satin shoes being a few sizes too large was obviated by their being firmly attached to her legs with strong tape sandals  her head was ornamented with a profusion of artificial flowers and in her hand she bore a large brass ladle wherein to receive what she figuratively denominated ‘the tin’  the other characters were a young gentleman in girl’s clothes and a widow’s cap two clowns who walked upon their hands in the mud to the immeasurable delight of all the spectators a man with a drum another man with a flageolet a dirty woman in a large shawl with a box under her arm for the money—and last though not least the ‘green’ animated by no less a personage than our identical friend in the tarpaulin suit  the man hammered away at the drum the flageolet squeaked the shovels rattled the ‘green’ rolled about pitching first on one side and then on the other my lady threw her right foot over her left ankle and her left foot over her right ankle alternately my lord ran a few paces forward and butted at the ‘green’ and then a few paces backward upon the toes of the crowd and then went to the right and then to the left and then dodged my lady round the ‘green’ and finally drew her arm through his and called upon the boys to shout which they did lustily—for this was the dancing  we passed the same group accidentally in the evening  we never saw a ‘green’ so drunk a lord so quarrelsome no not even in the house of peers after dinner a pair of clowns so melancholy a lady so muddy or a party so miserable  how has mayday decayed    chapter xxi—brokers’ and marinestore shops   when we affirm that brokers’ shops are strange places and that if an authentic history of their contents could be procured it would furnish many a page of amusement and many a melancholy tale it is necessary to explain the class of shops to which we allude  perhaps when we make use of the term ‘brokers’ shop’ the minds of our readers will at once picture large handsome warehouses exhibiting a long perspective of frenchpolished diningtables rosewood chiffoniers and mahogany washhandstands with an occasional vista of a fourpost bedstead and hangings and an appropriate foreground of diningroom chairs  perhaps they will imagine that we mean an humble class of secondhand furniture repositories  their imagination will then naturally lead them to that street at the back of longacre which is composed almost entirely of brokers’ shops where you walk through groves of deceitful showylooking furniture and where the prospect is occasionally enlivened by a bright red blue and yellow hearthrug embellished with the pleasing device of a mailcoach at full speed or a strange animal supposed to have been originally intended for a dog with a mass of worstedwork in his mouth which conjecture has likened to a basket of flowers  this bythebye is a tempting article to young wives in the humbler ranks of life who have a firstfloor front to furnish—they are lost in admiration and hardly know which to admire most  the dog is very beautiful but they have a dog already on the best teatray and two more on the mantelpiece  then there is something so genteel about that mailcoach and the passengers outside who are all hat give it such an air of reality  the goods here are adapted to the taste or rather to the means of cheap purchasers  there are some of the most beautiful looking pembroke tables that were ever beheld the wood as green as the trees in the park and the leaves almost as certain to fall off in the course of a year there is also a most extensive assortment of tent and turnup bedsteads made of stained wood and innumerable specimens of that base imposition on society—a sofa bedstead  a turnup bedstead is a blunt honest piece of furniture it may be slightly disguised with a sham drawer and sometimes a mad attempt is even made to pass it off for a bookcase ornament it as you will however the turnup bedstead seems to defy disguise and to insist on having it distinctly understood that he is a turnup bedstead and nothing else—that he is indispensably necessary and that being so useful he disdains to be ornamental  how different is the demeanour of a sofa bedstead  ashamed of its real use it strives to appear an article of luxury and gentility—an attempt in which it miserably fails  it has neither the respectability of a sofa nor the virtues of a bed every man who keeps a sofa bedstead in his house becomes a party to a wilful and designing fraud—we question whether you could insult him more than by insinuating that you entertain the least suspicion of its real use  to return from this digression we beg to say that neither of these classes of brokers’ shops forms the subject of this sketch  the shops to which we advert are immeasurably inferior to those on whose outward appearance we have slightly touched  our readers must often have observed in some bystreet in a poor neighbourhood a small dirty shop exposing for sale the most extraordinary and confused jumble of old wornout wretched articles that can well be imagined  our wonder at their ever having been bought is only to be equalled by our astonishment at the idea of their ever being sold again  on a board at the side of the door are placed about twenty books—all odd volumes and as many wineglasses—all different patterns several locks an old earthenware pan full of rusty keys two or three gaudy chimneyornaments—cracked of course the remains of a lustre without any drops a round frame like a capital o which has once held a mirror a flute complete with the exception of the middle joint a pair of curlingirons and a tinderbox in front of the shopwindow are ranged some halfdozen highbacked chairs with spinal complaints and wasted legs a corner cupboard two or three very dark mahogany tables with flaps like mathematical problems some picklejars some surgeons’ ditto with gilt labels and without stoppers an unframed portrait of some lady who flourished about the beginning of the thirteenth century by an artist who never flourished at all an incalculable host of miscellanies of every description including bottles and cabinets rags and bones fenders and streetdoor knockers fireirons wearing apparel and bedding a halllamp and a roomdoor imagine in addition to this incongruous mass a black doll in a white frock with two faces—one looking up the street and the other looking down swinging over the door a board with the squeezedup inscription ‘dealer in marine stores’ in lanky white letters whose height is strangely out of proportion to their width and you have before you precisely the kind of shop to which we wish to direct your attention  although the same heterogeneous mixture of things will be found at all these places it is curious to observe how truly and accurately some of the minor articles which are exposed for sale—articles of wearing apparel for instance—mark the character of the neighbourhood  take drurylane and coventgarden for example  this is essentially a theatrical neighbourhood  there is not a potboy in the vicinity who is not to a greater or less extent a dramatic character  the errandboys and chandler’sshopkeepers’ sons are all stagestruck they ‘gets up’ plays in back kitchens hired for the purpose and will stand before a shopwindow for hours contemplating a great staring portrait of mr somebody or other of the royal coburg theatre ‘as he appeared in the character of tongo the denounced’  the consequence is that there is not a marinestore shop in the neighbourhood which does not exhibit for sale some faded articles of dramatic finery such as three or four pairs of soiled buff boots with turnover red tops heretofore worn by a ‘fourth robber’ or ‘fifth mob’ a pair of rusty broadswords a few gauntlets and certain resplendent ornaments which if they were yellow instead of white might be taken for insurance plates of the sun fireoffice  there are several of these shops in the narrow streets and dirty courts of which there are so many near the national theatres and they all have tempting goods of this description with the addition perhaps of a lady’s pink dress covered with spangles white wreaths stage shoes and a tiara like a tin lamp reflector  they have been purchased of some wretched supernumeraries or sixthrate actors and are now offered for the benefit of the rising generation who on condition of making certain weekly payments amounting in the whole to about ten times their value may avail themselves of such desirable bargains  let us take a very different quarter and apply it to the same test look at a marinestore dealer’s in that reservoir of dirt drunkenness and drabs thieves oysters baked potatoes and pickled salmon—ratcliffhighway  here the wearing apparel is all nautical rough blue jackets with motherofpearl buttons oilskin hats coarse checked shirts and large canvas trousers that look as if they were made for a pair of bodies instead of a pair of legs are the staple commodities  then there are large bunches of cotton pockethandkerchiefs in colour and pattern unlike any one ever saw before with the exception of those on the backs of the three young ladies without bonnets who passed just now  the furniture is much the same as elsewhere with the addition of one or two models of ships and some old prints of naval engagements in still older frames  in the window are a few compasses a small tray containing silver watches in clumsy thick cases and tobaccoboxes the lid of each ornamented with a ship or an anchor or some such trophy  a sailor generally pawns or sells all he has before he has been long ashore and if he does not some favoured companion kindly saves him the trouble  in either case it is an even chance that he afterwards unconsciously repurchases the same things at a higher price than he gave for them at first  again pay a visit with a similar object to a part of london as unlike both of these as they are to each other  cross over to the surrey side and look at such shops of this description as are to be found near the king’s bench prison and in ‘the rules’  how different and how strikingly illustrative of the decay of some of the unfortunate residents in this part of the metropolis  imprisonment and neglect have done their work  there is contamination in the profligate denizens of a debtor’s prison old friends have fallen off the recollection of former prosperity has passed away and with it all thoughts for the past all care for the future  first watches and rings then cloaks coats and all the more expensive articles of dress have found their way to the pawnbroker’s  that miserable resource has failed at last and the sale of some trifling article at one of these shops has been the only mode left of raising a shilling or two to meet the urgent demands of the moment  dressingcases and writingdesks too old to pawn but too good to keep guns fishingrods musical instruments all in the same condition have first been sold and the sacrifice has been but slightly felt  but hunger must be allayed and what has already become a habit is easily resorted to when an emergency arises  light articles of clothing first of the ruined man then of his wife at last of their children even of the youngest have been parted with piecemeal  there they are thrown carelessly together until a purchaser presents himself old and patched and repaired it is true but the make and materials tell of better days and the older they are the greater the misery and destitution of those whom they once adorned    chapter xxii—ginshops   it is a remarkable circumstance that different trades appear to partake of the disease to which elephants and dogs are especially liable and to run stark staring raving mad periodically  the great distinction between the animals and the trades is that the former run mad with a certain degree of propriety—they are very regular in their irregularities  we know the period at which the emergency will arise and provide against it accordingly  if an elephant run mad we are all ready for him—kill or cure—pills or bullets calomel in conserve of roses or lead in a musketbarrel  if a dog happen to look unpleasantly warm in the summer months and to trot about the shady side of the streets with a quarter of a yard of tongue hanging out of his mouth a thick leather muzzle which has been previously prepared in compliance with the thoughtful injunctions of the legislature is instantly clapped over his head by way of making him cooler and he either looks remarkably unhappy for the next six weeks or becomes legally insane and goes mad as it were by act of parliament  but these trades are as eccentric as comets nay worse for no one can calculate on the recurrence of the strange appearances which betoken the disease moreover the contagion is general and the quickness with which it diffuses itself almost incredible  we will cite two or three cases in illustration of our meaning  six or eight years ago the epidemic began to display itself among the linendrapers and haberdashers  the primary symptoms were an inordinate love of plateglass and a passion for gaslights and gilding  the disease gradually progressed and at last attained a fearful height quiet dusty old shops in different parts of town were pulled down spacious premises with stuccoed fronts and gold letters were erected instead floors were covered with turkey carpets roofs supported by massive pillars doors knocked into windows a dozen squares of glass into one one shopman into a dozen and there is no knowing what would have been done if it had not been fortunately discovered just in time that the commissioners of bankruptcy were as competent to decide such cases as the commissioners of lunacy and that a little confinement and gentle examination did wonders  the disease abated  it died away  a year or two of comparative tranquillity ensued  suddenly it burst out again amongst the chemists the symptoms were the same with the addition of a strong desire to stick the royal arms over the shopdoor and a great rage for mahogany varnish and expensive floorcloth  then the hosiers were infected and began to pull down their shopfronts with frantic recklessness  the mania again died away and the public began to congratulate themselves on its entire disappearance when it burst forth with tenfold violence among the publicans and keepers of ‘wine vaults’ from that moment it has spread among them with unprecedented rapidity exhibiting a concatenation of all the previous symptoms onward it has rushed to every part of town knocking down all the old publichouses and depositing splendid mansions stone balustrades rosewood fittings immense lamps and illuminated clocks at the corner of every street  the extensive scale on which these places are established and the ostentatious manner in which the business of even the smallest among them is divided into branches is amusing  a handsome plate of ground glass in one door directs you ‘to the countinghouse’ another to the ‘bottle department a third to the ‘wholesale department’ a fourth to ‘the wine promenade’ and so forth until we are in daily expectation of meeting with a ‘brandy bell’ or a ‘whiskey entrance’  then ingenuity is exhausted in devising attractive titles for the different descriptions of gin and the dramdrinking portion of the community as they gaze upon the gigantic black and white announcements which are only to be equalled in size by the figures beneath them are left in a state of pleasing hesitation between ‘the cream of the valley’ ‘the out and out’ ‘the no mistake’ ‘the good for mixing’ ‘the real knockmedown’ ‘the celebrated butter gin’ ‘the regular flareup’ and a dozen other equally inviting and wholesome liqueurs  although places of this description are to be met with in every second street they are invariably numerous and splendid in precise proportion to the dirt and poverty of the surrounding neighbourhood  the ginshops in and near drurylane holborn st giles’s coventgarden and claremarket are the handsomest in london  there is more of filth and squalid misery near those great thoroughfares than in any part of this mighty city  we will endeavour to sketch the bar of a large ginshop and its ordinary customers for the edification of such of our readers as may not have had opportunities of observing such scenes and on the chance of finding one well suited to our purpose we will make for drurylane through the narrow streets and dirty courts which divide it from oxfordstreet and that classical spot adjoining the brewery at the bottom of tottenhamcourtroad best known to the initiated as the ‘rookery’  the filthy and miserable appearance of this part of london can hardly be imagined by those and there are many such who have not witnessed it wretched houses with broken windows patched with rags and paper every room let out to a different family and in many instances to two or even three—fruit and ‘sweetstuff’ manufacturers in the cellars barbers and redherring vendors in the front parlours cobblers in the back a birdfancier in the first floor three families on the second starvation in the attics irishmen in the passage a ‘musician’ in the front kitchen and a charwoman and five hungry children in the back one—filth everywhere—a gutter before the houses and a drain behind—clothes drying and slops emptying from the windows girls of fourteen or fifteen with matted hair walking about barefoot and in white greatcoats almost their only covering boys of all ages in coats of all sizes and no coats at all men and women in every variety of scanty and dirty apparel lounging scolding drinking smoking squabbling fighting and swearing  you turn the corner  what a change  all is light and brilliancy  the hum of many voices issues from that splendid ginshop which forms the commencement of the two streets opposite and the gay building with the fantastically ornamented parapet the illuminated clock the plateglass windows surrounded by stucco rosettes and its profusion of gaslights in richlygilt burners is perfectly dazzling when contrasted with the darkness and dirt we have just left  the interior is even gayer than the exterior  a bar of frenchpolished mahogany elegantly carved extends the whole width of the place and there are two sideaisles of great casks painted green and gold enclosed within a light brass rail and bearing such inscriptions as ‘old tom 549’ ‘young tom 360’ ‘samson 1421’—the figures agreeing we presume with ‘gallons’ understood beyond the bar is a lofty and spacious saloon full of the same enticing vessels with a gallery running round it equally well furnished  on the counter in addition to the usual spirit apparatus are two or three little baskets of cakes and biscuits which are carefully secured at top with wickerwork to prevent their contents being unlawfully abstracted behind it are two showilydressed damsels with large necklaces dispensing the spirits and ‘compounds’  they are assisted by the ostensible proprietor of the concern a stout coarse fellow in a fur cap put on very much on one side to give him a knowing air and to display his sandy whiskers to the best advantage  the two old washerwomen who are seated on the little bench to the left of the bar are rather overcome by the headdresses and haughty demeanour of the young ladies who officiate  they receive their halfquartern of gin and peppermint with considerable deference prefacing a request for ‘one of them soft biscuits’ with a ‘jist be good enough ma’am’  they are quite astonished at the impudent air of the young fellow in a brown coat and bright buttons who ushering in his two companions and walking up to the bar in as careless a manner as if he had been used to green and gold ornaments all his life winks at one of the young ladies with singular coolness and calls for a ‘kervorten and a threeoutglass’ just as if the place were his own  ‘gin for you sir’ says the young lady when she has drawn it carefully looking every way but the right one to show that the wink had no effect upon her  ‘for me mary my dear’ replies the gentleman in brown  ‘my name an’t mary as it happens’ says the young girl rather relaxing as she delivers the change  ‘well if it an’t it ought to be’ responds the irresistible one ‘all the marys as ever i see was handsome gals’  here the young lady not precisely remembering how blushes are managed in such cases abruptly ends the flirtation by addressing the female in the faded feathers who has just entered and who after stating explicitly to prevent any subsequent misunderstanding that ‘this gentleman pays’ calls for ‘a glass of port wine and a bit of sugar’  those two old men who came in ‘just to have a drain’ finished their third quartern a few seconds ago they have made themselves crying drunk and the fat comfortablelooking elderly women who had ‘a glass of rumsrub’ each having chimed in with their complaints on the hardness of the times one of the women has agreed to stand a glass round jocularly observing that ‘grief never mended no broken bones and as good people’s wery scarce what i says is make the most on ’em and that’s all about it’ a sentiment which appears to afford unlimited satisfaction to those who have nothing to pay  it is growing late and the throng of men women and children who have been constantly going in and out dwindles down to two or three occasional stragglers—cold wretchedlooking creatures in the last stage of emaciation and disease  the knot of irish labourers at the lower end of the place who have been alternately shaking hands with and threatening the life of each other for the last hour become furious in their disputes and finding it impossible to silence one man who is particularly anxious to adjust the difference they resort to the expedient of knocking him down and jumping on him afterwards  the man in the fur cap and the potboy rush out a scene of riot and confusion ensues half the irishmen get shut out and the other half get shut in the potboy is knocked among the tubs in no time the landlord hits everybody and everybody hits the landlord the barmaids scream the police come in the rest is a confused mixture of arms legs staves torn coats shouting and struggling  some of the party are borne off to the stationhouse and the remainder slink home to beat their wives for complaining and kick the children for daring to be hungry  we have sketched this subject very slightly not only because our limits compel us to do so but because if it were pursued farther it would be painful and repulsive  welldisposed gentlemen and charitable ladies would alike turn with coldness and disgust from a description of the drunken besotted men and wretched brokendown miserable women who form no inconsiderable portion of the frequenters of these haunts forgetting in the pleasant consciousness of their own rectitude the poverty of the one and the temptation of the other  gindrinking is a great vice in england but wretchedness and dirt are a greater and until you improve the homes of the poor or persuade a halffamished wretch not to seek relief in the temporary oblivion of his own misery with the pittance which divided among his family would furnish a morsel of bread for each ginshops will increase in number and splendour  if temperance societies would suggest an antidote against hunger filth and foul air or could establish dispensaries for the gratuitous distribution of bottles of lethewater ginpalaces would be numbered among the things that were    chapter xxiii—the pawnbroker’s shop   of the numerous receptacles for misery and distress with which the streets of london unhappily abound there are perhaps none which present such striking scenes as the pawnbrokers’ shops  the very nature and description of these places occasions their being but little known except to the unfortunate beings whose profligacy or misfortune drives them to seek the temporary relief they offer  the subject may appear at first sight to be anything but an inviting one but we venture on it nevertheless in the hope that as far as the limits of our present paper are concerned it will present nothing to disgust even the most fastidious reader  there are some pawnbrokers’ shops of a very superior description  there are grades in pawning as in everything else and distinctions must be observed even in poverty  the aristocratic spanish cloak and the plebeian calico shirt the silver fork and the flat iron the muslin cravat and the belcher neckerchief would but ill assort together so the better sort of pawnbroker calls himself a silversmith and decorates his shop with handsome trinkets and expensive jewellery while the more humble moneylender boldly advertises his calling and invites observation  it is with pawnbrokers’ shops of the latter class that we have to do  we have selected one for our purpose and will endeavour to describe it  the pawnbroker’s shop is situated near drurylane at the corner of a court which affords a side entrance for the accommodation of such customers as may be desirous of avoiding the observation of the passersby or the chance of recognition in the public street  it is a low dirtylooking dusty shop the door of which stands always doubtfully a little way open half inviting half repelling the hesitating visitor who if he be as yet uninitiated examines one of the old garnet brooches in the window for a minute or two with affected eagerness as if he contemplated making a purchase and then looking cautiously round to ascertain that no one watches him hastily slinks in the door closing of itself after him to just its former width  the shop front and the windowframes bear evident marks of having been once painted but what the colour was originally or at what date it was probably laid on are at this remote period questions which may be asked but cannot be answered  tradition states that the transparency in the front door which displays at night three red balls on a blue ground once bore also inscribed in graceful waves the words ‘money advanced on plate jewels wearing apparel and every description of property’ but a few illegible hieroglyphics are all that now remain to attest the fact the plate and jewels would seem to have disappeared together with the announcement for the articles of stock which are displayed in some profusion in the window do not include any very valuable luxuries of either kind  a few old china cups some modern vases adorned with paltry paintings of three spanish cavaliers playing three spanish guitars or a party of boors carousing each boor with one leg painfully elevated in the air by way of expressing his perfect freedom and gaiety several sets of chessmen two or three flutes a few fiddles a roundeyed portrait staring in astonishment from a very dark ground some gaudilybound prayerbooks and testaments two rows of silver watches quite as clumsy and almost as large as ferguson’s first numerous oldfashioned table and tea spoons displayed fanlike in halfdozens strings of coral with great broad gilt snaps cards of rings and brooches fastened and labelled separately like the insects in the british museum cheap silver penholders and snuffboxes with a masonic star complete the jewellery department while five or six beds in smeary clouded ticks strings of blankets and sheets silk and cotton handkerchiefs and wearing apparel of every description form the more useful though even less ornamental part of the articles exposed for sale  an extensive collection of planes chisels saws and other carpenters’ tools which have been pledged and never redeemed form the foreground of the picture while the large frames full of ticketed bundles which are dimly seen through the dirty casement upstairs—the squalid neighbourhood—the adjoining houses straggling shrunken and rotten with one or two filthy unwholesomelooking heads thrust out of every window and old red pans and stunted plants exposed on the tottering parapets to the manifest hazard of the heads of the passersby—the noisy men loitering under the archway at the corner of the court or about the ginshop next door—and their wives patiently standing on the curbstone with large baskets of cheap vegetables slung round them for sale are its immediate auxiliaries  if the outside of the pawnbroker’s shop be calculated to attract the attention or excite the interest of the speculative pedestrian its interior cannot fail to produce the same effect in an increased degree the front door which we have before noticed opens into the common shop which is the resort of all those customers whose habitual acquaintance with such scenes renders them indifferent to the observation of their companions in poverty  the side door opens into a small passage from which some halfdozen doors which may be secured on the inside by bolts open into a corresponding number of little dens or closets which face the counter  here the more timid or respectable portion of the crowd shroud themselves from the notice of the remainder and patiently wait until the gentleman behind the counter with the curly black hair diamond ring and double silver watchguard shall feel disposed to favour them with his notice—a consummation which depends considerably on the temper of the aforesaid gentleman for the time being  at the present moment this elegantlyattired individual is in the act of entering the duplicate he has just made out in a thick book a process from which he is diverted occasionally by a conversation he is carrying on with another young man similarly employed at a little distance from him whose allusions to ‘that last bottle of sodawater last night’ and ‘how regularly round my hat he felt himself when the young ’ooman gave ’em in charge’ would appear to refer to the consequences of some stolen joviality of the preceding evening  the customers generally however seem unable to participate in the amusement derivable from this source for an old sallowlooking woman who has been leaning with both arms on the counter with a small bundle before her for half an hour previously suddenly interrupts the conversation by addressing the jewelled shopman—‘now mr henry do make haste there’s a good soul for my two grandchildren’s locked up at home and i’m afeer’d of the fire’  the shopman slightly raises his head with an air of deep abstraction and resumes his entry with as much deliberation as if he were engraving ‘you’re in a hurry mrs tatham this ev’nin’ an’t you’ is the only notice he deigns to take after the lapse of five minutes or so  ‘yes i am indeed mr henry now do serve me next there’s a good creetur  i wouldn’t worry you only it’s all along o’ them botherin’ children’ ‘what have you got here’ inquires the shopman unpinning the bundle—‘old concern i suppose—pair o’ stays and a petticut  you must look up somethin’ else old ’ooman i can’t lend you anything more upon them they’re completely worn out by this time if it’s only by putting in and taking out again three times a week’  ‘oh you’re a rum un you are’ replies the old woman laughing extremely as in duty bound ‘i wish i’d got the gift of the gab like you see if i’d be up the spout so often then  no no it an’t the petticut it’s a child’s frock and a beautiful silk ankecher as belongs to my husband  he gave four shillin’ for it the werry same blessed day as he broke his arm’—‘what do you want upon these’ inquires mr henry slightly glancing at the articles which in all probability are old acquaintances  ‘what do you want upon these’—‘eighteenpence’—‘lend you ninepence’—‘oh make it a shillin’ there’s a dear—do now’—‘not another farden’—‘well i suppose i must take it’  the duplicate is made out one ticket pinned on the parcel the other given to the old woman the parcel is flung carelessly down into a corner and some other customer prefers his claim to be served without further delay  the choice falls on an unshaven dirty sottishlooking fellow whose tarnished papercap stuck negligently over one eye communicates an additionally repulsive expression to his very uninviting countenance  he was enjoying a little relaxation from his sedentary pursuits a quarter of an hour ago in kicking his wife up the court  he has come to redeem some tools—probably to complete a job with on account of which he has already received some money if his inflamed countenance and drunken staggers may be taken as evidence of the fact  having waited some little time he makes his presence known by venting his illhumour on a ragged urchin who being unable to bring his face on a level with the counter by any other process has employed himself in climbing up and then hooking himself on with his elbows—an uneasy perch from which he has fallen at intervals generally alighting on the toes of the person in his immediate vicinity  in the present case the unfortunate little wretch has received a cuff which sends him reeling to this door and the donor of the blow is immediately the object of general indignation  ‘what do you strike the boy for you brute’ exclaims a slipshod woman with two flat irons in a little basket  ‘do you think he’s your wife you willin’  ‘go and hang yourself’ replies the gentleman addressed with a drunken look of savage stupidity aiming at the same time a blow at the woman which fortunately misses its object  ‘go and hang yourself and wait till i come and cut you down’—‘cut you down’ rejoins the woman ‘i wish i had the cutting of you up you wagabond loud  oh you precious wagabond rather louder  where’s your wife you willin louder still women of this class are always sympathetic and work themselves into a tremendous passion on the shortest notice  your poor dear wife as you uses worser nor a dog—strike a woman—you a man very shrill i wish i had you—i’d murder you i would if i died for it’—‘now be civil’ retorts the man fiercely  ‘be civil you wiper’ ejaculates the woman contemptuously  ‘an’t it shocking’ she continues turning round and appealing to an old woman who is peeping out of one of the little closets we have before described and who has not the slightest objection to join in the attack possessing as she does the comfortable conviction that she is bolted in  ‘ain’t it shocking ma’am dreadful says the old woman in a parenthesis not exactly knowing what the question refers to  he’s got a wife ma’am as takes in mangling and is as ’dustrious and hardworking a young ’ooman as can be very fast as lives in the back parlour of our ’ous which my husband and me lives in the front one with great rapidity—and we hears him a beaten’ on her sometimes when he comes home drunk the whole night through and not only a beaten’ her but beaten’ his own child too to make her more miserable—ugh you beast and she poor creater won’t swear the peace agin him nor do nothin’ because she likes the wretch arter all—worse luck’  here as the woman has completely run herself out of breath the pawnbroker himself who has just appeared behind the counter in a gray dressinggown embraces the favourable opportunity of putting in a word—‘now i won’t have none of this sort of thing on my premises’ he interposes with an air of authority  ‘mrs mackin keep yourself to yourself or you don’t get fourpence for a flat iron here and jinkins you leave your ticket here till you’re sober and send your wife for them two planes for i won’t have you in my shop at no price so make yourself scarce before i make you scarcer’  this eloquent address produces anything but the effect desired the women rail in concert the man hits about him in all directions and is in the act of establishing an indisputable claim to gratuitous lodgings for the night when the entrance of his wife a wretched wornout woman apparently in the last stage of consumption whose face bears evident marks of recent illusage and whose strength seems hardly equal to the burden—light enough god knows—of the thin sickly child she carries in her arms turns his cowardly rage in a safer direction  ‘come home dear’ cries the miserable creature in an imploring tone ‘do come home there’s a good fellow and go to bed’—‘go home yourself’ rejoins the furious ruffian  ‘do come home quietly’ repeats the wife bursting into tears  ‘go home yourself’ retorts the husband again enforcing his argument by a blow which sends the poor creature flying out of the shop her ‘natural protector’ follows her up the court alternately venting his rage in accelerating her progress and in knocking the little scanty blue bonnet of the unfortunate child over its still more scanty and fadedlooking face  in the last box which is situated in the darkest and most obscure corner of the shop considerably removed from either of the gaslights are a young delicate girl of about twenty and an elderly female evidently her mother from the resemblance between them who stand at some distance back as if to avoid the observation even of the shopman  it is not their first visit to a pawnbroker’s shop for they answer without a moment’s hesitation the usual questions put in a rather respectful manner and in a much lower tone than usual of ‘what name shall i say—your own property of course—where do you live—housekeeper or lodger’  they bargain too for a higher loan than the shopman is at first inclined to offer which a perfect stranger would be little disposed to do and the elder female urges her daughter on in scarcely audible whispers to exert her utmost powers of persuasion to obtain an advance of the sum and expatiate on the value of the articles they have brought to raise a present supply upon  they are a small gold chain and a ‘forget me not’ ring the girl’s property for they are both too small for the mother given her in better times prized perhaps once for the giver’s sake but parted with now without a struggle for want has hardened the mother and her example has hardened the girl and the prospect of receiving money coupled with a recollection of the misery they have both endured from the want of it—the coldness of old friends—the stern refusal of some and the still more galling compassion of others—appears to have obliterated the consciousness of selfhumiliation which the idea of their present situation would once have aroused  in the next box is a young female whose attire miserably poor but extremely gaudy wretchedly cold but extravagantly fine too plainly bespeaks her station  the rich satin gown with its faded trimmings the wornout thin shoes and pink silk stockings the summer bonnet in winter and the sunken face where a daub of rouge only serves as an index to the ravages of squandered health never to be regained and lost happiness never to be restored and where the practised smile is a wretched mockery of the misery of the heart cannot be mistaken  there is something in the glimpse she has just caught of her young neighbour and in the sight of the little trinkets she has offered in pawn that seems to have awakened in this woman’s mind some slumbering recollection and to have changed for an instant her whole demeanour  her first hasty impulse was to bend forward as if to scan more minutely the appearance of her halfconcealed companions her next on seeing them involuntarily shrink from her to retreat to the back of the box cover her face with her hands and burst into tears  there are strange chords in the human heart which will lie dormant through years of depravity and wickedness but which will vibrate at last to some slight circumstance apparently trivial in itself but connected by some undefined and indistinct association with past days that can never be recalled and with bitter recollections from which the most degraded creature in existence cannot escape  there has been another spectator in the person of a woman in the common shop the lowest of the low dirty unbonneted flaunting and slovenly her curiosity was at first attracted by the little she could see of the group then her attention  the halfintoxicated leer changed to an expression of something like interest and a feeling similar to that we have described appeared for a moment and only a moment to extend itself even to her bosom  who shall say how soon these women may change places  the last has but two more stages—the hospital and the grave  how many females situated as her two companions are and as she may have been once have terminated the same wretched course in the same wretched manner  one is already tracing her footsteps with frightful rapidity  how soon may the other follow her example  how many have done the same    chapter xxiv—criminal courts   we shall never forget the mingled feelings of awe and respect with which we used to gaze on the exterior of newgate in our schoolboy days  how dreadful its rough heavy walls and low massive doors appeared to us—the latter looking as if they were made for the express purpose of letting people in and never letting them out again  then the fetters over the debtors’ door which we used to think were a bonâ fide set of irons just hung up there for convenience’ sake ready to be taken down at a moment’s notice and riveted on the limbs of some refractory felon  we were never tired of wondering how the hackneycoachmen on the opposite stand could cut jokes in the presence of such horrors and drink pots of halfandhalf so near the last drop  often have we strayed here in sessions time to catch a glimpse of the whippingplace and that dark building on one side of the yard in which is kept the gibbet with all its dreadful apparatus and on the door of which we half expected to see a brass plate with the inscription ‘mr ketch’ for we never imagined that the distinguished functionary could by possibility live anywhere else  the days of these childish dreams have passed away and with them many other boyish ideas of a gayer nature but we still retain so much of our original feeling that to this hour we never pass the building without something like a shudder  what london pedestrian is there who has not at some time or other cast a hurried glance through the wicket at which prisoners are admitted into this gloomy mansion and surveyed the few objects he could discern with an indescribable feeling of curiosity  the thick door plated with iron and mounted with spikes just low enough to enable you to see leaning over them an illlooking fellow in a broadbrimmed hat belcher handkerchief and topboots with a brown coat something between a greatcoat and a ‘sporting’ jacket on his back and an immense key in his left hand  perhaps you are lucky enough to pass just as the gate is being opened then you see on the other side of the lodge another gate the image of its predecessor and two or three more turnkeys who look like multiplications of the first one seated round a fire which just lights up the whitewashed apartment sufficiently to enable you to catch a hasty glimpse of these different objects  we have a great respect for mrs fry but she certainly ought to have written more romances than mrs radcliffe  we were walking leisurely down the old bailey some time ago when as we passed this identical gate it was opened by the officiating turnkey  we turned quickly round as a matter of course and saw two persons descending the steps  we could not help stopping and observing them  they were an elderly woman of decent appearance though evidently poor and a boy of about fourteen or fifteen  the woman was crying bitterly she carried a small bundle in her hand and the boy followed at a short distance behind her  their little history was obvious  the boy was her son to whose early comfort she had perhaps sacrificed her own—for whose sake she had borne misery without repining and poverty without a murmur—looking steadily forward to the time when he who had so long witnessed her struggles for himself might be enabled to make some exertions for their joint support  he had formed dissolute connexions idleness had led to crime and he had been committed to take his trial for some petty theft  he had been long in prison and after receiving some trifling additional punishment had been ordered to be discharged that morning  it was his first offence and his poor old mother still hoping to reclaim him had been waiting at the gate to implore him to return home  we cannot forget the boy he descended the steps with a dogged look shaking his head with an air of bravado and obstinate determination they walked a few paces and paused  the woman put her hand upon his shoulder in an agony of entreaty and the boy sullenly raised his head as if in refusal  it was a brilliant morning and every object looked fresh and happy in the broad gay sunlight he gazed round him for a few moments bewildered with the brightness of the scene for it was long since he had beheld anything save the gloomy walls of a prison  perhaps the wretchedness of his mother made some impression on the boy’s heart perhaps some undefined recollection of the time when he was a happy child and she his only friend and best companion crowded on him—he burst into tears and covering his face with one hand and hurriedly placing the other in his mother’s walked away with her  curiosity has occasionally led us into both courts at the old bailey nothing is so likely to strike the person who enters them for the first time as the calm indifference with which the proceedings are conducted every trial seems a mere matter of business  there is a great deal of form but no compassion considerable interest but no sympathy  take the old court for example  there sit the judges with whose great dignity everybody is acquainted and of whom therefore we need say no more  then there is the lord mayor in the centre looking as cool as a lord mayor can look with an immense bouquet before him and habited in all the splendour of his office  then there are the sheriffs who are almost as dignified as the lord mayor himself and the barristers who are quite dignified enough in their own opinion and the spectators who having paid for their admission look upon the whole scene as if it were got up especially for their amusement  look upon the whole group in the body of the court—some wholly engrossed in the morning papers others carelessly conversing in low whispers and others again quietly dozing away an hour—and you can scarcely believe that the result of the trial is a matter of life or death to one wretched being present  but turn your eyes to the dock watch the prisoner attentively for a few moments and the fact is before you in all its painful reality  mark how restlessly he has been engaged for the last ten minutes in forming all sorts of fantastic figures with the herbs which are strewed upon the ledge before him observe the ashy paleness of his face when a particular witness appears and how he changes his position and wipes his clammy forehead and feverish hands when the case for the prosecution is closed as if it were a relief to him to feel that the jury knew the worst  the defence is concluded the judge proceeds to sum up the evidence and the prisoner watches the countenances of the jury as a dying man clinging to life to the very last vainly looks in the face of his physician for a slight ray of hope  they turn round to consult you can almost hear the man’s heart beat as he bites the stalk of rosemary with a desperate effort to appear composed  they resume their places—a dead silence prevails as the foreman delivers in the verdict—‘guilty’  a shriek bursts from a female in the gallery the prisoner casts one look at the quarter from whence the noise proceeded and is immediately hurried from the dock by the gaoler  the clerk directs one of the officers of the court to ‘take the woman out’ and fresh business is proceeded with as if nothing had occurred  no imaginary contrast to a case like this could be as complete as that which is constantly presented in the new court the gravity of which is frequently disturbed in no small degree by the cunning and pertinacity of juvenile offenders  a boy of thirteen is tried say for picking the pocket of some subject of her majesty and the offence is about as clearly proved as an offence can be  he is called upon for his defence and contents himself with a little declamation about the jurymen and his country—asserts that all the witnesses have committed perjury and hints that the police force generally have entered into a conspiracy ‘again’ him  however probable this statement may be it fails to convince the court and some such scene as the following then takes place  court have you any witnesses to speak to your character boy  boy yes my lord fifteen gen’lm’n is a vaten outside and vos a vaten all day yesterday vich they told me the night afore my trial vos a comin’ on  court  inquire for these witnesses  here a stout beadle runs out and vociferates for the witnesses at the very top of his voice for you hear his cry grow fainter and fainter as he descends the steps into the courtyard below  after an absence of five minutes he returns very warm and hoarse and informs the court of what it knew perfectly well before—namely that there are no such witnesses in attendance  hereupon the boy sets up a most awful howling screws the lower part of the palms of his hands into the corners of his eyes and endeavours to look the picture of injured innocence  the jury at once find him ‘guilty’ and his endeavours to squeeze out a tear or two are redoubled  the governor of the gaol then states in reply to an inquiry from the bench that the prisoner has been under his care twice before  this the urchin resolutely denies in some such terms as—‘s’elp me gen’lm’n i never vos in trouble afore—indeed my lord i never vos it’s all a howen to my having a twin brother vich has wrongfully got into trouble and vich is so exactly like me that no vun ever knows the difference atween us’  this representation like the defence fails in producing the desired effect and the boy is sentenced perhaps to seven years’ transportation  finding it impossible to excite compassion he gives vent to his feelings in an imprecation bearing reference to the eyes of ‘old big vig’ and as he declines to take the trouble of walking from the dock is forthwith carried out congratulating himself on having succeeded in giving everybody as much trouble as possible    chapter xxv—a visit to newgate   ‘the force of habit’ is a trite phrase in everybody’s mouth and it is not a little remarkable that those who use it most as applied to others unconsciously afford in their own persons singular examples of the power which habit and custom exercise over the minds of men and of the little reflection they are apt to bestow on subjects with which every day’s experience has rendered them familiar  if bedlam could be suddenly removed like another aladdin’s palace and set down on the space now occupied by newgate scarcely one man out of a hundred whose road to business every morning lies through newgatestreet or the old bailey would pass the building without bestowing a hasty glance on its small grated windows and a transient thought upon the condition of the unhappy beings immured in its dismal cells and yet these same men day by day and hour by hour pass and repass this gloomy depository of the guilt and misery of london in one perpetual stream of life and bustle utterly unmindful of the throng of wretched creatures pent up within it—nay not even knowing or if they do not heeding the fact that as they pass one particular angle of the massive wall with a light laugh or a merry whistle they stand within one yard of a fellowcreature bound and helpless whose hours are numbered from whom the last feeble ray of hope has fled for ever and whose miserable career will shortly terminate in a violent and shameful death  contact with death even in its least terrible shape is solemn and appalling  how much more awful is it to reflect on this near vicinity to the dying—to men in full health and vigour in the flower of youth or the prime of life with all their faculties and perceptions as acute and perfect as your own but dying nevertheless—dying as surely—with the hand of death imprinted upon them as indelibly—as if mortal disease had wasted their frames to shadows and corruption had already begun  it was with some such thoughts as these that we determined not many weeks since to visit the interior of newgate—in an amateur capacity of course and having carried our intention into effect we proceed to lay its results before our readers in the hope—founded more upon the nature of the subject than on any presumptuous confidence in our own descriptive powers—that this paper may not be found wholly devoid of interest  we have only to premise that we do not intend to fatigue the reader with any statistical accounts of the prison they will be found at length in numerous reports of numerous committees and a variety of authorities of equal weight  we took no notes made no memoranda measured none of the yards ascertained the exact number of inches in no particular room are unable even to report of how many apartments the gaol is composed  we saw the prison and saw the prisoners and what we did see and what we thought we will tell at once in our own way  having delivered our credentials to the servant who answered our knock at the door of the governor’s house we were ushered into the ‘office’ a little room on the righthand side as you enter with two windows looking into the old bailey fitted up like an ordinary attorney’s office or merchant’s countinghouse with the usual fixtures—a wainscoted partition a shelf or two a desk a couple of stools a pair of clerks an almanack a clock and a few maps  after a little delay occasioned by sending into the interior of the prison for the officer whose duty it was to conduct us that functionary arrived a respectablelooking man of about two or three and fifty in a broadbrimmed hat and full suit of black who but for his keys would have looked quite as much like a clergyman as a turnkey  we were disappointed he had not even topboots on  following our conductor by a door opposite to that at which we had entered we arrived at a small room without any other furniture than a little desk with a book for visitors’ autographs and a shelf on which were a few boxes for papers and casts of the heads and faces of the two notorious murderers bishop and williams the former in particular exhibiting a style of head and set of features which might have afforded sufficient moral grounds for his instant execution at any time even had there been no other evidence against him  leaving this room also by an opposite door we found ourself in the lodge which opens on the old bailey one side of which is plentifully garnished with a choice collection of heavy sets of irons including those worn by the redoubtable jack sheppard—genuine and those said to have been graced by the sturdy limbs of the no less celebrated dick turpin—doubtful  from this lodge a heavy oaken gate bound with iron studded with nails of the same material and guarded by another turnkey opens on a few steps if we remember right which terminate in a narrow and dismal stone passage running parallel with the old bailey and leading to the different yards through a number of tortuous and intricate windings guarded in their turn by huge gates and gratings whose appearance is sufficient to dispel at once the slightest hope of escape that any newcomer may have entertained and the very recollection of which on eventually traversing the place again involves one in a maze of confusion  it is necessary to explain here that the buildings in the prison or in other words the different wards—form a square of which the four sides abut respectively on the old bailey the old college of physicians now forming a part of newgatemarket the sessionshouse and newgatestreet  the intermediate space is divided into several paved yards in which the prisoners take such air and exercise as can be had in such a place  these yards with the exception of that in which prisoners under sentence of death are confined of which we shall presently give a more detailed description run parallel with newgatestreet and consequently from the old bailey as it were to newgatemarket  the women’s side is in the right wing of the prison nearest the sessionshouse  as we were introduced into this part of the building first we will adopt the same order and introduce our readers to it also  turning to the right then down the passage to which we just now adverted omitting any mention of intervening gates—for if we noticed every gate that was unlocked for us to pass through and locked again as soon as we had passed we should require a gate at every comma—we came to a door composed of thick bars of wood through which were discernible passing to and fro in a narrow yard some twenty women the majority of whom however as soon as they were aware of the presence of strangers retreated to their wards  one side of this yard is railed off at a considerable distance and formed into a kind of iron cage about five feet ten inches in height roofed at the top and defended in front by iron bars from which the friends of the female prisoners communicate with them  in one corner of this singularlooking den was a yellow haggard decrepit old woman in a tattered gown that had once been black and the remains of an old straw bonnet with faded ribbon of the same hue in earnest conversation with a young girl—a prisoner of course—of about twoandtwenty  it is impossible to imagine a more povertystricken object or a creature so borne down in soul and body by excess of misery and destitution as the old woman  the girl was a goodlooking robust female with a profusion of hair streaming about in the wind—for she had no bonnet on—and a man’s silk pockethandkerchief loosely thrown over a most ample pair of shoulders  the old woman was talking in that low stifled tone of voice which tells so forcibly of mental anguish and every now and then burst into an irrepressible sharp abrupt cry of grief the most distressing sound that ears can hear  the girl was perfectly unmoved  hardened beyond all hope of redemption she listened doggedly to her mother’s entreaties whatever they were and beyond inquiring after ‘jem’ and eagerly catching at the few halfpence her miserable parent had brought her took no more apparent interest in the conversation than the most unconcerned spectators  heaven knows there were enough of them in the persons of the other prisoners in the yard who were no more concerned by what was passing before their eyes and within their hearing than if they were blind and deaf  why should they be  inside the prison and out such scenes were too familiar to them to excite even a passing thought unless of ridicule or contempt for feelings which they had long since forgotten  a little farther on a squalidlooking woman in a slovenly thickbordered cap with her arms muffled in a large red shawl the fringed ends of which straggled nearly to the bottom of a dirty white apron was communicating some instructions to her visitor—her daughter evidently  the girl was thinly clad and shaking with the cold  some ordinary word of recognition passed between her and her mother when she appeared at the grating but neither hope condolence regret nor affection was expressed on either side  the mother whispered her instructions and the girl received them with her pinchedup halfstarved features twisted into an expression of careful cunning  it was some scheme for the woman’s defence that she was disclosing perhaps and a sullen smile came over the girl’s face for an instant as if she were pleased not so much at the probability of her mother’s liberation as at the chance of her ‘getting off’ in spite of her prosecutors  the dialogue was soon concluded and with the same careless indifference with which they had approached each other the mother turned towards the inner end of the yard and the girl to the gate at which she had entered  the girl belonged to a class—unhappily but too extensive—the very existence of which should make men’s hearts bleed  barely past her childhood it required but a glance to discover that she was one of those children born and bred in neglect and vice who have never known what childhood is who have never been taught to love and court a parent’s smile or to dread a parent’s frown  the thousand nameless endearments of childhood its gaiety and its innocence are alike unknown to them they have entered at once upon the stern realities and miseries of life and to their better nature it is almost hopeless to appeal in aftertimes by any of the references which will awaken if it be only for a moment some good feeling in ordinary bosoms however corrupt they may have become  talk to them of parental solicitude the happy days of childhood and the merry games of infancy  tell them of hunger and the streets beggary and stripes the ginshop the stationhouse and the pawnbroker’s and they will understand you  two or three women were standing at different parts of the grating conversing with their friends but a very large proportion of the prisoners appeared to have no friends at all beyond such of their old companions as might happen to be within the walls  so passing hastily down the yard and pausing only for an instant to notice the little incidents we have just recorded we were conducted up a clean and welllighted flight of stone stairs to one of the wards  there are several in this part of the building but a description of one is a description of the whole  it was a spacious bare whitewashed apartment lighted of course by windows looking into the interior of the prison but far more light and airy than one could reasonably expect to find in such a situation  there was a large fire with a deal table before it round which ten or a dozen women were seated on wooden forms at dinner  along both sides of the room ran a shelf below it at regular intervals a row of large hooks were fixed in the wall on each of which was hung the sleeping mat of a prisoner her rug and blanket being folded up and placed on the shelf above  at night these mats are placed on the floor each beneath the hook on which it hangs during the day and the ward is thus made to answer the purposes both of a dayroom and sleeping apartment  over the fireplace was a large sheet of pasteboard on which were displayed a variety of texts from scripture which were also scattered about the room in scraps about the size and shape of the copyslips which are used in schools  on the table was a sufficient provision of a kind of stewed beef and brown bread in pewter dishes which are kept perfectly bright and displayed on shelves in great order and regularity when they are not in use  the women rose hastily on our entrance and retired in a hurried manner to either side of the fireplace  they were all cleanly—many of them decently—attired and there was nothing peculiar either in their appearance or demeanour  one or two resumed the needlework which they had probably laid aside at the commencement of their meal others gazed at the visitors with listless curiosity and a few retired behind their companions to the very end of the room as if desirous to avoid even the casual observation of the strangers  some old irish women both in this and other wards to whom the thing was no novelty appeared perfectly indifferent to our presence and remained standing close to the seats from which they had just risen but the general feeling among the females seemed to be one of uneasiness during the period of our stay among them which was very brief  not a word was uttered during the time of our remaining unless indeed by the wardswoman in reply to some question which we put to the turnkey who accompanied us  in every ward on the female side a wardswoman is appointed to preserve order and a similar regulation is adopted among the males  the wardsmen and wardswomen are all prisoners selected for good conduct  they alone are allowed the privilege of sleeping on bedsteads a small stump bedstead being placed in every ward for that purpose  on both sides of the gaol is a small receivingroom to which prisoners are conducted on their first reception and whence they cannot be removed until they have been examined by the surgeon of the prison 161  retracing our steps to the dismal passage in which we found ourselves at first and which bythebye contains three or four dark cells for the accommodation of refractory prisoners we were led through a narrow yard to the ‘school’—a portion of the prison set apart for boys under fourteen years of age  in a tolerablesized room in which were writingmaterials and some copybooks was the schoolmaster with a couple of his pupils the remainder having been fetched from an adjoining apartment the whole were drawn up in line for our inspection  there were fourteen of them in all some with shoes some without some in pinafores without jackets others in jackets without pinafores and one in scarce anything at all the whole number without an exception we believe had been committed for trial on charges of pocketpicking and fourteen such terrible little faces we never beheld—there was not one redeeming feature among them—not a glance of honesty—not a wink expressive of anything but the gallows and the hulks in the whole collection  as to anything like shame or contrition that was entirely out of the question  they were evidently quite gratified at being thought worth the trouble of looking at their idea appeared to be that we had come to see newgate as a grand affair and that they were an indispensable part of the show and every boy as he ‘fell in’ to the line actually seemed as pleased and important as if he had done something excessively meritorious in getting there at all  we never looked upon a more disagreeable sight because we never saw fourteen such hopeless creatures of neglect before  on either side of the schoolyard is a yard for men in one of which—that towards newgatestreet—prisoners of the more respectable class are confined  of the other we have little description to offer as the different wards necessarily partake of the same character  they are provided like the wards on the women’s side with mats and rugs which are disposed of in the same manner during the day the only very striking difference between their appearance and that of the wards inhabited by the females is the utter absence of any employment  huddled together on two opposite forms by the fireside sit twenty men perhaps here a boy in livery there a man in a rough greatcoat and topboots farther on a desperatelooking fellow in his shirtsleeves with an old scotch cap upon his shaggy head near him again a tall ruffian in a smockfrock next to him a miserable being of distressed appearance with his head resting on his hand—all alike in one respect all idle and listless when they do leave the fire sauntering moodily about lounging in the window or leaning against the wall vacantly swinging their bodies to and fro  with the exception of a man reading an old newspaper in two or three instances this was the case in every ward we entered  the only communication these men have with their friends is through two close iron gratings with an intermediate space of about a yard in width between the two so that nothing can be handed across nor can the prisoner have any communication by touch with the person who visits him the married men have a separate grating at which to see their wives but its construction is the same  the prison chapel is situated at the back of the governor’s house the latter having no windows looking into the interior of the prison whether the associations connected with the place—the knowledge that here a portion of the burial service is on some dreadful occasions performed over the quick and not upon the dead—cast over it a still more gloomy and sombre air than art has imparted to it we know not but its appearance is very striking  there is something in a silent and deserted place of worship solemn and impressive at any time and the very dissimilarity of this one from any we have been accustomed to only enhances the impression  the meanness of its appointments—the bare and scanty pulpit with the paltry painted pillars on either side—the women’s gallery with its great heavy curtain—the men’s with its unpainted benches and dingy front—the tottering little table at the altar with the commandments on the wall above it scarcely legible through lack of paint and dust and damp—so unlike the velvet and gilding the marble and wood of a modern church—are strange and striking  there is one object too which rivets the attention and fascinates the gaze and from which we may turn horrorstricken in vain for the recollection of it will haunt us waking and sleeping for a long time afterwards  immediately below the readingdesk on the floor of the chapel and forming the most conspicuous object in its little area is the condemned pew a huge black pen in which the wretched people who are singled out for death are placed on the sunday preceding their execution in sight of all their fellowprisoners from many of whom they may have been separated but a week before to hear prayers for their own souls to join in the responses of their own burial service and to listen to an address warning their recent companions to take example by their fate and urging themselves while there is yet time—nearly fourandtwenty hours—to ‘turn and flee from the wrath to come’  imagine what have been the feelings of the men whom that fearful pew has enclosed and of whom between the gallows and the knife no mortal remnant may now remain think of the hopeless clinging to life to the last and the wild despair far exceeding in anguish the felon’s death itself by which they have heard the certainty of their speedy transmission to another world with all their crimes upon their heads rung into their ears by the officiating clergyman  at one time—and at no distant period either—the coffins of the men about to be executed were placed in that pew upon the seat by their side during the whole service  it may seem incredible but it is true  let us hope that the increased spirit of civilisation and humanity which abolished this frightful and degrading custom may extend itself to other usages equally barbarous usages which have not even the plea of utility in their defence as every year’s experience has shown them to be more and more inefficacious  leaving the chapel descending to the passage so frequently alluded to and crossing the yard before noticed as being allotted to prisoners of a more respectable description than the generality of men confined here the visitor arrives at a thick iron gate of great size and strength having been admitted through it by the turnkey on duty he turns sharp round to the left and pauses before another gate and having passed this last barrier he stands in the most terrible part of this gloomy building—the condemned ward  the pressyard well known by name to newspaper readers from its frequent mention in accounts of executions is at the corner of the building and next to the ordinary’s house in newgatestreet running from newgatestreet towards the centre of the prison parallel with newgatemarket  it is a long narrow court of which a portion of the wall in newgatestreet forms one end and the gate the other  at the upper end on the left hand—that is adjoining the wall in newgatestreet—is a cistern of water and at the bottom a double grating of which the gate itself forms a part similar to that before described through these grates the prisoners are allowed to see their friends a turnkey always remaining in the vacant space between during the whole interview  immediately on the right as you enter is a building containing the pressroom dayroom and cells the yard is on every side surrounded by lofty walls guarded by chevaux de frise and the whole is under the constant inspection of vigilant and experienced turnkeys  in the first apartment into which we were conducted—which was at the top of a staircase and immediately over the pressroom—were fiveandtwenty or thirty prisoners all under sentence of death awaiting the result of the recorder’s report—men of all ages and appearances from a hardened old offender with swarthy face and grizzly beard of three days’ growth to a handsome boy not fourteen years old and of singularly youthful appearance even for that age who had been condemned for burglary  there was nothing remarkable in the appearance of these prisoners  one or two decentlydressed men were brooding with a dejected air over the fire several little groups of two or three had been engaged in conversation at the upper end of the room or in the windows and the remainder were crowded round a young man seated at a table who appeared to be engaged in teaching the younger ones to write  the room was large airy and clean  there was very little anxiety or mental suffering depicted in the countenance of any of the men—they had all been sentenced to death it is true and the recorder’s report had not yet been made but we question whether there was a man among them notwithstanding who did not know that although he had undergone the ceremony it never was intended that his life should be sacrificed  on the table lay a testament but there were no tokens of its having been in recent use  in the pressroom below were three men the nature of whose offence rendered it necessary to separate them even from their companions in guilt  it is a long sombre room with two windows sunk into the stone wall and here the wretched men are pinioned on the morning of their execution before moving towards the scaffold  the fate of one of these prisoners was uncertain some mitigatory circumstances having come to light since his trial which had been humanely represented in the proper quarter  the other two had nothing to expect from the mercy of the crown their doom was sealed no plea could be urged in extenuation of their crime and they well knew that for them there was no hope in this world  ‘the two short ones’ the turnkey whispered ‘were dead men’  the man to whom we have alluded as entertaining some hopes of escape was lounging at the greatest distance he could place between himself and his companions in the window nearest to the door  he was probably aware of our approach and had assumed an air of courageous indifference his face was purposely averted towards the window and he stirred not an inch while we were present  the other two men were at the upper end of the room  one of them who was imperfectly seen in the dim light had his back towards us and was stooping over the fire with his right arm on the mantelpiece and his head sunk upon it  the other was leaning on the sill of the farthest window  the light fell full upon him and communicated to his pale haggard face and disordered hair an appearance which at that distance was ghastly  his cheek rested upon his hand and with his face a little raised and his eyes wildly staring before him he seemed to be unconsciously intent on counting the chinks in the opposite wall  we passed this room again afterwards  the first man was pacing up and down the court with a firm military step—he had been a soldier in the footguards—and a cloth cap jauntily thrown on one side of his head  he bowed respectfully to our conductor and the salute was returned  the other two still remained in the positions we have described and were as motionless as statues 165  a few paces up the yard and forming a continuation of the building in which are the two rooms we have just quitted lie the condemned cells the entrance is by a narrow and obscure staircase leading to a dark passage in which a charcoal stove casts a lurid tint over the objects in its immediate vicinity and diffuses something like warmth around  from the lefthand side of this passage the massive door of every cell on the story opens and from it alone can they be approached  there are three of these passages and three of these ranges of cells one above the other but in size furniture and appearance they are all precisely alike  prior to the recorder’s report being made all the prisoners under sentence of death are removed from the dayroom at five o’clock in the afternoon and locked up in these cells where they are allowed a candle until ten o’clock and here they remain until seven next morning when the warrant for a prisoner’s execution arrives he is removed to the cells and confined in one of them until he leaves it for the scaffold he is at liberty to walk in the yard but both in his walks and in his cell he is constantly attended by a turnkey who never leaves him on any pretence  we entered the first cell  it was a stone dungeon eight feet long by six wide with a bench at the upper end under which were a common rug a bible and prayerbook  an iron candlestick was fixed into the wall at the side and a small high window in the back admitted as much air and light as could struggle in between a double row of heavy crossed iron bars  it contained no other furniture of any description  conceive the situation of a man spending his last night on earth in this cell  buoyed up with some vague and undefined hope of reprieve he knew not why—indulging in some wild and visionary idea of escaping he knew not how—hour after hour of the three preceding days allowed him for preparation has fled with a speed which no man living would deem possible for none but this dying man can know  he has wearied his friends with entreaties exhausted the attendants with importunities neglected in his feverish restlessness the timely warnings of his spiritual consoler and now that the illusion is at last dispelled now that eternity is before him and guilt behind now that his fears of death amount almost to madness and an overwhelming sense of his helpless hopeless state rushes upon him he is lost and stupefied and has neither thoughts to turn to nor power to call upon the almighty being from whom alone he can seek mercy and forgiveness and before whom his repentance can alone avail  hours have glided by and still he sits upon the same stone bench with folded arms heedless alike of the fast decreasing time before him and the urgent entreaties of the good man at his side  the feeble light is wasting gradually and the deathlike stillness of the street without broken only by the rumbling of some passing vehicle which echoes mournfully through the empty yards warns him that the night is waning fast away  the deep bell of st paul’s strikes—one  he heard it it has roused him  seven hours left  he paces the narrow limits of his cell with rapid strides cold drops of terror starting on his forehead and every muscle of his frame quivering with agony  seven hours  he suffers himself to be led to his seat mechanically takes the bible which is placed in his hand and tries to read and listen  no his thoughts will wander  the book is torn and soiled by use—and like the book he read his lessons in at school just forty years ago  he has never bestowed a thought upon it perhaps since he left it as a child and yet the place the time the room—nay the very boys he played with crowd as vividly before him as if they were scenes of yesterday and some forgotten phrase some childish word rings in his ears like the echo of one uttered but a minute since  the voice of the clergyman recalls him to himself  he is reading from the sacred book its solemn promises of pardon for repentance and its awful denunciation of obdurate men  he falls upon his knees and clasps his hands to pray  hush what sound was that  he starts upon his feet  it cannot be two yet  hark  two quarters have struck—the third—the fourth  it is  six hours left tell him not of repentance  six hours’ repentance for eight times six years of guilt and sin  he buries his face in his hands and throws himself on the bench  worn with watching and excitement he sleeps and the same unsettled state of mind pursues him in his dreams  an insupportable load is taken from his breast he is walking with his wife in a pleasant field with the bright sky above them and a fresh and boundless prospect on every side—how different from the stone walls of newgate  she is looking—not as she did when he saw her for the last time in that dreadful place but as she used when he loved her—long long ago before misery and illtreatment had altered her looks and vice had changed his nature and she is leaning upon his arm and looking up into his face with tenderness and affection—and he does not strike her now nor rudely shake her from him  and oh how glad he is to tell her all he had forgotten in that last hurried interview and to fall on his knees before her and fervently beseech her pardon for all the unkindness and cruelty that wasted her form and broke her heart  the scene suddenly changes  he is on his trial again there are the judge and jury and prosecutors and witnesses just as they were before  how full the court is—what a sea of heads—with a gallows too and a scaffold—and how all those people stare at him  verdict ‘guilty’  no matter he will escape  the night is dark and cold the gates have been left open and in an instant he is in the street flying from the scene of his imprisonment like the wind  the streets are cleared the open fields are gained and the broad wide country lies before him  onward he dashes in the midst of darkness over hedge and ditch through mud and pool bounding from spot to spot with a speed and lightness astonishing even to himself  at length he pauses he must be safe from pursuit now he will stretch himself on that bank and sleep till sunrise  a period of unconsciousness succeeds  he wakes cold and wretched  the dull gray light of morning is stealing into the cell and falls upon the form of the attendant turnkey  confused by his dreams he starts from his uneasy bed in momentary uncertainty  it is but momentary  every object in the narrow cell is too frightfully real to admit of doubt or mistake  he is the condemned felon again guilty and despairing and in two hours more will be dead     characters   chapter i—thoughts about people   it is strange with how little notice good bad or indifferent a man may live and die in london  he awakens no sympathy in the breast of any single person his existence is a matter of interest to no one save himself he cannot be said to be forgotten when he dies for no one remembered him when he was alive  there is a numerous class of people in this great metropolis who seem not to possess a single friend and whom nobody appears to care for  urged by imperative necessity in the first instance they have resorted to london in search of employment and the means of subsistence  it is hard we know to break the ties which bind us to our homes and friends and harder still to efface the thousand recollections of happy days and old times which have been slumbering in our bosoms for years and only rush upon the mind to bring before it associations connected with the friends we have left the scenes we have beheld too probably for the last time and the hopes we once cherished but may entertain no more  these men however happily for themselves have long forgotten such thoughts  old country friends have died or emigrated former correspondents have become lost like themselves in the crowd and turmoil of some busy city and they have gradually settled down into mere passive creatures of habit and endurance  we were seated in the enclosure of st james’s park the other day when our attention was attracted by a man whom we immediately put down in our own mind as one of this class  he was a tall thin pale person in a black coat scanty gray trousers little pinchedup gaiters and brown beaver gloves  he had an umbrella in his hand—not for use for the day was fine—but evidently because he always carried one to the office in the morning  he walked up and down before the little patch of grass on which the chairs are placed for hire not as if he were doing it for pleasure or recreation but as if it were a matter of compulsion just as he would walk to the office every morning from the back settlements of islington  it was monday he had escaped for fourandtwenty hours from the thraldom of the desk and was walking here for exercise and amusement—perhaps for the first time in his life  we were inclined to think he had never had a holiday before and that he did not know what to do with himself  children were playing on the grass groups of people were loitering about chatting and laughing but the man walked steadily up and down unheeding and unheeded his spare pale face looking as if it were incapable of bearing the expression of curiosity or interest  there was something in the man’s manner and appearance which told us we fancied his whole life or rather his whole day for a man of this sort has no variety of days  we thought we almost saw the dingy little back office into which he walks every morning hanging his hat on the same peg and placing his legs beneath the same desk first taking off that black coat which lasts the year through and putting on the one which did duty last year and which he keeps in his desk to save the other  there he sits till five o’clock working on all day as regularly as the dial over the mantelpiece whose loud ticking is as monotonous as his whole existence only raising his head when some one enters the countinghouse or when in the midst of some difficult calculation he looks up to the ceiling as if there were inspiration in the dusty skylight with a green knot in the centre of every pane of glass  about five or halfpast he slowly dismounts from his accustomed stool and again changing his coat proceeds to his usual diningplace somewhere near bucklersbury  the waiter recites the bill of fare in a rather confidential manner—for he is a regular customer—and after inquiring ‘what’s in the best cut’ and ‘what was up last’ he orders a small plate of roast beef with greens and halfapint of porter  he has a small plate today because greens are a penny more than potatoes and he had ‘two breads’ yesterday with the additional enormity of ‘a cheese’ the day before  this important point settled he hangs up his hat—he took it off the moment he sat down—and bespeaks the paper after the next gentleman  if he can get it while he is at dinner he eats with much greater zest balancing it against the waterbottle and eating a bit of beef and reading a line or two alternately  exactly at five minutes before the hour is up he produces a shilling pays the reckoning carefully deposits the change in his waistcoatpocket first deducting a penny for the waiter and returns to the office from which if it is not foreign post night he again sallies forth in about half an hour  he then walks home at his usual pace to his little back room at islington where he has his tea perhaps solacing himself during the meal with the conversation of his landlady’s little boy whom he occasionally rewards with a penny for solving problems in simple addition  sometimes there is a letter or two to take up to his employer’s in russellsquare and then the wealthy man of business hearing his voice calls out from the diningparlour—‘come in mr smith’ and mr smith putting his hat at the feet of one of the hall chairs walks timidly in and being condescendingly desired to sit down carefully tucks his legs under his chair and sits at a considerable distance from the table while he drinks the glass of sherry which is poured out for him by the eldest boy and after drinking which he backs and slides out of the room in a state of nervous agitation from which he does not perfectly recover until he finds himself once more in the islingtonroad  poor harmless creatures such men are contented but not happy brokenspirited and humbled they may feel no pain but they never know pleasure  compare these men with another class of beings who like them have neither friend nor companion but whose position in society is the result of their own choice  these are generally old fellows with white heads and red faces addicted to port wine and hessian boots who from some cause real or imaginary—generally the former the excellent reason being that they are rich and their relations poor—grow suspicious of everybody and do the misanthropical in chambers taking great delight in thinking themselves unhappy and making everybody they come near miserable  you may see such men as these anywhere you will know them at coffeehouses by their discontented exclamations and the luxury of their dinners at theatres by their always sitting in the same place and looking with a jaundiced eye on all the young people near them at church by the pomposity with which they enter and the loud tone in which they repeat the responses at parties by their getting cross at whist and hating music  an old fellow of this kind will have his chambers splendidly furnished and collect books plate and pictures about him in profusion not so much for his own gratification as to be superior to those who have the desire but not the means to compete with him  he belongs to two or three clubs and is envied and flattered and hated by the members of them all  sometimes he will be appealed to by a poor relation—a married nephew perhaps—for some little assistance and then he will declaim with honest indignation on the improvidence of young married people the worthlessness of a wife the insolence of having a family the atrocity of getting into debt with a hundred and twentyfive pounds a year and other unpardonable crimes winding up his exhortations with a complacent review of his own conduct and a delicate allusion to parochial relief  he dies some day after dinner of apoplexy having bequeathed his property to a public society and the institution erects a tablet to his memory expressive of their admiration of his christian conduct in this world and their comfortable conviction of his happiness in the next  but next to our very particular friends hackneycoachmen cabmen and cads whom we admire in proportion to the extent of their cool impudence and perfect selfpossession there is no class of people who amuse us more than london apprentices  they are no longer an organised body bound down by solemn compact to terrify his majesty’s subjects whenever it pleases them to take offence in their heads and staves in their hands they are only bound now by indentures and as to their valour it is easily restrained by the wholesome dread of the new police and a perspective view of a damp stationhouse terminating in a policeoffice and a reprimand  they are still however a peculiar class and not the less pleasant for being inoffensive  can any one fail to have noticed them in the streets on sunday  and were there ever such harmless efforts at the grand and magnificent as the young fellows display  we walked down the strand a sunday or two ago behind a little group and they furnished food for our amusement the whole way  they had come out of some part of the city it was between three and four o’clock in the afternoon and they were on their way to the park  there were four of them all arminarm with white kid gloves like so many bridegrooms light trousers of unprecedented patterns and coats for which the english language has yet no name—a kind of cross between a greatcoat and a surtout with the collar of the one the skirts of the other and pockets peculiar to themselves  each of the gentlemen carried a thick stick with a large tassel at the top which he occasionally twirled gracefully round and the whole four by way of looking easy and unconcerned were walking with a paralytic swagger irresistibly ludicrous  one of the party had a watch about the size and shape of a reasonable ribstone pippin jammed into his waistcoatpocket which he carefully compared with the clocks at st clement’s and the new church the illuminated clock at exeter ‘change the clock of st martin’s church and the clock of the horse guards when they at last arrived in st james’s park the member of the party who had the bestmade boots on hired a second chair expressly for his feet and flung himself on this twopennyworth of sylvan luxury with an air which levelled all distinctions between brookes’s and snooks’s crockford’s and bagnigge wells  we may smile at such people but they can never excite our anger  they are usually on the best terms with themselves and it follows almost as a matter of course in good humour with every one about them  besides they are always the faint reflection of higher lights and if they do display a little occasional foolery in their own proper persons it is surely more tolerable than precocious puppyism in the quadrant whiskered dandyism in regentstreet and pallmall or gallantry in its dotage anywhere    chapter ii—a christmas dinner   christmas time  that man must be a misanthrope indeed in whose breast something like a jovial feeling is not roused—in whose mind some pleasant associations are not awakened—by the recurrence of christmas  there are people who will tell you that christmas is not to them what it used to be that each succeeding christmas has found some cherished hope or happy prospect of the year before dimmed or passed away that the present only serves to remind them of reduced circumstances and straitened incomes—of the feasts they once bestowed on hollow friends and of the cold looks that meet them now in adversity and misfortune never heed such dismal reminiscences  there are few men who have lived long enough in the world who cannot call up such thoughts any day in the year  then do not select the merriest of the three hundred and sixtyfive for your doleful recollections but draw your chair nearer the blazing fire—fill the glass and send round the song—and if your room be smaller than it was a dozen years ago or if your glass be filled with reeking punch instead of sparkling wine put a good face on the matter and empty it offhand and fill another and troll off the old ditty you used to sing and thank god it’s no worse  look on the merry faces of your children if you have any as they sit round the fire  one little seat may be empty one slight form that gladdened the father’s heart and roused the mother’s pride to look upon may not be there  dwell not upon the past think not that one short year ago the fair child now resolving into dust sat before you with the bloom of health upon its cheek and the gaiety of infancy in its joyous eye  reflect upon your present blessings—of which every man has many—not on your past misfortunes of which all men have some  fill your glass again with a merry face and contented heart  our life on it but your christmas shall be merry and your new year a happy one  who can be insensible to the outpourings of good feeling and the honest interchange of affectionate attachment which abound at this season of the year  a christmas familyparty  we know nothing in nature more delightful  there seems a magic in the very name of christmas  petty jealousies and discords are forgotten social feelings are awakened in bosoms to which they have long been strangers father and son or brother and sister who have met and passed with averted gaze or a look of cold recognition for months before proffer and return the cordial embrace and bury their past animosities in their present happiness  kindly hearts that have yearned towards each other but have been withheld by false notions of pride and selfdignity are again reunited and all is kindness and benevolence  would that christmas lasted the whole year through as it ought and that the prejudices and passions which deform our better nature were never called into action among those to whom they should ever be strangers  the christmas familyparty that we mean is not a mere assemblage of relations got up at a week or two’s notice originating this year having no family precedent in the last and not likely to be repeated in the next  no  it is an annual gathering of all the accessible members of the family young or old rich or poor and all the children look forward to it for two months beforehand in a fever of anticipation formerly it was held at grandpapa’s but grandpapa getting old and grandmamma getting old too and rather infirm they have given up housekeeping and domesticated themselves with uncle george so the party always takes place at uncle george’s house but grandmamma sends in most of the good things and grandpapa always will toddle down all the way to newgatemarket to buy the turkey which he engages a porter to bring home behind him in triumph always insisting on the man’s being rewarded with a glass of spirits over and above his hire to drink ‘a merry christmas and a happy new year’ to aunt george  as to grandmamma she is very secret and mysterious for two or three days beforehand but not sufficiently so to prevent rumours getting afloat that she has purchased a beautiful new cap with pink ribbons for each of the servants together with sundry books and penknives and pencilcases for the younger branches to say nothing of divers secret additions to the order originally given by aunt george at the pastrycook’s such as another dozen of mincepies for the dinner and a large plumcake for the children  on christmaseve grandmamma is always in excellent spirits and after employing all the children during the day in stoning the plums and all that insists regularly every year on uncle george coming down into the kitchen taking off his coat and stirring the pudding for half an hour or so which uncle george goodhumouredly does to the vociferous delight of the children and servants  the evening concludes with a glorious game of blindman’sbuff in an early stage of which grandpapa takes great care to be caught in order that he may have an opportunity of displaying his dexterity  on the following morning the old couple with as many of the children as the pew will hold go to church in great state leaving aunt george at home dusting decanters and filling casters and uncle george carrying bottles into the diningparlour and calling for corkscrews and getting into everybody’s way  when the churchparty return to lunch grandpapa produces a small sprig of mistletoe from his pocket and tempts the boys to kiss their little cousins under it—a proceeding which affords both the boys and the old gentleman unlimited satisfaction but which rather outrages grandmamma’s ideas of decorum until grandpapa says that when he was just thirteen years and three months old he kissed grandmamma under a mistletoe too on which the children clap their hands and laugh very heartily as do aunt george and uncle george and grandmamma looks pleased and says with a benevolent smile that grandpapa was an impudent young dog on which the children laugh very heartily again and grandpapa more heartily than any of them  but all these diversions are nothing to the subsequent excitement when grandmamma in a high cap and slatecoloured silk gown and grandpapa with a beautifully plaited shirtfrill and white neckerchief seat themselves on one side of the drawingroom fire with uncle george’s children and little cousins innumerable seated in the front waiting the arrival of the expected visitors  suddenly a hackneycoach is heard to stop and uncle george who has been looking out of the window exclaims ‘here’s jane’ on which the children rush to the door and helterskelter downstairs and uncle robert and aunt jane and the dear little baby and the nurse and the whole party are ushered upstairs amidst tumultuous shouts of ‘oh my’ from the children and frequently repeated warnings not to hurt baby from the nurse  and grandpapa takes the child and grandmamma kisses her daughter and the confusion of this first entry has scarcely subsided when some other aunts and uncles with more cousins arrive and the grownup cousins flirt with each other and so do the little cousins too for that matter and nothing is to be heard but a confused din of talking laughing and merriment  a hesitating double knock at the streetdoor heard during a momentary pause in the conversation excites a general inquiry of ‘who’s that’ and two or three children who have been standing at the window announce in a low voice that it’s ‘poor aunt margaret’  upon which aunt george leaves the room to welcome the newcomer and grandmamma draws herself up rather stiff and stately for margaret married a poor man without her consent and poverty not being a sufficiently weighty punishment for her offence has been discarded by her friends and debarred the society of her dearest relatives  but christmas has come round and the unkind feelings that have struggled against better dispositions during the year have melted away before its genial influence like halfformed ice beneath the morning sun  it is not difficult in a moment of angry feeling for a parent to denounce a disobedient child but to banish her at a period of general goodwill and hilarity from the hearth round which she has sat on so many anniversaries of the same day expanding by slow degrees from infancy to girlhood and then bursting almost imperceptibly into a woman is widely different  the air of conscious rectitude and cold forgiveness which the old lady has assumed sits ill upon her and when the poor girl is led in by her sister pale in looks and broken in hope—not from poverty for that she could bear but from the consciousness of undeserved neglect and unmerited unkindness—it is easy to see how much of it is assumed  a momentary pause succeeds the girl breaks suddenly from her sister and throws herself sobbing on her mother’s neck  the father steps hastily forward and takes her husband’s hand  friends crowd round to offer their hearty congratulations and happiness and harmony again prevail  as to the dinner it’s perfectly delightful—nothing goes wrong and everybody is in the very best of spirits and disposed to please and be pleased  grandpapa relates a circumstantial account of the purchase of the turkey with a slight digression relative to the purchase of previous turkeys on former christmasdays which grandmamma corroborates in the minutest particular  uncle george tells stories and carves poultry and takes wine and jokes with the children at the sidetable and winks at the cousins that are making love or being made love to and exhilarates everybody with his good humour and hospitality and when at last a stout servant staggers in with a gigantic pudding with a sprig of holly in the top there is such a laughing and shouting and clapping of little chubby hands and kicking up of fat dumpy legs as can only be equalled by the applause with which the astonishing feat of pouring lighted brandy into mincepies is received by the younger visitors then the dessert—and the wine—and the fun  such beautiful speeches and such songs from aunt margaret’s husband who turns out to be such a nice man and so attentive to grandmamma  even grandpapa not only sings his annual song with unprecedented vigour but on being honoured with an unanimous encore according to annual custom actually comes out with a new one which nobody but grandmamma ever heard before and a young scapegrace of a cousin who has been in some disgrace with the old people for certain heinous sins of omission and commission—neglecting to call and persisting in drinking burton ale—astonishes everybody into convulsions of laughter by volunteering the most extraordinary comic songs that ever were heard  and thus the evening passes in a strain of rational goodwill and cheerfulness doing more to awaken the sympathies of every member of the party in behalf of his neighbour and to perpetuate their good feeling during the ensuing year than half the homilies that have ever been written by half the divines that have ever lived    chapter iii—the new year   next to christmasday the most pleasant annual epoch in existence is the advent of the new year  there are a lachrymose set of people who usher in the new year with watching and fasting as if they were bound to attend as chief mourners at the obsequies of the old one  now we cannot but think it a great deal more complimentary both to the old year that has rolled away and to the new year that is just beginning to dawn upon us to see the old fellow out and the new one in with gaiety and glee  there must have been some few occurrences in the past year to which we can look back with a smile of cheerful recollection if not with a feeling of heartfelt thankfulness  and we are bound by every rule of justice and equity to give the new year credit for being a good one until he proves himself unworthy the confidence we repose in him  this is our view of the matter and entertaining it notwithstanding our respect for the old year one of the few remaining moments of whose existence passes away with every word we write here we are seated by our fireside on this last night of the old year one thousand eight hundred and thirtysix penning this article with as jovial a face as if nothing extraordinary had happened or was about to happen to disturb our good humour  hackneycoaches and carriages keep rattling up the street and down the street in rapid succession conveying doubtless smartlydressed coachfuls to crowded parties loud and repeated double knocks at the house with green blinds opposite announce to the whole neighbourhood that there’s one large party in the street at all events and we saw through the window and through the fog too till it grew so thick that we rung for candles and drew our curtains pastrycooks’ men with green boxes on their heads and routfurniturewarehousecarts with cane seats and french lamps hurrying to the numerous houses where an annual festival is held in honour of the occasion  we can fancy one of these parties we think as well as if we were duly dresscoated and pumped and had just been announced at the drawingroom door  take the house with the green blinds for instance  we know it is a quadrille party because we saw some men taking up the front drawingroom carpet while we sat at breakfast this morning and if further evidence be required and we must tell the truth we just now saw one of the young ladies ‘doing’ another of the young ladies’ hair near one of the bedroom windows in an unusual style of splendour which nothing else but a quadrille party could possibly justify  the master of the house with the green blinds is in a public office we know the fact by the cut of his coat the tie of his neckcloth and the selfsatisfaction of his gait—the very green blinds themselves have a somerset house air about them  hark—a cab  that’s a junior clerk in the same office a tidy sort of young man with a tendency to cold and corns who comes in a pair of boots with black cloth fronts and brings his shoes in his coatpocket which shoes he is at this very moment putting on in the hall  now he is announced by the man in the passage to another man in a blue coat who is a disguised messenger from the office  the man on the first landing precedes him to the drawingroom door  ‘mr tupple’ shouts the messenger  ‘how are you tupple’ says the master of the house advancing from the fire before which he has been talking politics and airing himself  ‘my dear this is mr tupple a courteous salute from the lady of the house tupple my eldest daughter julia my dear mr tupple tupple my other daughters my son sir’ tupple rubs his hands very hard and smiles as if it were all capital fun and keeps constantly bowing and turning himself round till the whole family have been introduced when he glides into a chair at the corner of the sofa and opens a miscellaneous conversation with the young ladies upon the weather and the theatres and the old year and the last new murder and the balloon and the ladies’ sleeves and the festivities of the season and a great many other topics of small talk  more double knocks what an extensive party what an incessant hum of conversation and general sipping of coffee  we see tupple now in our mind’s eye in the height of his glory  he has just handed that stout old lady’s cup to the servant and now he dives among the crowd of young men by the door to intercept the other servant and secure the muffinplate for the old lady’s daughter before he leaves the room and now as he passes the sofa on his way back he bestows a glance of recognition and patronage upon the young ladies as condescending and familiar as if he had known them from infancy  charming person mr tupple—perfect ladies’ man—such a delightful companion too  laugh—nobody ever understood papa’s jokes half so well as mr tupple who laughs himself into convulsions at every fresh burst of facetiousness  most delightful partner talks through the whole set and although he does seem at first rather gay and frivolous so romantic and with so much feeling  quite a love  no great favourite with the young men certainly who sneer at and affect to despise him but everybody knows that’s only envy and they needn’t give themselves the trouble to depreciate his merits at any rate for ma says he shall be asked to every future dinnerparty if it’s only to talk to people between the courses and distract their attention when there’s any unexpected delay in the kitchen  at supper mr tupple shows to still greater advantage than he has done throughout the evening and when pa requests every one to fill their glasses for the purpose of drinking happiness throughout the year mr tupple is so droll insisting on all the young ladies having their glasses filled notwithstanding their repeated assurances that they never can by any possibility think of emptying them and subsequently begging permission to say a few words on the sentiment which has just been uttered by pa—when he makes one of the most brilliant and poetical speeches that can possibly be imagined about the old year and the new one  after the toast has been drunk and when the ladies have retired mr tupple requests that every gentleman will do him the favour of filling his glass for he has a toast to propose on which all the gentlemen cry ‘hear hear’ and pass the decanters accordingly and mr tupple being informed by the master of the house that they are all charged and waiting for his toast rises and begs to remind the gentlemen present how much they have been delighted by the dazzling array of elegance and beauty which the drawingroom has exhibited that night and how their senses have been charmed and their hearts captivated by the bewitching concentration of female loveliness which that very room has so recently displayed  loud cries of ‘hear’  much as he tupple would be disposed to deplore the absence of the ladies on other grounds he cannot but derive some consolation from the reflection that the very circumstance of their not being present enables him to propose a toast which he would have otherwise been prevented from giving—that toast he begs to say is—‘the ladies’  great applause  the ladies among whom the fascinating daughters of their excellent host are alike conspicuous for their beauty their accomplishments and their elegance  he begs them to drain a bumper to ‘the ladies and a happy new year to them’  prolonged approbation above which the noise of the ladies dancing the spanish dance among themselves overhead is distinctly audible  the applause consequent on this toast has scarcely subsided when a young gentleman in a pink underwaistcoat sitting towards the bottom of the table is observed to grow very restless and fidgety and to evince strong indications of some latent desire to give vent to his feelings in a speech which the wary tupple at once perceiving determines to forestall by speaking himself  he therefore rises again with an air of solemn importance and trusts he may be permitted to propose another toast unqualified approbation and mr tupple proceeds  he is sure they must all be deeply impressed with the hospitality—he may say the splendour—with which they have been that night received by their worthy host and hostess  unbounded applause  although this is the first occasion on which he has had the pleasure and delight of sitting at that board he has known his friend dobble long and intimately he has been connected with him in business—he wishes everybody present knew dobble as well as he does  a cough from the host  he tupple can lay his hand upon his tupple’s heart and declare his confident belief that a better man a better husband a better father a better brother a better son a better relation in any relation of life than dobble never existed loud cries of ‘hear’  they have seen him tonight in the peaceful bosom of his family they should see him in the morning in the trying duties of his office  calm in the perusal of the morning papers uncompromising in the signature of his name dignified in his replies to the inquiries of stranger applicants deferential in his behaviour to his superiors majestic in his deportment to the messengers  cheers  when he bears this merited testimony to the excellent qualities of his friend dobble what can he say in approaching such a subject as mrs dobble  is it requisite for him to expatiate on the qualities of that amiable woman no he will spare his friend dobble’s feelings he will spare the feelings of his friend—if he will allow him to have the honour of calling him so—mr dobble junior  here mr dobble junior who has been previously distending his mouth to a considerable width by thrusting a particularly fine orange into that feature suspends operations and assumes a proper appearance of intense melancholy  he will simply say—and he is quite certain it is a sentiment in which all who hear him will readily concur—that his friend dobble is as superior to any man he ever knew as mrs dobble is far beyond any woman he ever saw except her daughters and he will conclude by proposing their worthy ‘host and hostess and may they live to enjoy many more new years’  the toast is drunk with acclamation dobble returns thanks and the whole party rejoin the ladies in the drawingroom  young men who were too bashful to dance before supper find tongues and partners the musicians exhibit unequivocal symptoms of having drunk the new year in while the company were out and dancing is kept up until far in the first morning of the new year  we have scarcely written the last word of the previous sentence when the first stroke of twelve peals from the neighbouring churches  there certainly—we must confess it now—is something awful in the sound strictly speaking it may not be more impressive now than at any other time for the hours steal as swiftly on at other periods and their flight is little heeded  but we measure man’s life by years and it is a solemn knell that warns us we have passed another of the landmarks which stands between us and the grave  disguise it as we may the reflection will force itself on our minds that when the next bell announces the arrival of a new year we may be insensible alike of the timely warning we have so often neglected and of all the warm feelings that glow within us now    chapter iv—miss evans and the eagle   mr samuel wilkins was a carpenter a journeyman carpenter of small dimensions decidedly below the middle size—bordering perhaps upon the dwarfish  his face was round and shining and his hair carefully twisted into the outer corner of each eye till it formed a variety of that description of semicurls usually known as ‘aggerawators’  his earnings were allsufficient for his wants varying from eighteen shillings to one pound five weekly—his manner undeniable—his sabbath waistcoats dazzling no wonder that with these qualifications samuel wilkins found favour in the eyes of the other sex many women have been captivated by far less substantial qualifications  but samuel was proof against their blandishments until at length his eyes rested on those of a being for whom from that time forth he felt fate had destined him  he came and conquered—proposed and was accepted—loved and was beloved  mr wilkins ‘kept company’ with jemima evans  miss evans or ivins to adopt the pronunciation most in vogue with her circle of acquaintance had adopted in early life the useful pursuit of shoebinding to which she had afterwards superadded the occupation of a strawbonnet maker  herself her maternal parent and two sisters formed an harmonious quartett in the most secluded portion of camdentown and here it was that mr wilkins presented himself one monday afternoon in his best attire with his face more shining and his waistcoat more bright than either had ever appeared before  the family were just going to tea and were so glad to see him  it was quite a little feast two ounces of sevenandsixpenny green and a quarter of a pound of the best fresh and mr wilkins had brought a pint of shrimps neatly folded up in a clean belcher to give a zest to the meal and propitiate mrs ivins  jemima was ‘cleaning herself’ upstairs so mr samuel wilkins sat down and talked domestic economy with mrs ivins whilst the two youngest miss ivinses poked bits of lighted brown paper between the bars under the kettle to make the water boil for tea  ‘i wos a thinking’ said mr samuel wilkins during a pause in the conversation—‘i wos a thinking of taking j’mima to the eagle tonight’—‘o my’ exclaimed mrs ivins  ‘lor how nice’ said the youngest miss ivins  ‘well i declare’ added the youngest miss ivins but one  ‘tell j’mima to put on her white muslin tilly’ screamed mrs ivins with motherly anxiety and down came j’mima herself soon afterwards in a white muslin gown carefully hooked and eyed a little red shawl plentifully pinned a white straw bonnet trimmed with red ribbons a small necklace a large pair of bracelets denmark satin shoes and openworked stockings white cotton gloves on her fingers and a cambric pockethandkerchief carefully folded up in her hand—all quite genteel and ladylike  and away went miss j’mima ivins and mr samuel wilkins and a dresscane with a gilt knob at the top to the admiration and envy of the street in general and to the high gratification of mrs ivins and the two youngest miss ivinses in particular  they had no sooner turned into the pancrasroad than who should miss j’mima ivins stumble upon by the most fortunate accident in the world but a young lady as she knew with her young man—and it is so strange how things do turn out sometimes—they were actually going to the eagle too  so mr samuel wilkins was introduced to miss j’mima ivins’s friend’s young man and they all walked on together talking and laughing and joking away like anything and when they got as far as pentonville miss ivins’s friend’s young man would have the ladies go into the crown to taste some shrub which after a great blushing and giggling and hiding of faces in elaborate pockethandkerchiefs they consented to do  having tasted it once they were easily prevailed upon to taste it again and they sat out in the garden tasting shrub and looking at the busses alternately till it was just the proper time to go to the eagle and then they resumed their journey and walked very fast for fear they should lose the beginning of the concert in the rotunda  ‘how ev’nly’ said miss j’mima ivins and miss j’mima ivins’s friend both at once when they had passed the gate and were fairly inside the gardens  there were the walks beautifully gravelled and planted—and the refreshmentboxes painted and ornamented like so many snuffboxes—and the variegated lamps shedding their rich light upon the company’s heads—and the place for dancing ready chalked for the company’s feet—and a moorish band playing at one end of the gardens—and an opposition military band playing away at the other  then the waiters were rushing to and fro with glasses of negus and glasses of brandyandwater and bottles of ale and bottles of stout and gingerbeer was going off in one place and practical jokes were going on in another and people were crowding to the door of the rotunda and in short the whole scene was as miss j’mima ivins inspired by the novelty or the shrub or both observed—‘one of dazzling excitement’  as to the concertroom never was anything half so splendid  there was an orchestra for the singers all paint gilding and plateglass and such an organ  miss j’mima ivins’s friend’s young man whispered it had cost ‘four hundred pound’ which mr samuel wilkins said was ‘not dear neither’ an opinion in which the ladies perfectly coincided  the audience were seated on elevated benches round the room and crowded into every part of it and everybody was eating and drinking as comfortably as possible  just before the concert commenced mr samuel wilkins ordered two glasses of rumandwater ‘warm with—’ and two slices of lemon for himself and the other young man together with ‘a pint o’ sherry wine for the ladies and some sweet carrawayseed biscuits’ and they would have been quite comfortable and happy only a strange gentleman with large whiskers would stare at miss j’mima ivins and another gentleman in a plaid waistcoat would wink at miss j’mima ivins’s friend on which miss jemima ivins’s friend’s young man exhibited symptoms of boiling over and began to mutter about ‘people’s imperence’ and ‘swells out o’ luck’ and to intimate in oblique terms a vague intention of knocking somebody’s head off which he was only prevented from announcing more emphatically by both miss j’mima ivins and her friend threatening to faint away on the spot if he said another word  the concert commenced—overture on the organ  ‘how solemn’ exclaimed miss j’mima ivins glancing perhaps unconsciously at the gentleman with the whiskers  mr samuel wilkins who had been muttering apart for some time past as if he were holding a confidential conversation with the gilt knob of the dresscane breathed hardbreathing vengeance perhaps—but said nothing  ‘the soldier tired’ miss somebody in white satin  ‘ancore’ cried miss j’mima ivins’s friend  ‘ancore’ shouted the gentleman in the plaid waistcoat immediately hammering the table with a stoutbottle  miss j’mima ivins’s friend’s young man eyed the man behind the waistcoat from head to foot and cast a look of interrogative contempt towards mr samuel wilkins  comic song accompanied on the organ  miss j’mima ivins was convulsed with laughter—so was the man with the whiskers  everything the ladies did the plaid waistcoat and whiskers did by way of expressing unity of sentiment and congeniality of soul and miss j’mima ivins and miss j’mima ivins’s friend grew lively and talkative as mr samuel wilkins and miss j’mima ivins’s friend’s young man grew morose and surly in inverse proportion  now if the matter had ended here the little party might soon have recovered their former equanimity but mr samuel wilkins and his friend began to throw looks of defiance upon the waistcoat and whiskers  and the waistcoat and whiskers by way of intimating the slight degree in which they were affected by the looks aforesaid bestowed glances of increased admiration upon miss j’mima ivins and friend  the concert and vaudeville concluded they promenaded the gardens  the waistcoat and whiskers did the same and made divers remarks complimentary to the ankles of miss j’mima ivins and friend in an audible tone  at length not satisfied with these numerous atrocities they actually came up and asked miss j’mima ivins and miss j’mima ivins’s friend to dance without taking no more notice of mr samuel wilkins and miss j’mima ivins’s friend’s young man than if they was nobody  ‘what do you mean by that scoundrel’ exclaimed mr samuel wilkins grasping the giltknobbed dresscane firmly in his right hand  ‘what’s the matter with you you little humbug’ replied the whiskers  ‘how dare you insult me and my friend’ inquired the friend’s young man  ‘you and your friend be hanged’ responded the waistcoat  ‘take that’ exclaimed mr samuel wilkins  the ferrule of the giltknobbed dresscane was visible for an instant and then the light of the variegated lamps shone brightly upon it as it whirled into the air cane and all  ‘give it him’ said the waistcoat  ‘horficer’ screamed the ladies  miss j’mima ivins’s beau and the friend’s young man lay gasping on the gravel and the waistcoat and whiskers were seen no more  miss j’mima ivins and friend being conscious that the affray was in no slight degree attributable to themselves of course went into hysterics forthwith declared themselves the most injured of women exclaimed in incoherent ravings that they had been suspected—wrongfully suspected—oh that they should ever have lived to see the day—and so forth suffered a relapse every time they opened their eyes and saw their unfortunate little admirers and were carried to their respective abodes in a hackneycoach and a state of insensibility compounded of shrub sherry and excitement    chapter v—the parlour orator   we had been lounging one evening down oxfordstreet holborn cheapside colemanstreet finsburysquare and so on with the intention of returning westward by pentonville and the newroad when we began to feel rather thirsty and disposed to rest for five or ten minutes  so we turned back towards an old quiet decent publichouse which we remembered to have passed but a moment before it was not far from the cityroad for the purpose of solacing ourself with a glass of ale  the house was none of your stuccoed frenchpolished illuminated palaces but a modest publichouse of the old school with a little old bar and a little old landlord who with a wife and daughter of the same pattern was comfortably seated in the bar aforesaid—a snug little room with a cheerful fire protected by a large screen from behind which the young lady emerged on our representing our inclination for a glass of ale  ‘won’t you walk into the parlour sir’ said the young lady in seductive tones  ‘you had better walk into the parlour sir’ said the little old landlord throwing his chair back and looking round one side of the screen to survey our appearance  ‘you had much better step into the parlour sir’ said the little old lady popping out her head on the other side of the screen  we cast a slight glance around as if to express our ignorance of the locality so much recommended  the little old landlord observed it bustled out of the small door of the small bar and forthwith ushered us into the parlour itself  it was an ancient darklooking room with oaken wainscoting a sanded floor and a high mantelpiece  the walls were ornamented with three or four old coloured prints in black frames each print representing a naval engagement with a couple of menofwar banging away at each other most vigorously while another vessel or two were blowing up in the distance and the foreground presented a miscellaneous collection of broken masts and blue legs sticking up out of the water  depending from the ceiling in the centre of the room were a gaslight and bellpull on each side were three or four long narrow tables behind which was a thicklyplanted row of those slippery shinylooking wooden chairs peculiar to hostelries of this description  the monotonous appearance of the sanded boards was relieved by an occasional spittoon and a triangular pile of those useful articles adorned the two upper corners of the apartment  at the furthest table nearest the fire with his face towards the door at the bottom of the room sat a stoutish man of about forty whose short stiff black hair curled closely round a broad high forehead and a face to which something besides water and exercise had communicated a rather inflamed appearance  he was smoking a cigar with his eyes fixed on the ceiling and had that confident oracular air which marked him as the leading politician general authority and universal anecdoterelater of the place  he had evidently just delivered himself of something very weighty for the remainder of the company were puffing at their respective pipes and cigars in a kind of solemn abstraction as if quite overwhelmed with the magnitude of the subject recently under discussion  on his right hand sat an elderly gentleman with a white head and broadbrimmed brown hat on his left a sharpnosed lighthaired man in a brown surtout reaching nearly to his heels who took a whiff at his pipe and an admiring glance at the redfaced man alternately  ‘very extraordinary’ said the lighthaired man after a pause of five minutes  a murmur of assent ran through the company  ‘not at all extraordinary—not at all’ said the redfaced man awakening suddenly from his reverie and turning upon the lighthaired man the moment he had spoken  ‘why should it be extraordinary—why is it extraordinary—prove it to be extraordinary’  ‘oh if you come to that—’ said the lighthaired man meekly  ‘come to that’ ejaculated the man with the red face ‘but we must come to that  we stand in these times upon a calm elevation of intellectual attainment and not in the dark recess of mental deprivation  proof is what i require—proof and not assertions in these stirring times  every gen’lem’n that knows me knows what was the nature and effect of my observations when it was in the contemplation of the oldstreet suburban representative discovery society to recommend a candidate for that place in cornwall there—i forget the name of it  “mr snobee” said mr wilson “is a fit and proper person to represent the borough in parliament”  “prove it” says i  “he is a friend to reform” says mr wilson  “prove it” says i  “the abolitionist of the national debt the unflinching opponent of pensions the uncompromising advocate of the negro the reducer of sinecures and the duration of parliaments the extender of nothing but the suffrages of the people” says mr wilson “prove it” says i  “his acts prove it” says he  “prove them” says i  ‘and he could not prove them’ said the redfaced man looking round triumphantly ‘and the borough didn’t have him and if you carried this principle to the full extent you’d have no debt no pensions no sinecures no negroes no nothing  and then standing upon an elevation of intellectual attainment and having reached the summit of popular prosperity you might bid defiance to the nations of the earth and erect yourselves in the proud confidence of wisdom and superiority  this is my argument—this always has been my argument—and if i was a member of the house of commons tomorrow i’d make ’em shake in their shoes with it and the redfaced man having struck the table very hard with his clenched fist to add weight to the declaration smoked away like a brewery  ‘well’ said the sharpnosed man in a very slow and soft voice addressing the company in general ‘i always do say that of all the gentlemen i have the pleasure of meeting in this room there is not one whose conversation i like to hear so much as mr rogers’s or who is such improving company’  ‘improving company’ said mr rogers for that it seemed was the name of the redfaced man  ‘you may say i am improving company for i’ve improved you all to some purpose though as to my conversation being as my friend mr ellis here describes it that is not for me to say anything about  you gentlemen are the best judges on that point but this i will say when i came into this parish and first used this room ten years ago i don’t believe there was one man in it who knew he was a slave—and now you all know it and writhe under it  inscribe that upon my tomb and i am satisfied’  ‘why as to inscribing it on your tomb’ said a little greengrocer with a chubby face ‘of course you can have anything chalked up as you likes to pay for so far as it relates to yourself and your affairs but when you come to talk about slaves and that there abuse you’d better keep it in the family ’cos i for one don’t like to be called them names night after night’  ‘you are a slave’ said the redfaced man ‘and the most pitiable of all slaves’  ‘werry hard if i am’ interrupted the greengrocer ‘for i got no good out of the twenty million that was paid for ’mancipation anyhow’  ‘a willing slave’ ejaculated the redfaced man getting more red with eloquence and contradiction—‘resigning the dearest birthright of your children—neglecting the sacred call of liberty—who standing imploringly before you appeals to the warmest feelings of your heart and points to your helpless infants but in vain’  ‘prove it’ said the greengrocer  ‘prove it’ sneered the man with the red face  ‘what bending beneath the yoke of an insolent and factious oligarchy bowed down by the domination of cruel laws groaning beneath tyranny and oppression on every hand at every side and in every corner  prove it—’  the redfaced man abruptly broke off sneered melodramatically and buried his countenance and his indignation together in a quart pot  ‘ah to be sure mr rogers’ said a stout broker in a large waistcoat who had kept his eyes fixed on this luminary all the time he was speaking  ‘ah to be sure’ said the broker with a sigh ‘that’s the point’  ‘of course of course’ said divers members of the company who understood almost as much about the matter as the broker himself  ‘you had better let him alone tommy’ said the broker by way of advice to the little greengrocer ‘he can tell what’s o’clock by an eightday without looking at the minute hand he can  try it on on some other suit it won’t do with him tommy’  ‘what is a man’ continued the redfaced specimen of the species jerking his hat indignantly from its peg on the wall  ‘what is an englishman is he to be trampled upon by every oppressor  is he to be knocked down at everybody’s bidding  what’s freedom  not a standing army  what’s a standing army  not freedom  what’s general happiness  not universal misery  liberty ain’t the windowtax is it  the lords ain’t the commons are they’  and the redfaced man gradually bursting into a radiating sentence in which such adjectives as ‘dastardly’ ‘oppressive’ ‘violent’ and ‘sanguinary’ formed the most conspicuous words knocked his hat indignantly over his eyes left the room and slammed the door after him  ‘wonderful man’ said he of the sharp nose  ‘splendid speaker’ added the broker  ‘great power’ said everybody but the greengrocer  and as they said it the whole party shook their heads mysteriously and one by one retired leaving us alone in the old parlour  if we had followed the established precedent in all such instances we should have fallen into a fit of musing without delay  the ancient appearance of the room—the old panelling of the wall—the chimney blackened with smoke and age—would have carried us back a hundred years at least and we should have gone dreaming on until the pewterpot on the table or the little beerchiller on the fire had started into life and addressed to us a long story of days gone by  but by some means or other we were not in a romantic humour and although we tried very hard to invest the furniture with vitality it remained perfectly unmoved obstinate and sullen  being thus reduced to the unpleasant necessity of musing about ordinary matters our thoughts reverted to the redfaced man and his oratorical display  a numerous race are these redfaced men there is not a parlour or clubroom or benefit society or humble party of any kind without its redfaced man  weakpated dolts they are and a great deal of mischief they do to their cause however good  so just to hold a pattern one up to know the others by we took his likeness at once and put him in here and that is the reason why we have written this paper    chapter vi—the hospital patient   in our rambles through the streets of london after evening has set in we often pause beneath the windows of some public hospital and picture to ourself the gloomy and mournful scenes that are passing within  the sudden moving of a taper as its feeble ray shoots from window to window until its light gradually disappears as if it were carried farther back into the room to the bedside of some suffering patient is enough to awaken a whole crowd of reflections the mere glimmering of the lowburning lamps which when all other habitations are wrapped in darkness and slumber denote the chamber where so many forms are writhing with pain or wasting with disease is sufficient to check the most boisterous merriment  who can tell the anguish of those weary hours when the only sound the sick man hears is the disjointed wanderings of some feverish slumberer near him the low moan of pain or perhaps the muttered longforgotten prayer of a dying man  who but they who have felt it can imagine the sense of loneliness and desolation which must be the portion of those who in the hour of dangerous illness are left to be tended by strangers for what hands be they ever so gentle can wipe the clammy brow or smooth the restless bed like those of mother wife or child  impressed with these thoughts we have turned away through the nearlydeserted streets and the sight of the few miserable creatures still hovering about them has not tended to lessen the pain which such meditations awaken  the hospital is a refuge and restingplace for hundreds who but for such institutions must die in the streets and doorways but what can be the feelings of some outcasts when they are stretched on the bed of sickness with scarcely a hope of recovery  the wretched woman who lingers about the pavement hours after midnight and the miserable shadow of a man—the ghastly remnant that want and drunkenness have left—which crouches beneath a windowledge to sleep where there is some shelter from the rain have little to bind them to life but what have they to look back upon in death  what are the unwonted comforts of a roof and a bed to them when the recollections of a whole life of debasement stalk before them when repentance seems a mockery and sorrow comes too late  about a twelvemonth ago as we were strolling through coventgarden we had been thinking about these things overnight we were attracted by the very prepossessing appearance of a pickpocket who having declined to take the trouble of walking to the policeoffice on the ground that he hadn’t the slightest wish to go there at all was being conveyed thither in a wheelbarrow to the huge delight of a crowd  somehow we never can resist joining a crowd so we turned back with the mob and entered the office in company with our friend the pickpocket a couple of policemen and as many dirtyfaced spectators as could squeeze their way in  there was a powerful illlooking young fellow at the bar who was undergoing an examination on the very common charge of having on the previous night illtreated a woman with whom he lived in some court hard by  several witnesses bore testimony to acts of the grossest brutality and a certificate was read from the housesurgeon of a neighbouring hospital describing the nature of the injuries the woman had received and intimating that her recovery was extremely doubtful  some question appeared to have been raised about the identity of the prisoner for when it was agreed that the two magistrates should visit the hospital at eight o’clock that evening to take her deposition it was settled that the man should be taken there also  he turned pale at this and we saw him clench the bar very hard when the order was given he was removed directly afterwards and he spoke not a word  we felt an irrepressible curiosity to witness this interview although it is hard to tell why at this instant for we knew it must be a painful one  it was no very difficult matter for us to gain permission and we obtained it  the prisoner and the officer who had him in custody were already at the hospital when we reached it and waiting the arrival of the magistrates in a small room below stairs  the man was handcuffed and his hat was pulled forward over his eyes  it was easy to see though by the whiteness of his countenance and the constant twitching of the muscles of his face that he dreaded what was to come  after a short interval the magistrates and clerk were bowed in by the housesurgeon and a couple of young men who smelt very strong of tobaccosmoke—they were introduced as ‘dressers’—and after one magistrate had complained bitterly of the cold and the other of the absence of any news in the evening paper it was announced that the patient was prepared and we were conducted to the ‘casualty ward’ in which she was lying  the dim light which burnt in the spacious room increased rather than diminished the ghastly appearance of the hapless creatures in the beds which were ranged in two long rows on either side  in one bed lay a child enveloped in bandages with its body halfconsumed by fire in another a female rendered hideous by some dreadful accident was wildly beating her clenched fists on the coverlet in pain on a third there lay stretched a young girl apparently in the heavy stupor often the immediate precursor of death her face was stained with blood and her breast and arms were bound up in folds of linen  two or three of the beds were empty and their recent occupants were sitting beside them but with faces so wan and eyes so bright and glassy that it was fearful to meet their gaze  on every face was stamped the expression of anguish and suffering  the object of the visit was lying at the upper end of the room  she was a fine young woman of about two or three and twenty  her long black hair which had been hastily cut from near the wounds on her head streamed over the pillow in jagged and matted locks  her face bore deep marks of the illusage she had received her hand was pressed upon her side as if her chief pain were there her breathing was short and heavy and it was plain to see that she was dying fast  she murmured a few words in reply to the magistrate’s inquiry whether she was in great pain and having been raised on the pillow by the nurse looked vacantly upon the strange countenances that surrounded her bed  the magistrate nodded to the officer to bring the man forward  he did so and stationed him at the bedside  the girl looked on with a wild and troubled expression of face but her sight was dim and she did not know him  ‘take off his hat’ said the magistrate  the officer did as he was desired and the man’s features were disclosed  the girl started up with an energy quite preternatural the fire gleamed in her heavy eyes and the blood rushed to her pale and sunken cheeks it was a convulsive effort  she fell back upon her pillow and covering her scarred and bruised face with her hands burst into tears  the man cast an anxious look towards her but otherwise appeared wholly unmoved after a brief pause the nature of the errand was explained and the oath tendered  ‘oh no gentlemen’ said the girl raising herself once more and folding her hands together ‘no gentlemen for god’s sake  i did it myself—it was nobody’s fault—it was an accident  he didn’t hurt me he wouldn’t for all the world  jack dear jack you know you wouldn’t’  her sight was fast failing her and her hand groped over the bedclothes in search of his  brute as the man was he was not prepared for this he turned his face from the bed and sobbed  the girl’s colour changed and her breathing grew more difficult  she was evidently dying  ‘we respect the feelings which prompt you to this’ said the gentleman who had spoken first ‘but let me warn you not to persist in what you know to be untrue until it is too late  it cannot save him’  ‘jack’ murmured the girl laying her hand upon his arm ‘they shall not persuade me to swear your life away  he didn’t do it gentlemen  he never hurt me’  she grasped his arm tightly and added in a broken whisper ‘i hope god almighty will forgive me all the wrong i have done and the life i have led  god bless you jack  some kind gentleman take my love to my poor old father  five years ago he said he wished i had died a child  oh i wish i had  i wish i had’  the nurse bent over the girl for a few seconds and then drew the sheet over her face  it covered a corpse    chapter vii—the misplaced attachment of mr john dounce   if we had to make a classification of society there is a particular kind of men whom we should immediately set down under the head of ‘old boys’ and a column of most extensive dimensions the old boys would require  to what precise causes the rapid advance of oldboy population is to be traced we are unable to determine  it would be an interesting and curious speculation but as we have not sufficient space to devote to it here we simply state the fact that the numbers of the old boys have been gradually augmenting within the last few years and that they are at this moment alarmingly on the increase  upon a general review of the subject and without considering it minutely in detail we should be disposed to subdivide the old boys into two distinct classes—the gay old boys and the steady old boys  the gay old boys are paunchy old men in the disguise of young ones who frequent the quadrant and regentstreet in the daytime the theatres especially theatres under lady management at night and who assume all the foppishness and levity of boys without the excuse of youth or inexperience  the steady old boys are certain stout old gentlemen of clean appearance who are always to be seen in the same taverns at the same hours every evening smoking and drinking in the same company  there was once a fine collection of old boys to be seen round the circular table at offley’s every night between the hours of halfpast eight and halfpast eleven  we have lost sight of them for some time there were and may be still for aught we know two splendid specimens in full blossom at the rainbow tavern in fleetstreet who always used to sit in the box nearest the fireplace and smoked long cherrystick pipes which went under the table with the bowls resting on the floor  grand old boys they were—fat redfaced whiteheaded old fellows—always there—one on one side the table and the other opposite—puffing and drinking away in great state  everybody knew them and it was supposed by some people that they were both immortal  mr john dounce was an old boy of the latter class we don’t mean immortal but steady a retired glove and braces maker a widower resident with three daughters—all grown up and all unmarried—in cursitorstreet chancerylane  he was a short round largefaced tubbish sort of man with a broadbrimmed hat and a square coat and had that grave but confident kind of roll peculiar to old boys in general regular as clockwork—breakfast at nine—dress and tittivate a little—down to the sir somebody’s head—a glass of ale and the paper—come back again and take daughters out for a walk—dinner at three—glass of grog and pipe—nap—tea—little walk—sir somebody’s head again—capital house—delightful evenings  there were mr harris the lawstationer and mr jennings the robemaker two jolly young fellows like himself and jones the barrister’s clerk—rum fellow that jones—capital company—full of anecdote—and there they sat every night till just ten minutes before twelve drinking their brandyandwater and smoking their pipes and telling stories and enjoying themselves with a kind of solemn joviality particularly edifying  sometimes jones would propose a halfprice visit to drury lane or covent garden to see two acts of a fiveact play and a new farce perhaps or a ballet on which occasions the whole four of them went together none of your hurrying and nonsense but having their brandyandwater first comfortably and ordering a steak and some oysters for their supper against they came back and then walking coolly into the pit when the ‘rush’ had gone in as all sensible people do and did when mr dounce was a young man except when the celebrated master betty was at the height of his popularity and then sir—then—mr dounce perfectly well remembered getting a holiday from business and going to the pit doors at eleven o’clock in the forenoon and waiting there till six in the afternoon with some sandwiches in a pockethandkerchief and some wine in a phial and fainting after all with the heat and fatigue before the play began in which situation he was lifted out of the pit into one of the dress boxes sir by five of the finest women of that day sir who compassionated his situation and administered restoratives and sent a black servant six foot high in blue and silver livery next morning with their compliments and to know how he found himself sir—by g between the acts mr dounce and mr harris and mr jennings used to stand up and look round the house and jones—knowing fellow that jones—knew everybody—pointed out the fashionable and celebrated lady soandso in the boxes at the mention of whose name mr dounce after brushing up his hair and adjusting his neckerchief would inspect the aforesaid lady soandso through an immense glass and remark either that she was a ‘fine woman—very fine woman indeed’ or that ‘there might be a little more of her eh jones’  just as the case might happen to be  when the dancing began john dounce and the other old boys were particularly anxious to see what was going forward on the stage and jones—wicked dog that jones—whispered little critical remarks into the ears of john dounce which john dounce retailed to mr harris and mr harris to mr jennings and then they all four laughed until the tears ran down out of their eyes  when the curtain fell they walked back together two and two to the steaks and oysters and when they came to the second glass of brandyandwater jones—hoaxing scamp that jones—used to recount how he had observed a lady in white feathers in one of the pit boxes gazing intently on mr dounce all the evening and how he had caught mr dounce whenever he thought no one was looking at him bestowing ardent looks of intense devotion on the lady in return on which mr harris and mr jennings used to laugh very heartily and john dounce more heartily than either of them acknowledging however that the time had been when he might have done such things upon which mr jones used to poke him in the ribs and tell him he had been a sad dog in his time which john dounce with chuckles confessed  and after mr harris and mr jennings had preferred their claims to the character of having been sad dogs too they separated harmoniously and trotted home  the decrees of fate and the means by which they are brought about are mysterious and inscrutable  john dounce had led this life for twenty years and upwards without wish for change or care for variety when his whole social system was suddenly upset and turned completely topsyturvy—not by an earthquake or some other dreadful convulsion of nature as the reader would be inclined to suppose but by the simple agency of an oyster and thus it happened  mr john dounce was returning one night from the sir somebody’s head to his residence in cursitorstreet—not tipsy but rather excited for it was mr jennings’s birthday and they had had a brace of partridges for supper and a brace of extra glasses afterwards and jones had been more than ordinarily amusing—when his eyes rested on a newlyopened oystershop on a magnificent scale with natives laid one deep in circular marble basins in the windows together with little round barrels of oysters directed to lords and baronets and colonels and captains in every part of the habitable globe  behind the natives were the barrels and behind the barrels was a young lady of about fiveandtwenty all in blue and all alone—splendid creature charming face and lovely figure  it is difficult to say whether mr john dounce’s red countenance illuminated as it was by the flickering gaslight in the window before which he paused excited the lady’s risibility or whether a natural exuberance of animal spirits proved too much for that staidness of demeanour which the forms of society rather dictatorially prescribe  but certain it is that the lady smiled then put her finger upon her lip with a striking recollection of what was due to herself and finally retired in oysterlike bashfulness to the very back of the counter  the saddog sort of feeling came strongly upon john dounce he lingered—the lady in blue made no sign  he coughed—still she came not  he entered the shop  ‘can you open me an oyster my dear’ said mr john dounce  ‘dare say i can sir’ replied the lady in blue with playfulness  and mr john dounce eat one oyster and then looked at the young lady and then eat another and then squeezed the young lady’s hand as she was opening the third and so forth until he had devoured a dozen of those at eightpence in less than no time  ‘can you open me halfadozen more my dear’ inquired mr john dounce  ‘i’ll see what i can do for you sir’ replied the young lady in blue even more bewitchingly than before and mr john dounce eat halfadozen more of those at eightpence  ‘you couldn’t manage to get me a glass of brandyandwater my dear i suppose’ said mr john dounce when he had finished the oysters in a tone which clearly implied his supposition that she could  ‘i’ll see sir’ said the young lady and away she ran out of the shop and down the street her long auburn ringlets shaking in the wind in the most enchanting manner and back she came again tripping over the coalcellar lids like a whippingtop with a tumbler of brandyandwater which mr john dounce insisted on her taking a share of as it was regular ladies’ grog—hot strong sweet and plenty of it  so the young lady sat down with mr john dounce in a little red box with a green curtain and took a small sip of the brandyandwater and a small look at mr john dounce and then turned her head away and went through various other seriopantomimic fascinations which forcibly reminded mr john dounce of the first time he courted his first wife and which made him feel more affectionate than ever in pursuance of which affection and actuated by which feeling mr john dounce sounded the young lady on her matrimonial engagements when the young lady denied having formed any such engagements at all—she couldn’t abear the men they were such deceivers thereupon mr john dounce inquired whether this sweeping condemnation was meant to include other than very young men on which the young lady blushed deeply—at least she turned away her head and said mr john dounce had made her blush so of course she did blush—and mr john dounce was a long time drinking the brandyandwater and at last john dounce went home to bed and dreamed of his first wife and his second wife and the young lady and partridges and oysters and brandyandwater and disinterested attachments  the next morning john dounce was rather feverish with the extra brandyandwater of the previous night and partly in the hope of cooling himself with an oyster and partly with the view of ascertaining whether he owed the young lady anything or not went back to the oystershop  if the young lady had appeared beautiful by night she was perfectly irresistible by day and from this time forward a change came over the spirit of john dounce’s dream  he bought shirtpins wore a ring on his third finger read poetry bribed a cheap miniaturepainter to perpetrate a faint resemblance to a youthful face with a curtain over his head six large books in the background and an open country in the distance this he called his portrait ‘went on’ altogether in such an uproarious manner that the three miss dounces went off on small pensions he having made the tenement in cursitorstreet too warm to contain them and in short comported and demeaned himself in every respect like an unmitigated old saracen as he was  as to his ancient friends the other old boys at the sir somebody’s head he dropped off from them by gradual degrees for even when he did go there jones—vulgar fellow that jones—persisted in asking ‘when it was to be’ and ‘whether he was to have any gloves’ together with other inquiries of an equally offensive nature at which not only harris laughed but jennings also so he cut the two altogether and attached himself solely to the blue young lady at the smart oystershop  now comes the moral of the story—for it has a moral after all  the lastmentioned young lady having derived sufficient profit and emolument from john dounce’s attachment not only refused when matters came to a crisis to take him for better for worse but expressly declared to use her own forcible words that she ‘wouldn’t have him at no price’ and john dounce having lost his old friends alienated his relations and rendered himself ridiculous to everybody made offers successively to a schoolmistress a landlady a feminine tobacconist and a housekeeper and being directly rejected by each and every of them was accepted by his cook with whom he now lives a henpecked husband a melancholy monument of antiquated misery and a living warning to all uxorious old boys    chapter viii—the mistaken milliner  a tale of ambition   miss amelia martin was pale tallish thin and twoandthirty—what illnatured people would call plain and police reports interesting  she was a milliner and dressmaker living on her business and not above it if you had been a young lady in service and had wanted miss martin as a great many young ladies in service did you would just have stepped up in the evening to number fortyseven drummondstreet georgestreet eustonsquare and after casting your eye on a brass doorplate one foot ten by one and a half ornamented with a great brass knob at each of the four corners and bearing the inscription ‘miss martin millinery and dressmaking in all its branches’ you’d just have knocked two loud knocks at the streetdoor and down would have come miss martin herself in a merino gown of the newest fashion black velvet bracelets on the genteelest principle and other little elegancies of the most approved description  if miss martin knew the young lady who called or if the young lady who called had been recommended by any other young lady whom miss martin knew miss martin would forthwith show her upstairs into the twopair front and chat she would—so kind and so comfortable—it really wasn’t like a matter of business she was so friendly and then miss martin after contemplating the figure and general appearance of the young lady in service with great apparent admiration would say how well she would look to be sure in a low dress with short sleeves made very full in the skirts with four tucks in the bottom to which the young lady in service would reply in terms expressive of her entire concurrence in the notion and of the virtuous indignation with which she reflected on the tyranny of ‘missis’ who wouldn’t allow a young girl to wear a short sleeve of an arternoon—no nor nothing smart not even a pair of earrings let alone hiding people’s heads of hair under them frightful caps  at the termination of this complaint miss amelia martin would distantly suggest certain dark suspicions that some people were jealous on account of their own daughters and were obliged to keep their servants’ charms under for fear they should get married first which was no uncommon circumstance—leastways she had known two or three young ladies in service who had married a great deal better than their missises and they were not very goodlooking either and then the young lady would inform miss martin in confidence that how one of their young ladies was engaged to a young man and was agoing to be married and missis was so proud about it there was no bearing of her but how she needn’t hold her head quite so high neither for after all he was only a clerk  and after expressing due contempt for clerks in general and the engaged clerk in particular and the highest opinion possible of themselves and each other miss martin and the young lady in service would bid each other good night in a friendly but perfectly genteel manner and the one went back to her ‘place’ and the other to her room on the secondfloor front  there is no saying how long miss amelia martin might have continued this course of life how extensive a connection she might have established among young ladies in service or what amount her demands upon their quarterly receipts might have ultimately attained had not an unforeseen train of circumstances directed her thoughts to a sphere of action very different from dressmaking or millinery  a friend of miss martin’s who had long been keeping company with an ornamental painter and decorator’s journeyman at last consented on being at last asked to do so to name the day which would make the aforesaid journeyman a happy husband  it was a monday that was appointed for the celebration of the nuptials and miss amelia martin was invited among others to honour the weddingdinner with her presence  it was a charming party somerstown the locality and a front parlour the apartment  the ornamental painter and decorator’s journeyman had taken a house—no lodgings nor vulgarity of that kind but a house—four beautiful rooms and a delightful little washhouse at the end of the passage—which was the most convenient thing in the world for the bridesmaids could sit in the front parlour and receive the company and then run into the little washhouse and see how the pudding and boiled pork were getting on in the copper and then pop back into the parlour again as snug and comfortable as possible  and such a parlour as it was  beautiful kidderminster carpet—six brannew canebottomed stained chairs—three wineglasses and a tumbler on each sideboard—farmer’s girl and farmer’s boy on the mantelpiece girl tumbling over a stile and boy spitting himself on the handle of a pitchfork—long white dimity curtains in the window—and in short everything on the most genteel scale imaginable  then the dinner  there was baked leg of mutton at the top boiled leg of mutton at the bottom pair of fowls and leg of pork in the middle porterpots at the corners pepper mustard and vinegar in the centre vegetables on the floor and plumpudding and applepie and tartlets without number to say nothing of cheese and celery and watercresses and all that sort of thing  as to the company  miss amelia martin herself declared on a subsequent occasion that much as she had heard of the ornamental painter’s journeyman’s connexion she never could have supposed it was half so genteel  there was his father such a funny old gentleman—and his mother such a dear old lady—and his sister such a charming girl—and his brother such a manlylooking young man—with such a eye  but even all these were as nothing when compared with his musical friends mr and mrs jennings rodolph from white conduit with whom the ornamental painter’s journeyman had been fortunate enough to contract an intimacy while engaged in decorating the concertroom of that noble institution  to hear them sing separately was divine but when they went through the tragic duet of ‘red ruffian retire’ it was as miss martin afterwards remarked ‘thrilling’  and why as mr jennings rodolph observed why were they not engaged at one of the patent theatres  if he was to be told that their voices were not powerful enough to fill the house his only reply was that he would back himself for any amount to fill russellsquare—a statement in which the company after hearing the duet expressed their full belief so they all said it was shameful treatment and both mr and mrs jennings rodolph said it was shameful too and mr jennings rodolph looked very serious and said he knew who his malignant opponents were but they had better take care how far they went for if they irritated him too much he had not quite made up his mind whether he wouldn’t bring the subject before parliament and they all agreed that it ‘’ud serve ’em quite right and it was very proper that such people should be made an example of’  so mr jennings rodolph said he’d think of it  when the conversation resumed its former tone mr jennings rodolph claimed his right to call upon a lady and the right being conceded trusted miss martin would favour the company—a proposal which met with unanimous approbation whereupon miss martin after sundry hesitatings and coughings with a preparatory choke or two and an introductory declaration that she was frightened to death to attempt it before such great judges of the art commenced a species of treble chirruping containing frequent allusions to some young gentleman of the name of henery with an occasional reference to madness and broken hearts  mr jennings rodolph frequently interrupted the progress of the song by ejaculating ‘beautiful’—‘charming’—‘brilliant’—‘oh splendid’ c and at its close the admiration of himself and his lady knew no bounds  ‘did you ever hear so sweet a voice my dear’ inquired mr jennings rodolph of mrs jennings rodolph  ‘never indeed i never did love’ replied mrs jennings rodolph  ‘don’t you think miss martin with a little cultivation would be very like signora marra boni my dear’ asked mr jennings rodolph  ‘just exactly the very thing that struck me my love’ answered mrs jennings rodolph  and thus the time passed away mr jennings rodolph played tunes on a walkingstick and then went behind the parlourdoor and gave his celebrated imitations of actors edgetools and animals miss martin sang several other songs with increased admiration every time and even the funny old gentleman began singing  his song had properly seven verses but as he couldn’t recollect more than the first one he sang that over seven times apparently very much to his own personal gratification  and then all the company sang the national anthem with national independence—each for himself without reference to the other—and finally separated all declaring that they never had spent so pleasant an evening and miss martin inwardly resolving to adopt the advice of mr jennings rodolph and to ‘come out’ without delay  now ‘coming out’ either in acting or singing or society or facetiousness or anything else is all very well and remarkably pleasant to the individual principally concerned if he or she can but manage to come out with a burst and being out to keep out and not go in again but it does unfortunately happen that both consummations are extremely difficult to accomplish and that the difficulties of getting out at all in the first instance and if you surmount them of keeping out in the second are pretty much on a par and no slight ones either—and so miss amelia martin shortly discovered  it is a singular fact there being ladies in the case that miss amelia martin’s principal foible was vanity and the leading characteristic of mrs jennings rodolph an attachment to dress  dismal wailings were heard to issue from the secondfloor front of number fortyseven drummondstreet georgestreet eustonsquare it was miss martin practising halfsuppressed murmurs disturbed the calm dignity of the white conduit orchestra at the commencement of the season  it was the appearance of mrs jennings rodolph in full dress that occasioned them  miss martin studied incessantly—the practising was the consequence  mrs jennings rodolph taught gratuitously now and then—the dresses were the result  weeks passed away the white conduit season had begun and progressed and was more than half over  the dressmaking business had fallen off from neglect and its profits had dwindled away almost imperceptibly  a benefitnight approached mr jennings rodolph yielded to the earnest solicitations of miss amelia martin and introduced her personally to the ‘comic gentleman’ whose benefit it was  the comic gentleman was all smiles and blandness—he had composed a duet expressly for the occasion and miss martin should sing it with him  the night arrived there was an immense room—ninetyseven sixpenn’orths of ginandwater thirtytwo small glasses of brandyandwater fiveandtwenty bottled ales and fortyone neguses and the ornamental painter’s journeyman with his wife and a select circle of acquaintance were seated at one of the sidetables near the orchestra  the concert began  song—sentimental—by a lighthaired young gentleman in a blue coat and bright basket buttons—applause  another song doubtful by another gentleman in another blue coat and more bright basket buttons—increased applause duet mr jennings rodolph and mrs jennings rodolph ‘red ruffian retire’—great applause  solo miss julia montague positively on this occasion only—‘i am a friar’—enthusiasm  original duet comic—mr h taplin the comic gentleman and miss martin—‘the time of day’ ‘brayvo—brayvo’ cried the ornamental painter’s journeyman’s party as miss martin was gracefully led in by the comic gentleman  ‘go to work harry’ cried the comic gentleman’s personal friends  ‘taptaptap’ went the leader’s bow on the musicdesk  the symphony began and was soon afterwards followed by a faint kind of ventriloquial chirping proceeding apparently from the deepest recesses of the interior of miss amelia martin  ‘sing out’—shouted one gentleman in a white greatcoat ‘don’t be afraid to put the steam on old gal’ exclaimed another ‘sssssss’went the fiveandtwenty bottled ales  ‘shame shame’ remonstrated the ornamental painter’s journeyman’s party—‘ssss’ went the bottled ales again accompanied by all the gins and a majority of the brandies  ‘turn them geese out’ cried the ornamental painter’s journeyman’s party with great indignation  ‘sing out’ whispered mr jennings rodolph  ‘so i do’ responded miss amelia martin  ‘sing louder’ said mrs jennings rodolph  ‘i can’t’ replied miss amelia martin  ‘off off off’ cried the rest of the audience  ‘brayvo’ shouted the painter’s party  it wouldn’t do—miss amelia martin left the orchestra with much less ceremony than she had entered it and as she couldn’t sing out never came out  the general good humour was not restored until mr jennings rodolph had become purple in the face by imitating divers quadrupeds for half an hour without being able to render himself audible and to this day neither has miss amelia martin’s good humour been restored nor the dresses made for and presented to mrs jennings rodolph nor the local abilities which mr jennings rodolph once staked his professional reputation that miss martin possessed    chapter ix—the dancing academy   of all the dancing academies that ever were established there never was one more popular in its immediate vicinity than signor billsmethi’s of the ‘king’s theatre’  it was not in springgardens or newmanstreet or bernersstreet or gowerstreet or charlottestreet or percystreet or any other of the numerous streets which have been devoted time out of mind to professional people dispensaries and boardinghouses it was not in the westend at all—it rather approximated to the eastern portion of london being situated in the populous and improving neighbourhood of gray’sinnlane  it was not a dear dancing academy—fourandsixpence a quarter is decidedly cheap upon the whole  it was very select the number of pupils being strictly limited to seventyfive and a quarter’s payment in advance being rigidly exacted  there was public tuition and private tuition—an assemblyroom and a parlour  signor billsmethi’s family were always thrown in with the parlour and included in parlour price that is to say a private pupil had signor billsmethi’s parlour to dance in and signor billsmethi’s family to dance with and when he had been sufficiently broken in in the parlour he began to run in couples in the assemblyroom  such was the dancing academy of signor billsmethi when mr augustus cooper of fetterlane first saw an unstamped advertisement walking leisurely down holbornhill announcing to the world that signor billsmethi of the king’s theatre intended opening for the season with a grand ball  now mr augustus cooper was in the oil and colour line—just of age with a little money a little business and a little mother who having managed her husband and his business in his lifetime took to managing her son and his business after his decease and so somehow or other he had been cooped up in the little back parlour behind the shop on weekdays and in a little deal box without a lid called by courtesy a pew at bethel chapel on sundays and had seen no more of the world than if he had been an infant all his days whereas young white at the gasfitter’s over the way three years younger than him had been flaring away like winkin’—going to the theatre—supping at harmonic meetings—eating oysters by the barrel—drinking stout by the gallon—even out all night and coming home as cool in the morning as if nothing had happened  so mr augustus cooper made up his mind that he would not stand it any longer and had that very morning expressed to his mother a firm determination to be ‘blowed’ in the event of his not being instantly provided with a streetdoor key  and he was walking down holbornhill thinking about all these things and wondering how he could manage to get introduced into genteel society for the first time when his eyes rested on signor billsmethi’s announcement which it immediately struck him was just the very thing he wanted for he should not only be able to select a genteel circle of acquaintance at once out of the fiveandseventy pupils at fourandsixpence a quarter but should qualify himself at the same time to go through a hornpipe in private society with perfect ease to himself and great delight to his friends so he stopped the unstamped advertisement—an animated sandwich composed of a boy between two boards—and having procured a very small card with the signor’s address indented thereon walked straight at once to the signor’s house—and very fast he walked too for fear the list should be filled up and the fiveandseventy completed before he got there  the signor was at home and what was still more gratifying he was an englishman  such a nice man—and so polite  the list was not full but it was a most extraordinary circumstance that there was only just one vacancy and even that one would have been filled up that very morning only signor billsmethi was dissatisfied with the reference and being very much afraid that the lady wasn’t select wouldn’t take her  ‘and very much delighted i am mr cooper’ said signor billsmethi ‘that i did not take her  i assure you mr cooper—i don’t say it to flatter you for i know you’re above it—that i consider myself extremely fortunate in having a gentleman of your manners and appearance sir’  ‘i am very glad of it too sir’ said augustus cooper  ‘and i hope we shall be better acquainted sir’ said signor billsmethi  ‘and i’m sure i hope we shall too sir’ responded augustus cooper  just then the door opened and in came a young lady with her hair curled in a crop all over her head and her shoes tied in sandals all over her ankles  ‘don’t run away my dear’ said signor billsmethi for the young lady didn’t know mr cooper was there when she ran in and was going to run out again in her modesty all in confusionlike  ‘don’t run away my dear’ said signor billsmethi ‘this is mr cooper—mr cooper of fetterlane  mr cooper my daughter sir—miss billsmethi sir who i hope will have the pleasure of dancing many a quadrille minuet gavotte countrydance fandango doublehornpipe and farinagholkajingo with you sir  she dances them all sir and so shall you sir before you’re a quarter older sir’  and signor bellsmethi slapped mr augustus cooper on the back as if he had known him a dozen years—so friendly—and mr cooper bowed to the young lady and the young lady curtseyed to him and signor billsmethi said they were as handsome a pair as ever he’d wish to see upon which the young lady exclaimed ‘lor pa’ and blushed as red as mr cooper himself—you might have thought they were both standing under a red lamp at a chemist’s shop and before mr cooper went away it was settled that he should join the family circle that very night—taking them just as they were—no ceremony nor nonsense of that kind—and learn his positions in order that he might lose no time and be able to come out at the forthcoming ball  well mr augustus cooper went away to one of the cheap shoemakers’ shops in holborn where gentlemen’s dresspumps are sevenandsixpence and men’s strong walking just nothing at all and bought a pair of the regular sevenandsixpenny longquartered townmades in which he astonished himself quite as much as his mother and sallied forth to signor billsmethi’s  there were four other private pupils in the parlour two ladies and two gentlemen  such nice people  not a bit of pride about them  one of the ladies in particular who was in training for a columbine was remarkably affable and she and miss billsmethi took such an interest in mr augustus cooper and joked and smiled and looked so bewitching that he got quite at home and learnt his steps in no time  after the practising was over signor billsmethi and miss billsmethi and master billsmethi and a young lady and the two ladies and the two gentlemen danced a quadrille—none of your slipping and sliding about but regular warm work flying into corners and diving among chairs and shooting out at the door—something like dancing signor billsmethi in particular notwithstanding his having a little fiddle to play all the time was out on the landing every figure and master billsmethi when everybody else was breathless danced a hornpipe with a cane in his hand and a cheeseplate on his head to the unqualified admiration of the whole company  then signor billsmethi insisted as they were so happy that they should all stay to supper and proposed sending master billsmethi for the beer and spirits whereupon the two gentlemen swore ‘strike ’em wulgar if they’d stand that’ and were just going to quarrel who should pay for it when mr augustus cooper said he would if they’d have the kindness to allow him—and they had the kindness to allow him and master billsmethi brought the beer in a can and the rum in a quart pot  they had a regular night of it and miss billsmethi squeezed mr augustus cooper’s hand under the table and mr augustus cooper returned the squeeze and returned home too at something to six o’clock in the morning when he was put to bed by main force by the apprentice after repeatedly expressing an uncontrollable desire to pitch his revered parent out of the secondfloor window and to throttle the apprentice with his own neckhandkerchief  weeks had worn on and the sevenandsixpenny townmades had nearly worn out when the night arrived for the grand dressball at which the whole of the fiveandseventy pupils were to meet together for the first time that season and to take out some portion of their respective fourandsixpences in lampoil and fiddlers  mr augustus cooper had ordered a new coat for the occasion—a twopoundtenner from turnstile it was his first appearance in public and after a grand sicilian shawldance by fourteen young ladies in character he was to open the quadrille department with miss billsmethi herself with whom he had become quite intimate since his first introduction  it was a night everything was admirably arranged  the sandwichboy took the hats and bonnets at the streetdoor there was a turnup bedstead in the back parlour on which miss billsmethi made tea and coffee for such of the gentlemen as chose to pay for it and such of the ladies as the gentlemen treated red portwine negus and lemonade were handed round at eighteenpence a head and in pursuance of a previous engagement with the publichouse at the corner of the street an extra potboy was laid on for the occasion  in short nothing could exceed the arrangements except the company  such ladies  such pink silk stockings  such artificial flowers  such a number of cabs  no sooner had one cab set down a couple of ladies than another cab drove up and set down another couple of ladies and they all knew not only one another but the majority of the gentlemen into the bargain which made it all as pleasant and lively as could be  signor billsmethi in black tights with a large blue bow in his buttonhole introduced the ladies to such of the gentlemen as were strangers and the ladies talked away—and laughed they did—it was delightful to see them  as to the shawldance it was the most exciting thing that ever was beheld there was such a whisking and rustling and fanning and getting ladies into a tangle with artificial flowers and then disentangling them again  and as to mr augustus cooper’s share in the quadrille he got through it admirably  he was missing from his partner now and then certainly and discovered on such occasions to be either dancing with laudable perseverance in another set or sliding about in perspective without any definite object but generally speaking they managed to shove him through the figure until he turned up in the right place  be this as it may when he had finished a great many ladies and gentlemen came up and complimented him very much and said they had never seen a beginner do anything like it before and mr augustus cooper was perfectly satisfied with himself and everybody else into the bargain and ‘stood’ considerable quantities of spiritsandwater negus and compounds for the use and behoof of two or three dozen very particular friends selected from the select circle of fiveandseventy pupils  now whether it was the strength of the compounds or the beauty of the ladies or what not it did so happen that mr augustus cooper encouraged rather than repelled the very flattering attentions of a young lady in brown gauze over white calico who had appeared particularly struck with him from the first and when the encouragements had been prolonged for some time miss billsmethi betrayed her spite and jealousy thereat by calling the young lady in brown gauze a ‘creeter’ which induced the young lady in brown gauze to retort in certain sentences containing a taunt founded on the payment of fourandsixpence a quarter which reference mr augustus cooper being then and there in a state of considerable bewilderment expressed his entire concurrence in  miss billsmethi thus renounced forthwith began screaming in the loudest key of her voice at the rate of fourteen screams a minute and being unsuccessful in an onslaught on the eyes and face first of the lady in gauze and then of mr augustus cooper called distractedly on the other threeandseventy pupils to furnish her with oxalic acid for her own private drinking and the call not being honoured made another rush at mr cooper and then had her staylace cut and was carried off to bed mr augustus cooper not being remarkable for quickness of apprehension was at a loss to understand what all this meant until signor billsmethi explained it in a most satisfactory manner by stating to the pupils that mr augustus cooper had made and confirmed divers promises of marriage to his daughter on divers occasions and had now basely deserted her on which the indignation of the pupils became universal and as several chivalrous gentlemen inquired rather pressingly of mr augustus cooper whether he required anything for his own use or in other words whether he ‘wanted anything for himself’ he deemed it prudent to make a precipitate retreat  and the upshot of the matter was that a lawyer’s letter came next day and an action was commenced next week and that mr augustus cooper after walking twice to the serpentine for the purpose of drowning himself and coming twice back without doing it made a confidante of his mother who compromised the matter with twenty pounds from the till which made twenty pounds four shillings and sixpence paid to signor billsmethi exclusive of treats and pumps  and mr augustus cooper went back and lived with his mother and there he lives to this day and as he has lost his ambition for society and never goes into the world he will never see this account of himself and will never be any the wiser    chapter x—shabbygenteel people   there are certain descriptions of people who oddly enough appear to appertain exclusively to the metropolis  you meet them every day in the streets of london but no one ever encounters them elsewhere they seem indigenous to the soil and to belong as exclusively to london as its own smoke or the dingy bricks and mortar  we could illustrate the remark by a variety of examples but in our present sketch we will only advert to one class as a specimen—that class which is so aptly and expressively designated as ‘shabbygenteel’  now shabby people god knows may be found anywhere and genteel people are not articles of greater scarcity out of london than in it but this compound of the two—this shabbygentility—is as purely local as the statue at charingcross or the pump at aldgate  it is worthy of remark too that only men are shabbygenteel a woman is always either dirty and slovenly in the extreme or neat and respectable however povertystricken in appearance  a very poor man ‘who has seen better days’ as the phrase goes is a strange compound of dirtyslovenliness and wretched attempts at faded smartness  we will endeavour to explain our conception of the term which forms the title of this paper  if you meet a man lounging up drurylane or leaning with his back against a post in longacre with his hands in the pockets of a pair of drab trousers plentifully besprinkled with greasespots the trousers made very full over the boots and ornamented with two cords down the outside of each leg—wearing also what has been a brown coat with bright buttons and a hat very much pinched up at the side cocked over his right eye—don’t pity him  he is not shabbygenteel  the ‘harmonic meetings’ at some fourthrate publichouse or the purlieus of a private theatre are his chosen haunts he entertains a rooted antipathy to any kind of work and is on familiar terms with several pantomime men at the large houses  but if you see hurrying along a bystreet keeping as close as he can to the arearailings a man of about forty or fifty clad in an old rusty suit of threadbare black cloth which shines with constant wear as if it had been beeswaxed—the trousers tightly strapped down partly for the look of the thing and partly to keep his old shoes from slipping off at the heels—if you observe too that his yellowishwhite neckerchief is carefully pinned up to conceal the tattered garment underneath and that his hands are encased in the remains of an old pair of beaver gloves you may set him down as a shabbygenteel man  a glance at that depressed face and timorous air of conscious poverty will make your heart ache—always supposing that you are neither a philosopher nor a political economist  we were once haunted by a shabbygenteel man he was bodily present to our senses all day and he was in our mind’s eye all night  the man of whom sir walter scott speaks in his demonology did not suffer half the persecution from his imaginary gentlemanusher in black velvet that we sustained from our friend in quondam black cloth  he first attracted our notice by sitting opposite to us in the readingroom at the british museum and what made the man more remarkable was that he always had before him a couple of shabbygenteel books—two old dog’seared folios in mouldy wormeaten covers which had once been smart  he was in his chair every morning just as the clock struck ten he was always the last to leave the room in the afternoon and when he did he quitted it with the air of a man who knew not where else to go for warmth and quiet  there he used to sit all day as close to the table as possible in order to conceal the lack of buttons on his coat with his old hat carefully deposited at his feet where he evidently flattered himself it escaped observation  about two o’clock you would see him munching a french roll or a penny loaf not taking it boldly out of his pocket at once like a man who knew he was only making a lunch but breaking off little bits in his pocket and eating them by stealth  he knew too well it was his dinner  when we first saw this poor object we thought it quite impossible that his attire could ever become worse  we even went so far as to speculate on the possibility of his shortly appearing in a decent secondhand suit we knew nothing about the matter he grew more and more shabbygenteel every day  the buttons dropped off his waistcoat one by one then he buttoned his coat and when one side of the coat was reduced to the same condition as the waistcoat he buttoned it over—on the other side  he looked somewhat better at the beginning of the week than at the conclusion because the neckerchief though yellow was not quite so dingy and in the midst of all this wretchedness he never appeared without gloves and straps  he remained in this state for a week or two at length one of the buttons on the back of the coat fell off and then the man himself disappeared and we thought he was dead  we were sitting at the same table about a week after his disappearance and as our eyes rested on his vacant chair we insensibly fell into a train of meditation on the subject of his retirement from public life we were wondering whether he had hung himself or thrown himself off a bridge—whether he really was dead or had only been arrested—when our conjectures were suddenly set at rest by the entry of the man himself he had undergone some strange metamorphosis and walked up the centre of the room with an air which showed he was fully conscious of the improvement in his appearance  it was very odd  his clothes were a fine deep glossy black and yet they looked like the same suit nay there were the very darns with which old acquaintance had made us familiar  the hat too—nobody could mistake the shape of that hat with its high crown gradually increasing in circumference towards the top long service had imparted to it a reddishbrown tint but now it was as black as the coat  the truth flashed suddenly upon us—they had been ‘revived’  it is a deceitful liquid that black and blue reviver we have watched its effects on many a shabbygenteel man  it betrays its victims into a temporary assumption of importance possibly into the purchase of a new pair of gloves or a cheap stock or some other trifling article of dress  it elevates their spirits for a week only to depress them if possible below their original level  it was so in this case the transient dignity of the unhappy man decreased in exact proportion as the ‘reviver’ wore off  the knees of the unmentionables and the elbows of the coat and the seams generally soon began to get alarmingly white the hat was once more deposited under the table and its owner crept into his seat as quietly as ever  there was a week of incessant small rain and mist  at its expiration the ‘reviver’ had entirely vanished and the shabbygenteel man never afterwards attempted to effect any improvement in his outward appearance  it would be difficult to name any particular part of town as the principal resort of shabbygenteel men  we have met a great many persons of this description in the neighbourhood of the inns of court  they may be met with in holborn between eight and ten any morning and whoever has the curiosity to enter the insolvent debtors’ court will observe both among spectators and practitioners a great variety of them  we never went on ‘change by any chance without seeing some shabbygenteel men and we have often wondered what earthly business they can have there  they will sit there for hours leaning on great dropsical mildewed umbrellas or eating abernethy biscuits  nobody speaks to them nor they to any one  on consideration we remember to have occasionally seen two shabbygenteel men conversing together on ‘change but our experience assures us that this is an uncommon circumstance occasioned by the offer of a pinch of snuff or some such civility  it would be a task of equal difficulty either to assign any particular spot for the residence of these beings or to endeavour to enumerate their general occupations  we were never engaged in business with more than one shabbygenteel man and he was a drunken engraver and lived in a damp backparlour in a new row of houses at camdentown half street half brickfield somewhere near the canal  a shabbygenteel man may have no occupation or he may be a corn agent or a coal agent or a wine merchant or a collector of debts or a broker’s assistant or a brokendown attorney  he may be a clerk of the lowest description or a contributor to the press of the same grade  whether our readers have noticed these men in their walks as often as we have we know not this we know—that the miserably poor man no matter whether he owes his distresses to his own conduct or that of others who feels his poverty and vainly strives to conceal it is one of the most pitiable objects in human nature  such objects with few exceptions are shabbygenteel people    chapter xi—making a night of it   damon and pythias were undoubtedly very good fellows in their way the former for his extreme readiness to put in special bail for a friend and the latter for a certain trumplike punctuality in turning up just in the very nick of time scarcely less remarkable  many points in their character have however grown obsolete  damons are rather hard to find in these days of imprisonment for debt except the sham ones and they cost halfacrown and as to the pythiases the few that have existed in these degenerate times have had an unfortunate knack of making themselves scarce at the very moment when their appearance would have been strictly classical  if the actions of these heroes however can find no parallel in modern times their friendship can  we have damon and pythias on the one hand  we have potter and smithers on the other and lest the two lastmentioned names should never have reached the ears of our unenlightened readers we can do no better than make them acquainted with the owners thereof  mr thomas potter then was a clerk in the city and mr robert smithers was a ditto in the same their incomes were limited but their friendship was unbounded  they lived in the same street walked into town every morning at the same hour dined at the same slapbang every day and revelled in each other’s company very night  they were knit together by the closest ties of intimacy and friendship or as mr thomas potter touchingly observed they were ‘thickandthin pals and nothing but it’ there was a spice of romance in mr smithers’s disposition a ray of poetry a gleam of misery a sort of consciousness of he didn’t exactly know what coming across him he didn’t precisely know why—which stood out in fine relief against the offhand dashing amateurpickpocketsortofmanner which distinguished mr potter in an eminent degree  the peculiarity of their respective dispositions extended itself to their individual costume  mr smithers generally appeared in public in a surtout and shoes with a narrow black neckerchief and a brown hat very much turned up at the sides—peculiarities which mr potter wholly eschewed for it was his ambition to do something in the celebrated ‘kiddy’ or stagecoach way and he had even gone so far as to invest capital in the purchase of a rough blue coat with wooden buttons made upon the fireman’s principle in which with the addition of a lowcrowned flowerpotsaucershaped hat he had created no inconsiderable sensation at the albion in little russellstreet and divers other places of public and fashionable resort  mr potter and mr smithers had mutually agreed that on the receipt of their quarter’s salary they would jointly and in company ‘spend the evening’—an evident misnomer—the spending applying as everybody knows not to the evening itself but to all the money the individual may chance to be possessed of on the occasion to which reference is made and they had likewise agreed that on the evening aforesaid they would ‘make a night of it’—an expressive term implying the borrowing of several hours from tomorrow morning adding them to the night before and manufacturing a compound night of the whole  the quarterday arrived at last—we say at last because quarterdays are as eccentric as comets moving wonderfully quick when you have a good deal to pay and marvellously slow when you have a little to receive mr thomas potter and mr robert smithers met by appointment to begin the evening with a dinner and a nice snug comfortable dinner they had consisting of a little procession of four chops and four kidneys following each other supported on either side by a pot of the real draught stout and attended by divers cushions of bread and wedges of cheese  when the cloth was removed mr thomas potter ordered the waiter to bring in two goes of his best scotch whiskey with warm water and sugar and a couple of his ‘very mildest’ havannahs which the waiter did  mr thomas potter mixed his grog and lighted his cigar mr robert smithers did the same and then mr thomas potter jocularly proposed as the first toast ‘the abolition of all offices whatever’ not sinecures but countinghouses which was immediately drunk by mr robert smithers with enthusiastic applause  so they went on talking politics puffing cigars and sipping whiskeyandwater until the ‘goes’—most appropriately so called—were both gone which mr robert smithers perceiving immediately ordered in two more goes of the best scotch whiskey and two more of the very mildest havannahs and the goes kept coming in and the mild havannahs kept going out until what with the drinking and lighting and puffing and the stale ashes on the table and the tallowgrease on the cigars mr robert smithers began to doubt the mildness of the havannahs and to feel very much as if he had been sitting in a hackneycoach with his back to the horses  as to mr thomas potter he would keep laughing out loud and volunteering inarticulate declarations that he was ‘all right’ in proof of which he feebly bespoke the evening paper after the next gentleman but finding it a matter of some difficulty to discover any news in its columns or to ascertain distinctly whether it had any columns at all walked slowly out to look for the moon and after coming back quite pale with looking up at the sky so long and attempting to express mirth at mr robert smithers having fallen asleep by various galvanic chuckles laid his head on his arm and went to sleep also  when he awoke again mr robert smithers awoke too and they both very gravely agreed that it was extremely unwise to eat so many pickled walnuts with the chops as it was a notorious fact that they always made people queer and sleepy indeed if it had not been for the whiskey and cigars there was no knowing what harm they mightn’t have done ’em  so they took some coffee and after paying the bill—twelve and twopence the dinner and the odd tenpence for the waiter—thirteen shillings in all—started out on their expedition to manufacture a night  it was just halfpast eight so they thought they couldn’t do better than go at halfprice to the slips at the city theatre which they did accordingly  mr robert smithers who had become extremely poetical after the settlement of the bill enlivening the walk by informing mr thomas potter in confidence that he felt an inward presentiment of approaching dissolution and subsequently embellishing the theatre by falling asleep with his head and both arms gracefully drooping over the front of the boxes  such was the quiet demeanour of the unassuming smithers and such were the happy effects of scotch whiskey and havannahs on that interesting person  but mr thomas potter whose great aim it was to be considered as a ‘knowing card’ a ‘fastgoer’ and so forth conducted himself in a very different manner and commenced going very fast indeed—rather too fast at last for the patience of the audience to keep pace with him  on his first entry he contented himself by earnestly calling upon the gentlemen in the gallery to ‘flare up’ accompanying the demand with another request expressive of his wish that they would instantaneously ‘form a union’ both which requisitions were responded to in the manner most in vogue on such occasions  ‘give that dog a bone’ cried one gentleman in his shirtsleeves  ‘where have you been a having half a pint of intermediate beer’ cried a second  ‘tailor’ screamed a third  ‘barber’s clerk’ shouted a fourth ‘throw him o—ver’ roared a fifth while numerous voices concurred in desiring mr thomas potter to ‘go home to his mother’  all these taunts mr thomas potter received with supreme contempt cocking the lowcrowned hat a little more on one side whenever any reference was made to his personal appearance and standing up with his arms akimbo expressing defiance melodramatically  the overture—to which these various sounds had been an ad libitum accompaniment—concluded the second piece began and mr thomas potter emboldened by impunity proceeded to behave in a most unprecedented and outrageous manner  first of all he imitated the shake of the principal female singer then groaned at the blue fire then affected to be frightened into convulsions of terror at the appearance of the ghost and lastly not only made a running commentary in an audible voice upon the dialogue on the stage but actually awoke mr robert smithers who hearing his companion making a noise and having a very indistinct notion where he was or what was required of him immediately by way of imitating a good example set up the most unearthly unremitting and appalling howling that ever audience heard  it was too much  ‘turn them out’ was the general cry  a noise as of shuffling of feet and men being knocked up with violence against wainscoting was heard a hurried dialogue of ‘come out’—‘i won’t’—‘you shall’—‘i shan’t’—‘give me your card sir’—‘you’re a scoundrel sir’ and so forth succeeded  a round of applause betokened the approbation of the audience and mr robert smithers and mr thomas potter found themselves shot with astonishing swiftness into the road without having had the trouble of once putting foot to ground during the whole progress of their rapid descent  mr robert smithers being constitutionally one of the slowgoers and having had quite enough of fastgoing in the course of his recent expulsion to last until the quarterday then next ensuing at the very least had no sooner emerged with his companion from the precincts of miltonstreet than he proceeded to indulge in circuitous references to the beauties of sleep mingled with distant allusions to the propriety of returning to islington and testing the influence of their patent bramahs over the streetdoor locks to which they respectively belonged  mr thomas potter however was valorous and peremptory  they had come out to make a night of it and a night must be made  so mr robert smithers who was three parts dull and the other dismal despairingly assented and they went into a winevaults to get materials for assisting them in making a night where they found a good many young ladies and various old gentlemen and a plentiful sprinkling of hackneycoachmen and cabdrivers all drinking and talking together and mr thomas potter and mr robert smithers drank small glasses of brandy and large glasses of soda until they began to have a very confused idea either of things in general or of anything in particular and when they had done treating themselves they began to treat everybody else and the rest of the entertainment was a confused mixture of heads and heels black eyes and blue uniforms mud and gaslights thick doors and stone paving  then as standard novelists expressively inform us—‘all was a blank’ and in the morning the blank was filled up with the words ‘stationhouse’ and the stationhouse was filled up with mr thomas potter mr robert smithers and the major part of their winevault companions of the preceding night with a comparatively small portion of clothing of any kind  and it was disclosed at the policeoffice to the indignation of the bench and the astonishment of the spectators how one robert smithers aided and abetted by one thomas potter had knocked down and beaten in divers streets at different times five men four boys and three women how the said thomas potter had feloniously obtained possession of five doorknockers two bellhandles and a bonnet how robert smithers his friend had sworn at least forty pounds’ worth of oaths at the rate of five shillings apiece terrified whole streets full of her majesty’s subjects with awful shrieks and alarms of fire destroyed the uniforms of five policemen and committed various other atrocities too numerous to recapitulate  and the magistrate after an appropriate reprimand fined mr thomas potter and mr thomas smithers five shillings each for being what the law vulgarly terms drunk and thirtyfour pounds for seventeen assaults at forty shillings ahead with liberty to speak to the prosecutors  the prosecutors were spoken to and messrs potter and smithers lived on credit for a quarter as best they might and although the prosecutors expressed their readiness to be assaulted twice a week on the same terms they have never since been detected in ‘making a night of it’    chapter xii—the prisoners’ van   we were passing the corner of bowstreet on our return from a lounging excursion the other afternoon when a crowd assembled round the door of the policeoffice attracted our attention  we turned up the street accordingly  there were thirty or forty people standing on the pavement and half across the road and a few stragglers were patiently stationed on the opposite side of the way—all evidently waiting in expectation of some arrival  we waited too a few minutes but nothing occurred so we turned round to an unshorn sallowlooking cobbler who was standing next us with his hands under the bib of his apron and put the usual question of ‘what’s the matter’  the cobbler eyed us from head to foot with superlative contempt and laconically replied ‘nuffin’  now we were perfectly aware that if two men stop in the street to look at any given object or even to gaze in the air two hundred men will be assembled in no time but as we knew very well that no crowd of people could by possibility remain in a street for five minutes without getting up a little amusement among themselves unless they had some absorbing object in view the natural inquiry next in order was ‘what are all these people waiting here for’—‘her majesty’s carriage’ replied the cobbler  this was still more extraordinary  we could not imagine what earthly business her majesty’s carriage could have at the public office bowstreet  we were beginning to ruminate on the possible causes of such an uncommon appearance when a general exclamation from all the boys in the crowd of ‘here’s the wan’ caused us to raise our heads and look up the street  the covered vehicle in which prisoners are conveyed from the policeoffices to the different prisons was coming along at full speed it then occurred to us for the first time that her majesty’s carriage was merely another name for the prisoners’ van conferred upon it not only by reason of the superior gentility of the term but because the aforesaid van is maintained at her majesty’s expense having been originally started for the exclusive accommodation of ladies and gentlemen under the necessity of visiting the various houses of call known by the general denomination of ‘her majesty’s gaols’  the van drew up at the officedoor and the people thronged round the steps just leaving a little alley for the prisoners to pass through our friend the cobbler and the other stragglers crossed over and we followed their example  the driver and another man who had been seated by his side in front of the vehicle dismounted and were admitted into the office  the officedoor was closed after them and the crowd were on the tiptoe of expectation  after a few minutes’ delay the door again opened and the two first prisoners appeared  they were a couple of girls of whom the elder—could not be more than sixteen and the younger of whom had certainly not attained her fourteenth year  that they were sisters was evident from the resemblance which still subsisted between them though two additional years of depravity had fixed their brand upon the elder girl’s features as legibly as if a redhot iron had seared them  they were both gaudily dressed the younger one especially and although there was a strong similarity between them in both respects which was rendered the more obvious by their being handcuffed together it is impossible to conceive a greater contrast than the demeanour of the two presented  the younger girl was weeping bitterly—not for display or in the hope of producing effect but for very shame her face was buried in her handkerchief and her whole manner was but too expressive of bitter and unavailing sorrow  ‘how long are you for emily’ screamed a redfaced woman in the crowd ‘six weeks and labour’ replied the elder girl with a flaunting laugh ‘and that’s better than the stone jug anyhow the mill’s a deal better than the sessions and here’s bella agoing too for the first time  hold up your head you chicken’ she continued boisterously tearing the other girl’s handkerchief away ‘hold up your head and show ’em your face  i an’t jealous but i’m blessed if i an’t game’—‘that’s right old gal’ exclaimed a man in a paper cap who in common with the greater part of the crowd had been inexpressibly delighted with this little incident—‘right’ replied the girl ‘ah to be sure what’s the odds eh’—‘come  in with you’ interrupted the driver  ‘don’t you be in a hurry coachman’ replied the girl ‘and recollect i want to be set down in cold bath fields—large house with a high gardenwall in front you can’t mistake it  hallo  bella where are you going to—you’ll pull my precious arm off’  this was addressed to the younger girl who in her anxiety to hide herself in the caravan had ascended the steps first and forgotten the strain upon the handcuff  ‘come down and let’s show you the way’  and after jerking the miserable girl down with a force which made her stagger on the pavement she got into the vehicle and was followed by her wretched companion  these two girls had been thrown upon london streets their vices and debauchery by a sordid and rapacious mother  what the younger girl was then the elder had been once and what the elder then was the younger must soon become  a melancholy prospect but how surely to be realised a tragic drama but how often acted  turn to the prisons and police offices of london—nay look into the very streets themselves  these things pass before our eyes day after day and hour after hour—they have become such matters of course that they are utterly disregarded  the progress of these girls in crime will be as rapid as the flight of a pestilence resembling it too in its baneful influence and widespreading infection  step by step how many wretched females within the sphere of every man’s observation have become involved in a career of vice frightful to contemplate hopeless at its commencement loathsome and repulsive in its course friendless forlorn and unpitied at its miserable conclusion  there were other prisoners—boys of ten as hardened in vice as men of fifty—a houseless vagrant going joyfully to prison as a place of food and shelter handcuffed to a man whose prospects were ruined character lost and family rendered destitute by his first offence  our curiosity however was satisfied  the first group had left an impression on our mind we would gladly have avoided and would willingly have effaced  the crowd dispersed the vehicle rolled away with its load of guilt and misfortune and we saw no more of the prisoners’ van     tales   chapter i—the boardinghouse   chapter i   mrs tibbs was beyond all dispute the most tidy fidgety thrifty little personage that ever inhaled the smoke of london and the house of mrs tibbs was decidedly the neatest in all great coramstreet  the area and the areasteps and the streetdoor and the streetdoor steps and the brass handle and the doorplate and the knocker and the fanlight were all as clean and bright as indefatigable whitewashing and hearthstoning and scrubbing and rubbing could make them  the wonder was that the brass doorplate with the interesting inscription ‘mrs tibbs’ had never caught fire from constant friction so perseveringly was it polished  there were meatsafelooking blinds in the parlourwindows blue and gold curtains in the drawingroom and springroller blinds as mrs tibbs was wont in the pride of her heart to boast ‘all the way up’ the belllamp in the passage looked as clear as a soapbubble you could see yourself in all the tables and frenchpolish yourself on any one of the chairs  the banisters were beeswaxed and the very stairwires made your eyes wink they were so glittering  mrs tibbs was somewhat short of stature and mr tibbs was by no means a large man  he had moreover very short legs but by way of indemnification his face was peculiarly long  he was to his wife what the 0 is in 90—he was of some importance with her—he was nothing without her  mrs tibbs was always talking  mr tibbs rarely spoke but if it were at any time possible to put in a word when he should have said nothing at all he had that talent  mrs tibbs detested long stories and mr tibbs had one the conclusion of which had never been heard by his most intimate friends  it always began ‘i recollect when i was in the volunteer corps in eighteen hundred and six’—but as he spoke very slowly and softly and his better half very quickly and loudly he rarely got beyond the introductory sentence  he was a melancholy specimen of the storyteller   he was the wandering jew of joe millerism  mr tibbs enjoyed a small independence from the pensionlist—about 43l 15s 10d a year  his father mother and five interesting scions from the same stock drew a like sum from the revenue of a grateful country though for what particular service was never known  but as this said independence was not quite sufficient to furnish two people with all the luxuries of this life it had occurred to the busy little spouse of tibbs that the best thing she could do with a legacy of 700l would be to take and furnish a tolerable house—somewhere in that partiallyexplored tract of country which lies between the british museum and a remote village called somerstown—for the reception of boarders  great coramstreet was the spot pitched upon  the house had been furnished accordingly two female servants and a boy engaged and an advertisement inserted in the morning papers informing the public that ‘six individuals would meet with all the comforts of a cheerful musical home in a select private family residing within ten minutes’ walk of’—everywhere  answers out of number were received with all sorts of initials all the letters of the alphabet seemed to be seized with a sudden wish to go out boarding and lodging voluminous was the correspondence between mrs tibbs and the applicants and most profound was the secrecy observed  ‘e’ didn’t like this ‘i’ couldn’t think of putting up with that ‘i o u’ didn’t think the terms would suit him and ‘g r’ had never slept in a french bed  the result however was that three gentlemen became inmates of mrs tibbs’s house on terms which were ‘agreeable to all parties’  in went the advertisement again and a lady with her two daughters proposed to increase—not their families but mrs tibbs’s  ‘charming woman that mrs maplesone’ said mrs tibbs as she and her spouse were sitting by the fire after breakfast the gentlemen having gone out on their several avocations  ‘charming woman indeed’ repeated little mrs tibbs more by way of soliloquy than anything else for she never thought of consulting her husband  ‘and the two daughters are delightful  we must have some fish today they’ll join us at dinner for the first time’  mr tibbs placed the poker at right angles with the fire shovel and essayed to speak but recollected he had nothing to say  ‘the young ladies’ continued mrs t ‘have kindly volunteered to bring their own piano’  tibbs thought of the volunteer story but did not venture it  a bright thought struck him—  ‘it’s very likely—’ said he  ‘pray don’t lean your head against the paper’ interrupted mrs tibbs ‘and don’t put your feet on the steel fender that’s worse’  tibbs took his head from the paper and his feet from the fender and proceeded  ‘it’s very likely one of the young ladies may set her cap at young mr simpson and you know a marriage—’  ‘a what’ shrieked mrs tibbs  tibbs modestly repeated his former suggestion  ‘i beg you won’t mention such a thing’ said mrs t  ‘a marriage indeed to rob me of my boarders—no not for the world’  tibbs thought in his own mind that the event was by no means unlikely but as he never argued with his wife he put a stop to the dialogue by observing it was ‘time to go to business’  he always went out at ten o’clock in the morning and returned at five in the afternoon with an exceedingly dirty face and smelling mouldy  nobody knew what he was or where he went but mrs tibbs used to say with an air of great importance that he was engaged in the city  the miss maplesones and their accomplished parent arrived in the course of the afternoon in a hackneycoach and accompanied by a most astonishing number of packages  trunks bonnetboxes muffboxes and parasols guitarcases and parcels of all imaginable shapes done up in brown paper and fastened with pins filled the passage  then there was such a running up and down with the luggage such scampering for warm water for the ladies to wash in and such a bustle and confusion and heating of servants and curlingirons as had never been known in great coramstreet before  little mrs tibbs was quite in her element bustling about talking incessantly and distributing towels and soap like a head nurse in a hospital  the house was not restored to its usual state of quiet repose until the ladies were safely shut up in their respective bedrooms engaged in the important occupation of dressing for dinner  ‘are these gals ’andsome’ inquired mr simpson of mr septimus hicks another of the boarders as they were amusing themselves in the drawingroom before dinner by lolling on sofas and contemplating their pumps  ‘don’t know’ replied mr septimus hicks who was a tallish whitefaced young man with spectacles and a black ribbon round his neck instead of a neckerchief—a most interesting person a poetical walker of the hospitals and a ‘very talented young man’  he was fond of ‘lugging’ into conversation all sorts of quotations from don juan without fettering himself by the propriety of their application in which particular he was remarkably independent  the other mr simpson was one of those young men who are in society what walking gentlemen are on the stage only infinitely worse skilled in his vocation than the most indifferent artist  he was as emptyheaded as the great bell of st paul’s always dressed according to the caricatures published in the monthly fashion and spelt character with a k  ‘i saw a devilish number of parcels in the passage when i came home’ simpered mr simpson  ‘materials for the toilet no doubt’ rejoined the don juan reader     —‘much linen lace and several pair    of stockings slippers brushes combs complete    with other articles of ladies fair    to keep them beautiful or leave them neat’  ‘is that from milton’ inquired mr simpson  ‘no—from byron’ returned mr hicks with a look of contempt  he was quite sure of his author because he had never read any other  ‘hush here come the gals’ and they both commenced talking in a very loud key  ‘mrs maplesone and the miss maplesones mr hicks  mr hicks—mrs maplesone and the miss maplesones’ said mrs tibbs with a very red face for she had been superintending the cooking operations below stairs and looked like a wax doll on a sunny day  ‘mr simpson i beg your pardon—mr simpson—mrs maplesone and the miss maplesones’—and vice versâ  the gentlemen immediately began to slide about with much politeness and to look as if they wished their arms had been legs so little did they know what to do with them  the ladies smiled curtseyed and glided into chairs and dived for dropped pockethandkerchiefs the gentlemen leant against two of the curtainpegs mrs tibbs went through an admirable bit of serious pantomime with a servant who had come up to ask some question about the fishsauce and then the two young ladies looked at each other and everybody else appeared to discover something very attractive in the pattern of the fender  ‘julia my love’ said mrs maplesone to her youngest daughter in a tone loud enough for the remainder of the company to hear—‘julia’  ‘yes ma’  ‘don’t stoop’—this was said for the purpose of directing general attention to miss julia’s figure which was undeniable  everybody looked at her accordingly and there was another pause  ‘we had the most uncivil hackneycoachman today you can imagine’ said mrs maplesone to mrs tibbs in a confidential tone  ‘dear me’ replied the hostess with an air of great commiseration  she couldn’t say more for the servant again appeared at the door and commenced telegraphing most earnestly to her ‘missis’  ‘i think hackneycoachmen generally are uncivil’ said mr hicks in his most insinuating tone  ‘positively i think they are’ replied mrs maplesone as if the idea had never struck her before  ‘and cabmen too’ said mr simpson  this remark was a failure for no one intimated by word or sign the slightest knowledge of the manners and customs of cabmen  ‘robinson what do you want’ said mrs tibbs to the servant who by way of making her presence known to her mistress had been giving sundry hems and sniffs outside the door during the preceding five minutes  ‘please ma’am master wants his clean things’ replied the servant taken off her guard  the two young men turned their faces to the window and ‘went off’ like a couple of bottles of gingerbeer the ladies put their handkerchiefs to their mouths and little mrs tibbs bustled out of the room to give tibbs his clean linen—and the servant warning  mr calton the remaining boarder shortly afterwards made his appearance and proved a surprising promoter of the conversation  mr calton was a superannuated beau—an old boy  he used to say of himself that although his features were not regularly handsome they were striking  they certainly were  it was impossible to look at his face without being reminded of a chubby streetdoor knocker halflion halfmonkey and the comparison might be extended to his whole character and conversation  he had stood still while everything else had been moving  he never originated a conversation or started an idea but if any commonplace topic were broached or to pursue the comparison if anybody lifted him up he would hammer away with surprising rapidity he had the ticdouloureux occasionally and then he might be said to be muffled because he did not make quite as much noise as at other times when he would go on prosing rattattat the same thing over and over again  he had never been married but he was still on the lookout for a wife with money  he had a life interest worth about 300l a year—he was exceedingly vain and inordinately selfish  he had acquired the reputation of being the very pink of politeness and he walked round the park and up regentstreet every day  this respectable personage had made up his mind to render himself exceedingly agreeable to mrs maplesone—indeed the desire of being as amiable as possible extended itself to the whole party mrs tibbs having considered it an admirable little bit of management to represent to the gentlemen that she had some reason to believe the ladies were fortunes and to hint to the ladies that all the gentlemen were ‘eligible’  a little flirtation she thought might keep her house full without leading to any other result  mrs maplesone was an enterprising widow of about fifty shrewd scheming and goodlooking  she was amiably anxious on behalf of her daughters in proof whereof she used to remark that she would have no objection to marry again if it would benefit her dear girls—she could have no other motive  the ‘dear girls’ themselves were not at all insensible to the merits of ‘a good establishment’  one of them was twentyfive the other three years younger  they had been at different wateringplaces for four seasons they had gambled at libraries read books in balconies sold at fancy fairs danced at assemblies talked sentiment—in short they had done all that industrious girls could do—but as yet to no purpose  ‘what a magnificent dresser mr simpson is’ whispered matilda maplesone to her sister julia  ‘splendid’ returned the youngest  the magnificent individual alluded to wore a marooncoloured dresscoat with a velvet collar and cuffs of the same tint—very like that which usually invests the form of the distinguished unknown who condescends to play the ‘swell’ in the pantomime at ‘richardson’s show’  ‘what whiskers’ said miss julia  ‘charming’ responded her sister ‘and what hair’  his hair was like a wig and distinguished by that insinuating wave which graces the shining locks of those chefd’oeuvres of art surmounting the waxen images in bartellot’s window in regentstreet his whiskers meeting beneath his chin seemed strings wherewith to tie it on ere science had rendered them unnecessary by her patent invisible springs  ‘dinner’s on the table ma’am if you please’ said the boy who now appeared for the first time in a revived black coat of his master’s  ‘oh  mr calton will you lead mrs maplesone—thank you’  mr simpson offered his arm to miss julia mr septimus hicks escorted the lovely matilda and the procession proceeded to the diningroom  mr tibbs was introduced and mr tibbs bobbed up and down to the three ladies like a figure in a dutch clock with a powerful spring in the middle of his body and then dived rapidly into his seat at the bottom of the table delighted to screen himself behind a souptureen which he could just see over and that was all  the boarders were seated a lady and gentleman alternately like the layers of bread and meat in a plate of sandwiches and then mrs tibbs directed james to take off the covers  salmon lobstersauce gibletsoup and the usual accompaniments were discovered potatoes like petrifactions and bits of toasted bread the shape and size of blank dice  ‘soup for mrs maplesone my dear’ said the bustling mrs tibbs  she always called her husband ‘my dear’ before company  tibbs who had been eating his bread and calculating how long it would be before he should get any fish helped the soup in a hurry made a small island on the tablecloth and put his glass upon it to hide it from his wife  ‘miss julia shall i assist you to some fish’  ‘if you please—very little—oh plenty thank you’ a bit about the size of a walnut put upon the plate  ‘julia is a very little eater’ said mrs maplesone to mr calton  the knocker gave a single rap  he was busy eating the fish with his eyes so he only ejaculated ‘ah’  ‘my dear’ said mrs tibbs to her spouse after every one else had been helped ‘what do you take’  the inquiry was accompanied with a look intimating that he mustn’t say fish because there was not much left tibbs thought the frown referred to the island on the tablecloth he therefore coolly replied ‘why—i’ll take a little—fish i think’  ‘did you say fish my dear’ another frown  ‘yes dear’ replied the villain with an expression of acute hunger depicted in his countenance  the tears almost started to mrs tibbs’s eyes as she helped her ‘wretch of a husband’ as she inwardly called him to the last eatable bit of salmon on the dish  ‘james take this to your master and take away your master’s knife’ this was deliberate revenge as tibbs never could eat fish without one he was however constrained to chase small particles of salmon round and round his plate with a piece of bread and a fork the number of successful attempts being about one in seventeen  ‘take away james’ said mrs tibbs as tibbs swallowed the fourth mouthful—and away went the plates like lightning  ‘i’ll take a bit of bread james’ said the poor ‘master of the house’ more hungry than ever  ‘never mind your master now james’ said mrs tibbs ‘see about the meat’  this was conveyed in the tone in which ladies usually give admonitions to servants in company that is to say a low one but which like a stage whisper from its peculiar emphasis is most distinctly heard by everybody present  a pause ensued before the table was replenished—a sort of parenthesis in which mr simpson mr calton and mr hicks produced respectively a bottle of sauterne bucellas and sherry and took wine with everybody—except tibbs  no one ever thought of him  between the fish and an intimated sirloin there was a prolonged interval  here was an opportunity for mr hicks  he could not resist the singularly appropriate quotation—     ‘but beef is rare within these oxless isles    goats’ flesh there is no doubt and kid and mutton    and when a holiday upon them smiles    a joint upon their barbarous spits they put on’  ‘very ungentlemanly behaviour’ thought little mrs tibbs ‘to talk in that way’  ‘ah’ said mr calton filling his glass  ‘tom moore is my poet’  ‘and mine’ said mrs maplesone  ‘and mine’ said miss julia  ‘and mine’ added mr simpson  ‘look at his compositions’ resumed the knocker  ‘to be sure’ said simpson with confidence  ‘look at don juan’ replied mr septimus hicks  ‘julia’s letter’ suggested miss matilda  ‘can anything be grander than the fire worshippers’ inquired miss julia  ‘to be sure’ said simpson  ‘or paradise and the peri’ said the old beau  ‘yes or paradise and the peer’ repeated simpson who thought he was getting through it capitally  ‘it’s all very well’ replied mr septimus hicks who as we have before hinted never had read anything but don juan  ‘where will you find anything finer than the description of the siege at the commencement of the seventh canto’  ‘talking of a siege’ said tibbs with a mouthful of bread—‘when i was in the volunteer corps in eighteen hundred and six our commanding officer was sir charles rampart and one day when we were exercising on the ground on which the london university now stands he says says he tibbs calling me from the ranks tibbs—’  ‘tell your master james’ interrupted mrs tibbs in an awfully distinct tone ‘tell your master if he won’t carve those fowls to send them to me’  the discomfited volunteer instantly set to work and carved the fowls almost as expeditiously as his wife operated on the haunch of mutton  whether he ever finished the story is not known but if he did nobody heard it  as the ice was now broken and the new inmates more at home every member of the company felt more at ease  tibbs himself most certainly did because he went to sleep immediately after dinner  mr hicks and the ladies discoursed most eloquently about poetry and the theatres and lord chesterfield’s letters and mr calton followed up what everybody said with continuous double knocks  mrs tibbs highly approved of every observation that fell from mrs maplesone and as mr simpson sat with a smile upon his face and said ‘yes’ or ‘certainly’ at intervals of about four minutes each he received full credit for understanding what was going forward  the gentlemen rejoined the ladies in the drawingroom very shortly after they had left the diningparlour  mrs maplesone and mr calton played cribbage and the ‘young people’ amused themselves with music and conversation  the miss maplesones sang the most fascinating duets and accompanied themselves on guitars ornamented with bits of ethereal blue ribbon  mr simpson put on a pink waistcoat and said he was in raptures and mr hicks felt in the seventh heaven of poetry or the seventh canto of don juan—it was the same thing to him  mrs tibbs was quite charmed with the newcomers and mr tibbs spent the evening in his usual way—he went to sleep and woke up and went to sleep again and woke at suppertime                                        we are not about to adopt the licence of novelwriters and to let ‘years roll on’ but we will take the liberty of requesting the reader to suppose that six months have elapsed since the dinner we have described and that mrs tibbs’s boarders have during that period sang and danced and gone to theatres and exhibitions together as ladies and gentlemen wherever they board often do  and we will beg them the period we have mentioned having elapsed to imagine farther that mr septimus hicks received in his own bedroom a front attic at an early hour one morning a note from mr calton requesting the favour of seeing him as soon as convenient to himself in his calton’s dressingroom on the secondfloor back  ‘tell mr calton i’ll come down directly’ said mr septimus to the boy ‘stop—is mr calton unwell’ inquired this excited walker of hospitals as he put on a bedfurniturelooking dressinggown  ‘not as i knows on sir’ replied the boy  ‘ please sir he looked rather rum as it might be’  ‘ah that’s no proof of his being ill’ returned hicks unconsciously ‘very well i’ll be down directly’  downstairs ran the boy with the message and down went the excited hicks himself almost as soon as the message was delivered  ‘tap tap’  ‘come in’—door opens and discovers mr calton sitting in an easy chair  mutual shakes of the hand exchanged and mr septimus hicks motioned to a seat  a short pause mr hicks coughed and mr calton took a pinch of snuff  it was one of those interviews where neither party knows what to say  mr septimus hicks broke silence  ‘i received a note—’ he said very tremulously in a voice like a punch with a cold  ‘yes’ returned the other ‘you did’  ‘exactly’  ‘yes’  now although this dialogue must have been satisfactory both gentlemen felt there was something more important to be said therefore they did as most men in such a situation would have done—they looked at the table with a determined aspect  the conversation had been opened however and mr calton had made up his mind to continue it with a regular double knock  he always spoke very pompously  ‘hicks’ said he ‘i have sent for you in consequence of certain arrangements which are pending in this house connected with a marriage’  ‘with a marriage’ gasped hicks compared with whose expression of countenance hamlet’s when he sees his father’s ghost is pleasing and composed  ‘with a marriage’ returned the knocker  ‘i have sent for you to prove the great confidence i can repose in you’  ‘and will you betray me’ eagerly inquired hicks who in his alarm had even forgotten to quote  ‘i betray you  won’t you betray me’  ‘never no one shall know to my dying day that you had a hand in the business’ responded the agitated hicks with an inflamed countenance and his hair standing on end as if he were on the stool of an electrifying machine in full operation  ‘people must know that some time or other—within a year i imagine’ said mr calton with an air of great selfcomplacency   ‘we may have a family’  ‘we—that won’t affect you surely’  ‘the devil it won’t’  ‘no how can it’ said the bewildered hicks  calton was too much inwrapped in the contemplation of his happiness to see the equivoque between hicks and himself and threw himself back in his chair  ‘oh matilda’ sighed the antique beau in a lackadaisical voice and applying his right hand a little to the left of the fourth button of his waistcoat counting from the bottom  ‘oh matilda’  ‘what matilda’ inquired hicks starting up  ‘matilda maplesone’ responded the other doing the same  ‘i marry her tomorrow morning’ said hicks  ‘it’s false’ rejoined his companion ‘i marry her’  ‘you marry her’  ‘i marry her’  ‘you marry matilda maplesone’  ‘matilda maplesone’  ‘miss maplesone marry you’  ‘miss maplesone  no mrs maplesone’  ‘good heaven’ said hicks falling into his chair ‘you marry the mother and i the daughter’  ‘most extraordinary circumstance’ replied mr calton ‘and rather inconvenient too for the fact is that owing to matilda’s wishing to keep her intention secret from her daughters until the ceremony had taken place she doesn’t like applying to any of her friends to give her away i entertain an objection to making the affair known to my acquaintance just now and the consequence is that i sent to you to know whether you’d oblige me by acting as father’  ‘i should have been most happy i assure you’ said hicks in a tone of condolence ‘but you see i shall be acting as bridegroom  one character is frequently a consequence of the other but it is not usual to act in both at the same time  there’s simpson—i have no doubt he’ll do it for you’  ‘i don’t like to ask him’ replied calton ‘he’s such a donkey’  mr septimus hicks looked up at the ceiling and down at the floor at last an idea struck him  ‘let the man of the house tibbs be the father’ he suggested and then he quoted as peculiarly applicable to tibbs and the pair—      ‘oh powers of heaven what dark eyes meets she there     ’tis—’tis her father’s—fixed upon the pair’  ‘the idea has struck me already’ said mr calton ‘but you see matilda for what reason i know not is very anxious that mrs tibbs should know nothing about it till it’s all over  it’s a natural delicacy after all you know’  ‘he’s the bestnatured little man in existence if you manage him properly’ said mr septimus hicks  ‘tell him not to mention it to his wife and assure him she won’t mind it and he’ll do it directly  my marriage is to be a secret one on account of the mother and my father therefore he must be enjoined to secrecy’  a small double knock like a presumptuous single one was that instant heard at the streetdoor  it was tibbs it could be no one else for no one else occupied five minutes in rubbing his shoes  he had been out to pay the baker’s bill  ‘mr tibbs’ called mr calton in a very bland tone looking over the banisters  ‘sir’ replied he of the dirty face  ‘will you have the kindness to step upstairs for a moment’  ‘certainly sir’ said tibbs delighted to be taken notice of  the bedroomdoor was carefully closed and tibbs having put his hat on the floor as most timid men do and been accommodated with a seat looked as astounded as if he were suddenly summoned before the familiars of the inquisition  ‘a rather unpleasant occurrence mr tibbs’ said calton in a very portentous manner ‘obliges me to consult you and to beg you will not communicate what i am about to say to your wife’  tibbs acquiesced wondering in his own mind what the deuce the other could have done and imagining that at least he must have broken the best decanters  mr calton resumed ‘i am placed mr tibbs in rather an unpleasant situation’  tibbs looked at mr septimus hicks as if he thought mr h’s being in the immediate vicinity of his fellowboarder might constitute the unpleasantness of his situation but as he did not exactly know what to say he merely ejaculated the monosyllable ‘lor’  ‘now’ continued the knocker ‘let me beg you will exhibit no manifestations of surprise which may be overheard by the domestics when i tell you—command your feelings of astonishment—that two inmates of this house intend to be married tomorrow morning’  and he drew back his chair several feet to perceive the effect of the unlookedfor announcement  if tibbs had rushed from the room staggered downstairs and fainted in the passage—if he had instantaneously jumped out of the window into the mews behind the house in an agony of surprise—his behaviour would have been much less inexplicable to mr calton than it was when he put his hands into his inexpressiblepockets and said with a halfchuckle ‘just so’  ‘you are not surprised mr tibbs’ inquired mr calton  ‘bless you no sir’ returned tibbs ‘after all its very natural  when two young people get together you know—’  ‘certainly certainly’ said calton with an indescribable air of selfsatisfaction  ‘you don’t think it’s at all an outoftheway affair then’ asked mr septimus hicks who had watched the countenance of tibbs in mute astonishment  ‘no sir’ replied tibbs ‘i was just the same at his age’  he actually smiled when he said this  ‘how devilish well i must carry my years’ thought the delighted old beau knowing he was at least ten years older than tibbs at that moment  ‘well then to come to the point at once’ he continued ‘i have to ask you whether you will object to act as father on the occasion’  ‘certainly not’ replied tibbs still without evincing an atom of surprise  ‘you will not’  ‘decidedly not’ reiterated tibbs still as calm as a pot of porter with the head off  mr calton seized the hand of the petticoatgoverned little man and vowed eternal friendship from that hour  hicks who was all admiration and surprise did the same  ‘now confess’ asked mr calton of tibbs as he picked up his hat ‘were you not a little surprised’  ‘i b’lieve you’ replied that illustrious person holding up one hand ‘i b’lieve you  when i first heard of it’  ‘so sudden’ said septimus hicks  ‘so strange to ask me you know’ said tibbs  ‘so odd altogether’ said the superannuated lovemaker and then all three laughed  ‘i say’ said tibbs shutting the door which he had previously opened and giving full vent to a hitherto corkedup giggle ‘what bothers me is what will his father say’  mr septimus hicks looked at mr calton  ‘yes but the best of it is’ said the latter giggling in his turn ‘i haven’t got a father—he he he’  ‘you haven’t got a father  no but he has’ said tibbs  ‘who has’ inquired septimus hicks  ‘why him’  ‘him who  do you know my secret  do you mean me’  ‘you  no you know who i mean’ returned tibbs with a knowing wink  ‘for heaven’s sake whom do you mean’ inquired mr calton who like septimus hicks was all but out of his senses at the strange confusion  ‘why mr simpson of course’ replied tibbs ‘who else could i mean’  ‘i see it all’ said the byronquoter ‘simpson marries julia maplesone tomorrow morning’  ‘undoubtedly’ replied tibbs thoroughly satisfied ‘of course he does’  it would require the pencil of hogarth to illustrate—our feeble pen is inadequate to describe—the expression which the countenances of mr calton and mr septimus hicks respectively assumed at this unexpected announcement  equally impossible is it to describe although perhaps it is easier for our lady readers to imagine what arts the three ladies could have used so completely to entangle their separate partners whatever they were however they were successful  the mother was perfectly aware of the intended marriage of both daughters and the young ladies were equally acquainted with the intention of their estimable parent  they agreed however that it would have a much better appearance if each feigned ignorance of the other’s engagement and it was equally desirable that all the marriages should take place on the same day to prevent the discovery of one clandestine alliance operating prejudicially on the others  hence the mystification of mr calton and mr septimus hicks and the preengagement of the unwary tibbs  on the following morning mr septimus hicks was united to miss matilda maplesone  mr simpson also entered into a ‘holy alliance’ with miss julia tibbs acting as father ‘his first appearance in that character’ mr calton not being quite so eager as the two young men was rather struck by the double discovery and as he had found some difficulty in getting any one to give the lady away it occurred to him that the best mode of obviating the inconvenience would be not to take her at all  the lady however ‘appealed’ as her counsel said on the trial of the cause maplesone v calton for a breach of promise ‘with a broken heart to the outraged laws of her country’  she recovered damages to the amount of 1000l which the unfortunate knocker was compelled to pay mr septimus hicks having walked the hospitals took it into his head to walk off altogether  his injured wife is at present residing with her mother at boulogne  mr simpson having the misfortune to lose his wife six weeks after marriage by her eloping with an officer during his temporary sojourn in the fleet prison in consequence of his inability to discharge her little mantuamaker’s bill and being disinherited by his father who died soon afterwards was fortunate enough to obtain a permanent engagement at a fashionable haircutter’s hairdressing being a science to which he had frequently directed his attention  in this situation he had necessarily many opportunities of making himself acquainted with the habits and style of thinking of the exclusive portion of the nobility of this kingdom  to this fortunate circumstance are we indebted for the production of those brilliant efforts of genius his fashionable novels which so long as good taste unsullied by exaggeration cant and quackery continues to exist cannot fail to instruct and amuse the thinking portion of the community  it only remains to add that this complication of disorders completely deprived poor mrs tibbs of all her inmates except the one whom she could have best spared—her husband  that wretched little man returned home on the day of the wedding in a state of partial intoxication and under the influence of wine excitement and despair actually dared to brave the anger of his wife  since that illfated hour he has constantly taken his meals in the kitchen to which apartment it is understood his witticisms will be in future confined a turnup bedstead having been conveyed there by mrs tibbs’s order for his exclusive accommodation  it is possible that he will be enabled to finish in that seclusion his story of the volunteers  the advertisement has again appeared in the morning papers  results must be reserved for another chapter   chapter the second   ‘well’ said little mrs tibbs to herself as she sat in the front parlour of the coramstreet mansion one morning mending a piece of staircarpet off the first landings—‘things have not turned out so badly either and if i only get a favourable answer to the advertisement we shall be full again’  mrs tibbs resumed her occupation of making worsted latticework in the carpet anxiously listening to the twopenny postman who was hammering his way down the street at the rate of a penny a knock  the house was as quiet as possible  there was only one low sound to be heard—it was the unhappy tibbs cleaning the gentlemen’s boots in the back kitchen and accompanying himself with a buzzing noise in wretched mockery of humming a tune  the postman drew near the house  he paused—so did mrs tibbs  a knock—a bustle—a letter—postpaid      ‘t i presents compt to i t and t i begs to say that i see the     advertisement and she will do herself the pleasure of calling on you     at 12 o’clock tomorrow morning      ‘t i as to apologise to i t for the shortness of the notice but i     hope it will not unconvenience you                                                       ‘i remain yours truly                                                       ‘wednesday evening’  little mrs tibbs perused the document over and over again and the more she read it the more was she confused by the mixture of the first and third person the substitution of the ‘i’ for the ‘t i’ and the transition from the ‘i  t’ to the ‘you’  the writing looked like a skein of thread in a tangle and the note was ingeniously folded into a perfect square with the direction squeezed up into the righthand corner as if it were ashamed of itself  the back of the epistle was pleasingly ornamented with a large red wafer which with the addition of divers inkstains bore a marvellous resemblance to a black beetle trodden upon  one thing however was perfectly clear to the perplexed mrs tibbs  somebody was to call at twelve  the drawingroom was forthwith dusted for the third time that morning three or four chairs were pulled out of their places and a corresponding number of books carefully upset in order that there might be a due absence of formality down went the piece of staircarpet before noticed and up ran mrs tibbs ‘to make herself tidy’  the clock of new saint pancras church struck twelve and the foundling with laudable politeness did the same ten minutes afterwards saint something else struck the quarter and then there arrived a single lady with a double knock in a pelisse the colour of the interior of a damson pie a bonnet of the same with a regular conservatory of artificial flowers a white veil and a green parasol with a cobweb border  the visitor who was very fat and redfaced was shown into the drawingroom mrs tibbs presented herself and the negotiation commenced  ‘i called in consequence of an advertisement’ said the stranger in a voice as if she had been playing a set of pan’s pipes for a fortnight without leaving off  ‘yes’ said mrs tibbs rubbing her hands very slowly and looking the applicant full in the face—two things she always did on such occasions  ‘money isn’t no object whatever to me’ said the lady ‘so much as living in a state of retirement and obtrusion’  mrs tibbs as a matter of course acquiesced in such an exceedingly natural desire  ‘i am constantly attended by a medical man’ resumed the pelisse wearer ‘i have been a shocking unitarian for some time—i indeed have had very little peace since the death of mr bloss’  mrs tibbs looked at the relict of the departed bloss and thought he must have had very little peace in his time  of course she could not say so so she looked very sympathising  ‘i shall be a good deal of trouble to you’ said mrs bloss ‘but for that trouble i am willing to pay  i am going through a course of treatment which renders attention necessary  i have one muttonchop in bed at halfpast eight and another at ten every morning’  mrs tibbs as in duty bound expressed the pity she felt for anybody placed in such a distressing situation and the carnivorous mrs bloss proceeded to arrange the various preliminaries with wonderful despatch ‘now mind’ said that lady after terms were arranged ‘i am to have the secondfloor front for my bedroom’  ‘yes ma’am’  ‘and you’ll find room for my little servant agnes’  ‘oh certainly’  ‘and i can have one of the cellars in the area for my bottled porter’  ‘with the greatest pleasure—james shall get it ready for you by saturday’  ‘and i’ll join the company at the breakfasttable on sunday morning’ said mrs bloss  ‘i shall get up on purpose’  ‘very well’ returned mrs tibbs in her most amiable tone for satisfactory references had ‘been given and required’ and it was quite certain that the newcomer had plenty of money  ‘it’s rather singular’ continued mrs tibbs with what was meant for a most bewitching smile ‘that we have a gentleman now with us who is in a very delicate state of health—a mr gobler—his apartment is the back drawingroom’  ‘the next room’ inquired mrs bloss  ‘the next room’ repeated the hostess  ‘how very promiscuous’ ejaculated the widow  ‘he hardly ever gets up’ said mrs tibbs in a whisper  ‘lor’ cried mrs bloss in an equally low tone  ‘and when he is up’ said mrs tibbs ‘we never can persuade him to go to bed again’  ‘dear me’ said the astonished mrs bloss drawing her chair nearer mrs tibbs  ‘what is his complaint’  ‘why the fact is’ replied mrs tibbs with a most communicative air ‘he has no stomach whatever’  ‘no what’ inquired mrs bloss with a look of the most indescribable alarm  ‘no stomach’ repeated mrs tibbs with a shake of the head  ‘lord bless us what an extraordinary case’ gasped mrs bloss as if she understood the communication in its literal sense and was astonished at a gentleman without a stomach finding it necessary to board anywhere  ‘when i say he has no stomach’ explained the chatty little mrs tibbs ‘i mean that his digestion is so much impaired and his interior so deranged that his stomach is not of the least use to him—in fact it’s an inconvenience’  ‘never heard such a case in my life’ exclaimed mrs bloss  ‘why he’s worse than i am’  ‘oh yes’ replied mrs tibbs—‘certainly’  she said this with great confidence for the damson pelisse suggested that mrs bloss at all events was not suffering under mr gobler’s complaint  ‘you have quite incited my curiosity’ said mrs bloss as she rose to depart  ‘how i long to see him’  ‘he generally comes down once a week’ replied mrs tibbs ‘i dare say you’ll see him on sunday’  with this consolatory promise mrs bloss was obliged to be contented  she accordingly walked slowly down the stairs detailing her complaints all the way and mrs tibbs followed her uttering an exclamation of compassion at every step  james who looked very gritty for he was cleaning the knives fell up the kitchenstairs and opened the streetdoor and after mutual farewells mrs bloss slowly departed down the shady side of the street  it is almost superfluous to say that the lady whom we have just shown out at the streetdoor and whom the two female servants are now inspecting from the secondfloor windows was exceedingly vulgar ignorant and selfish  her deceased betterhalf had been an eminent corkcutter in which capacity he had amassed a decent fortune  he had no relative but his nephew and no friend but his cook  the former had the insolence one morning to ask for the loan of fifteen pounds and by way of retaliation he married the latter next day he made a will immediately afterwards containing a burst of honest indignation against his nephew who supported himself and two sisters on 100l a year and a bequest of his whole property to his wife  he felt ill after breakfast and died after dinner  there is a mantelpiecelooking tablet in a civic parish church setting forth his virtues and deploring his loss  he never dishonoured a bill or gave away a halfpenny  the relict and sole executrix of this nobleminded man was an odd mixture of shrewdness and simplicity liberality and meanness  bred up as she had been she knew no mode of living so agreeable as a boardinghouse and having nothing to do and nothing to wish for she naturally imagined she must be ill—an impression which was most assiduously promoted by her medical attendant dr wosky and her handmaid agnes both of whom doubtless for good reasons encouraged all her extravagant notions  since the catastrophe recorded in the last chapter mrs tibbs had been very shy of younglady boarders  her present inmates were all lords of the creation and she availed herself of the opportunity of their assemblage at the dinnertable to announce the expected arrival of mrs bloss  the gentlemen received the communication with stoical indifference and mrs tibbs devoted all her energies to prepare for the reception of the valetudinarian  the secondfloor front was scrubbed and washed and flannelled till the wet went through to the drawingroom ceiling  clean white counterpanes and curtains and napkins waterbottles as clear as crystal blue jugs and mahogany furniture added to the splendour and increased the comfort of the apartment  the warmingpan was in constant requisition and a fire lighted in the room every day  the chattels of mrs bloss were forwarded by instalments first there came a large hamper of guinness’s stout and an umbrella then a train of trunks then a pair of clogs and a bandbox then an easy chair with an aircushion then a variety of suspiciouslooking packages and—‘though last not least’—mrs bloss and agnes the latter in a cherrycoloured merino dress openwork stockings and shoes with sandals like a disguised columbine  the installation of the duke of wellington as chancellor of the university of oxford was nothing in point of bustle and turmoil to the installation of mrs bloss in her new quarters  true there was no bright doctor of civil law to deliver a classical address on the occasion but there were several other old women present who spoke quite as much to the purpose and understood themselves equally well  the chopeater was so fatigued with the process of removal that she declined leaving her room until the following morning so a muttonchop pickle a pill a pint bottle of stout and other medicines were carried upstairs for her consumption  ‘why what do you think ma’am’ inquired the inquisitive agnes of her mistress after they had been in the house some three hours ‘what do you think ma’am the lady of the house is married’  ‘married’ said mrs bloss taking the pill and a draught of guinness—‘married  unpossible’  ‘she is indeed ma’am’ returned the columbine ‘and her husband ma’am lives—he—he—he—lives in the kitchen ma’am’  ‘in the kitchen’  ‘yes ma’am and he—he—he—the housemaid says he never goes into the parlour except on sundays and that ms tibbs makes him clean the gentlemen’s boots and that he cleans the windows too sometimes and that one morning early when he was in the front balcony cleaning the drawingroom windows he called out to a gentleman on the opposite side of the way who used to live here—“ah  mr calton sir how are you”’ here the attendant laughed till mrs bloss was in serious apprehension of her chuckling herself into a fit  ‘well i never’ said mrs bloss  ‘yes  and please ma’am the servants gives him ginandwater sometimes and then he cries and says he hates his wife and the boarders and wants to tickle them’  ‘tickle the boarders’ exclaimed mrs bloss seriously alarmed  ‘no ma’am not the boarders the servants’  ‘oh is that all’ said mrs bloss quite satisfied  ‘he wanted to kiss me as i came up the kitchenstairs just now’ said agnes indignantly ‘but i gave it him—a little wretch’  this intelligence was but too true  a long course of snubbing and neglect his days spent in the kitchen and his nights in the turnup bedstead had completely broken the little spirit that the unfortunate volunteer had ever possessed  he had no one to whom he could detail his injuries but the servants and they were almost of necessity his chosen confidants  it is no less strange than true however that the little weaknesses which he had incurred most probably during his military career seemed to increase as his comforts diminished  he was actually a sort of journeyman giovanni of the basement story  the next morning being sunday breakfast was laid in the front parlour at ten o’clock  nine was the usual time but the family always breakfasted an hour later on sabbath  tibbs enrobed himself in his sunday costume—a black coat and exceedingly short thin trousers with a very large white waistcoat white stockings and cravat and blucher boots—and mounted to the parlour aforesaid  nobody had come down and he amused himself by drinking the contents of the milkpot with a teaspoon  a pair of slippers were heard descending the stairs  tibbs flew to a chair and a sternlooking man of about fifty with very little hair on his head and a sunday paper in his hand entered the room  ‘good morning mr evenson’ said tibbs very humbly with something between a nod and a bow  ‘how do you do mr tibbs’ replied he of the slippers as he sat himself down and began to read his paper without saying another word  ‘is mr wisbottle in town today do you know sir’ inquired tibbs just for the sake of saying something  ‘i should think he was’ replied the stern gentleman  ‘he was whistling “the light guitar” in the next room to mine at five o’clock this morning’  ‘he’s very fond of whistling’ said tibbs with a slight smirk  ‘yes—i ain’t’ was the laconic reply  mr john evenson was in the receipt of an independent income arising chiefly from various houses he owned in the different suburbs  he was very morose and discontented  he was a thorough radical and used to attend a great variety of public meetings for the express purpose of finding fault with everything that was proposed  mr wisbottle on the other hand was a high tory  he was a clerk in the woods and forests office which he considered rather an aristocratic employment he knew the peerage by heart and could tell you offhand where any illustrious personage lived  he had a good set of teeth and a capital tailor  mr evenson looked on all these qualifications with profound contempt and the consequence was that the two were always disputing much to the edification of the rest of the house  it should be added that in addition to his partiality for whistling mr wisbottle had a great idea of his singing powers  there were two other boarders besides the gentleman in the back drawingroom—mr alfred tomkins and mr frederick o’bleary  mr tomkins was a clerk in a winehouse he was a connoisseur in paintings and had a wonderful eye for the picturesque mr o’bleary was an irishman recently imported he was in a perfectly wild state and had come over to england to be an apothecary a clerk in a government office an actor a reporter or anything else that turned up—he was not particular  he was on familiar terms with two small irish members and got franks for everybody in the house  he felt convinced that his intrinsic merits must procure him a high destiny  he wore shepherd’splaid inexpressibles and used to look under all the ladies’ bonnets as he walked along the streets  his manners and appearance reminded one of orson  ‘here comes mr wisbottle’ said tibbs and mr wisbottle forthwith appeared in blue slippers and a shawl dressinggown whistling ‘di piacer’  ‘good morning sir’ said tibbs again  it was almost the only thing he ever said to anybody  ‘how are you tibbs’ condescendingly replied the amateur and he walked to the window and whistled louder than ever  ‘pretty air that’ said evenson with a snarl and without taking his eyes off the paper  ‘glad you like it’ replied wisbottle highly gratified  ‘don’t you think it would sound better if you whistled it a little louder’ inquired the mastiff  ‘no i don’t think it would’ rejoined the unconscious wisbottle  ‘i’ll tell you what wisbottle’ said evenson who had been bottling up his anger for some hours—‘the next time you feel disposed to whistle “the light guitar” at five o’clock in the morning i’ll trouble you to whistle it with your head out o’ window  if you don’t i’ll learn the triangle—i will by—’  the entrance of mrs tibbs with the keys in a little basket interrupted the threat and prevented its conclusion  mrs tibbs apologised for being down rather late the bell was rung james brought up the urn and received an unlimited order for dry toast and bacon  tibbs sat down at the bottom of the table and began eating watercresses like a nebuchadnezzar  mr o’bleary appeared and mr alfred tomkins  the compliments of the morning were exchanged and the tea was made  ‘god bless me’ exclaimed tomkins who had been looking out at the window  ‘here—wisbottle—pray come here—make haste’  mr wisbottle started from the table and every one looked up  ‘do you see’ said the connoisseur placing wisbottle in the right position—‘a little more this way there—do you see how splendidly the light falls upon the left side of that broken chimneypot at no 48’  ‘dear me  i see’ replied wisbottle in a tone of admiration  ‘i never saw an object stand out so beautifully against the clear sky in my life’ ejaculated alfred  everybody except john evenson echoed the sentiment for mr tomkins had a great character for finding out beauties which no one else could discover—he certainly deserved it  ‘i have frequently observed a chimneypot in collegegreen dublin which has a much better effect’ said the patriotic o’bleary who never allowed ireland to be outdone on any point  the assertion was received with obvious incredulity for mr tomkins declared that no other chimneypot in the united kingdom broken or unbroken could be so beautiful as the one at no 48  the roomdoor was suddenly thrown open and agnes appeared leading in mrs bloss who was dressed in a geraniumcoloured muslin gown and displayed a gold watch of huge dimensions a chain to match and a splendid assortment of rings with enormous stones  a general rush was made for a chair and a regular introduction took place  mr john evenson made a slight inclination of the head mr frederick o’bleary mr alfred tomkins and mr wisbottle bowed like the mandarins in a grocer’s shop tibbs rubbed hands and went round in circles  he was observed to close one eye and to assume a clockwork sort of expression with the other this has been considered as a wink and it has been reported that agnes was its object  we repel the calumny and challenge contradiction  mrs tibbs inquired after mrs bloss’s health in a low tone  mrs bloss with a supreme contempt for the memory of lindley murray answered the various questions in a most satisfactory manner and a pause ensued during which the eatables disappeared with awful rapidity  ‘you must have been very much pleased with the appearance of the ladies going to the drawingroom the other day mr o’bleary’ said mrs tibbs hoping to start a topic  ‘yes’ replied orson with a mouthful of toast  ‘never saw anything like it before i suppose’ suggested wisbottle  ‘no—except the lord lieutenant’s levees’ replied o’bleary  ‘are they at all equal to our drawingrooms’  ‘oh infinitely superior’  ‘gad  i don’t know’ said the aristocratic wisbottle ‘the dowager marchioness of publiccash was most magnificently dressed and so was the baron slappenbachenhausen’  ‘what was he presented on’ inquired evenson  ‘on his arrival in england’  ‘i thought so’ growled the radical ‘you never hear of these fellows being presented on their going away again  they know better than that’  ‘unless somebody pervades them with an apintment’ said mrs bloss joining in the conversation in a faint voice  ‘well’ said wisbottle evading the point ‘it’s a splendid sight’  ‘and did it never occur to you’ inquired the radical who never would be quiet ‘did it never occur to you that you pay for these precious ornaments of society’  ‘it certainly has occurred to me’ said wisbottle who thought this answer was a poser ‘it has occurred to me and i am willing to pay for them’  ‘well and it has occurred to me too’ replied john evenson ‘and i ain’t willing to pay for ’em  then why should i—i say why should i’ continued the politician laying down the paper and knocking his knuckles on the table  ‘there are two great principles—demand—’  ‘a cup of tea if you please dear’ interrupted tibbs  ‘and supply—’  ‘may i trouble you to hand this tea to mr tibbs’ said mrs tibbs interrupting the argument and unconsciously illustrating it  the thread of the orator’s discourse was broken  he drank his tea and resumed the paper  ‘if it’s very fine’ said mr alfred tomkins addressing the company in general ‘i shall ride down to richmond today and come back by the steamer  there are some splendid effects of light and shade on the thames the contrast between the blueness of the sky and the yellow water is frequently exceedingly beautiful’  mr wisbottle hummed ‘flow on thou shining river’  ‘we have some splendid steamvessels in ireland’ said o’bleary  ‘certainly’ said mrs bloss delighted to find a subject broached in which she could take part  ‘the accommodations are extraordinary’ said o’bleary  ‘extraordinary indeed’ returned mrs bloss  ‘when mr bloss was alive he was promiscuously obligated to go to ireland on business  i went with him and raly the manner in which the ladies and gentlemen were accommodated with berths is not creditable’  tibbs who had been listening to the dialogue looked aghast and evinced a strong inclination to ask a question but was checked by a look from his wife  mr wisbottle laughed and said tomkins had made a pun and tomkins laughed too and said he had not  the remainder of the meal passed off as breakfasts usually do conversation flagged and people played with their teaspoons  the gentlemen looked out at the window walked about the room and when they got near the door dropped off one by one  tibbs retired to the back parlour by his wife’s orders to check the greengrocer’s weekly account and ultimately mrs tibbs and mrs bloss were left alone together  ‘oh dear’ said the latter ‘i feel alarmingly faint it’s very singular’  it certainly was for she had eaten four pounds of solids that morning  ‘bythebye’ said mrs bloss ‘i have not seen mr what’shisname yet’  ‘mr gobler’ suggested mrs tibbs  ‘yes’  ‘oh’ said mrs tibbs ‘he is a most mysterious person  he has his meals regularly sent upstairs and sometimes don’t leave his room for weeks together’  ‘i haven’t seen or heard nothing of him’ repeated mrs bloss  ‘i dare say you’ll hear him tonight’ replied mrs tibbs ‘he generally groans a good deal on sunday evenings’  ‘i never felt such an interest in any one in my life’ ejaculated mrs bloss  a little doubleknock interrupted the conversation dr wosky was announced and duly shown in  he was a little man with a red face—dressed of course in black with a stiff white neckerchief  he had a very good practice and plenty of money which he had amassed by invariably humouring the worst fancies of all the females of all the families he had ever been introduced into  mrs tibbs offered to retire but was entreated to stay  ‘well my dear ma’am and how are we’ inquired wosky in a soothing tone  ‘very ill doctor—very ill’ said mrs bloss in a whisper  ‘ah we must take care of ourselves—we must indeed’ said the obsequious wosky as he felt the pulse of his interesting patient  ‘how is our appetite’  mrs bloss shook her head  ‘our friend requires great care’ said wosky appealing to mrs tibbs who of course assented  ‘i hope however with the blessing of providence that we shall be enabled to make her quite stout again’ mrs tibbs wondered in her own mind what the patient would be when she was made quite stout  ‘we must take stimulants’ said the cunning wosky—‘plenty of nourishment and above all we must keep our nerves quiet we positively must not give way to our sensibilities  we must take all we can get’ concluded the doctor as he pocketed his fee ‘and we must keep quiet’  ‘dear man’ exclaimed mrs bloss as the doctor stepped into the carriage  ‘charming creature indeed—quite a lady’s man’ said mrs tibbs and dr wosky rattled away to make fresh gulls of delicate females and pocket fresh fees  as we had occasion in a former paper to describe a dinner at mrs tibbs’s and as one meal went off very like another on all ordinary occasions we will not fatigue our readers by entering into any other detailed account of the domestic economy of the establishment  we will therefore proceed to events merely premising that the mysterious tenant of the back drawingroom was a lazy selfish hypochondriac always complaining and never ill  as his character in many respects closely assimilated to that of mrs bloss a very warm friendship soon sprung up between them  he was tall thin and pale he always fancied he had a severe pain somewhere or other and his face invariably wore a pinched screwedup expression he looked indeed like a man who had got his feet in a tub of exceedingly hot water against his will  for two or three months after mrs bloss’s first appearance in coramstreet john evenson was observed to become every day more sarcastic and more illnatured and there was a degree of additional importance in his manner which clearly showed that he fancied he had discovered something which he only wanted a proper opportunity of divulging  he found it at last  one evening the different inmates of the house were assembled in the drawingroom engaged in their ordinary occupations  mr gobler and mrs bloss were sitting at a small cardtable near the centre window playing cribbage mr wisbottle was describing semicircles on the musicstool turning over the leaves of a book on the piano and humming most melodiously alfred tomkins was sitting at the round table with his elbows duly squared making a pencil sketch of a head considerably larger than his own o’bleary was reading horace and trying to look as if he understood it and john evenson had drawn his chair close to mrs tibbs’s worktable and was talking to her very earnestly in a low tone  ‘i can assure you mrs tibbs’ said the radical laying his forefinger on the muslin she was at work on ‘i can assure you mrs tibbs that nothing but the interest i take in your welfare would induce me to make this communication  i repeat i fear wisbottle is endeavouring to gain the affections of that young woman agnes and that he is in the habit of meeting her in the storeroom on the first floor over the leads  from my bedroom i distinctly heard voices there last night  i opened my door immediately and crept very softly on to the landing there i saw mr tibbs who it seems had been disturbed also—bless me mrs tibbs you change colour’  ‘no no—it’s nothing’ returned mrs t in a hurried manner ‘it’s only the heat of the room’  ‘a flush’ ejaculated mrs bloss from the cardtable ‘that’s good for four’  ‘if i thought it was mr wisbottle’ said mrs tibbs after a pause ‘he should leave this house instantly’  ‘go’ said mrs bloss again  ‘and if i thought’ continued the hostess with a most threatening air ‘if i thought he was assisted by mr tibbs—’  ‘one for his nob’ said gobler  ‘oh’ said evenson in a most soothing tone—he liked to make mischief—‘i should hope mr tibbs was not in any way implicated  he always appeared to me very harmless’  ‘i have generally found him so’ sobbed poor little mrs tibbs crying like a wateringpot  ‘hush hush pray—mrs tibbs—consider—we shall be observed—pray don’t’ said john evenson fearing his whole plan would be interrupted  ‘we will set the matter at rest with the utmost care and i shall be most happy to assist you in doing so’  mrs tibbs murmured her thanks  ‘when you think every one has retired to rest tonight’ said evenson very pompously ‘if you’ll meet me without a light just outside my bedroom door by the staircase window i think we can ascertain who the parties really are and you will afterwards be enabled to proceed as you think proper’  mrs tibbs was easily persuaded her curiosity was excited her jealousy was roused and the arrangement was forthwith made  she resumed her work and john evenson walked up and down the room with his hands in his pockets looking as if nothing had happened  the game of cribbage was over and conversation began again  ‘well mr o’bleary’ said the hummingtop turning round on his pivot and facing the company ‘what did you think of vauxhall the other night’  ‘oh it’s very fair’ replied orson who had been enthusiastically delighted with the whole exhibition  ‘never saw anything like that captain ross’s setout—eh’  ‘no’ returned the patriot with his usual reservation—‘except in dublin’  ‘i saw the count de canky and captain fitzthompson in the gardens’ said wisbottle ‘they appeared much delighted’  ‘then it must be beautiful’ snarled evenson  ‘i think the white bears is partickerlerly well done’ suggested mrs bloss  ‘in their shaggy white coats they look just like polar bears—don’t you think they do mr evenson’  ‘i think they look a great deal more like omnibus cads on all fours’ replied the discontented one  ‘upon the whole i should have liked our evening very well’ gasped gobler ‘only i caught a desperate cold which increased my pain dreadfully  i was obliged to have several showerbaths before i could leave my room’  ‘capital things those showerbaths’ ejaculated wisbottle  ‘excellent’ said tomkins  ‘delightful’ chimed in o’bleary  he had once seen one outside a tinman’s  ‘disgusting machines’ rejoined evenson who extended his dislike to almost every created object masculine feminine or neuter  ‘disgusting mr evenson’ said gobler in a tone of strong indignation—‘disgusting  look at their utility—consider how many lives they have saved by promoting perspiration’  ‘promoting perspiration indeed’ growled john evenson stopping short in his walk across the large squares in the pattern of the carpet—‘i was ass enough to be persuaded some time ago to have one in my bedroom  ‘gad i was in it once and it effectually cured me for the mere sight of it threw me into a profuse perspiration for six months afterwards’  a titter followed this announcement and before it had subsided james brought up ‘the tray’ containing the remains of a leg of lamb which had made its début at dinner bread cheese an atom of butter in a forest of parsley one pickled walnut and the third of another and so forth the boy disappeared and returned again with another tray containing glasses and jugs of hot and cold water  the gentlemen brought in their spiritbottles the housemaid placed divers plated bedroom candlesticks under the cardtable and the servants retired for the night  chairs were drawn round the table and the conversation proceeded in the customary manner  john evenson who never ate supper lolled on the sofa and amused himself by contradicting everybody  o’bleary ate as much as he could conveniently carry and mrs tibbs felt a due degree of indignation thereat mr gobler and mrs bloss conversed most affectionately on the subject of pilltaking and other innocent amusements and tomkins and wisbottle ‘got into an argument’ that is to say they both talked very loudly and vehemently each flattering himself that he had got some advantage about something and neither of them having more than a very indistinct idea of what they were talking about an hour or two passed away and the boarders and the plated candlesticks retired in pairs to their respective bedrooms  john evenson pulled off his boots locked his door and determined to sit up until mr gobler had retired  he always sat in the drawingroom an hour after everybody else had left it taking medicine and groaning  great coramstreet was hushed into a state of profound repose it was nearly two o’clock  a hackneycoach now and then rumbled slowly by and occasionally some stray lawyer’s clerk on his way home to somerstown struck his iron heel on the top of the coalcellar with a noise resembling the click of a smokejack  a low monotonous gushing sound was heard which added considerably to the romantic dreariness of the scene  it was the water ‘coming in’ at number eleven  ‘he must be asleep by this time’ said john evenson to himself after waiting with exemplary patience for nearly an hour after mr gobler had left the drawingroom  he listened for a few moments the house was perfectly quiet he extinguished his rushlight and opened his bedroom door  the staircase was so dark that it was impossible to see anything  ‘sss’ whispered the mischiefmaker making a noise like the first indication a catherinewheel gives of the probability of its going off  ‘hush’ whispered somebody else  ‘is that you mrs tibbs’  ‘yes sir’  ‘where’  ‘here’ and the misty outline of mrs tibbs appeared at the staircase window like the ghost of queen anne in the tent scene in richard  ‘this way mrs tibbs’ whispered the delighted busybody ‘give me your hand—there  whoever these people are they are in the storeroom now for i have been looking down from my window and i could see that they accidentally upset their candlestick and are now in darkness  you have no shoes on have you’  ‘no’ said little mrs tibbs who could hardly speak for trembling  ‘well i have taken my boots off so we can go down close to the storeroom door and listen over the banisters’ and downstairs they both crept accordingly every board creaking like a patent mangle on a saturday afternoon  ‘it’s wisbottle and somebody i’ll swear’ exclaimed the radical in an energetic whisper when they had listened for a few moments  ‘hush—pray let’s hear what they say’ exclaimed mrs tibbs the gratification of whose curiosity was now paramount to every other consideration  ‘ah if i could but believe you’ said a female voice coquettishly ‘i’d be bound to settle my missis for life’  ‘what does she say’ inquired mr evenson who was not quite so well situated as his companion  ‘she says she’ll settle her missis’s life’ replied mrs tibbs  ‘the wretch they’re plotting murder’  ‘i know you want money’ continued the voice which belonged to agnes ‘and if you’d secure me the five hundred pound i warrant she should take fire soon enough’  ‘what’s that’ inquired evenson again  he could just hear enough to want to hear more  ‘i think she says she’ll set the house on fire’ replied the affrighted mrs tibbs  ‘but thank god i’m insured in the phoenix’  ‘the moment i have secured your mistress my dear’ said a man’s voice in a strong irish brogue ‘you may depend on having the money’  ‘bless my soul it’s mr o’bleary’ exclaimed mrs tibbs in a parenthesis  ‘the villain’ said the indignant mr evenson  ‘the first thing to be done’ continued the hibernian ‘is to poison mr gobler’s mind’  ‘oh certainly’ returned agnes  ‘what’s that’ inquired evenson again in an agony of curiosity and a whisper  ‘he says she’s to mind and poison mr gobler’ replied mrs tibbs aghast at this sacrifice of human life  ‘and in regard of mrs tibbs’ continued o’bleary—mrs tibbs shuddered  ‘hush’ exclaimed agnes in a tone of the greatest alarm just as mrs tibbs was on the extreme verge of a fainting fit  ‘hush’  ‘hush’ exclaimed evenson at the same moment to mrs tibbs  ‘there’s somebody coming upstairs’ said agnes to o’bleary  ‘there’s somebody coming downstairs’ whispered evenson to mrs tibbs  ‘go into the parlour sir’ said agnes to her companion  ‘you will get there before whoever it is gets to the top of the kitchen stairs’  ‘the drawingroom mrs tibbs’ whispered the astonished evenson to his equally astonished companion and for the drawingroom they both made plainly hearing the rustling of two persons one coming downstairs and one coming up  ‘what can it be’ exclaimed mrs tibbs  ‘it’s like a dream  i wouldn’t be found in this situation for the world’  ‘nor i’ returned evenson who could never bear a joke at his own expense  ‘hush here they are at the door’  ‘what fun’ whispered one of the newcomers—it was wisbottle  ‘glorious’ replied his companion in an equally low tone—this was alfred tomkins  ‘who would have thought it’  ‘i told you so’ said wisbottle in a most knowing whisper  ‘lord bless you he has paid her most extraordinary attention for the last two months  i saw ’em when i was sitting at the piano tonight’  ‘well do you know i didn’t notice it’ interrupted tomkins  ‘not notice it’ continued wisbottle  ‘bless you i saw him whispering to her and she crying and then i’ll swear i heard him say something about tonight when we were all in bed’  ‘they’re talking of us’ exclaimed the agonised mrs tibbs as the painful suspicion and a sense of their situation flashed upon her mind  ‘i know it—i know it’ replied evenson with a melancholy consciousness that there was no mode of escape  ‘what’s to be done we cannot both stop here’ ejaculated mrs tibbs in a state of partial derangement  ‘i’ll get up the chimney’ replied evenson who really meant what he said  ‘you can’t’ said mrs tibbs in despair  ‘you can’t—it’s a register stove’  ‘hush’ repeated john evenson  ‘hush—hush’ cried somebody downstairs  ‘what a dd hushing’ said alfred tomkins who began to get rather bewildered  ‘there they are’ exclaimed the sapient wisbottle as a rustling noise was heard in the storeroom  ‘hark’ whispered both the young men  ‘hark’ repeated mrs tibbs and evenson  ‘let me alone sir’ said a female voice in the storeroom  ‘oh hagnes’ cried another voice which clearly belonged to tibbs for nobody else ever owned one like it ‘oh hagnes—lovely creature’  ‘be quiet sir’  a bounce  ‘hag—’  ‘be quiet sir—i am ashamed of you  think of your wife mr tibbs  be quiet sir’  ‘my wife’ exclaimed the valorous tibbs who was clearly under the influence of ginandwater and a misplaced attachment ‘i ate her  oh hagnes when i was in the volunteer corps in eighteen hundred and—’  ‘i declare i’ll scream  be quiet sir will you’  another bounce and a scuffle  ‘what’s that’ exclaimed tibbs with a start  ‘what’s what’ said agnes stopping short  ‘why that’  ‘ah you have done it nicely now sir’ sobbed the frightened agnes as a tapping was heard at mrs tibbs’s bedroom door which would have beaten any dozen woodpeckers hollow  ‘mrs tibbs  mrs tibbs’ called out mrs bloss  ‘mrs tibbs pray get up’  here the imitation of a woodpecker was resumed with tenfold violence  ‘oh dear—dear’ exclaimed the wretched partner of the depraved tibbs ‘she’s knocking at my door  we must be discovered  what will they think’  ‘mrs tibbs  mrs tibbs’ screamed the woodpecker again  ‘what’s the matter’ shouted gobler bursting out of the back drawingroom like the dragon at astley’s  ‘oh mr gobler’ cried mrs bloss with a proper approximation to hysterics ‘i think the house is on fire or else there’s thieves in it i have heard the most dreadful noises’  ‘the devil you have’ shouted gobler again bouncing back into his den in happy imitation of the aforesaid dragon and returning immediately with a lighted candle  ‘why what’s this  wisbottle  tomkins o’bleary  agnes  what the deuce all up and dressed’  ‘astonishing’ said mrs bloss who had run downstairs and taken mr gobler’s arm  ‘call mrs tibbs directly somebody’ said gobler turning into the front drawingroom—‘what  mrs tibbs and mr evenson’  ‘mrs tibbs and mr evenson’ repeated everybody as that unhappy pair were discovered mrs tibbs seated in an armchair by the fireplace and mr evenson standing by her side  we must leave the scene that ensued to the reader’s imagination  we could tell how mrs tibbs forthwith fainted away and how it required the united strength of mr wisbottle and mr alfred tomkins to hold her in her chair how mr evenson explained and how his explanation was evidently disbelieved how agnes repelled the accusations of mrs tibbs by proving that she was negotiating with mr o’bleary to influence her mistress’s affections in his behalf and how mr gobler threw a damp counterpane on the hopes of mr o’bleary by avowing that he gobler had already proposed to and been accepted by mrs bloss how agnes was discharged from that lady’s service how mr o’bleary discharged himself from mrs tibbs’s house without going through the form of previously discharging his bill and how that disappointed young gentleman rails against england and the english and vows there is no virtue or fine feeling extant ‘except in ireland’  we repeat that we could tell all this but we love to exercise our selfdenial and we therefore prefer leaving it to be imagined  the lady whom we have hitherto described as mrs bloss is no more  mrs gobler exists mrs bloss has left us for ever  in a secluded retreat in newington butts far far removed from the noisy strife of that great boardinghouse the world the enviable gobler and his pleasing wife revel in retirement happy in their complaints their table and their medicine wafted through life by the grateful prayers of all the purveyors of animal food within three miles round  we would willingly stop here but we have a painful duty imposed upon us which we must discharge  mr and mrs tibbs have separated by mutual consent mrs tibbs receiving one moiety of 43l 15s 10d which we before stated to be the amount of her husband’s annual income and mr tibbs the other  he is spending the evening of his days in retirement and he is spending also annually that small but honourable independence  he resides among the original settlers at walworth and it has been stated on unquestionable authority that the conclusion of the volunteer story has been heard in a small tavern in that respectable neighbourhood  the unfortunate mrs tibbs has determined to dispose of the whole of her furniture by public auction and to retire from a residence in which she has suffered so much  mr robins has been applied to to conduct the sale and the transcendent abilities of the literary gentlemen connected with his establishment are now devoted to the task of drawing up the preliminary advertisement  it is to contain among a variety of brilliant matter seventyeight words in large capitals and six original quotations in inverted commas    chapter ii—mr minns and his cousin   mr augustus minns was a bachelor of about forty as he said—of about eightandforty as his friends said  he was always exceedingly clean precise and tidy perhaps somewhat priggish and the most retiring man in the world  he usually wore a brown frockcoat without a wrinkle light inexplicables without a spot a neat neckerchief with a remarkably neat tie and boots without a fault moreover he always carried a brown silk umbrella with an ivory handle  he was a clerk in somersethouse or as he said himself he held ‘a responsible situation under government’  he had a good and increasing salary in addition to some 10000l of his own invested in the funds and he occupied a first floor in tavistockstreet coventgarden where he had resided for twenty years having been in the habit of quarrelling with his landlord the whole time regularly giving notice of his intention to quit on the first day of every quarter and as regularly countermanding it on the second there were two classes of created objects which he held in the deepest and most unmingled horror these were dogs and children  he was not unamiable but he could at any time have viewed the execution of a dog or the assassination of an infant with the liveliest satisfaction their habits were at variance with his love of order and his love of order was as powerful as his love of life  mr augustus minns had no relations in or near london with the exception of his cousin mr octavius budden to whose son whom he had never seen for he disliked the father he had consented to become godfather by proxy  mr budden having realised a moderate fortune by exercising the trade or calling of a cornchandler and having a great predilection for the country had purchased a cottage in the vicinity of stamfordhill whither he retired with the wife of his bosom and his only son master alexander augustus budden  one evening as mr and mrs b were admiring their son discussing his various merits talking over his education and disputing whether the classics should be made an essential part thereof the lady pressed so strongly upon her husband the propriety of cultivating the friendship of mr minns in behalf of their son that mr budden at last made up his mind that it should not be his fault if he and his cousin were not in future more intimate  ‘i’ll break the ice my love’ said mr budden stirring up the sugar at the bottom of his glass of brandyandwater and casting a sidelong look at his spouse to see the effect of the announcement of his determination ‘by asking minns down to dine with us on sunday’  ‘then pray budden write to your cousin at once’ replied mrs budden ‘who knows if we could only get him down here but he might take a fancy to our alexander and leave him his property—alick my dear take your legs off the rail of the chair’  ‘very true’ said mr budden musing ‘very true indeed my love’  on the following morning as mr minns was sitting at his breakfasttable alternately biting his dry toast and casting a look upon the columns of his morning paper which he always read from the title to the printer’s name he heard a loud knock at the streetdoor which was shortly afterwards followed by the entrance of his servant who put into his hands a particularly small card on which was engraven in immense letters ‘mr octavius budden amelia cottage mrs b’s name was amelia poplarwalk stamfordhill’  ‘budden’ ejaculated minns ‘what can bring that vulgar man here—say i’m asleep—say i’m out and shall never be home again—anything to keep him downstairs’  ‘but please sir the gentleman’s coming up’ replied the servant and the fact was made evident by an appalling creaking of boots on the staircase accompanied by a pattering noise the cause of which minns could not for the life of him divine  ‘hem—show the gentleman in’ said the unfortunate bachelor  exit servant and enter octavius preceded by a large white dog dressed in a suit of fleecy hosiery with pink eyes large ears and no perceptible tail  the cause of the pattering on the stairs was but too plain  mr augustus minns staggered beneath the shock of the dog’s appearance  ‘my dear fellow how are you’ said budden as he entered  he always spoke at the top of his voice and always said the same thing halfadozen times  ‘how are you my hearty’  ‘how do you do mr budden—pray take a chair’ politely stammered the discomfited minns  ‘thank you—thank you—well—how are you eh’  ‘uncommonly well thank you’ said minns casting a diabolical look at the dog who with his hind legs on the floor and his fore paws resting on the table was dragging a bit of bread and butter out of a plate preparatory to devouring it with the buttered side next the carpet  ‘ah you rogue’ said budden to his dog ‘you see minns he’s like me always at home eh my boy—egad i’m precious hot and hungry  i’ve walked all the way from stamfordhill this morning’  ‘have you breakfasted’ inquired minns  ‘oh no—came to breakfast with you so ring the bell my dear fellow will you and let’s have another cup and saucer and the cold ham—make myself at home you see’ continued budden dusting his boots with a tablenapkin  ‘ha—ha—ha—’pon my life i’m hungry’  minns rang the bell and tried to smile  ‘i decidedly never was so hot in my life’ continued octavius wiping his forehead ‘well but how are you minns  ‘pon my soul you wear capitally’  ‘d’ye think so’ said minns and he tried another smile  ‘’pon my life i do’  ‘mrs b and—what’s his name—quite well’  ‘alick—my son you mean never better—never better  but at such a place as we’ve got at poplarwalk you know he couldn’t be ill if he tried when i first saw it by jove it looked so knowing with the front garden and the green railings and the brass knocker and all that—i really thought it was a cut above me’  ‘don’t you think you’d like the ham better’ interrupted minns ‘if you cut it the other way’  he saw with feelings which it is impossible to describe that his visitor was cutting or rather maiming the ham in utter violation of all established rules  ‘no thank ye’ returned budden with the most barbarous indifference to crime ‘i prefer it this way it eats short  but i say minns when will you come down and see us  you will be delighted with the place i know you will  amelia and i were talking about you the other night and amelia said—another lump of sugar please thank ye—she said don’t you think you could contrive my dear to say to mr minns in a friendly way—come down sir—damn the dog he’s spoiling your curtains minns—ha—ha—ha’  minns leaped from his seat as though he had received the discharge from a galvanic battery  ‘come out sir—go out hoo’ cried poor augustus keeping nevertheless at a very respectful distance from the dog having read of a case of hydrophobia in the paper of that morning  by dint of great exertion much shouting and a marvellous deal of poking under the tables with a stick and umbrella the dog was at last dislodged and placed on the landing outside the door where he immediately commenced a most appalling howling at the same time vehemently scratching the paint off the two nicelyvarnished bottom panels until they resembled the interior of a backgammonboard  ‘a good dog for the country that’ coolly observed budden to the distracted minns ‘but he’s not much used to confinement  but now minns when will you come down  i’ll take no denial positively  let’s see today’s thursday—will you come on sunday  we dine at five don’t say no—do’  after a great deal of pressing mr augustus minns driven to despair accepted the invitation and promised to be at poplarwalk on the ensuing sunday at a quarter before five to the minute  ‘now mind the direction’ said budden ‘the coach goes from the flowerpot in bishopsgatestreet every half hour  when the coach stops at the swan you’ll see immediately opposite you a white house’  ‘which is your house—i understand’ said minns wishing to cut short the visit and the story at the same time  ‘no no that’s not mine that’s grogus’s the great ironmonger’s  i was going to say—you turn down by the side of the white house till you can’t go another step further—mind that—and then you turn to your right by some stables—well close to you you’ll see a wall with “beware of the dog” written on it in large letters—minns shuddered—go along by the side of that wall for about a quarter of a mile—and anybody will show you which is my place’  ‘very well—thank ye—goodbye’  ‘be punctual’  ‘certainly good morning’  ‘i say minns you’ve got a card’  ‘yes i have thank ye’  and mr octavius budden departed leaving his cousin looking forward to his visit on the following sunday with the feelings of a penniless poet to the weekly visit of his scotch landlady  sunday arrived the sky was bright and clear crowds of people were hurrying along the streets intent on their different schemes of pleasure for the day everything and everybody looked cheerful and happy except mr augustus minns  the day was fine but the heat was considerable when mr minns had fagged up the shady side of fleetstreet cheapside and threadneedlestreet he had become pretty warm tolerably dusty and it was getting late into the bargain  by the most extraordinary good fortune however a coach was waiting at the flowerpot into which mr augustus minns got on the solemn assurance of the cad that the vehicle would start in three minutes—that being the very utmost extremity of time it was allowed to wait by act of parliament  a quarter of an hour elapsed and there were no signs of moving  minns looked at his watch for the sixth time  ‘coachman are you going or not’ bawled mr minns with his head and half his body out of the coach window  ‘directly sir’ said the coachman with his hands in his pockets looking as much unlike a man in a hurry as possible  ‘bill take them cloths off’  five minutes more elapsed at the end of which time the coachman mounted the box from whence he looked down the street and up the street and hailed all the pedestrians for another five minutes  ‘coachman if you don’t go this moment i shall get out’ said mr minns rendered desperate by the lateness of the hour and the impossibility of being in poplarwalk at the appointed time  ‘going this minute sir’ was the reply—and accordingly the machine trundled on for a couple of hundred yards and then stopped again  minns doubled himself up in a corner of the coach and abandoned himself to his fate as a child a mother a bandbox and a parasol became his fellowpassengers  the child was an affectionate and an amiable infant the little dear mistook minns for his other parent and screamed to embrace him  ‘be quiet dear’ said the mamma restraining the impetuosity of the darling whose little fat legs were kicking and stamping and twining themselves into the most complicated forms in an ecstasy of impatience ‘be quiet dear that’s not your papa’  ‘thank heaven i am not’ thought minns as the first gleam of pleasure he had experienced that morning shone like a meteor through his wretchedness  playfulness was agreeably mingled with affection in the disposition of the boy  when satisfied that mr minns was not his parent he endeavoured to attract his notice by scraping his drab trousers with his dirty shoes poking his chest with his mamma’s parasol and other nameless endearments peculiar to infancy with which he beguiled the tediousness of the ride apparently very much to his own satisfaction  when the unfortunate gentleman arrived at the swan he found to his great dismay that it was a quarter past five  the white house the stables the ‘beware of the dog’—every landmark was passed with a rapidity not unusual to a gentleman of a certain age when too late for dinner  after the lapse of a few minutes mr minns found himself opposite a yellow brick house with a green door brass knocker and doorplate green windowframes and ditto railings with ‘a garden’ in front that is to say a small loose bit of gravelled ground with one round and two scalene triangular beds containing a firtree twenty or thirty bulbs and an unlimited number of marigolds  the taste of mr and mrs budden was further displayed by the appearance of a cupid on each side of the door perched upon a heap of large chalk flints variegated with pink conchshells  his knock at the door was answered by a stumpy boy in drab livery cotton stockings and highlows who after hanging his hat on one of the dozen brass pegs which ornamented the passage denominated by courtesy ‘the hall’ ushered him into a front drawingroom commanding a very extensive view of the backs of the neighbouring houses  the usual ceremony of introduction and so forth over mr minns took his seat not a little agitated at finding that he was the last comer and somehow or other the lion of about a dozen people sitting together in a small drawingroom getting rid of that most tedious of all time the time preceding dinner  ‘well brogson’ said budden addressing an elderly gentleman in a black coat drab kneebreeches and long gaiters who under pretence of inspecting the prints in an annual had been engaged in satisfying himself on the subject of mr minns’s general appearance by looking at him over the tops of the leaves—‘well brogson what do ministers mean to do  will they go out or what’  ‘oh—why—really you know i’m the last person in the world to ask for news  your cousin from his situation is the most likely person to answer the question’  mr minns assured the last speaker that although he was in somersethouse he possessed no official communication relative to the projects of his majesty’s ministers  but his remark was evidently received incredulously and no further conjectures being hazarded on the subject a long pause ensued during which the company occupied themselves in coughing and blowing their noses until the entrance of mrs budden caused a general rise  the ceremony of introduction being over dinner was announced and downstairs the party proceeded accordingly—mr minns escorting mrs budden as far as the drawingroom door but being prevented by the narrowness of the staircase from extending his gallantry any farther the dinner passed off as such dinners usually do  ever and anon amidst the clatter of knives and forks and the hum of conversation mr b’s voice might be heard asking a friend to take wine and assuring him he was glad to see him and a great deal of byplay took place between mrs b and the servants respecting the removal of the dishes during which her countenance assumed all the variations of a weatherglass from ‘stormy’ to ‘set fair’  upon the dessert and wine being placed on the table the servant in compliance with a significant look from mrs b brought down ‘master alexander’ habited in a skyblue suit with silver buttons and possessing hair of nearly the same colour as the metal  after sundry praises from his mother and various admonitions as to his behaviour from his father he was introduced to his godfather  ‘well my little fellow—you are a fine boy ain’t you’ said mr minns as happy as a tomtit on birdlime  ‘yes’  ‘how old are you’  ‘eight next we’nsday  how old are you’  ‘alexander’ interrupted his mother ‘how dare you ask mr minns how old he is’  ‘he asked me how old i was’ said the precocious child to whom minns had from that moment internally resolved that he never would bequeath one shilling  as soon as the titter occasioned by the observation had subsided a little smirking man with red whiskers sitting at the bottom of the table who during the whole of dinner had been endeavouring to obtain a listener to some stories about sheridan called out with a very patronising air ‘alick what part of speech is be’  ‘a verb’  ‘that’s a good boy’ said mrs budden with all a mother’s pride  ‘now you know what a verb is’  ‘a verb is a word which signifies to be to do or to suffer as i am—i rule—i am ruled  give me an apple ma’  ‘i’ll give you an apple’ replied the man with the red whiskers who was an established friend of the family or in other words was always invited by mrs budden whether mr budden liked it or not ‘if you’ll tell me what is the meaning of be’  ‘be’ said the prodigy after a little hesitation—‘an insect that gathers honey’  ‘no dear’ frowned mrs budden ‘b double e is the substantive’  ‘i don’t think he knows much yet about common substantives’ said the smirking gentleman who thought this an admirable opportunity for letting off a joke  ‘it’s clear he’s not very well acquainted with proper names  he he he’  ‘gentlemen’ called out mr budden from the end of the table in a stentorian voice and with a very important air ‘will you have the goodness to charge your glasses  i have a toast to propose’  ‘hear hear’ cried the gentlemen passing the decanters  after they had made the round of the table mr budden proceeded—‘gentlemen there is an individual present—’  ‘hear hear’ said the little man with red whiskers  ‘pray be quiet jones’ remonstrated budden  ‘i say gentlemen there is an individual present’ resumed the host ‘in whose society i am sure we must take great delight—and—and—the conversation of that individual must have afforded to every one present the utmost pleasure’  ‘thank heaven he does not mean me’ thought minns conscious that his diffidence and exclusiveness had prevented his saying above a dozen words since he entered the house  ‘gentlemen i am but a humble individual myself and i perhaps ought to apologise for allowing any individual feeling of friendship and affection for the person i allude to to induce me to venture to rise to propose the health of that person—a person that i am sure—that is to say a person whose virtues must endear him to those who know him—and those who have not the pleasure of knowing him cannot dislike him’  ‘hear hear’ said the company in a tone of encouragement and approval  ‘gentlemen’ continued budden ‘my cousin is a man who—who is a relation of my own’  hear hear  minns groaned audibly  ‘who i am most happy to see here and who if he were not here would certainly have deprived us of the great pleasure we all feel in seeing him  loud cries of hear  gentlemen i feel that i have already trespassed on your attention for too long a time  with every feeling—of—with every sentiment of—of—’  ‘gratification’—suggested the friend of the family  ‘—of gratification i beg to propose the health of mr minns’  ‘standing gentlemen’ shouted the indefatigable little man with the whiskers—‘and with the honours  take your time from me if you please hip hip hip—za—hip hip hip—za—hip hip—zaaa’  all eyes were now fixed on the subject of the toast who by gulping down port wine at the imminent hazard of suffocation endeavoured to conceal his confusion  after as long a pause as decency would admit he rose but as the newspapers sometimes say in their reports ‘we regret that we are quite unable to give even the substance of the honourable gentleman’s observations’  the words ‘present company—honour—present occasion’ and ‘great happiness’—heard occasionally and repeated at intervals with a countenance expressive of the utmost confusion and misery convinced the company that he was making an excellent speech and accordingly on his resuming his seat they cried ‘bravo’ and manifested tumultuous applause  jones who had been long watching his opportunity then darted up  ‘budden’ said he ‘will you allow me to propose a toast’  ‘certainly’ replied budden adding in an undertone to minns right across the table ‘devilish sharp fellow that you’ll be very much pleased with his speech  he talks equally well on any subject’  minns bowed and mr jones proceeded  ‘it has on several occasions in various instances under many circumstances and in different companies fallen to my lot to propose a toast to those by whom at the time i have had the honour to be surrounded i have sometimes i will cheerfully own—for why should i deny it—felt the overwhelming nature of the task i have undertaken and my own utter incapability to do justice to the subject  if such have been my feelings however on former occasions what must they be now—now—under the extraordinary circumstances in which i am placed hear hear  to describe my feelings accurately would be impossible but i cannot give you a better idea of them gentlemen than by referring to a circumstance which happens oddly enough to occur to my mind at the moment  on one occasion when that truly great and illustrious man sheridan was—’  now there is no knowing what new villainy in the form of a joke would have been heaped on the grave of that very illused man mr sheridan if the boy in drab had not at that moment entered the room in a breathless state to report that as it was a very wet night the nine o’clock stage had come round to know whether there was anybody going to town as in that case he the nine o’clock had room for one inside  mr minns started up and despite countless exclamations of surprise and entreaties to stay persisted in his determination to accept the vacant place  but the brown silk umbrella was nowhere to be found and as the coachman couldn’t wait he drove back to the swan leaving word for mr minns to ‘run round’ and catch him  however as it did not occur to mr minns for some ten minutes or so that he had left the brown silk umbrella with the ivory handle in the other coach coming down and moreover as he was by no means remarkable for speed it is no matter of surprise that when he accomplished the feat of ‘running round’ to the swan the coach—the last coach—had gone without him  it was somewhere about three o’clock in the morning when mr augustus minns knocked feebly at the streetdoor of his lodgings in tavistockstreet cold wet cross and miserable  he made his will next morning and his professional man informs us in that strict confidence in which we inform the public that neither the name of mr octavius budden nor of mrs amelia budden nor of master alexander augustus budden appears therein    chapter iii—sentiment   the miss crumptons or to quote the authority of the inscription on the gardengate of minerva house hammersmith ‘the misses crumpton’ were two unusually tall particularly thin and exceedingly skinny personages very upright and very yellow  miss amelia crumpton owned to thirtyeight and miss maria crumpton admitted she was forty an admission which was rendered perfectly unnecessary by the selfevident fact of her being at least fifty  they dressed in the most interesting manner—like twins and looked as happy and comfortable as a couple of marigolds run to seed  they were very precise had the strictest possible ideas of propriety wore false hair and always smelt very strongly of lavender  minerva house conducted under the auspices of the two sisters was a ‘finishing establishment for young ladies’ where some twenty girls of the ages of from thirteen to nineteen inclusive acquired a smattering of everything and a knowledge of nothing instruction in french and italian dancing lessons twice aweek and other necessaries of life the house was a white one a little removed from the roadside with close palings in front  the bedroom windows were always left partly open to afford a bird’seye view of numerous little bedsteads with very white dimity furniture and thereby impress the passerby with a due sense of the luxuries of the establishment and there was a front parlour hung round with highly varnished maps which nobody ever looked at and filled with books which no one ever read appropriated exclusively to the reception of parents who whenever they called could not fail to be struck with the very deep appearance of the place  ‘amelia my dear’ said miss maria crumpton entering the schoolroom one morning with her false hair in papers as she occasionally did in order to impress the young ladies with a conviction of its reality  ‘amelia my dear here is a most gratifying note i have just received  you needn’t mind reading it aloud’  miss amelia thus advised proceeded to read the following note with an air of great triumph      ‘cornelius brook dingwall esq mp presents his compliments to     miss crumpton and will feel much obliged by miss crumpton’s calling     on him if she conveniently can tomorrow morning at one o’clock as     cornelius brook dingwall esq mp is anxious to see miss crumpton     on the subject of placing miss brook dingwall under her charge      ‘adelphi      ‘monday morning’  ‘a member of parliament’s daughter’ ejaculated amelia in an ecstatic tone  ‘a member of parliament’s daughter’ repeated miss maria with a smile of delight which of course elicited a concurrent titter of pleasure from all the young ladies  ‘it’s exceedingly delightful’ said miss amelia whereupon all the young ladies murmured their admiration again  courtiers are but schoolboys and courtladies schoolgirl’s  so important an announcement at once superseded the business of the day a holiday was declared in commemoration of the great event the miss crumptons retired to their private apartment to talk it over the smaller girls discussed the probable manners and customs of the daughter of a member of parliament and the young ladies verging on eighteen wondered whether she was engaged whether she was pretty whether she wore much bustle and many other whethers of equal importance  the two miss crumptons proceeded to the adelphi at the appointed time next day dressed of course in their best style and looking as amiable as they possibly could—which bythebye is not saying much for them having sent in their cards through the medium of a redhot looking footman in bright livery they were ushered into the august presence of the profound dingwall  cornelius brook dingwall esq mp was very haughty solemn and portentous  he had naturally a somewhat spasmodic expression of countenance which was not rendered the less remarkable by his wearing an extremely stiff cravat  he was wonderfully proud of the mp attached to his name and never lost an opportunity of reminding people of his dignity  he had a great idea of his own abilities which must have been a great comfort to him as no one else had and in diplomacy on a small scale in his own family arrangements he considered himself unrivalled he was a county magistrate and discharged the duties of his station with all due justice and impartiality frequently committing poachers and occasionally committing himself  miss brook dingwall was one of that numerous class of young ladies who like adverbs may be known by their answering to a commonplace question and doing nothing else  on the present occasion this talented individual was seated in a small library at a table covered with papers doing nothing but trying to look busy playing at shop  acts of parliament and letters directed to ‘cornelius brook dingwall esq mp’ were ostentatiously scattered over the table at a little distance from which mrs brook dingwall was seated at work  one of those public nuisances a spoiled child was playing about the room dressed after the most approved fashion—in a blue tunic with a black belt—a quarter of a yard wide fastened with an immense buckle—looking like a robber in a melodrama seen through a diminishing glass  after a little pleasantry from the sweet child who amused himself by running away with miss maria crumpton’s chair as fast as it was placed for her the visitors were seated and cornelius brook dingwall esq opened the conversation  he had sent for miss crumpton he said in consequence of the high character he had received of her establishment from his friend sir alfred muggs  miss crumpton murmured her acknowledgments to him muggs and cornelius proceeded  ‘one of my principal reasons miss crumpton for parting with my daughter is that she has lately acquired some sentimental ideas which it is most desirable to eradicate from her young mind’  here the little innocent before noticed fell out of an armchair with an awful crash  ‘naughty boy’ said his mamma who appeared more surprised at his taking the liberty of falling down than at anything else ‘i’ll ring the bell for james to take him away’  ‘pray don’t check him my love’ said the diplomatist as soon as he could make himself heard amidst the unearthly howling consequent upon the threat and the tumble  ‘it all arises from his great flow of spirits’ this last explanation was addressed to miss crumpton  ‘certainly sir’ replied the antique maria not exactly seeing however the connexion between a flow of animal spirits and a fall from an armchair  silence was restored and the mp resumed ‘now i know nothing so likely to effect this object miss crumpton as her mixing constantly in the society of girls of her own age and as i know that in your establishment she will meet such as are not likely to contaminate her young mind i propose to send her to you’  the youngest miss crumpton expressed the acknowledgments of the establishment generally  maria was rendered speechless by bodily pain the dear little fellow having recovered his animal spirits was standing upon her most tender foot by way of getting his face which looked like a capital o in a redlettered playbill on a level with the writingtable  ‘of course lavinia will be a parlour boarder’ continued the enviable father ‘and on one point i wish my directions to be strictly observed the fact is that some ridiculous love affair with a person much her inferior in life has been the cause of her present state of mind knowing that of course under your care she can have no opportunity of meeting this person i do not object to—indeed i should rather prefer—her mixing with such society as you see yourself’  this important statement was again interrupted by the highspirited little creature in the excess of his joyousness breaking a pane of glass and nearly precipitating himself into an adjacent area  james was rung for considerable confusion and screaming succeeded two little blue legs were seen to kick violently in the air as the man left the room and the child was gone  ‘mr brook dingwall would like miss brook dingwall to learn everything’ said mrs brook dingwall who hardly ever said anything at all  ‘certainly’ said both the miss crumptons together  ‘and as i trust the plan i have devised will be effectual in weaning my daughter from this absurd idea miss crumpton’ continued the legislator ‘i hope you will have the goodness to comply in all respects with any request i may forward to you’  the promise was of course made and after a lengthened discussion conducted on behalf of the dingwalls with the most becoming diplomatic gravity and on that of the crumptons with profound respect it was finally arranged that miss lavinia should be forwarded to hammersmith on the next day but one on which occasion the halfyearly ball given at the establishment was to take place  it might divert the dear girl’s mind this by the way was another bit of diplomacy  miss lavinia was introduced to her future governess and both the miss crumptons pronounced her ‘a most charming girl’ an opinion which by a singular coincidence they always entertained of any new pupil  courtesies were exchanged acknowledgments expressed condescension exhibited and the interview terminated  preparations to make use of theatrical phraseology ‘on a scale of magnitude never before attempted’ were incessantly made at minerva house to give every effect to the forthcoming ball  the largest room in the house was pleasingly ornamented with blue calico roses plaid tulips and other equally naturallooking artificial flowers the work of the young ladies themselves  the carpet was taken up the foldingdoors were taken down the furniture was taken out and routseats were taken in  the linendrapers of hammersmith were astounded at the sudden demand for blue sarsenet ribbon and long white gloves  dozens of geraniums were purchased for bouquets and a harp and two violins were bespoke from town in addition to the grand piano already on the premises  the young ladies who were selected to show off on the occasion and do credit to the establishment practised incessantly much to their own satisfaction and greatly to the annoyance of the lame old gentleman over the way and a constant correspondence was kept up between the misses crumpton and the hammersmith pastrycook  the evening came and then there was such a lacing of stays and tying of sandals and dressing of hair as never can take place with a proper degree of bustle out of a boardingschool  the smaller girls managed to be in everybody’s way and were pushed about accordingly and the elder ones dressed and tied and flattered and envied one another as earnestly and sincerely as if they had actually come out  ‘how do i look dear’ inquired miss emily smithers the belle of the house of miss caroline wilson who was her bosom friend because she was the ugliest girl in hammersmith or out of it  ‘oh charming dear  how do i’  ‘delightful you never looked so handsome’ returned the belle adjusting her own dress and not bestowing a glance on her poor companion  ‘i hope young hilton will come early’ said another young lady to miss somebody else in a fever of expectation  ‘i’m sure he’d be highly flattered if he knew it’ returned the other who was practising l’été  ‘oh he’s so handsome’ said the first  ‘such a charming person’ added a second  ‘such a distingué air’ said a third  ‘oh what do you think’ said another girl running into the room ‘miss crumpton says her cousin’s coming’  ‘what  theodosius butler’ said everybody in raptures  ‘is he handsome’ inquired a novice  ‘no not particularly handsome’ was the general reply ‘but oh so clever’  mr theodosius butler was one of those immortal geniuses who are to be met with in almost every circle  they have usually very deep monotonous voices  they always persuade themselves that they are wonderful persons and that they ought to be very miserable though they don’t precisely know why  they are very conceited and usually possess half an idea but with enthusiastic young ladies and silly young gentlemen they are very wonderful persons  the individual in question mr theodosius had written a pamphlet containing some very weighty considerations on the expediency of doing something or other and as every sentence contained a good many words of four syllables his admirers took it for granted that he meant a good deal  ‘perhaps that’s he’ exclaimed several young ladies as the first pull of the evening threatened destruction to the bell of the gate  an awful pause ensued  some boxes arrived and a young lady—miss brook dingwall in full ball costume with an immense gold chain round her neck and her dress looped up with a single rose an ivory fan in her hand and a most interesting expression of despair in her face  the miss crumptons inquired after the family with the most excruciating anxiety and miss brook dingwall was formally introduced to her future companions  the miss crumptons conversed with the young ladies in the most mellifluous tones in order that miss brook dingwall might be properly impressed with their amiable treatment  another pull at the bell  mr dadson the writingmaster and his wife the wife in green silk with shoes and captrimmings to correspond the writingmaster in a white waistcoat black kneeshorts and ditto silk stockings displaying a leg large enough for two writingmasters  the young ladies whispered one another and the writingmaster and his wife flattered the miss crumptons who were dressed in amber with long sashes like dolls  repeated pulls at the bell and arrivals too numerous to particularise papas and mammas and aunts and uncles the owners and guardians of the different pupils the singingmaster signor lobskini in a black wig the pianoforte player and the violins the harp in a state of intoxication and some twenty young men who stood near the door and talked to one another occasionally bursting into a giggle  a general hum of conversation  coffee handed round and plentifully partaken of by fat mammas who looked like the stout people who come on in pantomimes for the sole purpose of being knocked down  the popular mr hilton was the next arrival and he having at the request of the miss crumptons undertaken the office of master of the ceremonies the quadrilles commenced with considerable spirit  the young men by the door gradually advanced into the middle of the room and in time became sufficiently at ease to consent to be introduced to partners the writingmaster danced every set springing about with the most fearful agility and his wife played a rubber in the backparlour—a little room with five bookshelves dignified by the name of the study setting her down to whist was a halfyearly piece of generalship on the part of the miss crumptons it was necessary to hide her somewhere on account of her being a fright  the interesting lavinia brook dingwall was the only girl present who appeared to take no interest in the proceedings of the evening  in vain was she solicited to dance in vain was the universal homage paid to her as the daughter of a member of parliament  she was equally unmoved by the splendid tenor of the inimitable lobskini and the brilliant execution of miss laetitia parsons whose performance of ‘the recollections of ireland’ was universally declared to be almost equal to that of moscheles himself  not even the announcement of the arrival of mr theodosius butler could induce her to leave the corner of the back drawingroom in which she was seated  ‘now theodosius’ said miss maria crumpton after that enlightened pamphleteer had nearly run the gauntlet of the whole company ‘i must introduce you to our new pupil’  theodosius looked as if he cared for nothing earthly  ‘she’s the daughter of a member of parliament’ said maria—theodosius started  ‘and her name is—’ he inquired  ‘miss brook dingwall’  ‘great heaven’ poetically exclaimed theodosius in a low tone  miss crumpton commenced the introduction in due form  miss brook dingwall languidly raised her head  ‘edward’ she exclaimed with a halfshriek on seeing the wellknown nankeen legs  fortunately as miss maria crumpton possessed no remarkable share of penetration and as it was one of the diplomatic arrangements that no attention was to be paid to miss lavinia’s incoherent exclamations she was perfectly unconscious of the mutual agitation of the parties and therefore seeing that the offer of his hand for the next quadrille was accepted she left him by the side of miss brook dingwall  ‘oh edward’ exclaimed that most romantic of all romantic young ladies as the light of science seated himself beside her ‘oh edward is it you’  mr theodosius assured the dear creature in the most impassioned manner that he was not conscious of being anybody but himself  ‘then why—why—this disguise  oh  edward m’neville walter what have i not suffered on your account’  ‘lavinia hear me’ replied the hero in his most poetic strain  ‘do not condemn me unheard  if anything that emanates from the soul of such a wretch as i can occupy a place in your recollection—if any being so vile deserve your notice—you may remember that i once published a pamphlet and paid for its publication entitled “considerations on the policy of removing the duty on bees’wax”’  ‘i do—i do’ sobbed lavinia  ‘that’ continued the lover ‘was a subject to which your father was devoted heart and soul’  ‘he was—he was’ reiterated the sentimentalist  ‘i knew it’ continued theodosius tragically ‘i knew it—i forwarded him a copy  he wished to know me  could i disclose my real name  never no i assumed that name which you have so often pronounced in tones of endearment  as m’neville walter i devoted myself to the stirring cause as m’neville walter i gained your heart in the same character i was ejected from your house by your father’s domestics and in no character at all have i since been enabled to see you  we now meet again and i proudly own that i am—theodosius butler’  the young lady appeared perfectly satisfied with this argumentative address and bestowed a look of the most ardent affection on the immortal advocate of bees’wax  ‘may i hope’ said he ‘that the promise your father’s violent behaviour interrupted may be renewed’  ‘let us join this set’ replied lavinia coquettishly—for girls of nineteen can coquette  ‘no’ ejaculated he of the nankeens  ‘i stir not from this spot writhing under this torture of suspense  may i—may i—hope’  ‘you may’  ‘the promise is renewed’  ‘it is’  ‘i have your permission’  ‘you have’  ‘to the fullest extent’  ‘you know it’ returned the blushing lavinia  the contortions of the interesting butler’s visage expressed his raptures  we could dilate upon the occurrences that ensued  how mr theodosius and miss lavinia danced and talked and sighed for the remainder of the evening—how the miss crumptons were delighted thereat  how the writingmaster continued to frisk about with onehorse power and how his wife from some unaccountable freak left the whisttable in the little backparlour and persisted in displaying her green headdress in the most conspicuous part of the drawingroom  how the supper consisted of small triangular sandwiches in trays and a tart here and there by way of variety and how the visitors consumed warm water disguised with lemon and dotted with nutmeg under the denomination of negus  these and other matters of as much interest however we pass over for the purpose of describing a scene of even more importance  a fortnight after the date of the ball cornelius brook dingwall esq mp was seated at the same librarytable and in the same room as we have before described  he was alone and his face bore an expression of deep thought and solemn gravity—he was drawing up ‘a bill for the better observance of easter monday’  the footman tapped at the door—the legislator started from his reverie and ‘miss crumpton’ was announced  permission was given for miss crumpton to enter the sanctum maria came sliding in and having taken her seat with a due portion of affectation the footman retired and the governess was left alone with the mp  oh how she longed for the presence of a third party  even the facetious young gentleman would have been a relief  miss crumpton began the duet  she hoped mrs brook dingwall and the handsome little boy were in good health  they were  mrs brook dingwall and little frederick were at brighton  ‘much obliged to you miss crumpton’ said cornelius in his most dignified manner ‘for your attention in calling this morning  i should have driven down to hammersmith to see lavinia but your account was so very satisfactory and my duties in the house occupy me so much that i determined to postpone it for a week  how has she gone on’  ‘very well indeed sir’ returned maria dreading to inform the father that she had gone off  ‘ah i thought the plan on which i proceeded would be a match for her’  here was a favourable opportunity to say that somebody else had been a match for her  but the unfortunate governess was unequal to the task  ‘you have persevered strictly in the line of conduct i prescribed miss crumpton’  ‘strictly sir’  ‘you tell me in your note that her spirits gradually improved’  ‘very much indeed sir’  ‘to be sure  i was convinced they would’  ‘but i fear sir’ said miss crumpton with visible emotion ‘i fear the plan has not succeeded quite so well as we could have wished’  no’ exclaimed the prophet  ‘bless me  miss crumpton you look alarmed what has happened’  ‘miss brook dingwall sir—’  ‘yes ma’am’  ‘has gone sir’—said maria exhibiting a strong inclination to faint  ‘gone’  ‘eloped sir’  ‘eloped—who with—when—where—how’ almost shrieked the agitated diplomatist  the natural yellow of the unfortunate maria’s face changed to all the hues of the rainbow as she laid a small packet on the member’s table  he hurriedly opened it  a letter from his daughter and another from theodosius  he glanced over their contents—‘ere this reaches you far distant—appeal to feelings—love to distraction—bees’wax—slavery’ c c  he dashed his hand to his forehead and paced the room with fearfully long strides to the great alarm of the precise maria  ‘now mind from this time forward’ said mr brook dingwall suddenly stopping at the table and beating time upon it with his hand ‘from this time forward i never will under any circumstances whatever permit a man who writes pamphlets to enter any other room of this house but the kitchen—i’ll allow my daughter and her husband one hundred and fifty pounds ayear and never see their faces again and damme ma’am i’ll bring in a bill for the abolition of finishingschools’  some time has elapsed since this passionate declaration  mr and mrs butler are at present rusticating in a small cottage at ball’spond pleasantly situated in the immediate vicinity of a brickfield  they have no family  mr theodosius looks very important and writes incessantly but in consequence of a gross combination on the part of publishers none of his productions appear in print  his young wife begins to think that ideal misery is preferable to real unhappiness and that a marriage contracted in haste and repented at leisure is the cause of more substantial wretchedness than she ever anticipated  on cool reflection cornelius brook dingwall esq mp was reluctantly compelled to admit that the untoward result of his admirable arrangements was attributable not to the miss crumptons but his own diplomacy  he however consoles himself like some other small diplomatists by satisfactorily proving that if his plans did not succeed they ought to have done so  minerva house is in status quo and ‘the misses crumpton’ remain in the peaceable and undisturbed enjoyment of all the advantages resulting from their finishingschool    chapter iv—the tuggses at ramsgate   once upon a time there dwelt in a narrow street on the surrey side of the water within three minutes’ walk of old london bridge mr joseph tuggs—a little darkfaced man with shiny hair twinkling eyes short legs and a body of very considerable thickness measuring from the centre button of his waistcoat in front to the ornamental buttons of his coat behind  the figure of the amiable mrs tuggs if not perfectly symmetrical was decidedly comfortable and the form of her only daughter the accomplished miss charlotte tuggs was fast ripening into that state of luxuriant plumpness which had enchanted the eyes and captivated the heart of mr joseph tuggs in his earlier days  mr simon tuggs his only son and miss charlotte tuggs’s only brother was as differently formed in body as he was differently constituted in mind from the remainder of his family  there was that elongation in his thoughtful face and that tendency to weakness in his interesting legs which tell so forcibly of a great mind and romantic disposition  the slightest traits of character in such a being possess no mean interest to speculative minds  he usually appeared in public in capacious shoes with black cotton stockings and was observed to be particularly attached to a black glazed stock without tie or ornament of any description  there is perhaps no profession however useful no pursuit however meritorious which can escape the petty attacks of vulgar minds  mr joseph tuggs was a grocer  it might be supposed that a grocer was beyond the breath of calumny but no—the neighbours stigmatised him as a chandler and the poisonous voice of envy distinctly asserted that he dispensed tea and coffee by the quartern retailed sugar by the ounce cheese by the slice tobacco by the screw and butter by the pat  these taunts however were lost upon the tuggses  mr tuggs attended to the grocery department mrs tuggs to the cheesemongery and miss tuggs to her education  mr simon tuggs kept his father’s books and his own counsel  one fine spring afternoon the latter gentleman was seated on a tub of weekly dorset behind the little red desk with a wooden rail which ornamented a corner of the counter when a stranger dismounted from a cab and hastily entered the shop  he was habited in black cloth and bore with him a green umbrella and a blue bag  ‘mr tuggs’ said the stranger inquiringly  ‘my name is tuggs’ replied mr simon  ‘it’s the other mr tuggs’ said the stranger looking towards the glass door which led into the parlour behind the shop and on the inside of which the round face of mr tuggs senior was distinctly visible peeping over the curtain  mr simon gracefully waved his pen as if in intimation of his wish that his father would advance  mr joseph tuggs with considerable celerity removed his face from the curtain and placed it before the stranger  ‘i come from the temple’ said the man with the bag  ‘from the temple’ said mrs tuggs flinging open the door of the little parlour and disclosing miss tuggs in perspective  ‘from the temple’ said miss tuggs and mr simon tuggs at the same moment  ‘from the temple’ said mr joseph tuggs turning as pale as a dutch cheese  ‘from the temple’ repeated the man with the bag ‘from mr cower’s the solicitor’s  mr tuggs i congratulate you sir  ladies i wish you joy of your prosperity  we have been successful’  and the man with the bag leisurely divested himself of his umbrella and glove as a preliminary to shaking hands with mr joseph tuggs  now the words ‘we have been successful’ had no sooner issued from the mouth of the man with the bag than mr simon tuggs rose from the tub of weekly dorset opened his eyes very wide gasped for breath made figures of eight in the air with his pen and finally fell into the arms of his anxious mother and fainted away without the slightest ostensible cause or pretence  ‘water’ screamed mrs tuggs  ‘look up my son’ exclaimed mr tuggs  ‘simon dear simon’ shrieked miss tuggs  ‘i’m better now’ said mr simon tuggs  ‘what successful’  and then as corroborative evidence of his being better he fainted away again and was borne into the little parlour by the united efforts of the remainder of the family and the man with the bag  to a casual spectator or to any one unacquainted with the position of the family this fainting would have been unaccountable  to those who understood the mission of the man with the bag and were moreover acquainted with the excitability of the nerves of mr simon tuggs it was quite comprehensible  a longpending lawsuit respecting the validity of a will had been unexpectedly decided and mr joseph tuggs was the possessor of twenty thousand pounds  a prolonged consultation took place that night in the little parlour—a consultation that was to settle the future destinies of the tuggses  the shop was shut up at an unusually early hour and many were the unavailing kicks bestowed upon the closed door by applicants for quarterns of sugar or halfquarterns of bread or penn’orths of pepper which were to have been ‘left till saturday’ but which fortune had decreed were to be left alone altogether  ‘we must certainly give up business’ said miss tuggs  ‘oh decidedly’ said mrs tuggs  ‘simon shall go to the bar’ said mr joseph tuggs  ‘and i shall always sign myself “cymon” in future’ said his son  ‘and i shall call myself charlotta’ said miss tuggs  ‘and you must always call me “ma” and father “pa”’ said mrs tuggs  ‘yes and pa must leave off all his vulgar habits’ interposed miss tuggs  ‘i’ll take care of all that’ responded mr joseph tuggs complacently he was at that very moment eating pickled salmon with a pocketknife  ‘we must leave town immediately’ said mr cymon tuggs  everybody concurred that this was an indispensable preliminary to being genteel  the question then arose where should they go  ‘gravesend’ mildly suggested mr joseph tuggs  the idea was unanimously scouted  gravesend was low  ‘margate’ insinuated mrs tuggs  worse and worse—nobody there but tradespeople  ‘brighton’  mr cymon tuggs opposed an insurmountable objection  all the coaches had been upset in turn within the last three weeks each coach had averaged two passengers killed and six wounded and in every case the newspapers had distinctly understood that ‘no blame whatever was attributable to the coachman’  ‘ramsgate’ ejaculated mr cymon thoughtfully  to be sure how stupid they must have been not to have thought of that before  ramsgate was just the place of all others  two months after this conversation the city of london ramsgate steamer was running gaily down the river  her flag was flying her band was playing her passengers were conversing everything about her seemed gay and lively—no wonder—the tuggses were on board  ‘charming ain’t it’ said mr joseph tuggs in a bottlegreen greatcoat with a velvet collar of the same and a blue travellingcap with a gold band  ‘soulinspiring’ replied mr cymon tuggs—he was entered at the bar ‘soulinspiring’  ‘delightful morning sir’ said a stoutish militarylooking gentleman in a blue surtout buttoned up to his chin and white trousers chained down to the soles of his boots  mr cymon tuggs took upon himself the responsibility of answering the observation  ‘heavenly’ he replied  ‘you are an enthusiastic admirer of the beauties of nature sir’ said the military gentleman  ‘i am sir’ replied mr cymon tuggs  ‘travelled much sir’ inquired the military gentleman  ‘not much’ replied mr cymon tuggs  ‘you’ve been on the continent of course’ inquired the military gentleman  ‘not exactly’ replied mr cymon tuggs—in a qualified tone as if he wished it to be implied that he had gone halfway and come back again  ‘you of course intend your son to make the grand tour sir’ said the military gentleman addressing mr joseph tuggs  as mr joseph tuggs did not precisely understand what the grand tour was or how such an article was manufactured he replied ‘of course’  just as he said the word there came tripping up from her seat at the stern of the vessel a young lady in a pucecoloured silk cloak and boots of the same with long black ringlets large black eyes brief petticoats and unexceptionable ankles  ‘walter my dear’ said the young lady to the military gentleman  ‘yes belinda my love’ responded the military gentleman to the blackeyed young lady  ‘what have you left me alone so long for’ said the young lady  ‘i have been stared out of countenance by those rude young men’  ‘what stared at’ exclaimed the military gentleman with an emphasis which made mr cymon tuggs withdraw his eyes from the young lady’s face with inconceivable rapidity  ‘which young men—where’ and the military gentleman clenched his fist and glared fearfully on the cigarsmokers around  ‘be calm walter i entreat’ said the young lady  ‘i won’t’ said the military gentleman  ‘do sir’ interposed mr cymon tuggs  ‘they ain’t worth your notice’  ‘no—no—they are not indeed’ urged the young lady  ‘i will be calm’ said the military gentleman  ‘you speak truly sir i thank you for a timely remonstrance which may have spared me the guilt of manslaughter’  calming his wrath the military gentleman wrung mr cymon tuggs by the hand  ‘my sister sir’ said mr cymon tuggs seeing that the military gentleman was casting an admiring look towards miss charlotta  ‘my wife ma’am—mrs captain waters’ said the military gentleman presenting the blackeyed young lady  ‘my mother ma’am—mrs tuggs’ said mr cymon  the military gentleman and his wife murmured enchanting courtesies and the tuggses looked as unembarrassed as they could  ‘walter my dear’ said the blackeyed young lady after they had sat chatting with the tuggses some halfhour  ‘yes my love’ said the military gentleman  ‘don’t you think this gentleman with an inclination of the head towards mr cymon tuggs is very much like the marquis carriwini’  ‘lord bless me very’ said the military gentleman  ‘it struck me the moment i saw him’ said the young lady gazing intently and with a melancholy air on the scarlet countenance of mr cymon tuggs  mr cymon tuggs looked at everybody and finding that everybody was looking at him appeared to feel some temporary difficulty in disposing of his eyesight  ‘so exactly the air of the marquis’ said the military gentleman  ‘quite extraordinary’ sighed the military gentleman’s lady  ‘you don’t know the marquis sir’ inquired the military gentleman  mr cymon tuggs stammered a negative  ‘if you did’ continued captain walter waters ‘you would feel how much reason you have to be proud of the resemblance—a most elegant man with a most prepossessing appearance’  ‘he is—he is indeed’ exclaimed belinda waters energetically  as her eye caught that of mr cymon tuggs she withdrew it from his features in bashful confusion  all this was highly gratifying to the feelings of the tuggses and when in the course of farther conversation it was discovered that miss charlotta tuggs was the fac simile of a titled relative of mrs belinda waters and that mrs tuggs herself was the very picture of the dowager duchess of dobbleton their delight in the acquisition of so genteel and friendly an acquaintance knew no bounds  even the dignity of captain walter waters relaxed to that degree that he suffered himself to be prevailed upon by mr joseph tuggs to partake of cold pigeonpie and sherry on deck and a most delightful conversation aided by these agreeable stimulants was prolonged until they ran alongside ramsgate pier  ‘goodbye dear’ said mrs captain waters to miss charlotta tuggs just before the bustle of landing commenced ‘we shall see you on the sands in the morning and as we are sure to have found lodgings before then i hope we shall be inseparables for many weeks to come’  ‘oh i hope so’ said miss charlotta tuggs emphatically  ‘tickets ladies and gen’lm’n’ said the man on the paddlebox  ‘want a porter sir’ inquired a dozen men in smockfrocks  ‘now my dear’ said captain waters  ‘goodbye’ said mrs captain waters—‘goodbye mr cymon’ and with a pressure of the hand which threw the amiable young man’s nerves into a state of considerable derangement mrs captain waters disappeared among the crowd  a pair of pucecoloured boots were seen ascending the steps a white handkerchief fluttered a black eye gleamed  the waterses were gone and mr cymon tuggs was alone in a heartless world  silently and abstractedly did that too sensitive youth follow his revered parents and a train of smockfrocks and wheelbarrows along the pier until the bustle of the scene around recalled him to himself  the sun was shining brightly the sea dancing to its own music rolled merrily in crowds of people promenaded to and fro young ladies tittered old ladies talked nursemaids displayed their charms to the greatest possible advantage and their little charges ran up and down and to and fro and in and out under the feet and between the legs of the assembled concourse in the most playful and exhilarating manner there were old gentlemen trying to make out objects through long telescopes and young ones making objects of themselves in open shirtcollars ladies carrying about portable chairs and portable chairs carrying about invalids parties waiting on the pier for parties who had come by the steamboat and nothing was to be heard but talking laughing welcoming and merriment  ‘fly sir’ exclaimed a chorus of fourteen men and six boys the moment mr joseph tuggs at the head of his little party set foot in the street  ‘here’s the gen’lm’n at last’ said one touching his hat with mock politeness  ‘werry glad to see you sir—been awaitin’ for you these six weeks  jump in if you please sir’  ‘nice light fly and a fast trotter sir’ said another ‘fourteen mile a hour and surroundin’ objects rendered inwisible by extreme welocity’  ‘large fly for your luggage sir’ cried a third  ‘werry large fly here sir—reg’lar bluebottle’  ‘here’s your fly sir’ shouted another aspiring charioteer mounting the box and inducing an old grey horse to indulge in some imperfect reminiscences of a canter  ‘look at him sir—temper of a lamb and haction of a steamingein’  resisting even the temptation of securing the services of so valuable a quadruped as the last named mr joseph tuggs beckoned to the proprietor of a dingy conveyance of a greenish hue lined with faded striped calico and the luggage and the family having been deposited therein the animal in the shafts after describing circles in the road for a quarter of an hour at last consented to depart in quest of lodgings  ‘how many beds have you got’ screamed mrs tuggs out of the fly to the woman who opened the door of the first house which displayed a bill intimating that apartments were to be let within  ‘how many did you want ma’am’ was of course the reply  ‘three’  ‘will you step in ma’am’  down got mrs tuggs  the family were delighted  splendid view of the sea from the front windows—charming  a short pause  back came mrs tuggs again—one parlour and a mattress  ‘why the devil didn’t they say so at first’ inquired mr joseph tuggs rather pettishly  ‘don’t know’ said mrs tuggs  ‘wretches’ exclaimed the nervous cymon  another bill—another stoppage same question—same answer—similar result  ‘what do they mean by this’ inquired mr joseph tuggs thoroughly out of temper  ‘don’t know’ said the placid mrs tuggs  ‘orvis the vay here sir’ said the driver by way of accounting for the circumstance in a satisfactory manner and off they went again to make fresh inquiries and encounter fresh disappointments  it had grown dusk when the ‘fly’—the rate of whose progress greatly belied its name—after climbing up four or five perpendicular hills stopped before the door of a dusty house with a bay window from which you could obtain a beautiful glimpse of the sea—if you thrust half of your body out of it at the imminent peril of falling into the area mrs tuggs alighted  one groundfloor sittingroom and three cells with beds in them upstairs  a doublehouse  family on the opposite side five children milkandwatering in the parlour and one little boy expelled for bad behaviour screaming on his back in the passage  ‘what’s the terms’ said mrs tuggs  the mistress of the house was considering the expediency of putting on an extra guinea so she coughed slightly and affected not to hear the question  ‘what’s the terms’ said mrs tuggs in a louder key  ‘five guineas a week ma’am with attendance’ replied the lodginghouse keeper  attendance means the privilege of ringing the bell as often as you like for your own amusement  ‘rather dear’ said mrs tuggs  ‘oh dear no ma’am’ replied the mistress of the house with a benign smile of pity at the ignorance of manners and customs which the observation betrayed  ‘very cheap’  such an authority was indisputable  mrs tuggs paid a week’s rent in advance and took the lodgings for a month  in an hour’s time the family were seated at tea in their new abode  ‘capital srimps’ said mr joseph tuggs  mr cymon eyed his father with a rebellious scowl as he emphatically said ‘shrimps’  ‘well then shrimps’ said mr joseph tuggs  ‘srimps or shrimps don’t much matter’  there was pity blended with malignity in mr cymon’s eye as he replied ‘don’t matter father  what would captain waters say if he heard such vulgarity’  ‘or what would dear mrs captain waters say’ added charlotta ‘if she saw mother—ma i mean—eating them whole heads and all’  ‘it won’t bear thinking of’ ejaculated mr cymon with a shudder  ‘how different’ he thought ‘from the dowager duchess of dobbleton’  ‘very pretty woman mrs captain waters is she not cymon’ inquired miss charlotta  a glow of nervous excitement passed over the countenance of mr cymon tuggs as he replied ‘an angel of beauty’  ‘hallo’ said mr joseph tuggs  ‘hallo cymon my boy take care married lady you know’ and he winked one of his twinkling eyes knowingly  ‘why’ exclaimed cymon starting up with an ebullition of fury as unexpected as alarming ‘why am i to be reminded of that blight of my happiness and ruin of my hopes  why am i to be taunted with the miseries which are heaped upon my head  is it not enough to—to—to—’ and the orator paused but whether for want of words or lack of breath was never distinctly ascertained  there was an impressive solemnity in the tone of this address and in the air with which the romantic cymon at its conclusion rang the bell and demanded a flat candlestick which effectually forbade a reply  he stalked dramatically to bed and the tuggses went to bed too half an hour afterwards in a state of considerable mystification and perplexity  if the pier had presented a scene of life and bustle to the tuggses on their first landing at ramsgate it was far surpassed by the appearance of the sands on the morning after their arrival  it was a fine bright clear day with a light breeze from the sea  there were the same ladies and gentlemen the same children the same nursemaids the same telescopes the same portable chairs  the ladies were employed in needlework or watchguard making or knitting or reading novels the gentlemen were reading newspapers and magazines the children were digging holes in the sand with wooden spades and collecting water therein the nursemaids with their youngest charges in their arms were running in after the waves and then running back with the waves after them and now and then a little sailingboat either departed with a gay and talkative cargo of passengers or returned with a very silent and particularly uncomfortablelooking one  ‘well i never’ exclaimed mrs tuggs as she and mr joseph tuggs and miss charlotta tuggs and mr cymon tuggs with their eight feet in a corresponding number of yellow shoes seated themselves on four rushbottomed chairs which being placed in a soft part of the sand forthwith sunk down some two feet and a half—‘well i never’  mr cymon by an exertion of great personal strength uprooted the chairs and removed them further back  ‘why i’m blessed if there ain’t some ladies agoing in’ exclaimed mr joseph tuggs with intense astonishment  ‘lor pa’ exclaimed miss charlotta  ‘there is my dear’ said mr joseph tuggs  and sure enough four young ladies each furnished with a towel tripped up the steps of a bathingmachine  in went the horse floundering about in the water round turned the machine down sat the driver and presently out burst the young ladies aforesaid with four distinct splashes  ‘well that’s sing’ler too’ ejaculated mr joseph tuggs after an awkward pause  mr cymon coughed slightly  ‘why here’s some gentlemen agoing in on this side’ exclaimed mrs tuggs in a tone of horror  three machines—three horses—three flounderings—three turnings round—three splashes—three gentlemen disporting themselves in the water like so many dolphins  ‘well that’s sing’ler’ said mr joseph tuggs again  miss charlotta coughed this time and another pause ensued  it was agreeably broken  ‘how d’ye do dear  we have been looking for you all the morning’ said a voice to miss charlotta tuggs  mrs captain waters was the owner of it  ‘how d’ye do’ said captain walter waters all suavity and a most cordial interchange of greetings ensued  ‘belinda my love’ said captain walter waters applying his glass to his eye and looking in the direction of the sea  ‘yes my dear’ replied mrs captain waters  ‘there’s harry thompson’  ‘where’ said belinda applying her glass to her eye  ‘bathing’  ‘lor so it is  he don’t see us does he’  ‘no i don’t think he does’ replied the captain  ‘bless my soul how very singular’  ‘what’ inquired belinda  ‘there’s mary golding too’  ‘lor—where’  up went the glass again  ‘there’ said the captain pointing to one of the young ladies before noticed who in her bathing costume looked as if she was enveloped in a patent mackintosh of scanty dimensions  ‘so it is i declare’ exclaimed mrs captain waters  ‘how very curious we should see them both’  ‘very’ said the captain with perfect coolness  ‘it’s the reg’lar thing here you see’ whispered mr cymon tuggs to his father  ‘i see it is’ whispered mr joseph tuggs in reply  ‘queer though—ain’t it’  mr cymon tuggs nodded assent  ‘what do you think of doing with yourself this morning’ inquired the captain  ‘shall we lunch at pegwell’  ‘i should like that very much indeed’ interposed mrs tuggs  she had never heard of pegwell but the word ‘lunch’ had reached her ears and it sounded very agreeably  ‘how shall we go’ inquired the captain ‘it’s too warm to walk’  ‘a shay’ suggested mr joseph tuggs  ‘chaise’ whispered mr cymon  ‘i should think one would be enough’ said mr joseph tuggs aloud quite unconscious of the meaning of the correction  ‘however two shays if you like’  ‘i should like a donkey so much’ said belinda  ‘oh so should i’ echoed charlotta tuggs  ‘well we can have a fly’ suggested the captain ‘and you can have a couple of donkeys’  a fresh difficulty arose  mrs captain waters declared it would be decidedly improper for two ladies to ride alone  the remedy was obvious perhaps young mr tuggs would be gallant enough to accompany them  mr cymon tuggs blushed smiled looked vacant and faintly protested that he was no horseman  the objection was at once overruled  a fly was speedily found and three donkeys—which the proprietor declared on his solemn asseveration to be ‘three parts blood and the other corn’—were engaged in the service  ‘kim up’ shouted one of the two boys who followed behind to propel the donkeys when belinda waters and charlotta tuggs had been hoisted and pushed and pulled into their respective saddles  ‘hi—hi—hi’ groaned the other boy behind mr cymon tuggs  away went the donkey with the stirrups jingling against the heels of cymon’s boots and cymon’s boots nearly scraping the ground  ‘way—way  wo—o—o—’ cried mr cymon tuggs as well as he could in the midst of the jolting  ‘don’t make it gallop’ screamed mrs captain waters behind  ‘my donkey will go into the publichouse’ shrieked miss tuggs in the rear  ‘hi—hi—hi’ groaned both the boys together and on went the donkeys as if nothing would ever stop them  everything has an end however even the galloping of donkeys will cease in time  the animal which mr cymon tuggs bestrode feeling sundry uncomfortable tugs at the bit the intent of which he could by no means divine abruptly sidled against a brick wall and expressed his uneasiness by grinding mr cymon tuggs’s leg on the rough surface  mrs captain waters’s donkey apparently under the influence of some playfulness of spirit rushed suddenly head first into a hedge and declined to come out again and the quadruped on which miss tuggs was mounted expressed his delight at this humorous proceeding by firmly planting his forefeet against the ground and kicking up his hindlegs in a very agile but somewhat alarming manner  this abrupt termination to the rapidity of the ride naturally occasioned some confusion  both the ladies indulged in vehement screaming for several minutes and mr cymon tuggs besides sustaining intense bodily pain had the additional mental anguish of witnessing their distressing situation without having the power to rescue them by reason of his leg being firmly screwed in between the animal and the wall  the efforts of the boys however assisted by the ingenious expedient of twisting the tail of the most rebellious donkey restored order in a much shorter time than could have reasonably been expected and the little party jogged slowly on together  ‘now let ’em walk’ said mr cymon tuggs  ‘it’s cruel to overdrive ’em’  ‘werry well sir’ replied the boy with a grin at his companion as if he understood mr cymon to mean that the cruelty applied less to the animals than to their riders  ‘what a lovely day dear’ said charlotta  ‘charming enchanting dear’ responded mrs captain waters  ‘what a beautiful prospect mr tuggs’  cymon looked full in belinda’s face as he responded—‘beautiful indeed’ the lady cast down her eyes and suffered the animal she was riding to fall a little back  cymon tuggs instinctively did the same  there was a brief silence broken only by a sigh from mr cymon tuggs  ‘mr cymon’ said the lady suddenly in a low tone ‘mr cymon—i am another’s’  mr cymon expressed his perfect concurrence in a statement which it was impossible to controvert  ‘if i had not been—’ resumed belinda and there she stopped  ‘what—what’ said mr cymon earnestly  ‘do not torture me  what would you say’  ‘if i had not been’—continued mrs captain waters—‘if in earlier life it had been my fate to have known and been beloved by a noble youth—a kindred soul—a congenial spirit—one capable of feeling and appreciating the sentiments which—’  ‘heavens what do i hear’ exclaimed mr cymon tuggs  ‘is it possible can i believe my—come up’  this last unsentimental parenthesis was addressed to the donkey who with his head between his forelegs appeared to be examining the state of his shoes with great anxiety  ‘hi—hi—hi’ said the boys behind  ‘come up’ expostulated cymon tuggs again  ‘hi—hi—hi’ repeated the boys  and whether it was that the animal felt indignant at the tone of mr tuggs’s command or felt alarmed by the noise of the deputy proprietor’s boots running behind him or whether he burned with a noble emulation to outstrip the other donkeys certain it is that he no sooner heard the second series of ‘hi—hi’s’ than he started away with a celerity of pace which jerked mr cymon’s hat off instantaneously and carried him to the pegwell bay hotel in no time where he deposited his rider without giving him the trouble of dismounting by sagaciously pitching him over his head into the very doorway of the tavern  great was the confusion of mr cymon tuggs when he was put right end uppermost by two waiters considerable was the alarm of mrs tuggs in behalf of her son agonizing were the apprehensions of mrs captain waters on his account  it was speedily discovered however that he had not sustained much more injury than the donkey—he was grazed and the animal was grazing—and then it was a delightful party to be sure  mr and mrs tuggs and the captain had ordered lunch in the little garden behind—small saucers of large shrimps dabs of butter crusty loaves and bottled ale  the sky was without a cloud there were flowerpots and turf before them the sea from the foot of the cliff stretching away as far as the eye could discern anything at all vessels in the distance with sails as white and as small as nicelygotup cambric handkerchiefs  the shrimps were delightful the ale better and the captain even more pleasant than either  mrs captain waters was in such spirits after lunch—chasing first the captain across the turf and among the flowerpots and then mr cymon tuggs and then miss tuggs and laughing too quite boisterously  but as the captain said it didn’t matter who knew what they were there  for all the people of the house knew they might be common people  to which mr joseph tuggs responded ‘to be sure’  and then they went down the steep wooden steps a little further on which led to the bottom of the cliff and looked at the crabs and the seaweed and the eels till it was more than fully time to go back to ramsgate again  finally mr cymon tuggs ascended the steps last and mrs captain waters last but one and mr cymon tuggs discovered that the foot and ankle of mrs captain waters were even more unexceptionable than he had at first supposed  taking a donkey towards his ordinary place of residence is a very different thing and a feat much more easily to be accomplished than taking him from it  it requires a great deal of foresight and presence of mind in the one case to anticipate the numerous flights of his discursive imagination whereas in the other all you have to do is to hold on and place a blind confidence in the animal  mr cymon tuggs adopted the latter expedient on his return and his nerves were so little discomposed by the journey that he distinctly understood they were all to meet again at the library in the evening  the library was crowded  there were the same ladies and the same gentlemen who had been on the sands in the morning and on the pier the day before  there were young ladies in marooncoloured gowns and black velvet bracelets dispensing fancy articles in the shop and presiding over games of chance in the concertroom  there were marriageable daughters and marriagemaking mammas gaming and promenading and turning over music and flirting  there were some male beaux doing the sentimental in whispers and others doing the ferocious in moustache there were mrs tuggs in amber miss tuggs in skyblue mrs captain waters in pink  there was captain waters in a braided surtout there was mr cymon tuggs in pumps and a gilt waistcoat there was mr joseph tuggs in a blue coat and a shirtfrill  ‘numbers three eight and eleven’ cried one of the young ladies in the marooncoloured gowns  ‘numbers three eight and eleven’ echoed another young lady in the same uniform  ‘number three’s gone’ said the first young lady  ‘numbers eight and eleven’  ‘numbers eight and eleven’ echoed the second young lady  ‘number eight’s gone mary ann’ said the first young lady  ‘number eleven’ screamed the second  ‘the numbers are all taken now ladies if you please’ said the first the representatives of numbers three eight and eleven and the rest of the numbers crowded round the table  ‘will you throw ma’am’ said the presiding goddess handing the dicebox to the eldest daughter of a stout lady with four girls  there was a profound silence among the lookerson  ‘throw jane my dear’ said the stout lady  an interesting display of bashfulness—a little blushing in a cambric handkerchief—a whispering to a younger sister  ‘amelia my dear throw for your sister’ said the stout lady and then she turned to a walking advertisement of rowlands’ macassar oil who stood next her and said ‘jane is so very modest and retiring but i can’t be angry with her for it  an artless and unsophisticated girl is so truly amiable that i often wish amelia was more like her sister’  the gentleman with the whiskers whispered his admiring approval  ‘now my dear’ said the stout lady  miss amelia threw—eight for her sister ten for herself  ‘nice figure amelia’ whispered the stout lady to a thin youth beside her  ‘beautiful’  ‘and such a spirit  i am like you in that respect  i can not help admiring that life and vivacity  ah a sigh i wish i could make poor jane a little more like my dear amelia’  the young gentleman cordially acquiesced in the sentiment both he and the individual first addressed were perfectly contented  ‘who’s this’ inquired mr cymon tuggs of mrs captain waters as a short female in a blue velvet hat and feathers was led into the orchestra by a fat man in black tights and cloudy berlins  ‘mrs tippin of the london theatres’ replied belinda referring to the programme of the concert  the talented tippin having condescendingly acknowledged the clapping of hands and shouts of ‘bravo’ which greeted her appearance proceeded to sing the popular cavatina of ‘bid me discourse’ accompanied on the piano by mr tippin after which mr tippin sang a comic song accompanied on the piano by mrs tippin the applause consequent upon which was only to be exceeded by the enthusiastic approbation bestowed upon an air with variations on the guitar by miss tippin accompanied on the chin by master tippin  thus passed the evening thus passed the days and evenings of the tuggses and the waterses for six weeks  sands in the morning—donkeys at noon—pier in the afternoon—library at night—and the same people everywhere  on that very night six weeks the moon was shining brightly over the calm sea which dashed against the feet of the tall gaunt cliffs with just enough noise to lull the old fish to sleep without disturbing the young ones when two figures were discernible—or would have been if anybody had looked for them—seated on one of the wooden benches which are stationed near the verge of the western cliff  the moon had climbed higher into the heavens by two hours’ journeying since those figures first sat down—and yet they had moved not  the crowd of loungers had thinned and dispersed the noise of itinerant musicians had died away light after light had appeared in the windows of the different houses in the distance blockademan after blockademan had passed the spot wending his way towards his solitary post and yet those figures had remained stationary  some portions of the two forms were in deep shadow but the light of the moon fell strongly on a pucecoloured boot and a glazed stock  mr cymon tuggs and mrs captain waters were seated on that bench  they spoke not but were silently gazing on the sea  ‘walter will return tomorrow’ said mrs captain waters mournfully breaking silence  mr cymon tuggs sighed like a gust of wind through a forest of gooseberry bushes as he replied ‘alas he will’  ‘oh cymon’ resumed belinda ‘the chaste delight the calm happiness of this one week of platonic love is too much for me’  cymon was about to suggest that it was too little for him but he stopped himself and murmured unintelligibly  ‘and to think that even this gleam of happiness innocent as it is’ exclaimed belinda ‘is now to be lost for ever’  ‘oh do not say for ever belinda’ exclaimed the excitable cymon as two stronglydefined tears chased each other down his pale face—it was so long that there was plenty of room for a chase  ‘do not say for ever’  ‘i must’ replied belinda  ‘why’ urged cymon ‘oh why  such platonic acquaintance as ours is so harmless that even your husband can never object to it’  ‘my husband’ exclaimed belinda  ‘you little know him  jealous and revengeful ferocious in his revenge—a maniac in his jealousy  would you be assassinated before my eyes’  mr cymon tuggs in a voice broken by emotion expressed his disinclination to undergo the process of assassination before the eyes of anybody  ‘then leave me’ said mrs captain waters  ‘leave me this night for ever  it is late let us return’  mr cymon tuggs sadly offered the lady his arm and escorted her to her lodgings  he paused at the door—he felt a platonic pressure of his hand ‘good night’ he said hesitating  ‘good night’ sobbed the lady  mr cymon tuggs paused again  ‘won’t you walk in sir’ said the servant  mr tuggs hesitated  oh that hesitation  he did walk in  ‘good night’ said mr cymon tuggs again when he reached the drawingroom  ‘good night’ replied belinda ‘and if at any period of my life i—hush’  the lady paused and stared with a steady gaze of horror on the ashy countenance of mr cymon tuggs  there was a double knock at the streetdoor  ‘it is my husband’ said belinda as the captain’s voice was heard below  ‘and my family’ added cymon tuggs as the voices of his relatives floated up the staircase  ‘the curtain  the curtain’ gasped mrs captain waters pointing to the window before which some chintz hangings were closely drawn  ‘but i have done nothing wrong’ said the hesitating cymon  ‘the curtain’ reiterated the frantic lady ‘you will be murdered’  this last appeal to his feelings was irresistible  the dismayed cymon concealed himself behind the curtain with pantomimic suddenness  enter the captain joseph tuggs mrs tuggs and charlotta  ‘my dear’ said the captain ‘lieutenant slaughter’  two ironshod boots and one gruff voice were heard by mr cymon to advance and acknowledge the honour of the introduction  the sabre of the lieutenant rattled heavily upon the floor as he seated himself at the table  mr cymon’s fears almost overcame his reason  ‘the brandy my dear’ said the captain  here was a situation  they were going to make a night of it  and mr cymon tuggs was pent up behind the curtain and afraid to breathe  ‘slaughter’ said the captain ‘a cigar’  now mr cymon tuggs never could smoke without feeling it indispensably necessary to retire immediately and never could smell smoke without a strong disposition to cough  the cigars were introduced the captain was a professed smoker so was the lieutenant so was joseph tuggs  the apartment was small the door was closed the smoke powerful it hung in heavy wreaths over the room and at length found its way behind the curtain  cymon tuggs held his nose his mouth his breath  it was all of no use—out came the cough  ‘bless my soul’ said the captain ‘i beg your pardon miss tuggs  you dislike smoking’  ‘oh no i don’t indeed’ said charlotta  ‘it makes you cough’  ‘oh dear no’  ‘you coughed just now’  ‘me captain waters  lor how can you say so’  ‘somebody coughed’ said the captain  ‘i certainly thought so’ said slaughter  no everybody denied it  ‘fancy’ said the captain  ‘must be’ echoed slaughter  cigars resumed—more smoke—another cough—smothered but violent  ‘damned odd’ said the captain staring about him  ‘sing’ler’ ejaculated the unconscious mr joseph tuggs  lieutenant slaughter looked first at one person mysteriously then at another then laid down his cigar then approached the window on tiptoe and pointed with his right thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the curtain  ‘slaughter’ ejaculated the captain rising from table ‘what do you mean’  the lieutenant in reply drew back the curtain and discovered mr cymon tuggs behind it pallid with apprehension and blue with wanting to cough  ‘aha’ exclaimed the captain furiously  ‘what do i see  slaughter your sabre’  ‘cymon’ screamed the tuggses  ‘mercy’ said belinda  ‘platonic’ gasped cymon  ‘your sabre’ roared the captain ‘slaughter—unhand me—the villain’s life’  ‘murder’ screamed the tuggses  ‘hold him fast sir’ faintly articulated cymon  ‘water’ exclaimed joseph tuggs—and mr cymon tuggs and all the ladies forthwith fainted away and formed a tableau  most willingly would we conceal the disastrous termination of the six weeks’ acquaintance  a troublesome form and an arbitrary custom however prescribe that a story should have a conclusion in addition to a commencement we have therefore no alternative  lieutenant slaughter brought a message—the captain brought an action  mr joseph tuggs interposed—the lieutenant negotiated  when mr cymon tuggs recovered from the nervous disorder into which misplaced affection and exciting circumstances had plunged him he found that his family had lost their pleasant acquaintance that his father was minus fifteen hundred pounds and the captain plus the precise sum  the money was paid to hush the matter up but it got abroad notwithstanding and there are not wanting some who affirm that three designing impostors never found more easy dupes than did captain waters mrs waters and lieutenant slaughter in the tuggses at ramsgate    chapter v—horatio sparkins   ‘indeed my love he paid teresa very great attention on the last assembly night’ said mrs malderton addressing her spouse who after the fatigues of the day in the city was sitting with a silk handkerchief over his head and his feet on the fender drinking his port—‘very great attention and i say again every possible encouragement ought to be given him  he positively must be asked down here to dine’  ‘who must’ inquired mr malderton  ‘why you know whom i mean my dear—the young man with the black whiskers and the white cravat who has just come out at our assembly and whom all the girls are talking about  young—dear me what’s his name—marianne what is his name’ continued mrs malderton addressing her youngest daughter who was engaged in netting a purse and looking sentimental  ‘mr horatio sparkins ma’ replied miss marianne with a sigh  ‘oh yes to be sure—horatio sparkins’ said mrs malderton  ‘decidedly the most gentlemanlike young man i ever saw  i am sure in the beautifullymade coat he wore the other night he looked like—like—’  ‘like prince leopold ma—so noble so full of sentiment’ suggested marianne in a tone of enthusiastic admiration  ‘you should recollect my dear’ resumed mrs malderton ‘that teresa is now eightandtwenty and that it really is very important that something should be done’  miss teresa malderton was a very little girl rather fat with vermilion cheeks but goodhumoured and still disengaged although to do her justice the misfortune arose from no lack of perseverance on her part in vain had she flirted for ten years in vain had mr and mrs malderton assiduously kept up an extensive acquaintance among the young eligible bachelors of camberwell and even of wandsworth and brixton to say nothing of those who ‘dropped in’ from town  miss malderton was as well known as the lion on the top of northumberland house and had an equal chance of ‘going off’  ‘i am quite sure you’d like him’ continued mrs malderton ‘he is so gentlemanly’  ‘so clever’ said miss marianne  ‘and has such a flow of language’ added miss teresa  ‘he has a great respect for you my dear’ said mrs malderton to her husband  mr malderton coughed and looked at the fire  ‘yes i’m sure he’s very much attached to pa’s society’ said miss marianne  ‘no doubt of it’ echoed miss teresa  ‘indeed he said as much to me in confidence’ observed mrs malderton  ‘well well’ returned mr malderton somewhat flattered ‘if i see him at the assembly tomorrow perhaps i’ll ask him down  i hope he knows we live at oak lodge camberwell my dear’  ‘of course—and that you keep a onehorse carriage’  ‘i’ll see about it’ said mr malderton composing himself for a nap ‘i’ll see about it’  mr malderton was a man whose whole scope of ideas was limited to lloyd’s the exchange the india house and the bank  a few successful speculations had raised him from a situation of obscurity and comparative poverty to a state of affluence  as frequently happens in such cases the ideas of himself and his family became elevated to an extraordinary pitch as their means increased they affected fashion taste and many other fooleries in imitation of their betters and had a very decided and becoming horror of anything which could by possibility be considered low  he was hospitable from ostentation illiberal from ignorance and prejudiced from conceit  egotism and the love of display induced him to keep an excellent table convenience and a love of good things of this life ensured him plenty of guests  he liked to have clever men or what he considered such at his table because it was a great thing to talk about but he never could endure what he called ‘sharp fellows’  probably he cherished this feeling out of compliment to his two sons who gave their respected parent no uneasiness in that particular  the family were ambitious of forming acquaintances and connexions in some sphere of society superior to that in which they themselves moved and one of the necessary consequences of this desire added to their utter ignorance of the world beyond their own small circle was that any one who could lay claim to an acquaintance with people of rank and title had a sure passport to the table at oak lodge camberwell  the appearance of mr horatio sparkins at the assembly had excited no small degree of surprise and curiosity among its regular frequenters who could he be  he was evidently reserved and apparently melancholy was he a clergyman—he danced too well  a barrister—he said he was not called  he used very fine words and talked a great deal  could he be a distinguished foreigner come to england for the purpose of describing the country its manners and customs and frequenting public balls and public dinners with the view of becoming acquainted with high life polished etiquette and english refinement—no he had not a foreign accent  was he a surgeon a contributor to the magazines a writer of fashionable novels or an artist—no to each and all of these surmises there existed some valid objection—‘then’ said everybody ‘he must be somebody’—‘i should think he must be’ reasoned mr malderton within himself ‘because he perceives our superiority and pays us so much attention’  the night succeeding the conversation we have just recorded was ‘assembly night’  the doublefly was ordered to be at the door of oak lodge at nine o’clock precisely  the miss maldertons were dressed in skyblue satin trimmed with artificial flowers and mrs m who was a little fat woman in ditto ditto looked like her eldest daughter multiplied by two  mr frederick malderton the eldest son in fulldress costume was the very beau idéal of a smart waiter and mr thomas malderton the youngest with his white dressstock blue coat bright buttons and red watchribbon strongly resembled the portrait of that interesting but rash young gentleman george barnwell  every member of the party had made up his or her mind to cultivate the acquaintance of mr horatio sparkins  miss teresa of course was to be as amiable and interesting as ladies of eightandtwenty on the lookout for a husband usually are  mrs malderton would be all smiles and graces  miss marianne would request the favour of some verses for her album  mr malderton would patronise the great unknown by asking him to dinner  tom intended to ascertain the extent of his information on the interesting topics of snuff and cigars  even mr frederick malderton himself the family authority on all points of taste dress and fashionable arrangement who had lodgings of his own in town who had a free admission to coventgarden theatre who always dressed according to the fashions of the months who went up the water twice aweek in the season and who actually had an intimate friend who once knew a gentleman who formerly lived in the albany—even he had determined that mr horatio sparkins must be a devilish good fellow and that he would do him the honour of challenging him to a game at billiards  the first object that met the anxious eyes of the expectant family on their entrance into the ballroom was the interesting horatio with his hair brushed off his forehead and his eyes fixed on the ceiling reclining in a contemplative attitude on one of the seats  ‘there he is my dear’ whispered mrs malderton to mr malderton  ‘how like lord byron’ murmured miss teresa  ‘or montgomery’ whispered miss marianne  ‘or the portraits of captain cook’ suggested tom  ‘tom—don’t be an ass’ said his father who checked him on all occasions probably with a view to prevent his becoming ‘sharp’—which was very unnecessary  the elegant sparkins attitudinised with admirable effect until the family had crossed the room  he then started up with the most natural appearance of surprise and delight accosted mrs malderton with the utmost cordiality saluted the young ladies in the most enchanting manner bowed to and shook hands with mr malderton with a degree of respect amounting almost to veneration and returned the greetings of the two young men in a halfgratified halfpatronising manner which fully convinced them that he must be an important and at the same time condescending personage  ‘miss malderton’ said horatio after the ordinary salutations and bowing very low ‘may i be permitted to presume to hope that you will allow me to have the pleasure—’  ‘i don’t think i am engaged’ said miss teresa with a dreadful affectation of indifference—‘but really—so many—’  horatio looked handsomely miserable  ‘i shall be most happy’ simpered the interesting teresa at last horatio’s countenance brightened up like an old hat in a shower of rain  ‘a very genteel young man certainly’ said the gratified mr malderton as the obsequious sparkins and his partner joined the quadrille which was just forming  ‘he has a remarkably good address’ said mr frederick  ‘yes he is a prime fellow’ interposed tom who always managed to put his foot in it—‘he talks just like an auctioneer’  ‘tom’ said his father solemnly ‘i think i desired you before not to be a fool’  tom looked as happy as a cock on a drizzly morning  ‘how delightful’ said the interesting horatio to his partner as they promenaded the room at the conclusion of the set—‘how delightful how refreshing it is to retire from the cloudy storms the vicissitudes and the troubles of life even if it be but for a few short fleeting moments and to spend those moments fading and evanescent though they be in the delightful the blessed society of one individual—whose frowns would be death whose coldness would be madness whose falsehood would be ruin whose constancy would be bliss the possession of whose affection would be the brightest and best reward that heaven could bestow on man’  ‘what feeling what sentiment’ thought miss teresa as she leaned more heavily on her companion’s arm  ‘but enough—enough’ resumed the elegant sparkins with a theatrical air ‘what have i said what have i—i—to do with sentiments like these  miss malderton’—here he stopped short—‘may i hope to be permitted to offer the humble tribute of—’  ‘really mr sparkins’ returned the enraptured teresa blushing in the sweetest confusion ‘i must refer you to papa  i never can without his consent venture to—’  ‘surely he cannot object—’  ‘oh yes  indeed indeed you know him not’ interrupted miss teresa well knowing there was nothing to fear but wishing to make the interview resemble a scene in some romantic novel  ‘he cannot object to my offering you a glass of negus’ returned the adorable sparkins with some surprise  ‘is that all’ thought the disappointed teresa  ‘what a fuss about nothing’  ‘it will give me the greatest pleasure sir to see you to dinner at oak lodge camberwell on sunday next at five o’clock if you have no better engagement’ said mr malderton at the conclusion of the evening as he and his sons were standing in conversation with mr horatio sparkins  horatio bowed his acknowledgments and accepted the flattering invitation  ‘i must confess’ continued the father offering his snuffbox to his new acquaintance ‘that i don’t enjoy these assemblies half so much as the comfort—i had almost said the luxury—of oak lodge  they have no great charms for an elderly man’  ‘and after all sir what is man’ said the metaphysical sparkins  ‘i say what is man’  ‘ah very true’ said mr malderton ‘very true’  ‘we know that we live and breathe’ continued horatio ‘that we have wants and wishes desires and appetites—’  ‘certainly’ said mr frederick malderton looking profound  ‘i say we know that we exist’ repeated horatio raising his voice ‘but there we stop there is an end to our knowledge there is the summit of our attainments there is the termination of our ends  what more do we know’  ‘nothing’ replied mr frederick—than whom no one was more capable of answering for himself in that particular  tom was about to hazard something but fortunately for his reputation he caught his father’s angry eye and slunk off like a puppy convicted of petty larceny  ‘upon my word’ said mr malderton the elder as they were returning home in the fly ‘that mr sparkins is a wonderful young man  such surprising knowledge such extraordinary information and such a splendid mode of expressing himself’  ‘i think he must be somebody in disguise’ said miss marianne  ‘how charmingly romantic’  ‘he talks very loud and nicely’ timidly observed tom ‘but i don’t exactly understand what he means’  ‘i almost begin to despair of your understanding anything tom’ said his father who of course had been much enlightened by mr horatio sparkins’s conversation  ‘it strikes me tom’ said miss teresa ‘that you have made yourself very ridiculous this evening’  ‘no doubt of it’ cried everybody—and the unfortunate tom reduced himself into the least possible space  that night mr and mrs malderton had a long conversation respecting their daughter’s prospects and future arrangements  miss teresa went to bed considering whether in the event of her marrying a title she could conscientiously encourage the visits of her present associates and dreamed all night of disguised noblemen large routs ostrich plumes bridal favours and horatio sparkins  various surmises were hazarded on the sunday morning as to the mode of conveyance which the anxiouslyexpected horatio would adopt  did he keep a gig—was it possible he could come on horseback—or would he patronize the stage  these and other various conjectures of equal importance engrossed the attention of mrs malderton and her daughters during the whole morning after church  ‘upon my word my dear it’s a most annoying thing that that vulgar brother of yours should have invited himself to dine here today’ said mr malderton to his wife  ‘on account of mr sparkins’s coming down i purposely abstained from asking any one but flamwell  and then to think of your brother—a tradesman—it’s insufferable  i declare i wouldn’t have him mention his shop before our new guest—no not for a thousand pounds i wouldn’t care if he had the good sense to conceal the disgrace he is to the family but he’s so fond of his horrible business that he will let people know what he is’  mr jacob barton the individual alluded to was a large grocer so vulgar and so lost to all sense of feeling that he actually never scrupled to avow that he wasn’t above his business ‘he’d made his money by it and he didn’t care who know’d it’  ‘ah flamwell my dear fellow how d’ye do’ said mr malderton as a little spoffish man with green spectacles entered the room  ‘you got my note’  ‘yes i did and here i am in consequence’  ‘you don’t happen to know this mr sparkins by name  you know everybody’  mr flamwell was one of those gentlemen of remarkably extensive information whom one occasionally meets in society who pretend to know everybody but in reality know nobody  at malderton’s where any stories about great people were received with a greedy ear he was an especial favourite and knowing the kind of people he had to deal with he carried his passion of claiming acquaintance with everybody to the most immoderate length  he had rather a singular way of telling his greatest lies in a parenthesis and with an air of selfdenial as if he feared being thought egotistical  ‘why no i don’t know him by that name’ returned flamwell in a low tone and with an air of immense importance  ‘i have no doubt i know him though  is he tall’  ‘middlesized’ said miss teresa  ‘with black hair’ inquired flamwell hazarding a bold guess  ‘yes’ returned miss teresa eagerly  ‘rather a snub nose’  ‘no’ said the disappointed teresa ‘he has a roman nose’  ‘i said a roman nose didn’t i’ inquired flamwell  ‘he’s an elegant young man’  ‘oh certainly’  ‘with remarkably prepossessing manners’  ‘oh yes’ said all the family together  ‘you must know him’  ‘yes i thought you knew him if he was anybody’ triumphantly exclaimed mr malderton  ‘who d’ye think he is’  ‘why from your description’ said flamwell ruminating and sinking his voice almost to a whisper ‘he bears a strong resemblance to the honourable augustus fitzedward fitzjohn fitzosborne  he’s a very talented young man and rather eccentric  it’s extremely probable he may have changed his name for some temporary purpose’  teresa’s heart beat high  could he be the honourable augustus fitzedward fitzjohn fitzosborne  what a name to be elegantly engraved upon two glazed cards tied together with a piece of white satin ribbon ‘the honourable mrs augustus fitzedward fitzjohn fitzosborne’  the thought was transport  ‘it’s five minutes to five’ said mr malderton looking at his watch ‘i hope he’s not going to disappoint us’  ‘there he is’ exclaimed miss teresa as a loud doubleknock was heard at the door  everybody endeavoured to look—as people when they particularly expect a visitor always do—as if they were perfectly unsuspicious of the approach of anybody  the roomdoor opened—‘mr barton’ said the servant  ‘confound the man’ murmured malderton  ‘ah my dear sir how d’ye do any news’  ‘why no’ returned the grocer in his usual bluff manner  ‘no none partickler  none that i am much aware of  how d’ye do gals and boys mr flamwell sir—glad to see you’  ‘here’s mr sparkins’ said tom who had been looking out at the window ‘on such a black horse’  there was horatio sure enough on a large black horse curvetting and prancing along like an astley’s supernumerary  after a great deal of reining in and pulling up with the accompaniments of snorting rearing and kicking the animal consented to stop at about a hundred yards from the gate where mr sparkins dismounted and confided him to the care of mr malderton’s groom  the ceremony of introduction was gone through in all due form mr flamwell looked from behind his green spectacles at horatio with an air of mysterious importance and the gallant horatio looked unutterable things at teresa  ‘is he the honourable mr augustus what’shisname’ whispered mrs malderton to flamwell as he was escorting her to the diningroom  ‘why no—at least not exactly’ returned that great authority—‘not exactly’  ‘who is he then’  ‘hush’ said flamwell nodding his head with a grave air importing that he knew very well but was prevented by some grave reasons of state from disclosing the important secret  it might be one of the ministers making himself acquainted with the views of the people  ‘mr sparkins’ said the delighted mrs malderton ‘pray divide the ladies  john put a chair for the gentleman between miss teresa and miss marianne’  this was addressed to a man who on ordinary occasions acted as halfgroom halfgardener but who as it was important to make an impression on mr sparkins had been forced into a white neckerchief and shoes and touched up and brushed to look like a second footman  the dinner was excellent horatio was most attentive to miss teresa and every one felt in high spirits except mr malderton who knowing the propensity of his brotherinlaw mr barton endured that sort of agony which the newspapers inform us is experienced by the surrounding neighbourhood when a potboy hangs himself in a hayloft and which is ‘much easier to be imagined than described’  ‘have you seen your friend sir thomas noland lately flamwell’ inquired mr malderton casting a sidelong look at horatio to see what effect the mention of so great a man had upon him  ‘why no—not very lately  i saw lord gubbleton the day before yesterday’  ‘all  i hope his lordship is very well’ said malderton in a tone of the greatest interest  it is scarcely necessary to say that until that moment he had been quite innocent of the existence of such a person  ‘why yes he was very well—very well indeed  he’s a devilish good fellow  i met him in the city and had a long chat with him  indeed i’m rather intimate with him  i couldn’t stop to talk to him as long as i could wish though because i was on my way to a banker’s a very rich man and a member of parliament with whom i am also rather indeed i may say very intimate’  ‘i know whom you mean’ returned the host consequentially—in reality knowing as much about the matter as flamwell himself—‘he has a capital business’  this was touching on a dangerous topic  ‘talking of business’ interposed mr barton from the centre of the table  ‘a gentleman whom you knew very well malderton before you made that first lucky spec of yours called at our shop the other day and—’  ‘barton may i trouble you for a potato’ interrupted the wretched master of the house hoping to nip the story in the bud  ‘certainly’ returned the grocer quite insensible of his brotherinlaw’s object—‘and he said in a very plain manner—’  ‘floury if you please’ interrupted malderton again dreading the termination of the anecdote and fearing a repetition of the word ‘shop’  ‘he said says he’ continued the culprit after despatching the potato ‘says he how goes on your business  so i said jokingly—you know my way—says i i’m never above my business and i hope my business will never be above me  ha ha’  ‘mr sparkins’ said the host vainly endeavouring to conceal his dismay ‘a glass of wine’  ‘with the utmost pleasure sir’  ‘happy to see you’  ‘thank you’  ‘we were talking the other evening’ resumed the host addressing horatio partly with the view of displaying the conversational powers of his new acquaintance and partly in the hope of drowning the grocer’s stories—‘we were talking the other night about the nature of man  your argument struck me very forcibly’  ‘and me’ said mr frederick  horatio made a graceful inclination of the head  ‘pray what is your opinion of woman mr sparkins’ inquired mrs malderton  the young ladies simpered  ‘man’ replied horatio ‘man whether he ranged the bright gay flowery plains of a second eden or the more sterile barren and i may say commonplace regions to which we are compelled to accustom ourselves in times such as these man under any circumstances or in any place—whether he were bending beneath the withering blasts of the frigid zone or scorching under the rays of a vertical sun—man without woman would be—alone’  ‘i am very happy to find you entertain such honourable opinions mr sparkins’ said mrs malderton  ‘and i’ added miss teresa  horatio looked his delight and the young lady blushed  ‘now it’s my opinion—’ said mr barton  ‘i know what you’re going to say’ interposed malderton determined not to give his relation another opportunity ‘and i don’t agree with you’  ‘what’ inquired the astonished grocer  ‘i am sorry to differ from you barton’ said the host in as positive a manner as if he really were contradicting a position which the other had laid down ‘but i cannot give my assent to what i consider a very monstrous proposition’  ‘but i meant to say—’  ‘you never can convince me’ said malderton with an air of obstinate determination  ‘never’  ‘and i’ said mr frederick following up his father’s attack ‘cannot entirely agree in mr sparkins’s argument’  ‘what’ said horatio who became more metaphysical and more argumentative as he saw the female part of the family listening in wondering delight—‘what  is effect the consequence of cause  is cause the precursor of effect’  ‘that’s the point’ said flamwell  ‘to be sure’ said mr malderton  ‘because if effect is the consequence of cause and if cause does precede effect i apprehend you are wrong’ added horatio  ‘decidedly’ said the toadeating flamwell  ‘at least i apprehend that to be the just and logical deduction’ said sparkins in a tone of interrogation  ‘no doubt of it’ chimed in flamwell again  ‘it settles the point’  ‘well perhaps it does’ said mr frederick ‘i didn’t see it before’  ‘i don’t exactly see it now’ thought the grocer ‘but i suppose it’s all right’  ‘how wonderfully clever he is’ whispered mrs malderton to her daughters as they retired to the drawingroom  ‘oh he’s quite a love’ said both the young ladies together ‘he talks like an oracle  he must have seen a great deal of life’  the gentlemen being left to themselves a pause ensued during which everybody looked very grave as if they were quite overcome by the profound nature of the previous discussion  flamwell who had made up his mind to find out who and what mr horatio sparkins really was first broke silence  ‘excuse me sir’ said that distinguished personage ‘i presume you have studied for the bar  i thought of entering once myself—indeed i’m rather intimate with some of the highest ornaments of that distinguished profession’  ‘nno’ said horatio with a little hesitation ‘not exactly’  ‘but you have been much among the silk gowns or i mistake’ inquired flamwell deferentially  ‘nearly all my life’ returned sparkins  the question was thus pretty well settled in the mind of mr flamwell he was a young gentleman ‘about to be called’  ‘i shouldn’t like to be a barrister’ said tom speaking for the first time and looking round the table to find somebody who would notice the remark  no one made any reply  ‘i shouldn’t like to wear a wig’ said tom hazarding another observation  ‘tom i beg you will not make yourself ridiculous’ said his father ‘pray listen and improve yourself by the conversation you hear and don’t be constantly making these absurd remarks’  ‘very well father’ replied the unfortunate tom who had not spoken a word since he had asked for another slice of beef at a quarterpast five o’clock pm and it was then eight  ‘well tom’ observed his goodnatured uncle ‘never mind  i think with you  i shouldn’t like to wear a wig  i’d rather wear an apron’  mr malderton coughed violently  mr barton resumed—‘for if a man’s above his business—’  the cough returned with tenfold violence and did not cease until the unfortunate cause of it in his alarm had quite forgotten what he intended to say  ‘mr sparkins’ said flamwell returning to the charge ‘do you happen to know mr delafontaine of bedfordsquare’  ‘i have exchanged cards with him since which indeed i have had an opportunity of serving him considerably’ replied horatio slightly colouring no doubt at having been betrayed into making the acknowledgment  ‘you are very lucky if you have had an opportunity of obliging that great man’ observed flamwell with an air of profound respect  ‘i don’t know who he is’ he whispered to mr malderton confidentially as they followed horatio up to the drawingroom  ‘it’s quite clear however that he belongs to the law and that he is somebody of great importance and very highly connected’  ‘no doubt no doubt’ returned his companion  the remainder of the evening passed away most delightfully  mr malderton relieved from his apprehensions by the circumstance of mr barton’s falling into a profound sleep was as affable and gracious as possible  miss teresa played the ‘fall of paris’ as mr sparkins declared in a most masterly manner and both of them assisted by mr frederick tried over glees and trios without number they having made the pleasing discovery that their voices harmonised beautifully  to be sure they all sang the first part and horatio in addition to the slight drawback of having no ear was perfectly innocent of knowing a note of music still they passed the time very agreeably and it was past twelve o’clock before mr sparkins ordered the mourningcoachlooking steed to be brought out—an order which was only complied with on the distinct understanding that he was to repeat his visit on the following sunday  ‘but perhaps mr sparkins will form one of our party tomorrow evening’ suggested mrs m  ‘mr malderton intends taking the girls to see the pantomime’  mr sparkins bowed and promised to join the party in box 48 in the course of the evening  ‘we will not tax you for the morning’ said miss teresa bewitchingly ‘for ma is going to take us to all sorts of places shopping  i know that gentlemen have a great horror of that employment’  mr sparkins bowed again and declared that he should be delighted but business of importance occupied him in the morning  flamwell looked at malderton significantly—‘it’s term time’ he whispered  at twelve o’clock on the following morning the ‘fly’ was at the door of oak lodge to convey mrs malderton and her daughters on their expedition for the day  they were to dine and dress for the play at a friend’s house  first driving thither with their bandboxes they departed on their first errand to make some purchases at messrs jones spruggins and smith’s of tottenhamcourtroad after which they were to go to redmayne’s in bondstreet thence to innumerable places that no one ever heard of  the young ladies beguiled the tediousness of the ride by eulogising mr horatio sparkins scolding their mamma for taking them so far to save a shilling and wondering whether they should ever reach their destination  at length the vehicle stopped before a dirtylooking ticketed linendraper’s shop with goods of all kinds and labels of all sorts and sizes in the window  there were dropsical figures of seven with a little threefarthings in the corner ‘perfectly invisible to the naked eye’ three hundred and fifty thousand ladies’ boas from one shilling and a penny halfpenny real french kid shoes at two and ninepence per pair green parasols at an equally cheap rate and ‘every description of goods’ as the proprietors said—and they must know best—‘fifty per cent under cost price’  ‘lor ma what a place you have brought us to’ said miss teresa ‘what would mr sparkins say if he could see us’  ‘ah what indeed’ said miss marianne horrified at the idea  ‘pray be seated ladies  what is the first article’ inquired the obsequious master of the ceremonies of the establishment who in his large white neckcloth and formal tie looked like a bad ‘portrait of a gentleman’ in the somersethouse exhibition  ‘i want to see some silks’ answered mrs malderton  ‘directly ma’am—mr smith  where is mr smith’  ‘here sir’ cried a voice at the back of the shop  ‘pray make haste mr smith’ said the mc  ‘you never are to be found when you’re wanted sir’  mr smith thus enjoined to use all possible despatch leaped over the counter with great agility and placed himself before the newlyarrived customers  mrs malderton uttered a faint scream miss teresa who had been stooping down to talk to her sister raised her head and beheld—horatio sparkins  ‘we will draw a veil’ as novelwriters say over the scene that ensued the mysterious philosophical romantic metaphysical sparkins—he who to the interesting teresa seemed like the embodied idea of the young dukes and poetical exquisites in blue silk dressinggowns and ditto ditto slippers of whom she had read and dreamed but had never expected to behold was suddenly converted into mr samuel smith the assistant at a ‘cheap shop’ the junior partner in a slippery firm of some three weeks’ existence  the dignified evanishment of the hero of oak lodge on this unexpected recognition could only be equalled by that of a furtive dog with a considerable kettle at his tail  all the hopes of the maldertons were destined at once to melt away like the lemon ices at a company’s dinner almack’s was still to them as distant as the north pole and miss teresa had as much chance of a husband as captain ross had of the northwest passage  years have elapsed since the occurrence of this dreadful morning  the daisies have thrice bloomed on camberwellgreen the sparrows have thrice repeated their vernal chirps in camberwellgrove but the miss maldertons are still unmated  miss teresa’s case is more desperate than ever but flamwell is yet in the zenith of his reputation and the family have the same predilection for aristocratic personages with an increased aversion to anything low    chapter vi—the black veil   one winter’s evening towards the close of the year 1800 or within a year or two of that time a young medical practitioner recently established in business was seated by a cheerful fire in his little parlour listening to the wind which was beating the rain in pattering drops against the window or rumbling dismally in the chimney  the night was wet and cold he had been walking through mud and water the whole day and was now comfortably reposing in his dressinggown and slippers more than half asleep and less than half awake revolving a thousand matters in his wandering imagination  first he thought how hard the wind was blowing and how the cold sharp rain would be at that moment beating in his face if he were not comfortably housed at home  then his mind reverted to his annual christmas visit to his native place and dearest friends he thought how glad they would all be to see him and how happy it would make rose if he could only tell her that he had found a patient at last and hoped to have more and to come down again in a few months’ time and marry her and take her home to gladden his lonely fireside and stimulate him to fresh exertions  then he began to wonder when his first patient would appear or whether he was destined by a special dispensation of providence never to have any patients at all and then he thought about rose again and dropped to sleep and dreamed about her till the tones of her sweet merry voice sounded in his ears and her soft tiny hand rested on his shoulder  there was a hand upon his shoulder but it was neither soft nor tiny its owner being a corpulent roundheaded boy who in consideration of the sum of one shilling per week and his food was let out by the parish to carry medicine and messages  as there was no demand for the medicine however and no necessity for the messages he usually occupied his unemployed hours—averaging fourteen a day—in abstracting peppermint drops taking animal nourishment and going to sleep  ‘a lady sir—a lady’ whispered the boy rousing his master with a shake  ‘what lady’ cried our friend starting up not quite certain that his dream was an illusion and half expecting that it might be rose herself—‘what lady  where’  ‘there sir’ replied the boy pointing to the glass door leading into the surgery with an expression of alarm which the very unusual apparition of a customer might have tended to excite  the surgeon looked towards the door and started himself for an instant on beholding the appearance of his unlookedfor visitor  it was a singularly tall woman dressed in deep mourning and standing so close to the door that her face almost touched the glass  the upper part of her figure was carefully muffled in a black shawl as if for the purpose of concealment and her face was shrouded by a thick black veil she stood perfectly erect her figure was drawn up to its full height and though the surgeon felt that the eyes beneath the veil were fixed on him she stood perfectly motionless and evinced by no gesture whatever the slightest consciousness of his having turned towards her  ‘do you wish to consult me’ he inquired with some hesitation holding open the door  it opened inwards and therefore the action did not alter the position of the figure which still remained motionless on the same spot  she slightly inclined her head in token of acquiescence  ‘pray walk in’ said the surgeon  the figure moved a step forward and then turning its head in the direction of the boy—to his infinite horror—appeared to hesitate  ‘leave the room tom’ said the young man addressing the boy whose large round eyes had been extended to their utmost width during this brief interview  ‘draw the curtain and shut the door’  the boy drew a green curtain across the glass part of the door retired into the surgery closed the door after him and immediately applied one of his large eyes to the keyhole on the other side  the surgeon drew a chair to the fire and motioned the visitor to a seat the mysterious figure slowly moved towards it  as the blaze shone upon the black dress the surgeon observed that the bottom of it was saturated with mud and rain  ‘you are very wet’ be said  ‘i am’ said the stranger in a low deep voice  ‘and you are ill’ added the surgeon compassionately for the tone was that of a person in pain  ‘i am’ was the reply—‘very ill not bodily but mentally  it is not for myself or on my own behalf’ continued the stranger ‘that i come to you  if i laboured under bodily disease i should not be out alone at such an hour or on such a night as this and if i were afflicted with it twentyfour hours hence god knows how gladly i would lie down and pray to die  it is for another that i beseech your aid sir  i may be mad to ask it for him—i think i am but night after night through the long dreary hours of watching and weeping the thought has been ever present to my mind and though even i see the hopelessness of human assistance availing him the bare thought of laying him in his grave without it makes my blood run cold’  and a shudder such as the surgeon well knew art could not produce trembled through the speaker’s frame  there was a desperate earnestness in this woman’s manner that went to the young man’s heart  he was young in his profession and had not yet witnessed enough of the miseries which are daily presented before the eyes of its members to have grown comparatively callous to human suffering  ‘if’ he said rising hastily ‘the person of whom you speak be in so hopeless a condition as you describe not a moment is to be lost  i will go with you instantly  why did you not obtain medical advice before’  ‘because it would have been useless before—because it is useless even now’ replied the woman clasping her hands passionately  the surgeon gazed for a moment on the black veil as if to ascertain the expression of the features beneath it its thickness however rendered such a result impossible  ‘you are ill’ he said gently ‘although you do not know it  the fever which has enabled you to bear without feeling it the fatigue you have evidently undergone is burning within you now  put that to your lips’ he continued pouring out a glass of water—‘compose yourself for a few moments and then tell me as calmly as you can what the disease of the patient is and how long he has been ill  when i know what it is necessary i should know to render my visit serviceable to him i am ready to accompany you’  the stranger lifted the glass of water to her mouth without raising the veil put it down again untasted and burst into tears  ‘i know’ she said sobbing aloud ‘that what i say to you now seems like the ravings of fever  i have been told so before less kindly than by you  i am not a young woman and they do say that as life steals on towards its final close the last short remnant worthless as it may seem to all beside is dearer to its possessor than all the years that have gone before connected though they be with the recollection of old friends long since dead and young ones—children perhaps—who have fallen off from and forgotten one as completely as if they had died too  my natural term of life cannot be many years longer and should be dear on that account but i would lay it down without a sigh—with cheerfulness—with joy—if what i tell you now were only false or imaginary  tomorrow morning he of whom i speak will be i know though i would fain think otherwise beyond the reach of human aid and yet tonight though he is in deadly peril you must not see and could not serve him’  ‘i am unwilling to increase your distress’ said the surgeon after a short pause ‘by making any comment on what you have just said or appearing desirous to investigate a subject you are so anxious to conceal but there is an inconsistency in your statement which i cannot reconcile with probability  this person is dying tonight and i cannot see him when my assistance might possibly avail you apprehend it will be useless tomorrow and yet you would have me see him then  if he be indeed as dear to you as your words and manner would imply why not try to save his life before delay and the progress of his disease render it impracticable’  ‘god help me’ exclaimed the woman weeping bitterly ‘how can i hope strangers will believe what appears incredible even to myself  you will not see him then sir’ she added rising suddenly  ‘i did not say that i declined to see him’ replied the surgeon ‘but i warn you that if you persist in this extraordinary procrastination and the individual dies a fearful responsibility rests with you’  ‘the responsibility will rest heavily somewhere’ replied the stranger bitterly  ‘whatever responsibility rests with me i am content to bear and ready to answer’  ‘as i incur none’ continued the surgeon ‘by acceding to your request i will see him in the morning if you leave me the address  at what hour can he be seen’  ‘nine’ replied the stranger  ‘you must excuse my pressing these inquiries’ said the surgeon  ‘but is he in your charge now’  ‘he is not’ was the rejoinder  ‘then if i gave you instructions for his treatment through the night you could not assist him’  the woman wept bitterly as she replied ‘i could not’  finding that there was but little prospect of obtaining more information by prolonging the interview and anxious to spare the woman’s feelings which subdued at first by a violent effort were now irrepressible and most painful to witness the surgeon repeated his promise of calling in the morning at the appointed hour  his visitor after giving him a direction to an obscure part of walworth left the house in the same mysterious manner in which she had entered it  it will be readily believed that so extraordinary a visit produced a considerable impression on the mind of the young surgeon and that he speculated a great deal and to very little purpose on the possible circumstances of the case  in common with the generality of people he had often heard and read of singular instances in which a presentiment of death at a particular day or even minute had been entertained and realised  at one moment he was inclined to think that the present might be such a case but then it occurred to him that all the anecdotes of the kind he had ever heard were of persons who had been troubled with a foreboding of their own death  this woman however spoke of another person—a man and it was impossible to suppose that a mere dream or delusion of fancy would induce her to speak of his approaching dissolution with such terrible certainty as she had spoken  it could not be that the man was to be murdered in the morning and that the woman originally a consenting party and bound to secrecy by an oath had relented and though unable to prevent the commission of some outrage on the victim had determined to prevent his death if possible by the timely interposition of medical aid  the idea of such things happening within two miles of the metropolis appeared too wild and preposterous to be entertained beyond the instant  then his original impression that the woman’s intellects were disordered recurred and as it was the only mode of solving the difficulty with any degree of satisfaction he obstinately made up his mind to believe that she was mad  certain misgivings upon this point however stole upon his thoughts at the time and presented themselves again and again through the long dull course of a sleepless night during which in spite of all his efforts to the contrary he was unable to banish the black veil from his disturbed imagination  the back part of walworth at its greatest distance from town is a straggling miserable place enough even in these days but fiveandthirty years ago the greater portion of it was little better than a dreary waste inhabited by a few scattered people of questionable character whose poverty prevented their living in any better neighbourhood or whose pursuits and mode of life rendered its solitude desirable  very many of the houses which have since sprung up on all sides were not built until some years afterwards and the great majority even of those which were sprinkled about at irregular intervals were of the rudest and most miserable description  the appearance of the place through which he walked in the morning was not calculated to raise the spirits of the young surgeon or to dispel any feeling of anxiety or depression which the singular kind of visit he was about to make had awakened  striking off from the high road his way lay across a marshy common through irregular lanes with here and there a ruinous and dismantled cottage fast falling to pieces with decay and neglect  a stunted tree or pool of stagnant water roused into a sluggish action by the heavy rain of the preceding night skirted the path occasionally and now and then a miserable patch of gardenground with a few old boards knocked together for a summerhouse and old palings imperfectly mended with stakes pilfered from the neighbouring hedges bore testimony at once to the poverty of the inhabitants and the little scruple they entertained in appropriating the property of other people to their own use  occasionally a filthylooking woman would make her appearance from the door of a dirty house to empty the contents of some cooking utensil into the gutter in front or to scream after a little slipshod girl who had contrived to stagger a few yards from the door under the weight of a sallow infant almost as big as herself but scarcely anything was stirring around and so much of the prospect as could be faintly traced through the cold damp mist which hung heavily over it presented a lonely and dreary appearance perfectly in keeping with the objects we have described  after plodding wearily through the mud and mire making many inquiries for the place to which he had been directed and receiving as many contradictory and unsatisfactory replies in return the young man at length arrived before the house which had been pointed out to him as the object of his destination  it was a small low building one story above the ground with even a more desolate and unpromising exterior than any he had yet passed  an old yellow curtain was closely drawn across the window upstairs and the parlour shutters were closed but not fastened the house was detached from any other and as it stood at an angle of a narrow lane there was no other habitation in sight  when we say that the surgeon hesitated and walked a few paces beyond the house before he could prevail upon himself to lift the knocker we say nothing that need raise a smile upon the face of the boldest reader  the police of london were a very different body in that day the isolated position of the suburbs when the rage for building and the progress of improvement had not yet begun to connect them with the main body of the city and its environs rendered many of them and this in particular a place of resort for the worst and most depraved characters  even the streets in the gayest parts of london were imperfectly lighted at that time and such places as these were left entirely to the mercy of the moon and stars  the chances of detecting desperate characters or of tracing them to their haunts were thus rendered very few and their offences naturally increased in boldness as the consciousness of comparative security became the more impressed upon them by daily experience  added to these considerations it must be remembered that the young man had spent some time in the public hospitals of the metropolis and although neither burke nor bishop had then gained a horrible notoriety his own observation might have suggested to him how easily the atrocities to which the former has since given his name might be committed  be this as it may whatever reflection made him hesitate he did hesitate but being a young man of strong mind and great personal courage it was only for an instant—he stepped briskly back and knocked gently at the door  a low whispering was audible immediately afterwards as if some person at the end of the passage were conversing stealthily with another on the landing above  it was succeeded by the noise of a pair of heavy boots upon the bare floor  the doorchain was softly unfastened the door opened and a tall illfavoured man with black hair and a face as the surgeon often declared afterwards as pale and haggard as the countenance of any dead man he ever saw presented himself  ‘walk in sir’ he said in a low tone  the surgeon did so and the man having secured the door again by the chain led the way to a small back parlour at the extremity of the passage  ‘am i in time’  ‘too soon’ replied the man  the surgeon turned hastily round with a gesture of astonishment not unmixed with alarm which he found it impossible to repress  ‘if you’ll step in here sir’ said the man who had evidently noticed the action—‘if you’ll step in here sir you won’t be detained five minutes i assure you’  the surgeon at once walked into the room  the man closed the door and left him alone  it was a little cold room with no other furniture than two deal chairs and a table of the same material  a handful of fire unguarded by any fender was burning in the grate which brought out the damp if it served no more comfortable purpose for the unwholesome moisture was stealing down the walls in long sluglike tracks  the window which was broken and patched in many places looked into a small enclosed piece of ground almost covered with water  not a sound was to be heard either within the house or without  the young surgeon sat down by the fireplace to await the result of his first professional visit  he had not remained in this position many minutes when the noise of some approaching vehicle struck his ear  it stopped the streetdoor was opened a low talking succeeded accompanied with a shuffling noise of footsteps along the passage and on the stairs as if two or three men were engaged in carrying some heavy body to the room above  the creaking of the stairs a few seconds afterwards announced that the newcomers having completed their task whatever it was were leaving the house the door was again closed and the former silence was restored  another five minutes had elapsed and the surgeon had resolved to explore the house in search of some one to whom he might make his errand known when the roomdoor opened and his last night’s visitor dressed in exactly the same manner with the veil lowered as before motioned him to advance  the singular height of her form coupled with the circumstance of her not speaking caused the idea to pass across his brain for an instant that it might be a man disguised in woman’s attire  the hysteric sobs which issued from beneath the veil and the convulsive attitude of grief of the whole figure however at once exposed the absurdity of the suspicion and he hastily followed  the woman led the way upstairs to the front room and paused at the door to let him enter first  it was scantily furnished with an old deal box a few chairs and a tent bedstead without hangings or crossrails which was covered with a patchwork counterpane  the dim light admitted through the curtain which he had noticed from the outside rendered the objects in the room so indistinct and communicated to all of them so uniform a hue that he did not at first perceive the object on which his eye at once rested when the woman rushed frantically past him and flung herself on her knees by the bedside  stretched upon the bed closely enveloped in a linen wrapper and covered with blankets lay a human form stiff and motionless  the head and face which were those of a man were uncovered save by a bandage which passed over the head and under the chin  the eyes were closed  the left arm lay heavily across the bed and the woman held the passive hand  the surgeon gently pushed the woman aside and took the hand in his  ‘my god’ he exclaimed letting it fall involuntarily—‘the man is dead’  the woman started to her feet and beat her hands together  ‘oh don’t say so sir’ she exclaimed with a burst of passion amounting almost to frenzy  ‘oh don’t say so sir  i can’t bear it men have been brought to life before when unskilful people have given them up for lost and men have died who might have been restored if proper means had been resorted to  don’t let him lie here sir without one effort to save him  this very moment life may be passing away  do try sir—do for heaven’s sake’—and while speaking she hurriedly chafed first the forehead and then the breast of the senseless form before her and then wildly beat the cold hands which when she ceased to hold them fell listlessly and heavily back on the coverlet  ‘it is of no use my good woman’ said the surgeon soothingly as he withdrew his hand from the man’s breast  ‘stay—undraw that curtain’  ‘why’ said the woman starting up  ‘undraw that curtain’ repeated the surgeon in an agitated tone  ‘i darkened the room on purpose’ said the woman throwing herself before him as he rose to undraw it—‘oh sir have pity on me  if it can be of no use and he is really dead do not expose that form to other eyes than mine’  ‘this man died no natural or easy death’ said the surgeon  ‘i must see the body’  with a motion so sudden that the woman hardly knew that he had slipped from beside her he tore open the curtain admitted the full light of day and returned to the bedside  ‘there has been violence here’ he said pointing towards the body and gazing intently on the face from which the black veil was now for the first time removed  in the excitement of a minute before the female had thrown off the bonnet and veil and now stood with her eyes fixed upon him  her features were those of a woman about fifty who had once been handsome  sorrow and weeping had left traces upon them which not time itself would ever have produced without their aid her face was deadly pale and there was a nervous contortion of the lip and an unnatural fire in her eye which showed too plainly that her bodily and mental powers had nearly sunk beneath an accumulation of misery  ‘there has been violence here’ said the surgeon preserving his searching glance  ‘there has’ replied the woman  ‘this man has been murdered’  ‘that i call god to witness he has’ said the woman passionately ‘pitilessly inhumanly murdered’  ‘by whom’ said the surgeon seizing the woman by the arm  ‘look at the butchers’ marks and then ask me’ she replied  the surgeon turned his face towards the bed and bent over the body which now lay full in the light of the window  the throat was swollen and a livid mark encircled it  the truth flashed suddenly upon him  ‘this is one of the men who were hanged this morning’ he exclaimed turning away with a shudder  ‘it is’ replied the woman with a cold unmeaning stare  ‘who was he’ inquired the surgeon  ‘my son’ rejoined the woman and fell senseless at his feet  it was true  a companion equally guilty with himself had been acquitted for want of evidence and this man had been left for death and executed  to recount the circumstances of the case at this distant period must be unnecessary and might give pain to some persons still alive  the history was an everyday one  the mother was a widow without friends or money and had denied herself necessaries to bestow them on her orphan boy  that boy unmindful of her prayers and forgetful of the sufferings she had endured for him—incessant anxiety of mind and voluntary starvation of body—had plunged into a career of dissipation and crime  and this was the result his own death by the hangman’s hands and his mother’s shame and incurable insanity  for many years after this occurrence and when profitable and arduous avocations would have led many men to forget that such a miserable being existed the young surgeon was a daily visitor at the side of the harmless mad woman not only soothing her by his presence and kindness but alleviating the rigour of her condition by pecuniary donations for her comfort and support bestowed with no sparing hand  in the transient gleam of recollection and consciousness which preceded her death a prayer for his welfare and protection as fervent as mortal ever breathed rose from the lips of this poor friendless creature  that prayer flew to heaven and was heard  the blessings he was instrumental in conferring have been repaid to him a thousandfold but amid all the honours of rank and station which have since been heaped upon him and which he has so well earned he can have no reminiscence more gratifying to his heart than that connected with the black veil    chapter vii—the steam excursion   mr percy noakes was a law student inhabiting a set of chambers on the fourth floor in one of those houses in gray’sinnsquare which command an extensive view of the gardens and their usual adjuncts—flaunting nurserymaids and townmade children with parenthetical legs  mr percy noakes was what is generally termed—‘a devilish good fellow’  he had a large circle of acquaintance and seldom dined at his own expense he used to talk politics to papas flatter the vanity of mammas do the amiable to their daughters make pleasure engagements with their sons and romp with the younger branches  like those paragons of perfection advertising footmen out of place he was always ‘willing to make himself generally useful’  if any old lady whose son was in india gave a ball mr percy noakes was master of the ceremonies if any young lady made a stolen match mr percy noakes gave her away if a juvenile wife presented her husband with a blooming cherub mr percy noakes was either godfather or deputygodfather and if any member of a friend’s family died mr percy noakes was invariably to be seen in the second mourning coach with a white handkerchief to his eyes sobbing—to use his own appropriate and expressive description—‘like winkin’’  it may readily be imagined that these numerous avocations were rather calculated to interfere with mr percy noakes’s professional studies mr percy noakes was perfectly aware of the fact and had therefore after mature reflection made up his mind not to study at all—a laudable determination to which he adhered in the most praiseworthy manner  his sittingroom presented a strange chaos of dressgloves boxinggloves caricatures albums invitationcards foils cricketbats cardboard drawings paste gum and fifty other miscellaneous articles heaped together in the strangest confusion  he was always making something for somebody or planning some party of pleasure which was his great forte  he invariably spoke with astonishing rapidity was smart spoffish and eightandtwenty  ‘splendid idea ’pon my life’ soliloquised mr percy noakes over his morning coffee as his mind reverted to a suggestion which had been thrown out on the previous night by a lady at whose house he had spent the evening  ‘glorious idea—mrs stubbs’  ‘yes sir’ replied a dirty old woman with an inflamed countenance emerging from the bedroom with a barrel of dirt and cinders—this was the laundress  ‘did you call sir’  ‘oh  mrs stubbs i’m going out  if that tailor should call again you’d better say—you’d better say i’m out of town and shan’t be back for a fortnight and if that bootmaker should come tell him i’ve lost his address or i’d have sent him that little amount  mind he writes it down and if mr hardy should call—you know mr hardy’  ‘the funny gentleman sir’  ‘ah the funny gentleman  if mr hardy should call say i’ve gone to mrs taunton’s about that waterparty’  ‘yes sir’  ‘and if any fellow calls and says he’s come about a steamer tell him to be here at five o’clock this afternoon mrs stubbs’  ‘very well sir’  mr percy noakes brushed his hat whisked the crumbs off his inexpressibles with a silk handkerchief gave the ends of his hair a persuasive roll round his forefinger and sallied forth for mrs taunton’s domicile in great marlboroughstreet where she and her daughters occupied the upper part of a house  she was a goodlooking widow of fifty with the form of a giantess and the mind of a child  the pursuit of pleasure and some means of killing time were the sole end of her existence  she doted on her daughters who were as frivolous as herself  a general exclamation of satisfaction hailed the arrival of mr percy noakes who went through the ordinary salutations and threw himself into an easy chair near the ladies’ worktable with the ease of a regularly established friend of the family  mrs taunton was busily engaged in planting immense bright bows on every part of a smart cap on which it was possible to stick one miss emily taunton was making a watchguard miss sophia was at the piano practising a new song—poetry by the young officer or the policeofficer or the customhouse officer or some other interesting amateur  ‘you good creature’ said mrs taunton addressing the gallant percy ‘you really are a good soul  you’ve come about the waterparty i know’  ‘i should rather suspect i had’ replied mr noakes triumphantly  ‘now come here girls and i’ll tell you all about it’  miss emily and miss sophia advanced to the table  ‘now’ continued mr percy noakes ‘it seems to me that the best way will be to have a committee of ten to make all the arrangements and manage the whole setout  then i propose that the expenses shall be paid by these ten fellows jointly’  ‘excellent indeed’ said mrs taunton who highly approved of this part of the arrangements  ‘then my plan is that each of these ten fellows shall have the power of asking five people  there must be a meeting of the committee at my chambers to make all the arrangements and these people shall be then named every member of the committee shall have the power of blackballing any one who is proposed and one black ball shall exclude that person  this will ensure our having a pleasant party you know’  ‘what a manager you are’ interrupted mrs taunton again  ‘charming’ said the lovely emily  ‘i never did’ ejaculated sophia  ‘yes i think it’ll do’ replied mr percy noakes who was now quite in his element  ‘i think it’ll do  then you know we shall go down to the nore and back and have a regular capital cold dinner laid out in the cabin before we start so that everything may be ready without any confusion and we shall have the lunch laid out on deck in those little teagardenlooking concerns by the paddleboxes—i don’t know what you call ’em  then we shall hire a steamer expressly for our party and a band and have the deck chalked and we shall be able to dance quadrilles all day and then whoever we know that’s musical you know why they’ll make themselves useful and agreeable and—and—upon the whole i really hope we shall have a glorious day you know’  the announcement of these arrangements was received with the utmost enthusiasm  mrs taunton emily and sophia were loud in their praises  ‘well but tell me percy’ said mrs taunton ‘who are the ten gentlemen to be’  ‘oh  i know plenty of fellows who’ll be delighted with the scheme’ replied mr percy noakes ‘of course we shall have—’  ‘mr hardy’ interrupted the servant announcing a visitor  miss sophia and miss emily hastily assumed the most interesting attitudes that could be adopted on so short a notice  ‘how are you’ said a stout gentleman of about forty pausing at the door in the attitude of an awkward harlequin  this was mr hardy whom we have before described on the authority of mrs stubbs as ‘the funny gentleman’  he was an astleycooperish joe miller—a practical joker immensely popular with married ladies and a general favourite with young men  he was always engaged in some pleasure excursion or other and delighted in getting somebody into a scrape on such occasions  he could sing comic songs imitate hackneycoachmen and fowls play airs on his chin and execute concertos on the jews’harp  he always eat and drank most immoderately and was the bosom friend of mr percy noakes  he had a red face a somewhat husky voice and a tremendous laugh  ‘how are you’ said this worthy laughing as if it were the finest joke in the world to make a morning call and shaking hands with the ladies with as much vehemence as if their arms had been so many pumphandles  ‘you’re just the very man i wanted’ said mr percy noakes who proceeded to explain the cause of his being in requisition  ‘ha ha ha’ shouted hardy after hearing the statement and receiving a detailed account of the proposed excursion  ‘oh capital glorious what a day it will be what fun—but i say when are you going to begin making the arrangements’  ‘no time like the present—at once if you please’  ‘oh charming’ cried the ladies  ‘pray do’  writing materials were laid before mr percy noakes and the names of the different members of the committee were agreed on after as much discussion between him and mr hardy as if the fate of nations had depended on their appointment  it was then agreed that a meeting should take place at mr percy noakes’s chambers on the ensuing wednesday evening at eight o’clock and the visitors departed  wednesday evening arrived eight o’clock came and eight members of the committee were punctual in their attendance  mr loggins the solicitor of boswellcourt sent an excuse and mr samuel briggs the ditto of furnival’s inn sent his brother much to his the brother’s satisfaction and greatly to the discomfiture of mr percy noakes between the briggses and the tauntons there existed a degree of implacable hatred quite unprecedented  the animosity between the montagues and capulets was nothing to that which prevailed between these two illustrious houses  mrs briggs was a widow with three daughters and two sons mr samuel the eldest was an attorney and mr alexander the youngest was under articles to his brother  they resided in portlandstreet oxfordstreet and moved in the same orbit as the tauntons—hence their mutual dislike  if the miss briggses appeared in smart bonnets the miss tauntons eclipsed them with smarter  if mrs taunton appeared in a cap of all the hues of the rainbow mrs briggs forthwith mounted a toque with all the patterns of the kaleidoscope  if miss sophia taunton learnt a new song two of the miss briggses came out with a new duet  the tauntons had once gained a temporary triumph with the assistance of a harp but the briggses brought three guitars into the field and effectually routed the enemy  there was no end to the rivalry between them  now as mr samuel briggs was a mere machine a sort of selfacting legal walkingstick and as the party was known to have originated however remotely with mrs taunton the female branches of the briggs family had arranged that mr alexander should attend instead of his brother and as the said mr alexander was deservedly celebrated for possessing all the pertinacity of a bankruptcycourt attorney combined with the obstinacy of that useful animal which browses on the thistle he required but little tuition  he was especially enjoined to make himself as disagreeable as possible and above all to blackball the tauntons at every hazard  the proceedings of the evening were opened by mr percy noakes  after successfully urging on the gentlemen present the propriety of their mixing some brandyandwater he briefly stated the object of the meeting and concluded by observing that the first step must be the selection of a chairman necessarily possessing some arbitrary—he trusted not unconstitutional—powers to whom the personal direction of the whole of the arrangements subject to the approval of the committee should be confided  a pale young gentleman in a green stock and spectacles of the same a member of the honourable society of the inner temple immediately rose for the purpose of proposing mr percy noakes  he had known him long and this he would say that a more honourable a more excellent or a betterhearted fellow never existed—hear hear  the young gentleman who was a member of a debating society took this opportunity of entering into an examination of the state of the english law from the days of william the conqueror down to the present period he briefly adverted to the code established by the ancient druids slightly glanced at the principles laid down by the athenian lawgivers and concluded with a most glowing eulogium on picnics and constitutional rights  mr alexander briggs opposed the motion  he had the highest esteem for mr percy noakes as an individual but he did consider that he ought not to be intrusted with these immense powers—oh oh—he believed that in the proposed capacity mr percy noakes would not act fairly impartially or honourably but he begged it to be distinctly understood that he said this without the slightest personal disrespect  mr hardy defended his honourable friend in a voice rendered partially unintelligible by emotion and brandyandwater  the proposition was put to the vote and there appearing to be only one dissentient voice mr percy noakes was declared duly elected and took the chair accordingly  the business of the meeting now proceeded with rapidity  the chairman delivered in his estimate of the probable expense of the excursion and every one present subscribed his portion thereof  the question was put that ‘the endeavour’ be hired for the occasion mr alexander briggs moved as an amendment that the word ‘fly’ be substituted for the word ‘endeavour’ but after some debate consented to withdraw his opposition the important ceremony of balloting then commenced  a teacaddy was placed on a table in a dark corner of the apartment and every one was provided with two backgammon men one black and one white  the chairman with great solemnity then read the following list of the guests whom he proposed to introduce—mrs taunton and two daughters mr wizzle mr simson  the names were respectively balloted for and mrs taunton and her daughters were declared to be blackballed  mr percy noakes and mr hardy exchanged glances  ‘is your list prepared mr briggs’ inquired the chairman  ‘it is’ replied alexander delivering in the following—‘mrs briggs and three daughters mr samuel briggs’  the previous ceremony was repeated and mrs briggs and three daughters were declared to be blackballed mr alexander briggs looked rather foolish and the remainder of the company appeared somewhat overawed by the mysterious nature of the proceedings  the balloting proceeded but one little circumstance which mr percy noakes had not originally foreseen prevented the system from working quite as well as he had anticipated  everybody was blackballed  mr alexander briggs by way of retaliation exercised his power of exclusion in every instance and the result was that after three hours had been consumed in hard balloting the names of only three gentlemen were found to have been agreed to  in this dilemma what was to be done either the whole plan must fall to the ground or a compromise must be effected the latter alternative was preferable and mr percy noakes therefore proposed that the form of balloting should be dispensed with and that every gentleman should merely be required to state whom he intended to bring  the proposal was acceded to the tauntons and the briggses were reinstated and the party was formed  the next wednesday was fixed for the eventful day and it was unanimously resolved that every member of the committee should wear a piece of blue sarsenet ribbon round his left arm  it appeared from the statement of mr percy noakes that the boat belonged to the general steam navigation company and was then lying off the customhouse and as he proposed that the dinner and wines should be provided by an eminent city purveyor it was arranged that mr percy noakes should be on board by seven o’clock to superintend the arrangements and that the remaining members of the committee together with the company generally should be expected to join her by nine o’clock  more brandyandwater was despatched several speeches were made by the different law students present thanks were voted to the chairman and the meeting separated  the weather had been beautiful up to this period and beautiful it continued to be  sunday passed over and mr percy noakes became unusually fidgety—rushing constantly to and from the steam packet wharf to the astonishment of the clerks and the great emolument of the holborn cabmen  tuesday arrived and the anxiety of mr percy noakes knew no bounds  he was every instant running to the window to look out for clouds and mr hardy astonished the whole square by practising a new comic song for the occasion in the chairman’s chambers  uneasy were the slumbers of mr percy noakes that night he tossed and tumbled about and had confused dreams of steamers starting off and gigantic clocks with the hands pointing to a quarterpast nine and the ugly face of mr alexander briggs looking over the boat’s side and grinning as if in derision of his fruitless attempts to move  he made a violent effort to get on board and awoke  the bright sun was shining cheerfully into the bedroom and mr percy noakes started up for his watch in the dreadful expectation of finding his worst dreams realised  it was just five o’clock  he calculated the time—he should be a good halfhour dressing himself and as it was a lovely morning and the tide would be then running down he would walk leisurely to strandlane and have a boat to the customhouse  he dressed himself took a hasty apology for a breakfast and sallied forth  the streets looked as lonely and deserted as if they had been crowded overnight for the last time  here and there an early apprentice with quenchedlooking sleepy eyes was taking down the shutters of a shop and a policeman or milkwoman might occasionally be seen pacing slowly along but the servants had not yet begun to clean the doors or light the kitchen fires and london looked the picture of desolation  at the corner of a bystreet near templebar was stationed a ‘streetbreakfast’  the coffee was boiling over a charcoal fire and large slices of bread and butter were piled one upon the other like deals in a timberyard  the company were seated on a form which with a view both to security and comfort was placed against a neighbouring wall  two young men whose uproarious mirth and disordered dress bespoke the conviviality of the preceding evening were treating three ‘ladies’ and an irish labourer  a little sweep was standing at a short distance casting a longing eye at the tempting delicacies and a policeman was watching the group from the opposite side of the street  the wan looks and gaudy finery of the thinlyclad women contrasted as strangely with the gay sunlight as did their forced merriment with the boisterous hilarity of the two young men who now and then varied their amusements by ‘bonneting’ the proprietor of this itinerant coffeehouse  mr percy noakes walked briskly by and when he turned down strandlane and caught a glimpse of the glistening water he thought he had never felt so important or so happy in his life  ‘boat sir’ cried one of the three watermen who were mopping out their boats and all whistling  ‘boat sir’  ‘no’ replied mr percy noakes rather sharply for the inquiry was not made in a manner at all suitable to his dignity  ‘would you prefer a wessel sir’ inquired another to the infinite delight of the ‘jackinthewater’  mr percy noakes replied with a look of supreme contempt  ‘did you want to be put on board a steamer sir’ inquired an old firemanwaterman very confidentially  he was dressed in a faded red suit just the colour of the cover of a very old courtguide  ‘yes make haste—the endeavour—off the customhouse’  ‘endeavour’ cried the man who had convulsed the ‘jack’ before  ‘vy i see the endeavour go up half an hour ago’  ‘so did i’ said another ‘and i should think she’d gone down by this time for she’s a precious sight too full of ladies and gen’lemen’  mr percy noakes affected to disregard these representations and stepped into the boat which the old man by dint of scrambling and shoving and grating had brought up to the causeway  ‘shove her off’ cried mr percy noakes and away the boat glided down the river mr percy noakes seated on the recently mopped seat and the watermen at the stairs offering to bet him any reasonable sum that he’d never reach the ‘custumus’  ‘here she is by jove’ said the delighted percy as they ran alongside the endeavour  ‘hold hard’ cried the steward over the side and mr percy noakes jumped on board  ‘hope you will find everything as you wished sir  she looks uncommon well this morning’  ‘she does indeed’ replied the manager in a state of ecstasy which it is impossible to describe  the deck was scrubbed and the seats were scrubbed and there was a bench for the band and a place for dancing and a pile of campstools and an awning and then mr percy noakes bustled down below and there were the pastrycook’s men and the steward’s wife laying out the dinner on two tables the whole length of the cabin and then mr percy noakes took off his coat and rushed backwards and forwards doing nothing but quite convinced he was assisting everybody and the steward’s wife laughed till she cried and mr percy noakes panted with the violence of his exertions  and then the bell at londonbridge wharf rang and a margate boat was just starting and a gravesend boat was just starting and people shouted and porters ran down the steps with luggage that would crush any men but porters and sloping boards with bits of wood nailed on them were placed between the outside boat and the inside boat and the passengers ran along them and looked like so many fowls coming out of an area and then the bell ceased and the boards were taken away and the boats started and the whole scene was one of the most delightful bustle and confusion  the time wore on halfpast eight o’clock arrived the pastrycook’s men went ashore the dinner was completely laid out and mr percy noakes locked the principal cabin and put the key in his pocket in order that it might be suddenly disclosed in all its magnificence to the eyes of the astonished company  the band came on board and so did the wine  ten minutes to nine and the committee embarked in a body  there was mr hardy in a blue jacket and waistcoat white trousers silk stockings and pumps—in full aquatic costume with a straw hat on his head and an immense telescope under his arm and there was the young gentleman with the green spectacles in nankeen inexplicables with a ditto waistcoat and bright buttons like the pictures of paul—not the saint but he of virginia notoriety  the remainder of the committee dressed in white hats light jackets waistcoats and trousers looked something between waiters and west india planters  nine o’clock struck and the company arrived in shoals  mr samuel briggs mrs briggs and the misses briggs made their appearance in a smart private wherry  the three guitars in their respective dark green cases were carefully stowed away in the bottom of the boat accompanied by two immense portfolios of music which it would take at least a week’s incessant playing to get through  the tauntons arrived at the same moment with more music and a lion—a gentleman with a bass voice and an incipient red moustache  the colours of the taunton party were pink those of the briggses a light blue  the tauntons had artificial flowers in their bonnets here the briggses gained a decided advantage—they wore feathers  ‘how d’ye do dear’ said the misses briggs to the misses taunton  the word ‘dear’ among girls is frequently synonymous with ‘wretch’  ‘quite well thank you dear’ replied the misses taunton to the misses briggs and then there was such a kissing and congratulating and shaking of hands as might have induced one to suppose that the two families were the best friends in the world instead of each wishing the other overboard as they most sincerely did  mr percy noakes received the visitors and bowed to the strange gentleman as if he should like to know who he was  this was just what mrs taunton wanted  here was an opportunity to astonish the briggses  ‘oh  i beg your pardon’ said the general of the taunton party with a careless air—‘captain helves—mr percy noakes—mrs briggs—captain helves’  mr percy noakes bowed very low the gallant captain did the same with all due ferocity and the briggses were clearly overcome  ‘our friend mr wizzle being unfortunately prevented from coming’ resumed mrs taunton ‘i did myself the pleasure of bringing the captain whose musical talents i knew would be a great acquisition’  ‘in the name of the committee i have to thank you for doing so and to offer you welcome sir’ replied percy  here the scraping was renewed ‘but pray be seated—won’t you walk aft  captain will you conduct miss taunton—miss briggs will you allow me’  ‘where could they have picked up that military man’ inquired mrs briggs of miss kate briggs as they followed the little party  ‘i can’t imagine’ replied miss kate bursting with vexation for the very fierce air with which the gallant captain regarded the company had impressed her with a high sense of his importance  boat after boat came alongside and guest after guest arrived  the invites had been excellently arranged mr percy noakes having considered it as important that the number of young men should exactly tally with that of the young ladies as that the quantity of knives on board should be in precise proportion to the forks  ‘now is every one on board’ inquired mr percy noakes  the committee who with their bits of blue ribbon looked as if they were all going to be bled bustled about to ascertain the fact and reported that they might safely start  ‘go on’ cried the master of the boat from the top of one of the paddleboxes  ‘go on’ echoed the boy who was stationed over the hatchway to pass the directions down to the engineer and away went the vessel with that agreeable noise which is peculiar to steamers and which is composed of a mixture of creaking gushing clanging and snorting  ‘hoioioioioioioiii’ shouted halfadozen voices from a boat a quarter of a mile astern  ‘ease her’ cried the captain ‘do these people belong to us sir’  ‘noakes’ exclaimed hardy who had been looking at every object far and near through the large telescope ‘it’s the fleetwoods and the wakefields—and two children with them by jove’  ‘what a shame to bring children’ said everybody ‘how very inconsiderate’  ‘i say it would be a good joke to pretend not to see ’em wouldn’t it’ suggested hardy to the immense delight of the company generally  a council of war was hastily held and it was resolved that the newcomers should be taken on board on mr hardy solemnly pledging himself to tease the children during the whole of the day  ‘stop her’ cried the captain  ‘stop her’ repeated the boy whizz went the steam and all the young ladies as in duty bound screamed in concert  they were only appeased by the assurance of the martial helves that the escape of steam consequent on stopping a vessel was seldom attended with any great loss of human life  two men ran to the side and after some shouting and swearing and angling for the wherry with a boathook mr fleetwood and mrs fleetwood and master fleetwood and mr wakefield and mrs wakefield and miss wakefield were safely deposited on the deck  the girl was about six years old the boy about four the former was dressed in a white frock with a pink sash and dog’searedlooking little spencer a straw bonnet and green veil six inches by three and a half the latter was attired for the occasion in a nankeen frock between the bottom of which and the top of his plaid socks a considerable portion of two small mottled legs was discernible  he had a light blue cap with a gold band and tassel on his head and a damp piece of gingerbread in his hand with which he had slightly embossed his countenance  the boat once more started off the band played ‘off she goes’ the major part of the company conversed cheerfully in groups and the old gentlemen walked up and down the deck in pairs as perseveringly and gravely as if they were doing a match against time for an immense stake  they ran briskly down the pool the gentlemen pointed out the docks the thames policeoffice and other elegant public edifices and the young ladies exhibited a proper display of horror at the appearance of the coalwhippers and ballastheavers  mr hardy told stories to the married ladies at which they laughed very much in their pockethandkerchiefs and hit him on the knuckles with their fans declaring him to be ‘a naughty man—a shocking creature’—and so forth and captain helves gave slight descriptions of battles and duels with a most bloodthirsty air which made him the admiration of the women and the envy of the men quadrilling commenced captain helves danced one set with miss emily taunton and another set with miss sophia taunton  mrs taunton was in ecstasies  the victory appeared to be complete but alas the inconstancy of man  having performed this necessary duty he attached himself solely to miss julia briggs with whom he danced no less than three sets consecutively and from whose side he evinced no intention of stirring for the remainder of the day  mr hardy having played one or two very brilliant fantasias on the jews’harp and having frequently repeated the exquisitely amusing joke of slily chalking a large cross on the back of some member of the committee mr percy noakes expressed his hope that some of their musical friends would oblige the company by a display of their abilities  ‘perhaps’ he said in a very insinuating manner ‘captain helves will oblige us’  mrs taunton’s countenance lighted up for the captain only sang duets and couldn’t sing them with anybody but one of her daughters  ‘really’ said that warlike individual ‘i should be very happy ‘but—’  ‘oh pray do’ cried all the young ladies  ‘miss emily have you any objection to join in a duet’  ‘oh not the slightest’ returned the young lady in a tone which clearly showed she had the greatest possible objection  ‘shall i accompany you dear’ inquired one of the miss briggses with the bland intention of spoiling the effect  ‘very much obliged to you miss briggs’ sharply retorted mrs taunton who saw through the manoeuvre ‘my daughters always sing without accompaniments’  ‘and without voices’ tittered mrs briggs in a low tone  ‘perhaps’ said mrs taunton reddening for she guessed the tenor of the observation though she had not heard it clearly—‘perhaps it would be as well for some people if their voices were not quite so audible as they are to other people’  ‘and perhaps if gentlemen who are kidnapped to pay attention to some persons’ daughters had not sufficient discernment to pay attention to other persons’ daughters’ returned mrs briggs ‘some persons would not be so ready to display that illtemper which thank god distinguishes them from other persons’  ‘persons’ ejaculated mrs taunton  ‘persons’ replied mrs briggs  ‘insolence’  ‘creature’  ‘hush hush’ interrupted mr percy noakes who was one of the very few by whom this dialogue had been overheard  ‘hush—pray silence for the duet’  after a great deal of preparatory crowing and humming the captain began the following duet from the opera of ‘paul and virginia’ in that grunting tone in which a man gets down heaven knows where without the remotest chance of ever getting up again  this in private circles is frequently designated ‘a bass voice’      ‘see sung the captain from o—ce—an ri—sing     bright flames the or—b of d—ay     from yon gro—ove the varied so—ongs—’  here the singer was interrupted by varied cries of the most dreadful description proceeding from some grove in the immediate vicinity of the starboard paddlebox  ‘my child’ screamed mrs fleetwood  ‘my child it is his voice—i know it’  mr fleetwood accompanied by several gentlemen here rushed to the quarter from whence the noise proceeded and an exclamation of horror burst from the company the general impression being that the little innocent had either got his head in the water or his legs in the machinery  ‘what is the matter’ shouted the agonised father as he returned with the child in his arms  ‘oh oh oh’ screamed the small sufferer again  ‘what is the matter dear’ inquired the father once more—hastily stripping off the nankeen frock for the purpose of ascertaining whether the child had one bone which was not smashed to pieces  ‘oh oh—i’m so frightened’  ‘what at dear—what at’ said the mother soothing the sweet infant  ‘oh he’s been making such dreadful faces at me’ cried the boy relapsing into convulsions at the bare recollection  ‘he—who’ cried everybody crowding round him  ‘oh—him’ replied the child pointing at hardy who affected to be the most concerned of the whole group  the real state of the case at once flashed upon the minds of all present with the exception of the fleetwoods and the wakefields  the facetious hardy in fulfilment of his promise had watched the child to a remote part of the vessel and suddenly appearing before him with the most awful contortions of visage had produced his paroxysm of terror  of course he now observed that it was hardly necessary for him to deny the accusation and the unfortunate little victim was accordingly led below after receiving sundry thumps on the head from both his parents for having the wickedness to tell a story  this little interruption having been adjusted the captain resumed and miss emily chimed in in due course  the duet was loudly applauded and certainly the perfect independence of the parties deserved great commendation  miss emily sung her part without the slightest reference to the captain and the captain sang so loud that he had not the slightest idea what was being done by his partner  after having gone through the last few eighteen or nineteen bars by himself therefore he acknowledged the plaudits of the circle with that air of selfdenial which men usually assume when they think they have done something to astonish the company  ‘now’ said mr percy noakes who had just ascended from the forecabin where he had been busily engaged in decanting the wine ‘if the misses briggs will oblige us with something before dinner i am sure we shall be very much delighted’  one of those hums of admiration followed the suggestion which one frequently hears in society when nobody has the most distant notion what he is expressing his approval of  the three misses briggs looked modestly at their mamma and the mamma looked approvingly at her daughters and mrs taunton looked scornfully at all of them  the misses briggs asked for their guitars and several gentlemen seriously damaged the cases in their anxiety to present them  then there was a very interesting production of three little keys for the aforesaid cases and a melodramatic expression of horror at finding a string broken and a vast deal of screwing and tightening and winding and tuning during which mrs briggs expatiated to those near her on the immense difficulty of playing a guitar and hinted at the wondrous proficiency of her daughters in that mystic art  mrs taunton whispered to a neighbour that it was ‘quite sickening’ and the misses taunton looked as if they knew how to play but disdained to do it  at length the misses briggs began in real earnest  it was a new spanish composition for three voices and three guitars  the effect was electrical  all eyes were turned upon the captain who was reported to have once passed through spain with his regiment and who must be well acquainted with the national music  he was in raptures  this was sufficient the trio was encored the applause was universal and never had the tauntons suffered such a complete defeat  ‘bravo bravo’ ejaculated the captain—‘bravo’  ‘pretty isn’t it sir’ inquired mr samuel briggs with the air of a selfsatisfied showman  bythebye these were the first words he had been heard to utter since he left boswellcourt the evening before  ‘delightful’ returned the captain with a flourish and a military cough—‘delightful’  ‘sweet instrument’ said an old gentleman with a bald head who had been trying all the morning to look through a telescope inside the glass of which mr hardy had fixed a large black wafer  ‘did you ever hear a portuguese tambourine’ inquired that jocular individual  ‘did you ever hear a tomtom sir’ sternly inquired the captain who lost no opportunity of showing off his travels real or pretended  ‘a what’ asked hardy rather taken aback  ‘a tomtom’  ‘never’  ‘nor a gumgum’  ‘never’  ‘what is a gumgum’ eagerly inquired several young ladies  ‘when i was in the east indies’ replied the captain—here was a discovery—he had been in the east indies—‘when i was in the east indies i was once stopping a few thousand miles up the country on a visit at the house of a very particular friend of mine ram chowdar doss azuph al bowlar—a devilish pleasant fellow  as we were enjoying our hookahs one evening in the cool verandah in front of his villa we were rather surprised by the sudden appearance of thirtyfour of his kitmagars for he had rather a large establishment there accompanied by an equal number of consumars approaching the house with a threatening aspect and beating a tomtom  the ram started up—’  ‘who’ inquired the bald gentleman intensely interested  ‘the ram—ram chowdar—’  ‘oh’ said the old gentleman ‘beg your pardon pray go on’  ‘—started up and drew a pistol  “helves” said he “my boy”—he always called me my boy—“helves” said he “do you hear that tomtom”  “i do” said i  his countenance which before was pale assumed a most frightful appearance his whole visage was distorted and his frame shaken by violent emotions  “do you see that gumgum” said he  “no” said i staring about me  “you don’t” said he  “no i’ll be damned if i do” said i “and what’s more i don’t know what a gumgum is” said i  i really thought the ram would have dropped  he drew me aside and with an expression of agony i shall never forget said in a low whisper—’  ‘dinner’s on the table ladies’ interrupted the steward’s wife  ‘will you allow me’ said the captain immediately suiting the action to the word and escorting miss julia briggs to the cabin with as much ease as if he had finished the story  ‘what an extraordinary circumstance’ ejaculated the same old gentleman preserving his listening attitude  ‘what a traveller’ said the young ladies  ‘what a singular name’ exclaimed the gentlemen rather confused by the coolness of the whole affair  ‘i wish he had finished the story’ said an old lady  ‘i wonder what a gumgum really is’  ‘by jove’ exclaimed hardy who until now had been lost in utter amazement ‘i don’t know what it may be in india but in england i think a gumgum has very much the same meaning as a humbug’  ‘how illiberal how envious’ cried everybody as they made for the cabin fully impressed with a belief in the captain’s amazing adventures helves was the sole lion for the remainder of the day—impudence and the marvellous are pretty sure passports to any society  the party had by this time reached their destination and put about on their return home  the wind which had been with them the whole day was now directly in their teeth the weather had become gradually more and more overcast and the sky water and shore were all of that dull heavy uniform leadcolour which housepainters daub in the first instance over a streetdoor which is gradually approaching a state of convalescence  it had been ‘spitting’ with rain for the last halfhour and now began to pour in good earnest  the wind was freshening very fast and the waterman at the wheel had unequivocally expressed his opinion that there would shortly be a squall  a slight emotion on the part of the vessel now and then seemed to suggest the possibility of its pitching to a very uncomfortable extent in the event of its blowing harder and every timber began to creak as if the boat were an overladen clothesbasket  seasickness however is like a belief in ghosts—every one entertains some misgivings on the subject but few will acknowledge any  the majority of the company therefore endeavoured to look peculiarly happy feeling all the while especially miserable  ‘don’t it rain’ inquired the old gentleman before noticed when by dint of squeezing and jamming they were all seated at table  ‘i think it does—a little’ replied mr percy noakes who could hardly hear himself speak in consequence of the pattering on the deck  ‘don’t it blow’ inquired some one else  ‘no i don’t think it does’ responded hardy sincerely wishing that he could persuade himself that it did not for he sat near the door and was almost blown off his seat  ‘it’ll soon clear up’ said mr percy noakes in a cheerful tone  ‘oh certainly’ ejaculated the committee generally  ‘no doubt of it’ said the remainder of the company whose attention was now pretty well engrossed by the serious business of eating carving taking wine and so forth  the throbbing motion of the engine was but too perceptible  there was a large substantial cold boiled leg of mutton at the bottom of the table shaking like blancmange a previously hearty sirloin of beef looked as if it had been suddenly seized with the palsy and some tongues which were placed on dishes rather too large for them went through the most surprising evolutions darting from side to side and from end to end like a fly in an inverted wineglass  then the sweets shook and trembled till it was quite impossible to help them and people gave up the attempt in despair and the pigeonpies looked as if the birds whose legs were stuck outside were trying to get them in  the table vibrated and started like a feverish pulse and the very legs were convulsed—everything was shaking and jarring  the beams in the roof of the cabin seemed as if they were put there for the sole purpose of giving people headaches and several elderly gentlemen became illtempered in consequence  as fast as the steward put the fireirons up they would fall down again and the more the ladies and gentlemen tried to sit comfortably on their seats the more the seats seemed to slide away from the ladies and gentlemen  several ominous demands were made for small glasses of brandy the countenances of the company gradually underwent most extraordinary changes one gentleman was observed suddenly to rush from table without the slightest ostensible reason and dart up the steps with incredible swiftness thereby greatly damaging both himself and the steward who happened to be coming down at the same moment  the cloth was removed the dessert was laid on the table and the glasses were filled  the motion of the boat increased several members of the party began to feel rather vague and misty and looked as if they had only just got up  the young gentleman with the spectacles who had been in a fluctuating state for some time—at one moment bright and at another dismal like a revolving light on the seacoast—rashly announced his wish to propose a toast  after several ineffectual attempts to preserve his perpendicular the young gentleman having managed to hook himself to the centre leg of the table with his left hand proceeded as follows  ‘ladies and gentlemen  a gentleman is among us—i may say a stranger—here some painful thought seemed to strike the orator he paused and looked extremely odd—whose talents whose travels whose cheerfulness—’  ‘i beg your pardon edkins’ hastily interrupted mr percy noakes—‘hardy what’s the matter’  ‘nothing’ replied the ‘funny gentleman’ who had just life enough left to utter two consecutive syllables  ‘will you have some brandy’  ‘no’ replied hardy in a tone of great indignation and looking as comfortable as templebar in a scotch mist ‘what should i want brandy for’  ‘will you go on deck’  ‘no i will not’  this was said with a most determined air and in a voice which might have been taken for an imitation of anything it was quite as much like a guineapig as a bassoon  ‘i beg your pardon edkins’ said the courteous percy ‘i thought our friend was ill  pray go on’  a pause  ‘pray go on’  ‘mr edkins is gone’ cried somebody  ‘i beg your pardon sir’ said the steward running up to mr percy noakes ‘i beg your pardon sir but the gentleman as just went on deck—him with the green spectacles—is uncommon bad to be sure and the young man as played the wiolin says that unless he has some brandy he can’t answer for the consequences  he says he has a wife and two children whose werry subsistence depends on his breaking a wessel and he expects to do so every moment  the flageolet’s been werry ill but he’s better only he’s in a dreadful prusperation’  all disguise was now useless the company staggered on deck the gentlemen tried to see nothing but the clouds and the ladies muffled up in such shawls and cloaks as they had brought with them lay about on the seats and under the seats in the most wretched condition  never was such a blowing and raining and pitching and tossing endured by any pleasure party before  several remonstrances were sent down below on the subject of master fleetwood but they were totally unheeded in consequence of the indisposition of his natural protectors  that interesting child screamed at the top of his voice until he had no voice left to scream with and then miss wakefield began and screamed for the remainder of the passage  mr hardy was observed some hours afterwards in an attitude which induced his friends to suppose that he was busily engaged in contemplating the beauties of the deep they only regretted that his taste for the picturesque should lead him to remain so long in a position very injurious at all times but especially so to an individual labouring under a tendency of blood to the head  the party arrived off the customhouse at about two o’clock on the thursday morning dispirited and worn out  the tauntons were too ill to quarrel with the briggses and the briggses were too wretched to annoy the tauntons  one of the guitarcases was lost on its passage to a hackneycoach and mrs briggs has not scrupled to state that the tauntons bribed a porter to throw it down an area  mr alexander briggs opposes vote by ballot—he says from personal experience of its inefficacy and mr samuel briggs whenever he is asked to express his sentiments on the point says he has no opinion on that or any other subject  mr edkins—the young gentleman in the green spectacles—makes a speech on every occasion on which a speech can possibly be made the eloquence of which can only be equalled by its length  in the event of his not being previously appointed to a judgeship it is probable that he will practise as a barrister in the new central criminal court  captain helves continued his attention to miss julia briggs whom he might possibly have espoused if it had not unfortunately happened that mr samuel arrested him in the way of business pursuant to instructions received from messrs  scroggins and payne whose towndebts the gallant captain had condescended to collect but whose accounts with the indiscretion sometimes peculiar to military minds he had omitted to keep with that dull accuracy which custom has rendered necessary  mrs taunton complains that she has been much deceived in him  he introduced himself to the family on board a gravesend steampacket and certainly therefore ought to have proved respectable  mr percy noakes is as lighthearted and careless as ever    chapter viii—the great winglebury duel   the little town of great winglebury is exactly fortytwo miles and threequarters from hyde park corner  it has a long straggling quiet highstreet with a great black and white clock at a small red townhall halfway up—a marketplace—a cage—an assemblyroom—a church—a bridge—a chapel—a theatre—a library—an inn—a pump—and a postoffice  tradition tells of a ‘little winglebury’ down some crossroad about two miles off and as a square mass of dirty paper supposed to have been originally intended for a letter with certain tremulous characters inscribed thereon in which a lively imagination might trace a remote resemblance to the word ‘little’ was once stuck up to be owned in the sunny window of the great winglebury postoffice from which it only disappeared when it fell to pieces with dust and extreme old age there would appear to be some foundation for the legend  common belief is inclined to bestow the name upon a little hole at the end of a muddy lane about a couple of miles long colonised by one wheelwright four paupers and a beershop but even this authority slight as it is must be regarded with extreme suspicion inasmuch as the inhabitants of the hole aforesaid concur in opining that it never had any name at all from the earliest ages down to the present day  the winglebury arms in the centre of the highstreet opposite the small building with the big clock is the principal inn of great winglebury—the commercialinn postinghouse and exciseoffice the ‘blue’ house at every election and the judges’ house at every assizes  it is the headquarters of the gentlemen’s whist club of winglebury blues so called in opposition to the gentlemen’s whist club of winglebury buffs held at the other house a little further down and whenever a juggler or waxwork man or concertgiver takes great winglebury in his circuit it is immediately placarded all over the town that mr soandso ‘trusting to that liberal support which the inhabitants of great winglebury have long been so liberal in bestowing has at a great expense engaged the elegant and commodious assemblyrooms attached to the winglebury arms’  the house is a large one with a red brick and stone front a pretty spacious hall ornamented with evergreen plants terminates in a perspective view of the bar and a glass case in which are displayed a choice variety of delicacies ready for dressing to catch the eye of a newcomer the moment he enters and excite his appetite to the highest possible pitch  opposite doors lead to the ‘coffee’ and ‘commercial’ rooms and a great wide rambling staircase—three stairs and a landing—four stairs and another landing—one step and another landing—halfadozen stairs and another landing—and so on—conducts to galleries of bedrooms and labyrinths of sittingrooms denominated ‘private’ where you may enjoy yourself as privately as you can in any place where some bewildered being walks into your room every five minutes by mistake and then walks out again to open all the doors along the gallery until he finds his own  such is the winglebury arms at this day and such was the winglebury arms some time since—no matter when—two or three minutes before the arrival of the london stage  four horses with cloths on—change for a coach—were standing quietly at the corner of the yard surrounded by a listless group of postboys in shiny hats and smockfrocks engaged in discussing the merits of the cattle half a dozen ragged boys were standing a little apart listening with evident interest to the conversation of these worthies and a few loungers were collected round the horsetrough awaiting the arrival of the coach  the day was hot and sunny the town in the zenith of its dulness and with the exception of these few idlers not a living creature was to be seen  suddenly the loud notes of a keybugle broke the monotonous stillness of the street in came the coach rattling over the uneven paving with a noise startling enough to stop even the largefaced clock itself  down got the outsides up went the windows in all directions out came the waiters up started the ostlers and the loungers and the postboys and the ragged boys as if they were electrified—unstrapping and unchaining and unbuckling and dragging willing horses out and forcing reluctant horses in and making a most exhilarating bustle ‘lady inside here’ said the guard  ‘please to alight ma’am’ said the waiter  ‘private sittingroom’ interrogated the lady  ‘certainly ma’am’ responded the chambermaid  ‘nothing but these ’ere trunks ma’am’ inquired the guard  ‘nothing more’ replied the lady  up got the outsides again and the guard and the coachman off came the cloths with a jerk ‘all right’ was the cry and away they went  the loungers lingered a minute or two in the road watching the coach until it turned the corner and then loitered away one by one  the street was clear again and the town by contrast quieter than ever  ‘lady in number twentyfive’ screamed the landlady—‘thomas’  ‘yes ma’am’  ‘letter just been left for the gentleman in number nineteen  boots at the lion left it  no answer’  ‘letter for you sir’ said thomas depositing the letter on number nineteen’s table  ‘for me’ said number nineteen turning from the window out of which he had been surveying the scene just described  ‘yes sir’—waiters always speak in hints and never utter complete sentences—‘yes sir—boots at the lion sir—bar sir—missis said number nineteen sir—alexander trott esq sir—your card at the bar sir i think sir’  ‘my name is trott’ replied number nineteen breaking the seal  ‘you may go waiter’  the waiter pulled down the windowblind and then pulled it up again—for a regular waiter must do something before he leaves the room—adjusted the glasses on the sideboard brushed a place that was not dusty rubbed his hands very hard walked stealthily to the door and evaporated  there was evidently something in the contents of the letter of a nature if not wholly unexpected certainly extremely disagreeable  mr alexander trott laid it down and took it up again and walked about the room on particular squares of the carpet and even attempted though unsuccessfully to whistle an air  it wouldn’t do  he threw himself into a chair and read the following epistle aloud—                                              ‘blue lion and stomachwarmer                                                         ‘great winglebury                                                      ‘wednesday morning      ‘sir  immediately on discovering your intentions i left our     countinghouse and followed you  i know the purport of your     journey—that journey shall never be completed      ‘i have no friend here just now on whose secrecy i can rely  this     shall be no obstacle to my revenge  neither shall emily brown be     exposed to the mercenary solicitations of a scoundrel odious in her     eyes and contemptible in everybody else’s nor will i tamely submit     to the clandestine attacks of a base umbrellamaker      ‘sir  from great winglebury church a footpath leads through four     meadows to a retired spot known to the townspeople as stiffun’s     acre’  mr trott shuddered  ‘i shall be waiting there alone at     twenty minutes before six o’clock tomorrow morning  should i be     disappointed in seeing you there i will do myself the pleasure of     calling with a horsewhip                                                             ‘horace hunter      ‘ps  there is a gunsmiths in the highstreet and they won’t sell     gunpowder after dark—you understand me      ‘pps  you had better not order your breakfast in the morning until     you have met me  it may be an unnecessary expense’  ‘desperateminded villain  i knew how it would be’ ejaculated the terrified trott  ‘i always told father that once start me on this expedition and hunter would pursue me like the wandering jew  it’s bad enough as it is to marry with the old people’s commands and without the girl’s consent but what will emily think of me if i go down there breathless with running away from this infernal salamander  what shall i do  what can i do  if i go back to the city i’m disgraced for ever—lose the girl—and what’s more lose the money too  even if i did go on to the browns’ by the coach hunter would be after me in a postchaise and if i go to this place this stiffun’s acre another shudder i’m as good as dead  i’ve seen him hit the man at the pallmall shootinggallery in the second buttonhole of the waistcoat five times out of every six and when he didn’t hit him there he hit him in the head’  with this consolatory reminiscence mr alexander trott again ejaculated ‘what shall i do’  long and weary were his reflections as burying his face in his hand he sat ruminating on the best course to be pursued  his mental directionpost pointed to london  he thought of the ‘governor’s’ anger and the loss of the fortune which the paternal brown had promised the paternal trott his daughter should contribute to the coffers of his son then the words ‘to brown’s’ were legibly inscribed on the said directionpost but horace hunter’s denunciation rung in his ears—last of all it bore in red letters the words ‘to stiffun’s acre’ and then mr alexander trott decided on adopting a plan which he presently matured  first and foremost he despatched the underboots to the blue lion and stomachwarmer with a gentlemanly note to mr horace hunter intimating that he thirsted for his destruction and would do himself the pleasure of slaughtering him next morning without fail  he then wrote another letter and requested the attendance of the other boots—for they kept a pair  a modest knock at the room door was heard  ‘come in’ said mr trott  a man thrust in a red head with one eye in it and being again desired to ‘come in’ brought in the body and the legs to which the head belonged and a fur cap which belonged to the head  ‘you are the upperboots i think’ inquired mr trott  ‘yes i am the upperboots’ replied a voice from inside a velveteen case with motherofpearl buttons—‘that is i’m the boots as b’longs to the house the other man’s my man as goes errands and does odd jobs topboots and halfboots i calls us’  ‘you’re from london’ inquired mr trott  ‘driv a cab once’ was the laconic reply  ‘why don’t you drive it now’ asked mr trott  ‘overdriv the cab and driv over a ’ooman’ replied the topboots with brevity  ‘do you know the mayor’s house’ inquired mr trott  ‘rather’ replied the boots significantly as if he had some good reason to remember it  ‘do you think you could manage to leave a letter there’ interrogated trott  ‘shouldn’t wonder’ responded boots  ‘but this letter’ said trott holding a deformed note with a paralytic direction in one hand and five shillings in the other—‘this letter is anonymous’  ‘a—what’ interrupted the boots  ‘anonymous—he’s not to know who it comes from’  ‘oh  i see’ responded the reg’lar with a knowing wink but without evincing the slightest disinclination to undertake the charge—‘i see—bit o’ sving eh’ and his one eye wandered round the room as if in quest of a dark lantern and phosphorusbox  ‘but i say’ he continued recalling the eye from its search and bringing it to bear on mr trott  ‘i say he’s a lawyer our mayor and insured in the county  if you’ve a spite agen him you’d better not burn his house down—blessed if i don’t think it would be the greatest favour you could do him’  and he chuckled inwardly  if mr alexander trott had been in any other situation his first act would have been to kick the man downstairs by deputy or in other words to ring the bell and desire the landlord to take his boots off he contented himself however with doubling the fee and explaining that the letter merely related to a breach of the peace  the topboots retired solemnly pledged to secrecy and mr alexander trott sat down to a fried sole maintenon cutlet madeira and sundries with greater composure than he had experienced since the receipt of horace hunter’s letter of defiance  the lady who alighted from the london coach had no sooner been installed in number twentyfive and made some alteration in her travellingdress than she indited a note to joseph overton esquire solicitor and mayor of great winglebury requesting his immediate attendance on private business of paramount importance—a summons which that worthy functionary lost no time in obeying for after sundry openings of his eyes divers ejaculations of ‘bless me’ and other manifestations of surprise he took his broadbrimmed hat from its accustomed peg in his little front office and walked briskly down the highstreet to the winglebury arms through the hall and up the staircase of which establishment he was ushered by the landlady and a crowd of officious waiters to the door of number twentyfive  ‘show the gentleman in’ said the stranger lady in reply to the foremost waiter’s announcement  the gentleman was shown in accordingly  the lady rose from the sofa the mayor advanced a step from the door and there they both paused for a minute or two looking at one another as if by mutual consent  the mayor saw before him a buxom richlydressed female of about forty the lady looked upon a sleek man about ten years older in drab shorts and continuations black coat neckcloth and gloves  ‘miss julia manners’ exclaimed the mayor at length ‘you astonish me’  ‘that’s very unfair of you overton’ replied miss julia ‘for i have known you long enough not to be surprised at anything you do and you might extend equal courtesy to me’  ‘but to run away—actually run away—with a young man’ remonstrated the mayor  ‘you wouldn’t have me actually run away with an old one i presume’ was the cool rejoinder  ‘and then to ask me—me—of all people in the world—a man of my age and appearance—mayor of the town—to promote such a scheme’ pettishly ejaculated joseph overton throwing himself into an armchair and producing miss julia’s letter from his pocket as if to corroborate the assertion that he had been asked  ‘now overton’ replied the lady ‘i want your assistance in this matter and i must have it  in the lifetime of that poor old dear mr cornberry who—who—’  ‘who was to have married you and didn’t because he died first and who left you his property unencumbered with the addition of himself’ suggested the mayor  ‘well’ replied miss julia reddening slightly ‘in the lifetime of the poor old dear the property had the incumbrance of your management and all i will say of that is that i only wonder it didn’t die of consumption instead of its master  you helped yourself then—help me now’  mr joseph overton was a man of the world and an attorney and as certain indistinct recollections of an odd thousand pounds or two appropriated by mistake passed across his mind he hemmed deprecatingly smiled blandly remained silent for a few seconds and finally inquired ‘what do you wish me to do’  ‘i’ll tell you’ replied miss julia—‘i’ll tell you in three words  dear lord peter—’  ‘that’s the young man i suppose—’ interrupted the mayor  ‘that’s the young nobleman’ replied the lady with a great stress on the last word  ‘dear lord peter is considerably afraid of the resentment of his family and we have therefore thought it better to make the match a stolen one  he left town to avoid suspicion on a visit to his friend the honourable augustus flair whose seat as you know is about thirty miles from this accompanied only by his favourite tiger  we arranged that i should come here alone in the london coach and that he leaving his tiger and cab behind him should come on and arrive here as soon as possible this afternoon’  ‘very well’ observed joseph overton ‘and then he can order the chaise and you can go on to gretna green together without requiring the presence or interference of a third party can’t you’  ‘no’ replied miss julia  ‘we have every reason to believe—dear lord peter not being considered very prudent or sagacious by his friends and they having discovered his attachment to me—that immediately on his absence being observed pursuit will be made in this direction—to elude which and to prevent our being traced i wish it to be understood in this house that dear lord peter is slightly deranged though perfectly harmless and that i am unknown to him awaiting his arrival to convey him in a postchaise to a private asylum—at berwick say  if i don’t show myself much i dare say i can manage to pass for his mother’  the thought occurred to the mayor’s mind that the lady might show herself a good deal without fear of detection seeing that she was about double the age of her intended husband  he said nothing however and the lady proceeded  ‘with the whole of this arrangement dear lord peter is acquainted and all i want you to do is to make the delusion more complete by giving it the sanction of your influence in this place and assigning this as a reason to the people of the house for my taking the young gentleman away as it would not be consistent with the story that i should see him until after he has entered the chaise i also wish you to communicate with him and inform him that it is all going on well’  ‘has he arrived’ inquired overton  ‘i don’t know’ replied the lady  ‘then how am i to know’ inquired the mayor  ‘of course he will not give his own name at the bar’  ‘i begged him immediately on his arrival to write you a note’ replied miss manners ‘and to prevent the possibility of our project being discovered through its means i desired him to write anonymously and in mysterious terms to acquaint you with the number of his room’  ‘bless me’ exclaimed the mayor rising from his seat and searching his pockets—‘most extraordinary circumstance—he has arrived—mysterious note left at my house in a most mysterious manner just before yours—didn’t know what to make of it before and certainly shouldn’t have attended to it—oh here it is’  and joseph overton pulled out of an inner coatpocket the identical letter penned by alexander trott  ‘is this his lordship’s hand’  ‘oh yes’ replied julia ‘good punctual creature  i have not seen it more than once or twice but i know he writes very badly and very large these dear wild young noblemen you know overton—’  ‘ay ay i see’ replied the mayor—‘horses and dogs play and wine—grooms actresses and cigars—the stable the greenroom the saloon and the tavern and the legislative assembly at last’  ‘here’s what he says’ pursued the mayor ‘“sir—a young gentleman in number nineteen at the winglebury arms is bent on committing a rash act tomorrow morning at an early hour”  that’s good—he means marrying “if you have any regard for the peace of this town or the preservation of one—it may be two—human lives”—what the deuce does he mean by that’  ‘that he’s so anxious for the ceremony he will expire if it’s put off and that i may possibly do the same’ replied the lady with great complacency  ‘oh  i see—not much fear of that—well—“two human lives you will cause him to be removed tonight”  he wants to start at once  “fear not to do this on your responsibility for tomorrow the absolute necessity of the proceeding will be but too apparent  remember number nineteen  the name is trott  no delay for life and death depend upon your promptitude”  passionate language certainly  shall i see him’  ‘do’ replied miss julia ‘and entreat him to act his part well  i am half afraid of him  tell him to be cautious’  ‘i will’ said the mayor  ‘settle all the arrangements’  ‘i will’ said the mayor again  ‘and say i think the chaise had better be ordered for one o’clock’  ‘very well’ said the mayor once more and ruminating on the absurdity of the situation in which fate and old acquaintance had placed him he desired a waiter to herald his approach to the temporary representative of number nineteen  the announcement ‘gentleman to speak with you sir’ induced mr trott to pause halfway in the glass of port the contents of which he was in the act of imbibing at the moment to rise from his chair and retreat a few paces towards the window as if to secure a retreat in the event of the visitor assuming the form and appearance of horace hunter  one glance at joseph overton however quieted his apprehensions  he courteously motioned the stranger to a seat  the waiter after a little jingling with the decanter and glasses consented to leave the room and joseph overton placing the broadbrimmed hat on the chair next him and bending his body gently forward opened the business by saying in a very low and cautious tone  ‘my lord—’  ‘eh’ said mr alexander trott in a loud key with the vacant and mystified stare of a chilly somnambulist  ‘hush—hush’ said the cautious attorney ‘to be sure—quite right—no titles here—my name is overton sir’  ‘overton’  ‘yes the mayor of this place—you sent me a letter with anonymous information this afternoon’  ‘i sir’ exclaimed trott with illdissembled surprise for coward as he was he would willingly have repudiated the authorship of the letter in question  ‘i sir’  ‘yes you sir did you not’ responded overton annoyed with what he supposed to be an extreme degree of unnecessary suspicion  ‘either this letter is yours or it is not  if it be we can converse securely upon the subject at once  if it be not of course i have no more to say’  ‘stay stay’ said trott ‘it is mine i did write it  what could i do sir  i had no friend here’  ‘to be sure to be sure’ said the mayor encouragingly ‘you could not have managed it better  well sir it will be necessary for you to leave here tonight in a postchaise and four  and the harder the boys drive the better  you are not safe from pursuit’  ‘bless me’ exclaimed trott in an agony of apprehension ‘can such things happen in a country like this  such unrelenting and coldblooded hostility’  he wiped off the concentrated essence of cowardice that was oozing fast down his forehead and looked aghast at joseph overton  ‘it certainly is a very hard case’ replied the mayor with a smile ‘that in a free country people can’t marry whom they like without being hunted down as if they were criminals  however in the present instance the lady is willing you know and that’s the main point after all’  ‘lady willing’ repeated trott mechanically  ‘how do you know the lady’s willing’  ‘come that’s a good one’ said the mayor benevolently tapping mr trott on the arm with his broadbrimmed hat ‘i have known her well for a long time and if anybody could entertain the remotest doubt on the subject i assure you i have none nor need you have’  ‘dear me’ said mr trott ruminating  ‘this is very extraordinary’  ‘well lord peter’ said the mayor rising  ‘lord peter’ repeated mr trott  ‘oh—ah i forgot  mr trott then—trott—very good ha ha—well sir the chaise shall be ready at halfpast twelve’  ‘and what is to become of me until then’ inquired mr trott anxiously ‘wouldn’t it save appearances if i were placed under some restraint’  ‘ah’ replied overton ‘very good thought—capital idea indeed  i’ll send somebody up directly  and if you make a little resistance when we put you in the chaise it wouldn’t be amiss—look as if you didn’t want to be taken away you know’  ‘to be sure’ said trott—‘to be sure’  ‘well my lord’ said overton in a low tone ‘until then i wish your lordship a good evening’  ‘lord—lordship’ ejaculated trott again falling back a step or two and gazing in unutterable wonder on the countenance of the mayor  ‘haha  i see my lord—practising the madman—very good indeed—very vacant look—capital my lord capital—good evening mr—trott—ha ha ha’  ‘that mayor’s decidedly drunk’ soliloquised mr trott throwing himself back in his chair in an attitude of reflection  ‘he is a much cleverer fellow than i thought him that young nobleman—he carries it off uncommonly well’ thought overton as he went his way to the bar there to complete his arrangements  this was soon done  every word of the story was implicitly believed and the oneeyed boots was immediately instructed to repair to number nineteen to act as custodian of the person of the supposed lunatic until halfpast twelve o’clock  in pursuance of this direction that somewhat eccentric gentleman armed himself with a walkingstick of gigantic dimensions and repaired with his usual equanimity of manner to mr trott’s apartment which he entered without any ceremony and mounted guard in by quietly depositing himself on a chair near the door where he proceeded to beguile the time by whistling a popular air with great apparent satisfaction  ‘what do you want here you scoundrel’ exclaimed mr alexander trott with a proper appearance of indignation at his detention  the boots beat time with his head as he looked gently round at mr trott with a smile of pity and whistled an adagio movement  ‘do you attend in this room by mr overton’s desire’ inquired trott rather astonished at the man’s demeanour  ‘keep yourself to yourself young feller’ calmly responded the boots ‘and don’t say nothing to nobody’  and he whistled again  ‘now mind’ ejaculated mr trott anxious to keep up the farce of wishing with great earnestness to fight a duel if they’d let him  ‘i protest against being kept here  i deny that i have any intention of fighting with anybody  but as it’s useless contending with superior numbers i shall sit quietly down’  ‘you’d better’ observed the placid boots shaking the large stick expressively  ‘under protest however’ added alexander trott seating himself with indignation in his face but great content in his heart  ‘under protest’  ‘oh certainly’ responded the boots ‘anything you please  if you’re happy i’m transported only don’t talk too much—it’ll make you worse’  ‘make me worse’ exclaimed trott in unfeigned astonishment ‘the man’s drunk’  ‘you’d better be quiet young feller’ remarked the boots going through a threatening piece of pantomime with the stick  ‘or mad’ said mr trott rather alarmed  ‘leave the room sir and tell them to send somebody else’  ‘won’t do’ replied the boots  ‘leave the room’ shouted trott ringing the bell violently for he began to be alarmed on a new score  ‘leave that ’ere bell alone you wretched loonattic’ said the boots suddenly forcing the unfortunate trott back into his chair and brandishing the stick aloft  ‘be quiet you miserable object and don’t let everybody know there’s a madman in the house’  ‘he is a madman  he is a madman’ exclaimed the terrified mr trott gazing on the one eye of the redheaded boots with a look of abject horror  ‘madman’ replied the boots ‘dam’me i think he is a madman with a vengeance  listen to me you unfortunate  ah would you’ a slight tap on the head with the large stick as mr trott made another move towards the bellhandle ‘i caught you there did i’  ‘spare my life’ exclaimed trott raising his hands imploringly  ‘i don’t want your life’ replied the boots disdainfully ‘though i think it ’ud be a charity if somebody took it’  ‘no no it wouldn’t’ interrupted poor mr trott hurriedly ‘no no it wouldn’t  i—i’d rather keep it’  ‘o werry well’ said the boots ‘that’s a mere matter of taste—ev’ry one to his liking  hows’ever all i’ve got to say is this here you sit quietly down in that chair and i’ll sit hoppersite you here and if you keep quiet and don’t stir i won’t damage you but if you move hand or foot till halfpast twelve o’clock i shall alter the expression of your countenance so completely that the next time you look in the glass you’ll ask vether you’re gone out of town and ven you’re likely to come back again  so sit down’  ‘i will—i will’ responded the victim of mistakes and down sat mr trott and down sat the boots too exactly opposite him with the stick ready for immediate action in case of emergency  long and dreary were the hours that followed  the bell of great winglebury church had just struck ten and two hours and a half would probably elapse before succour arrived  for half an hour the noise occasioned by shutting up the shops in the street beneath betokened something like life in the town and rendered mr trott’s situation a little less insupportable but when even these ceased and nothing was heard beyond the occasional rattling of a postchaise as it drove up the yard to change horses and then drove away again or the clattering of horses’ hoofs in the stables behind it became almost unbearable  the boots occasionally moved an inch or two to knock superfluous bits of wax off the candles which were burning low but instantaneously resumed his former position and as he remembered to have heard somewhere or other that the human eye had an unfailing effect in controlling mad people he kept his solitary organ of vision constantly fixed on mr alexander trott  that unfortunate individual stared at his companion in his turn until his features grew more and more indistinct—his hair gradually less red—and the room more misty and obscure  mr alexander trott fell into a sound sleep from which he was awakened by a rumbling in the street and a cry of ‘chaiseandfour for number twentyfive’  a bustle on the stairs succeeded the room door was hastily thrown open and mr joseph overton entered followed by four stout waiters and mrs williamson the stout landlady of the winglebury arms  ‘mr overton’ exclaimed mr alexander trott jumping up in a frenzy ‘look at this man sir consider the situation in which i have been placed for three hours past—the person you sent to guard me sir was a madman—a madman—a raging ravaging furious madman’  ‘bravo’ whispered mr overton  ‘poor dear’ said the compassionate mrs williamson ‘mad people always thinks other people’s mad’  ‘poor dear’ ejaculated mr alexander trott  ‘what the devil do you mean by poor dear  are you the landlady of this house’  ‘yes yes’ replied the stout old lady ‘don’t exert yourself there’s a dear  consider your health now do’  ‘exert myself’ shouted mr alexander trott ‘it’s a mercy ma’am that i have any breath to exert myself with  i might have been assassinated three hours ago by that oneeyed monster with the oakum head  how dare you have a madman ma’am—how dare you have a madman to assault and terrify the visitors to your house’  ‘i’ll never have another’ said mrs williamson casting a look of reproach at the mayor  ‘capital capital’ whispered overton again as he enveloped mr alexander trott in a thick travellingcloak  ‘capital sir’ exclaimed trott aloud ‘it’s horrible  the very recollection makes me shudder  i’d rather fight four duels in three hours if i survived the first three than i’d sit for that time face to face with a madman’  ‘keep it up my lord as you go downstairs’ whispered overton ‘your bill is paid and your portmanteau in the chaise’  and then he added aloud ‘now waiters the gentleman’s ready’  at this signal the waiters crowded round mr alexander trott  one took one arm another the other a third walked before with a candle the fourth behind with another candle the boots and mrs williamson brought up the rear and downstairs they went mr alexander trott expressing alternately at the very top of his voice either his feigned reluctance to go or his unfeigned indignation at being shut up with a madman  mr overton was waiting at the chaisedoor the boys were ready mounted and a few ostlers and stable nondescripts were standing round to witness the departure of ‘the mad gentleman’  mr alexander trott’s foot was on the step when he observed which the dim light had prevented his doing before a figure seated in the chaise closely muffled up in a cloak like his own  ‘who’s that’ he inquired of overton in a whisper  ‘hush hush’ replied the mayor ‘the other party of course’  ‘the other party’ exclaimed trott with an effort to retreat  ‘yes yes you’ll soon find that out before you go far i should think—but make a noise you’ll excite suspicion if you whisper to me so much’  ‘i won’t go in this chaise’ shouted mr alexander trott all his original fears recurring with tenfold violence  ‘i shall be assassinated—i shall be—’  ‘bravo bravo’ whispered overton  ‘i’ll push you in’  ‘but i won’t go’ exclaimed mr trott  ‘help here help  they’re carrying me away against my will  this is a plot to murder me’  ‘poor dear’ said mrs williamson again  ‘now boys put ’em along’ cried the mayor pushing trott in and slamming the door  ‘off with you as quick as you can and stop for nothing till you come to the next stage—all right’  ‘horses are paid tom’ screamed mrs williamson and away went the chaise at the rate of fourteen miles an hour with mr alexander trott and miss julia manners carefully shut up in the inside  mr alexander trott remained coiled up in one corner of the chaise and his mysterious companion in the other for the first two or three miles mr trott edging more and more into his corner as he felt his companion gradually edging more and more from hers and vainly endeavouring in the darkness to catch a glimpse of the furious face of the supposed horace hunter  ‘we may speak now’ said his fellowtraveller at length ‘the postboys can neither see nor hear us’  ‘that’s not hunter’s voice’—thought alexander astonished  ‘dear lord peter’ said miss julia most winningly putting her arm on mr trott’s shoulder  ‘dear lord peter  not a word’  ‘why it’s a woman’ exclaimed mr trott in a low tone of excessive wonder  ‘ah  whose voice is that’ said julia ‘’tis not lord peter’s’  ‘no—it’s mine’ replied mr trott  ‘yours’ ejaculated miss julia manners ‘a strange man  gracious heaven how came you here’  ‘whoever you are you might have known that i came against my will ma’am’ replied alexander ‘for i made noise enough when i got in’  ‘do you come from lord peter’ inquired miss manners  ‘confound lord peter’ replied trott pettishly  ‘i don’t know any lord peter  i never heard of him before tonight when i’ve been lord peter’d by one and lord peter’d by another till i verily believe i’m mad or dreaming—’  ‘whither are we going’ inquired the lady tragically  ‘how should i know ma’am’ replied trott with singular coolness for the events of the evening had completely hardened him  ‘stop stop’ cried the lady letting down the front glasses of the chaise  ‘stay my dear ma’am’ said mr trott pulling the glasses up again with one hand and gently squeezing miss julia’s waist with the other  ‘there is some mistake here give me till the end of this stage to explain my share of it  we must go so far you cannot be set down here alone at this hour of the night’  the lady consented the mistake was mutually explained  mr trott was a young man had highly promising whiskers an undeniable tailor and an insinuating address—he wanted nothing but valour and who wants that with three thousand ayear  the lady had this and more she wanted a young husband and the only course open to mr trott to retrieve his disgrace was a rich wife  so they came to the conclusion that it would be a pity to have all this trouble and expense for nothing and that as they were so far on the road already they had better go to gretna green and marry each other and they did so  and the very next preceding entry in the blacksmith’s book was an entry of the marriage of emily brown with horace hunter  mr hunter took his wife home and begged pardon and was pardoned and mr trott took his wife home begged pardon too and was pardoned also  and lord peter who had been detained beyond his time by drinking champagne and riding a steeplechase went back to the honourable augustus flair’s and drank more champagne and rode another steeplechase and was thrown and killed  and horace hunter took great credit to himself for practising on the cowardice of alexander trott and all these circumstances were discovered in time and carefully noted down and if you ever stop a week at the winglebury arms they will give you just this account of the great winglebury duel    chapter ix—mrs joseph porter   most extensive were the preparations at rose villa clapham rise in the occupation of mr gattleton a stockbroker in especially comfortable circumstances and great was the anxiety of mr gattleton’s interesting family as the day fixed for the representation of the private play which had been ‘many months in preparation’ approached  the whole family was infected with the mania for private theatricals the house usually so clean and tidy was to use mr gattleton’s expressive description ‘regularly turned out o’ windows’ the large diningroom dismantled of its furniture and ornaments presented a strange jumble of flats flies wings lamps bridges clouds thunder and lightning festoons and flowers daggers and foil and various other messes in theatrical slang included under the comprehensive name of ‘properties’  the bedrooms were crowded with scenery the kitchen was occupied by carpenters  rehearsals took place every other night in the drawingroom and every sofa in the house was more or less damaged by the perseverance and spirit with which mr sempronius gattleton and miss lucina rehearsed the smothering scene in ‘othello’—it having been determined that that tragedy should form the first portion of the evening’s entertainments  ‘when we’re a leetle more perfect i think it will go admirably’ said mr sempronius addressing his corps dramatique at the conclusion of the hundred and fiftieth rehearsal  in consideration of his sustaining the trifling inconvenience of bearing all the expenses of the play mr sempronius had been in the most handsome manner unanimously elected stagemanager  ‘evans’ continued mr gattleton the younger addressing a tall thin pale young gentleman with extensive whiskers—‘evans you play roderigo beautifully’  ‘beautifully’ echoed the three miss gattletons for mr evans was pronounced by all his lady friends to be ‘quite a dear’  he looked so interesting and had such lovely whiskers to say nothing of his talent for writing verses in albums and playing the flute  roderigo simpered and bowed  ‘but i think’ added the manager ‘you are hardly perfect in the—fall—in the fencingscene where you are—you understand’  ‘it’s very difficult’ said mr evans thoughtfully ‘i’ve fallen about a good deal in our countinghouse lately for practice only i find it hurts one so  being obliged to fall backward you see it bruises one’s head a good deal’  ‘but you must take care you don’t knock a wing down’ said mr gattleton the elder who had been appointed prompter and who took as much interest in the play as the youngest of the company  ‘the stage is very narrow you know’  ‘oh don’t be afraid’ said mr evans with a very selfsatisfied air ‘i shall fall with my head “off” and then i can’t do any harm’  ‘but egad’ said the manager rubbing his hands ‘we shall make a decided hit in “masaniello”  harleigh sings that music admirably’  everybody echoed the sentiment  mr harleigh smiled and looked foolish—not an unusual thing with him—hummed’  behold how brightly breaks the morning’ and blushed as red as the fisherman’s nightcap he was trying on  ‘let’s see’ resumed the manager telling the number on his fingers ‘we shall have three dancing female peasants besides fenella and four fishermen  then there’s our man tom he can have a pair of ducks of mine and a check shirt of bob’s and a red nightcap and he’ll do for another—that’s five  in the choruses of course we can sing at the sides and in the marketscene we can walk about in cloaks and things when the revolt takes place tom must keep rushing in on one side and out on the other with a pickaxe as fast as he can  the effect will be electrical it will look exactly as if there were an immense number of ’em  and in the eruptionscene we must burn the red fire and upset the teatrays and make all sorts of noises—and it’s sure to do’  ‘sure sure’ cried all the performers unâ voce—and away hurried mr sempronius gattleton to wash the burnt cork off his face and superintend the ‘setting up’ of some of the amateurpainted but neversufficientlytobeadmired scenery  mrs gattleton was a kind goodtempered vulgar soul exceedingly fond of her husband and children and entertaining only three dislikes  in the first place she had a natural antipathy to anybody else’s unmarried daughters in the second she was in bodily fear of anything in the shape of ridicule lastly—almost a necessary consequence of this feeling—she regarded with feelings of the utmost horror one mrs joseph porter over the way  however the good folks of clapham and its vicinity stood very much in awe of scandal and sarcasm and thus mrs joseph porter was courted and flattered and caressed and invited for much the same reason that induces a poor author without a farthing in his pocket to behave with extraordinary civility to a twopenny postman  ‘never mind ma’ said miss emma porter in colloquy with her respected relative and trying to look unconcerned ‘if they had invited me you know that neither you nor pa would have allowed me to take part in such an exhibition’  ‘just what i should have thought from your high sense of propriety’ returned the mother  ‘i am glad to see emma you know how to designate the proceeding’  miss p bythebye had only the week before made ‘an exhibition’ of herself for four days behind a counter at a fancy fair to all and every of her majesty’s liege subjects who were disposed to pay a shilling each for the privilege of seeing some four dozen girls flirting with strangers and playing at shop  ‘there’ said mrs porter looking out of window ‘there are two rounds of beef and a ham going in—clearly for sandwiches and thomas the pastrycook says there have been twelve dozen tarts ordered besides blancmange and jellies  upon my word think of the miss gattletons in fancy dresses too’  ‘oh it’s too ridiculous’ said miss porter hysterically  ‘i’ll manage to put them a little out of conceit with the business however’ said mrs porter and out she went on her charitable errand  ‘well my dear mrs gattleton’ said mrs joseph porter after they had been closeted for some time and when by dint of indefatigable pumping she had managed to extract all the news about the play ‘well my dear people may say what they please indeed we know they will for some folks are so illnatured  ah my dear miss lucina how d’ye do  i was just telling your mamma that i have heard it said that—’  ‘what’  ‘mrs porter is alluding to the play my dear’ said mrs gattleton ‘she was i am sorry to say just informing me that—’  ‘oh now pray don’t mention it’ interrupted mrs porter ‘it’s most absurd—quite as absurd as young what’shisname saying he wondered how miss caroline with such a foot and ankle could have the vanity to play fenella’  ‘highly impertinent whoever said it’ said mrs gattleton bridling up  ‘certainly my dear’ chimed in the delighted mrs porter ‘most undoubtedly  because as i said if miss caroline does play fenella it doesn’t follow as a matter of course that she should think she has a pretty foot—and then—such puppies as these young men are—he had the impudence to say that—’  how far the amiable mrs porter might have succeeded in her pleasant purpose it is impossible to say had not the entrance of mr thomas balderstone mrs gattleton’s brother familiarly called in the family ‘uncle tom’ changed the course of conversation and suggested to her mind an excellent plan of operation on the evening of the play  uncle tom was very rich and exceedingly fond of his nephews and nieces as a matter of course therefore he was an object of great importance in his own family  he was one of the besthearted men in existence always in a good temper and always talking  it was his boast that he wore topboots on all occasions and had never worn a black silk neckerchief and it was his pride that he remembered all the principal plays of shakspeare from beginning to end—and so he did  the result of this parrotlike accomplishment was that he was not only perpetually quoting himself but that he could never sit by and hear a misquotation from the ‘swan of avon’ without setting the unfortunate delinquent right  he was also something of a wag never missed an opportunity of saying what he considered a good thing and invariably laughed until he cried at anything that appeared to him mirthmoving or ridiculous  ‘well girls’ said uncle tom after the preparatory ceremony of kissing and howd’yedoing had been gone through—‘how d’ye get on  know your parts eh—lucina my dear act ii scene i—place leftcue—“unknown fate”—what’s next eh—go on—“the heavens—”’  ‘oh yes’ said miss lucina ‘i recollect—                  “the heavens forbid     but that our loves and comforts should increase     even as our days do grow”’  ‘make a pause here and there’ said the old gentleman who was a great critic  ‘“but that our loves and comforts should increase”—emphasis on the last syllable “crease”—loud “even”—one two three four then loud again “as our days do grow” emphasis on days  that’s the way my dear trust to your uncle for emphasis  ah  sem my boy how are you’  ‘very well thankee uncle’ returned mr sempronius who had just appeared looking something like a ringdove with a small circle round each eye the result of his constant corking  ‘of course we see you on thursday’  ‘of course of course my dear boy’  ‘what a pity it is your nephew didn’t think of making you prompter mr balderstone’ whispered mrs joseph porter ‘you would have been invaluable’  ‘well i flatter myself i should have been tolerably up to the thing’ responded uncle tom  ‘i must bespeak sitting next you on the night’ resumed mrs porter ‘and then if our dear young friends here should be at all wrong you will be able to enlighten me  i shall be so interested’  ‘i am sure i shall be most happy to give you any assistance in my power’  ‘mind it’s a bargain’  ‘certainly’  ‘i don’t know how it is’ said mrs gattleton to her daughters as they were sitting round the fire in the evening looking over their parts ‘but i really very much wish mrs joseph porter wasn’t coming on thursday  i am sure she’s scheming something’  ‘she can’t make us ridiculous however’ observed mr sempronius gattleton haughtily  the longlookedfor thursday arrived in due course and brought with it as mr gattleton senior philosophically observed ‘no disappointments to speak of’  true it was yet a matter of doubt whether cassio would be enabled to get into the dress which had been sent for him from the masquerade warehouse  it was equally uncertain whether the principal female singer would be sufficiently recovered from the influenza to make her appearance mr harleigh the masaniello of the night was hoarse and rather unwell in consequence of the great quantity of lemon and sugarcandy he had eaten to improve his voice and two flutes and a violoncello had pleaded severe colds  what of that the audience were all coming  everybody knew his part the dresses were covered with tinsel and spangles the white plumes looked beautiful mr evans had practised falling until he was bruised from head to foot and quite perfect iago was sure that in the stabbingscene he should make ‘a decided hit’  a selftaught deaf gentleman who had kindly offered to bring his flute would be a most valuable addition to the orchestra miss jenkins’s talent for the piano was too well known to be doubted for an instant mr cape had practised the violin accompaniment with her frequently and mr brown who had kindly undertaken at a few hours’ notice to bring his violoncello would no doubt manage extremely well  seven o’clock came and so did the audience all the rank and fashion of clapham and its vicinity was fast filling the theatre  there were the smiths the gubbinses the nixons the dixons the hicksons people with all sorts of names two aldermen a sheriff in perspective sir thomas glumper who had been knighted in the last reign for carrying up an address on somebody’s escaping from nothing and last not least there were mrs joseph porter and uncle tom seated in the centre of the third row from the stage mrs p amusing uncle tom with all sorts of stories and uncle tom amusing every one else by laughing most immoderately  ting ting ting went the prompter’s bell at eight o’clock precisely and dash went the orchestra into the overture to ‘the men of prometheus’ the pianoforte player hammered away with laudable perseverance and the violoncello which struck in at intervals ‘sounded very well considering’  the unfortunate individual however who had undertaken to play the flute accompaniment ‘at sight’ found from fatal experience the perfect truth of the old adage ‘ought of sight out of mind’ for being very nearsighted and being placed at a considerable distance from his musicbook all he had an opportunity of doing was to play a bar now and then in the wrong place and put the other performers out  it is however but justice to mr brown to say that he did this to admiration the overture in fact was not unlike a race between the different instruments the piano came in first by several bars and the violoncello next quite distancing the poor flute for the deaf gentleman tootoo’d away quite unconscious that he was at all wrong until apprised by the applause of the audience that the overture was concluded  a considerable bustle and shuffling of feet was then heard upon the stage accompanied by whispers of ‘here’s a pretty go—what’s to be done’ c the audience applauded again by way of raising the spirits of the performers and then mr sempronius desired the prompter in a very audible voice to ‘clear the stage and ring up’  ting ting ting went the bell again  everybody sat down the curtain shook rose sufficiently high to display several pair of yellow boots paddling about and there remained  ting ting ting went the bell again  the curtain was violently convulsed but rose no higher the audience tittered mrs porter looked at uncle tom uncle tom looked at everybody rubbing his hands and laughing with perfect rapture  after as much ringing with the little bell as a muffinboy would make in going down a tolerably long street and a vast deal of whispering hammering and calling for nails and cord the curtain at length rose and discovered mr sempronius gattleton solus and decked for othello  after three distinct rounds of applause during which mr sempronius applied his right hand to his left breast and bowed in the most approved manner the manager advanced and said  ‘ladies and gentlemen—i assure you it is with sincere regret that i regret to be compelled to inform you that iago who was to have played mr wilson—i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen but i am naturally somewhat agitated applause—i mean mr wilson who was to have played iago is—that is has been—or in other words ladies and gentlemen the fact is that i have just received a note in which i am informed that iago is unavoidably detained at the postoffice this evening under these circumstances i trust—a—a—amateur performance—a—another gentleman undertaken to read the part—request indulgence for a short time—courtesy and kindness of a british audience’  overwhelming applause  exit mr sempronius gattleton and curtain falls  the audience were of course exceedingly goodhumoured the whole business was a joke and accordingly they waited for an hour with the utmost patience being enlivened by an interlude of routcakes and lemonade  it appeared by mr sempronius’s subsequent explanation that the delay would not have been so great had it not so happened that when the substitute iago had finished dressing and just as the play was on the point of commencing the original iago unexpectedly arrived  the former was therefore compelled to undress and the latter to dress for his part which as he found some difficulty in getting into his clothes occupied no inconsiderable time  at last the tragedy began in real earnest  it went off well enough until the third scene of the first act in which othello addresses the senate the only remarkable circumstance being that as iago could not get on any of the stage boots in consequence of his feet being violently swelled with the heat and excitement he was under the necessity of playing the part in a pair of wellingtons which contrasted rather oddly with his richly embroidered pantaloons  when othello started with his address to the senate whose dignity was represented by the duke a carpenter two men engaged on the recommendation of the gardener and a boy mrs porter found the opportunity she so anxiously sought  mr sempronius proceeded      ‘“most potent grave and reverend signiors     my very noble and approv’d good masters     that i have ta’en away this old man’s daughter     it is most true—rude am i in my speech—”’  ‘is that right’ whispered mrs porter to uncle tom  ‘no’  ‘tell him so then’  ‘i will  sem’ called out uncle tom ‘that’s wrong my boy’  ‘what’s wrong uncle’ demanded othello quite forgetting the dignity of his situation  ‘you’ve left out something  “true i have married—”’  ‘oh ah’ said mr sempronius endeavouring to hide his confusion as much and as ineffectually as the audience attempted to conceal their halfsuppressed tittering by coughing with extraordinary violence—      —‘“true i have married her—     the very head and front of my offending     hath this extent no more”  aside why don’t you prompt father’  ‘because i’ve mislaid my spectacles’ said poor mr gattleton almost dead with the heat and bustle  ‘there now it’s “rude am i”’ said uncle tom  ‘yes i know it is’ returned the unfortunate manager proceeding with his part  it would be useless and tiresome to quote the number of instances in which uncle tom now completely in his element and instigated by the mischievous mrs porter corrected the mistakes of the performers suffice it to say that having mounted his hobby nothing could induce him to dismount so during the whole remainder of the play he performed a kind of running accompaniment by muttering everybody’s part as it was being delivered in an undertone  the audience were highly amused mrs porter delighted the performers embarrassed uncle tom never was better pleased in all his life and uncle tom’s nephews and nieces had never although the declared heirs to his large property so heartily wished him gathered to his fathers as on that memorable occasion  several other minor causes too united to damp the ardour of the dramatis personae  none of the performers could walk in their tights or move their arms in their jackets the pantaloons were too small the boots too large and the swords of all shapes and sizes  mr evans naturally too tall for the scenery wore a black velvet hat with immense white plumes the glory of which was lost in ‘the flies’ and the only other inconvenience of which was that when it was off his head he could not put it on and when it was on he could not take it off notwithstanding all his practice too he fell with his head and shoulders as neatly through one of the side scenes as a harlequin would jump through a panel in a christmas pantomime  the pianoforte player overpowered by the extreme heat of the room fainted away at the commencement of the entertainments leaving the music of ‘masaniello’ to the flute and violoncello  the orchestra complained that mr harleigh put them out and mr harleigh declared that the orchestra prevented his singing a note  the fishermen who were hired for the occasion revolted to the very life positively refusing to play without an increased allowance of spirits and their demand being complied with getting drunk in the eruptionscene as naturally as possible  the red fire which was burnt at the conclusion of the second act not only nearly suffocated the audience but nearly set the house on fire into the bargain and as it was the remainder of the piece was acted in a thick fog  in short the whole affair was as mrs joseph porter triumphantly told everybody ‘a complete failure’  the audience went home at four o’clock in the morning exhausted with laughter suffering from severe headaches and smelling terribly of brimstone and gunpowder  the messrs gattleton senior and junior retired to rest with the vague idea of emigrating to swan river early in the ensuing week  rose villa has once again resumed its wonted appearance the diningroom furniture has been replaced the tables are as nicely polished as formerly the horsehair chairs are ranged against the wall as regularly as ever venetian blinds have been fitted to every window in the house to intercept the prying gaze of mrs joseph porter  the subject of theatricals is never mentioned in the gattleton family unless indeed by uncle tom who cannot refrain from sometimes expressing his surprise and regret at finding that his nephews and nieces appear to have lost the relish they once possessed for the beauties of shakspeare and quotations from the works of that immortal bard    chapter x—a passage in the life of mr watkins tottle   chapter the first   matrimony is proverbially a serious undertaking  like an overweening predilection for brandyandwater it is a misfortune into which a man easily falls and from which he finds it remarkably difficult to extricate himself  it is of no use telling a man who is timorous on these points that it is but one plunge and all is over  they say the same thing at the old bailey and the unfortunate victims derive as much comfort from the assurance in the one case as in the other  mr watkins tottle was a rather uncommon compound of strong uxorious inclinations and an unparalleled degree of anticonnubial timidity  he was about fifty years of age stood four feet six inches and threequarters in his socks—for he never stood in stockings at all—plump clean and rosy  he looked something like a vignette to one of richardson’s novels and had a cleancravatish formality of manner and kitchenpokerness of carriage which sir charles grandison himself might have envied  he lived on an annuity which was well adapted to the individual who received it in one respect—it was rather small  he received it in periodical payments on every alternate monday but he ran himself out about a day after the expiration of the first week as regularly as an eightday clock and then to make the comparison complete his landlady wound him up and he went on with a regular tick  mr watkins tottle had long lived in a state of single blessedness as bachelors say or single cursedness as spinsters think but the idea of matrimony had never ceased to haunt him  wrapt in profound reveries on this neverfailing theme fancy transformed his small parlour in cecilstreet strand into a neat house in the suburbs the halfhundredweight of coals under the kitchenstairs suddenly sprang up into three tons of the best wallsend his small french bedstead was converted into a regular matrimonial fourposter and in the empty chair on the opposite side of the fireplace imagination seated a beautiful young lady with a very little independence or will of her own and a very large independence under a will of her father’s  ‘who’s there’ inquired mr watkins tottle as a gentle tap at his roomdoor disturbed these meditations one evening  ‘tottle my dear fellow how do you do’ said a short elderly gentleman with a gruffish voice bursting into the room and replying to the question by asking another  ‘told you i should drop in some evening’ said the short gentleman as he delivered his hat into tottle’s hand after a little struggling and dodging  ‘delighted to see you i’m sure’ said mr watkins tottle wishing internally that his visitor had ‘dropped in’ to the thames at the bottom of the street instead of dropping into his parlour  the fortnight was nearly up and watkins was hard up  ‘how is mrs gabriel parsons’ inquired tottle  ‘quite well thank you’ replied mr gabriel parsons for that was the name the short gentleman revelled in  here there was a pause the short gentleman looked at the left hob of the fireplace mr watkins tottle stared vacancy out of countenance  ‘quite well’ repeated the short gentleman when five minutes had expired  ‘i may say remarkably well’  and he rubbed the palms of his hands as hard as if he were going to strike a light by friction  ‘what will you take’ inquired tottle with the desperate suddenness of a man who knew that unless the visitor took his leave he stood very little chance of taking anything else  ‘oh i don’t know—have you any whiskey’  ‘why’ replied tottle very slowly for all this was gaining time ‘i had some capital and remarkably strong whiskey last week but it’s all gone—and therefore its strength—’  ‘is much beyond proof or in other words impossible to be proved’ said the short gentleman and he laughed very heartily and seemed quite glad the whiskey had been drunk  mr tottle smiled—but it was the smile of despair  when mr gabriel parsons had done laughing he delicately insinuated that in the absence of whiskey he would not be averse to brandy  and mr watkins tottle lighting a flat candle very ostentatiously and displaying an immense key which belonged to the streetdoor but which for the sake of appearances occasionally did duty in an imaginary winecellar left the room to entreat his landlady to charge their glasses and charge them in the bill  the application was successful the spirits were speedily called—not from the vasty deep but the adjacent winevaults  the two short gentlemen mixed their grog and then sat cosily down before the fire—a pair of shorts airing themselves  ‘tottle’ said mr gabriel parsons ‘you know my way—offhand open say what i mean mean what i say hate reserve and can’t bear affectation one is a bad domino which only hides what good people have about ’em without making the bad look better and the other is much about the same thing as pinking a white cotton stocking to make it look like a silk one now listen to what i’m going to say’  here the little gentleman paused and took a long pull at his brandyandwater  mr watkins tottle took a sip of his stirred the fire and assumed an air of profound attention  ‘it’s of no use humming and ha’ing about the matter’ resumed the short gentleman—‘you want to get married’  ‘why’ replied mr watkins tottle evasively for he trembled violently and felt a sudden tingling throughout his whole frame ‘why—i should certainly—at least i think i should like—’  ‘won’t do’ said the short gentleman—‘plain and free—or there’s an end of the matter  do you want money’  ‘you know i do’  ‘you admire the sex’  ‘i do’  ‘and you’d like to be married’  ‘certainly’  ‘then you shall be  there’s an end of that’  thus saying mr gabriel parsons took a pinch of snuff and mixed another glass  ‘let me entreat you to be more explanatory’ said tottle  ‘really as the party principally interested i cannot consent to be disposed of in this way’  ‘i’ll tell you’ replied mr gabriel parsons warming with the subject and the brandyandwater—‘i know a lady—she’s stopping with my wife now—who is just the thing for you  well educated talks french plays the piano knows a good deal about flowers and shells and all that sort of thing and has five hundred a year with an uncontrolled power of disposing of it by her last will and testament’  ‘i’ll pay my addresses to her’ said mr watkins tottle  ‘she isn’t very young—is she’  ‘not very just the thing for you  i’ve said that already’  ‘what coloured hair has the lady’ inquired mr watkins tottle  ‘egad i hardly recollect’ replied gabriel with coolness  ‘perhaps i ought to have observed at first she wears a front’  ‘a what’ ejaculated tottle  ‘one of those things with curls along here’ said parsons drawing a straight line across his forehead just over his eyes in illustration of his meaning  ‘i know the front’s black i can’t speak quite positively about her own hair because unless one walks behind her and catches a glimpse of it under her bonnet one seldom sees it but i should say that it was rather lighter than the front—a shade of a greyish tinge perhaps’  mr watkins tottle looked as if he had certain misgivings of mind  mr gabriel parsons perceived it and thought it would be safe to begin the next attack without delay  ‘now were you ever in love tottle’ he inquired  mr watkins tottle blushed up to the eyes and down to the chin and exhibited a most extensive combination of colours as he confessed the soft impeachment  ‘i suppose you popped the question more than once when you were a young—i beg your pardon—a younger—man’ said parsons  ‘never in my life’ replied his friend apparently indignant at being suspected of such an act  ‘never  the fact is that i entertain as you know peculiar opinions on these subjects  i am not afraid of ladies young or old—far from it but i think that in compliance with the custom of the present day they allow too much freedom of speech and manner to marriageable men  now the fact is that anything like this easy freedom i never could acquire and as i am always afraid of going too far i am generally i dare say considered formal and cold’  ‘i shouldn’t wonder if you were’ replied parsons gravely ‘i shouldn’t wonder  however you’ll be all right in this case for the strictness and delicacy of this lady’s ideas greatly exceed your own  lord bless you why when she came to our house there was an old portrait of some man or other with two large black staring eyes hanging up in her bedroom she positively refused to go to bed there till it was taken down considering it decidedly wrong’  ‘i think so too’ said mr watkins tottle ‘certainly’  ‘and then the other night—i never laughed so much in my life’—resumed mr gabriel parsons ‘i had driven home in an easterly wind and caught a devil of a faceache  well as fanny—that’s mrs parsons you know—and this friend of hers and i and frank ross were playing a rubber i said jokingly that when i went to bed i should wrap my head in fanny’s flannel petticoat  she instantly threw up her cards and left the room’  ‘quite right’ said mr watkins tottle ‘she could not possibly have behaved in a more dignified manner  what did you do’  ‘do—frank took dummy and i won sixpence’  ‘but didn’t you apologise for hurting her feelings’  ‘devil a bit  next morning at breakfast we talked it over  she contended that any reference to a flannel petticoat was improper—men ought not to be supposed to know that such things were  i pleaded my coverture being a married man’  ‘and what did the lady say to that’ inquired tottle deeply interested  ‘changed her ground and said that frank being a single man its impropriety was obvious’  ‘nobleminded creature’ exclaimed the enraptured tottle  ‘oh both fanny and i said at once that she was regularly cut out for you’  a gleam of placid satisfaction shone on the circular face of mr watkins tottle as he heard the prophecy  ‘there’s one thing i can’t understand’ said mr gabriel parsons as he rose to depart ‘i cannot for the life and soul of me imagine how the deuce you’ll ever contrive to come together  the lady would certainly go into convulsions if the subject were mentioned’  mr gabriel parsons sat down again and laughed until he was weak  tottle owed him money so he had a perfect right to laugh at tottle’s expense  mr watkins tottle feared in his own mind that this was another characteristic which he had in common with this modern lucretia  he however accepted the invitation to dine with the parsonses on the next day but one with great firmness and looked forward to the introduction when again left alone with tolerable composure  the sun that rose on the next day but one had never beheld a sprucer personage on the outside of the norwood stage than mr watkins tottle and when the coach drew up before a cardboardlooking house with disguised chimneys and a lawn like a large sheet of green letterpaper he certainly had never lighted to his place of destination a gentleman who felt more uncomfortable  the coach stopped and mr watkins tottle jumped—we beg his pardon—alighted with great dignity  ‘all right’ said he and away went the coach up the hill with that beautiful equanimity of pace for which ‘short’ stages are generally remarkable  mr watkins tottle gave a faltering jerk to the handle of the gardengate bell  he essayed a more energetic tug and his previous nervousness was not at all diminished by hearing the bell ringing like a fire alarum  ‘is mr parsons at home’ inquired tottle of the man who opened the gate he could hardly hear himself speak for the bell had not yet done tolling  ‘here i am’ shouted a voice on the lawn—and there was mr gabriel parsons in a flannel jacket running backwards and forwards from a wicket to two hats piled on each other and from the two hats to the wicket in the most violent manner while another gentleman with his coat off was getting down the area of the house after a ball  when the gentleman without the coat had found it—which he did in less than ten minutes—he ran back to the hats and gabriel parsons pulled up  then the gentleman without the coat called out ‘play’ very loudly and bowled  then mr gabriel parsons knocked the ball several yards and took another run  then the other gentleman aimed at the wicket and didn’t hit it and mr gabriel parsons having finished running on his own account laid down the bat and ran after the ball which went into a neighbouring field  they called this cricket  ‘tottle will you “go in”’ inquired mr gabriel parsons as he approached him wiping the perspiration off his face  mr watkins tottle declined the offer the bare idea of accepting which made him even warmer than his friend  ‘then we’ll go into the house as it’s past four and i shall have to wash my hands before dinner’ said mr gabriel parsons  ‘here i hate ceremony you know  timson that’s tottle—tottle that’s timson bred for the church which i fear will never be bread for him’ and he chuckled at the old joke  mr timson bowed carelessly  mr watkins tottle bowed stiffly  mr gabriel parsons led the way to the house  he was a rich sugarbaker who mistook rudeness for honesty and abrupt bluntness for an open and candid manner many besides gabriel mistake bluntness for sincerity  mrs gabriel parsons received the visitors most graciously on the steps and preceded them to the drawingroom  on the sofa was seated a lady of very prim appearance and remarkably inanimate  she was one of those persons at whose age it is impossible to make any reasonable guess her features might have been remarkably pretty when she was younger and they might always have presented the same appearance  her complexion—with a slight trace of powder here and there—was as clear as that of a wellmade wax doll and her face as expressive  she was handsomely dressed and was winding up a gold watch  ‘miss lillerton my dear this is our friend mr watkins tottle a very old acquaintance i assure you’ said mrs parsons presenting the strephon of cecilstreet strand  the lady rose and made a deep courtesy mr watkins tottle made a bow  ‘splendid majestic creature’ thought tottle  mr timson advanced and mr watkins tottle began to hate him  men generally discover a rival instinctively and mr watkins tottle felt that his hate was deserved  ‘may i beg’ said the reverend gentleman—‘may i beg to call upon you miss lillerton for some trifling donation to my soup coals and blanket distribution society’  ‘put my name down for two sovereigns if you please’ responded miss lillerton  ‘you are truly charitable madam’ said the reverend mr timson ‘and we know that charity will cover a multitude of sins  let me beg you to understand that i do not say this from the supposition that you have many sins which require palliation believe me when i say that i never yet met any one who had fewer to atone for than miss lillerton’  something like a bad imitation of animation lighted up the lady’s face as she acknowledged the compliment  watkins tottle incurred the sin of wishing that the ashes of the reverend charles timson were quietly deposited in the churchyard of his curacy wherever it might be  ‘i’ll tell you what’ interrupted parsons who had just appeared with clean hands and a black coat ‘it’s my private opinion timson that your “distribution society” is rather a humbug’  ‘you are so severe’ replied timson with a christian smile he disliked parsons but liked his dinners  ‘so positively unjust’ said miss lillerton  ‘certainly’ observed tottle  the lady looked up her eyes met those of mr watkins tottle  she withdrew them in a sweet confusion and watkins tottle did the same—the confusion was mutual  ‘why’ urged mr parsons pursuing his objections ‘what on earth is the use of giving a man coals who has nothing to cook or giving him blankets when he hasn’t a bed or giving him soup when he requires substantial food—“like sending them ruffles when wanting a shirt”  why not give ’em a trifle of money as i do when i think they deserve it and let them purchase what they think best  why—because your subscribers wouldn’t see their names flourishing in print on the churchdoor—that’s the reason’  ‘really mr parsons i hope you don’t mean to insinuate that i wish to see my name in print on the churchdoor’ interrupted miss lillerton  ‘i hope not’ said mr watkins tottle putting in another word and getting another glance  ‘certainly not’ replied parsons  ‘i dare say you wouldn’t mind seeing it in writing though in the church register—eh’  ‘register  what register’ inquired the lady gravely  ‘why the register of marriages to be sure’ replied parsons chuckling at the sally and glancing at tottle  mr watkins tottle thought he should have fainted for shame and it is quite impossible to imagine what effect the joke would have had upon the lady if dinner had not been at that moment announced  mr watkins tottle with an unprecedented effort of gallantry offered the tip of his little finger miss lillerton accepted it gracefully with maiden modesty and they proceeded in due state to the dinnertable where they were soon deposited side by side the room was very snug the dinner very good and the little party in spirits  the conversation became pretty general and when mr watkins tottle had extracted one or two cold observations from his neighbour and had taken wine with her he began to acquire confidence rapidly  the cloth was removed mrs gabriel parsons drank four glasses of port on the plea of being a nurse just then and miss lillerton took about the same number of sips on the plea of not wanting any at all  at length the ladies retired to the great gratification of mr gabriel parsons who had been coughing and frowning at his wife for halfanhour previously—signals which mrs parsons never happened to observe until she had been pressed to take her ordinary quantum which to avoid giving trouble she generally did at once  ‘what do you think of her’ inquired mr gabriel parsons of mr watkins tottle in an undertone  ‘i dote on her with enthusiasm already’ replied mr watkins tottle  ‘gentlemen pray let us drink “the ladies”’ said the reverend mr timson  ‘the ladies’ said mr watkins tottle emptying his glass  in the fulness of his confidence he felt as if he could make love to a dozen ladies offhand  ‘ah’ said mr gabriel parsons ‘i remember when i was a young man—fill your glass timson’  ‘i have this moment emptied it’  ‘then fill again’  ‘i will’ said timson suiting the action to the word  ‘i remember’ resumed mr gabriel parsons ‘when i was a younger man with what a strange compound of feelings i used to drink that toast and how i used to think every woman was an angel’  ‘was that before you were married’ mildly inquired mr watkins tottle  ‘oh certainly’ replied mr gabriel parsons  ‘i have never thought so since and a precious milksop i must have been ever to have thought so at all  but you know i married fanny under the oddest and most ridiculous circumstances possible’  ‘what were they if one may inquire’ asked timson who had heard the story on an average twice a week for the last six months  mr watkins tottle listened attentively in the hope of picking up some suggestion that might be useful to him in his new undertaking  ‘i spent my weddingnight in a backkitchen chimney’ said parsons by way of a beginning  ‘in a backkitchen chimney’ ejaculated watkins tottle  ‘how dreadful’  ‘yes it wasn’t very pleasant’ replied the small host  ‘the fact is fanny’s father and mother liked me well enough as an individual but had a decided objection to my becoming a husband  you see i hadn’t any money in those days and they had and so they wanted fanny to pick up somebody else  however we managed to discover the state of each other’s affections somehow  i used to meet her at some mutual friends’ parties at first we danced together and talked and flirted and all that sort of thing then i used to like nothing so well as sitting by her side—we didn’t talk so much then but i remember i used to have a great notion of looking at her out of the extreme corner of my left eye—and then i got very miserable and sentimental and began to write verses and use macassar oil  at last i couldn’t bear it any longer and after i had walked up and down the sunny side of oxfordstreet in tight boots for a week—and a devilish hot summer it was too—in the hope of meeting her i sat down and wrote a letter and begged her to manage to see me clandestinely for i wanted to hear her decision from her own mouth  i said i had discovered to my perfect satisfaction that i couldn’t live without her and that if she didn’t have me i had made up my mind to take prussic acid or take to drinking or emigrate so as to take myself off in some way or other  well i borrowed a pound and bribed the housemaid to give her the note which she did’  ‘and what was the reply’ inquired timson who had found before that to encourage the repetition of old stories is to get a general invitation  ‘oh the usual one  fanny expressed herself very miserable hinted at the possibility of an early grave said that nothing should induce her to swerve from the duty she owed her parents implored me to forget her and find out somebody more deserving and all that sort of thing  she said she could on no account think of meeting me unknown to her pa and ma and entreated me as she should be in a particular part of kensington gardens at eleven o’clock next morning not to attempt to meet her there’  ‘you didn’t go of course’ said watkins tottle  ‘didn’t i—of course i did  there she was with the identical housemaid in perspective in order that there might be no interruption  we walked about for a couple of hours made ourselves delightfully miserable and were regularly engaged  then we began to “correspond”—that is to say we used to exchange about four letters a day what we used to say in ’em i can’t imagine  and i used to have an interview in the kitchen or the cellar or some such place every evening  well things went on in this way for some time and we got fonder of each other every day  at last as our love was raised to such a pitch and as my salary had been raised too shortly before we determined on a secret marriage  fanny arranged to sleep at a friend’s on the previous night we were to be married early in the morning and then we were to return to her home and be pathetic  she was to fall at the old gentleman’s feet and bathe his boots with her tears and i was to hug the old lady and call her “mother” and use my pockethandkerchief as much as possible  married we were the next morning two girlsfriends of fanny’s—acting as bridesmaids and a man who was hired for five shillings and a pint of porter officiating as father  now the old lady unfortunately put off her return from ramsgate where she had been paying a visit until the next morning and as we placed great reliance on her we agreed to postpone our confession for fourandtwenty hours  my newlymade wife returned home and i spent my weddingday in strolling about hampsteadheath and execrating my fatherinlaw  of course i went to comfort my dear little wife at night as much as i could with the assurance that our troubles would soon be over  i opened the gardengate of which i had a key and was shown by the servant to our old place of meeting—a back kitchen with a stonefloor and a dresser upon which in the absence of chairs we used to sit and make love’  ‘make love upon a kitchendresser’ interrupted mr watkins tottle whose ideas of decorum were greatly outraged  ‘ah  on a kitchendresser’ replied parsons  ‘and let me tell you old fellow that if you were really over headandears in love and had no other place to make love in you’d be devilish glad to avail yourself of such an opportunity  however let me see—where was i’  ‘on the dresser’ suggested timson  ‘oh—ah  well here i found poor fanny quite disconsolate and uncomfortable  the old boy had been very cross all day which made her feel still more lonely and she was quite out of spirits  so i put a good face on the matter and laughed it off and said we should enjoy the pleasures of a matrimonial life more by contrast and at length poor fanny brightened up a little  i stopped there till about eleven o’clock and just as i was taking my leave for the fourteenth time the girl came running down the stairs without her shoes in a great fright to tell us that the old villain—heaven forgive me for calling him so for he is dead and gone now—prompted i suppose by the prince of darkness was coming down to draw his own beer for supper—a thing he had not done before for six months to my certain knowledge for the cask stood in that very back kitchen  if he discovered me there explanation would have been out of the question for he was so outrageously violent when at all excited that he never would have listened to me  there was only one thing to be done  the chimney was a very wide one it had been originally built for an oven went up perpendicularly for a few feet and then shot backward and formed a sort of small cavern  my hopes and fortune—the means of our joint existence almost—were at stake  i scrambled in like a squirrel coiled myself up in this recess and as fanny and the girl replaced the deal chimneyboard i could see the light of the candle which my unconscious fatherinlaw carried in his hand  i heard him draw the beer and i never heard beer run so slowly  he was just leaving the kitchen and i was preparing to descend when down came the infernal chimneyboard with a tremendous crash  he stopped and put down the candle and the jug of beer on the dresser he was a nervous old fellow and any unexpected noise annoyed him  he coolly observed that the fireplace was never used and sending the frightened servant into the next kitchen for a hammer and nails actually nailed up the board and locked the door on the outside  so there was i on my weddingnight in the light kerseymere trousers fancy waistcoat and blue coat that i had been married in in the morning in a backkitchen chimney the bottom of which was nailed up and the top of which had been formerly raised some fifteen feet to prevent the smoke from annoying the neighbours  and there’ added mr gabriel parsons as he passed the bottle ‘there i remained till halfpast seven the next morning when the housemaid’s sweetheart who was a carpenter unshelled me  the old dog had nailed me up so securely that to this very hour i firmly believe that no one but a carpenter could ever have got me out’  ‘and what did mrs parsons’s father say when he found you were married’ inquired watkins tottle who although he never saw a joke was not satisfied until he heard a story to the very end  ‘why the affair of the chimney so tickled his fancy that he pardoned us offhand and allowed us something to live on till he went the way of all flesh  i spent the next night in his secondfloor front much more comfortably than i had spent the preceding one for as you will probably guess—’  ‘please sir missis has made tea’ said a middleaged female servant bobbing into the room  ‘that’s the very housemaid that figures in my story’ said mr gabriel parsons  ‘she went into fanny’s service when we were first married and has been with us ever since but i don’t think she has felt one atom of respect for me since the morning she saw me released when she went into violent hysterics to which she has been subject ever since  now shall we join the ladies’  ‘if you please’ said mr watkins tottle  ‘by all means’ added the obsequious mr timson and the trio made for the drawingroom accordingly  tea being concluded and the toast and cups having been duly handed and occasionally upset by mr watkins tottle a rubber was proposed  they cut for partners—mr and mrs parsons and mr watkins tottle and miss lillerton  mr timson having conscientious scruples on the subject of cardplaying drank brandyandwater and kept up a running spar with mr watkins tottle  the evening went off well mr watkins tottle was in high spirits having some reason to be gratified with his reception by miss lillerton and before he left a small party was made up to visit the beulah spa on the following saturday  ‘it’s all right i think’ said mr gabriel parsons to mr watkins tottle as he opened the garden gate for him  ‘i hope so’ he replied squeezing his friend’s hand  ‘you’ll be down by the first coach on saturday’ said mr gabriel parsons  ‘certainly’ replied mr watkins tottle  ‘undoubtedly’  but fortune had decreed that mr watkins tottle should not be down by the first coach on saturday  his adventures on that day however and the success of his wooing are subjects for another chapter   chapter the second   ‘the first coach has not come in yet has it tom’ inquired mr gabriel parsons as he very complacently paced up and down the fourteen feet of gravel which bordered the ‘lawn’ on the saturday morning which had been fixed upon for the beulah spa jaunt  ‘no sir i haven’t seen it’ replied a gardener in a blue apron who let himself out to do the ornamental for halfacrown a day and his ‘keep’  ‘time tottle was down’ said mr gabriel parsons ruminating—‘oh here he is no doubt’ added gabriel as a cab drove rapidly up the hill and he buttoned his dressinggown and opened the gate to receive the expected visitor  the cab stopped and out jumped a man in a coarse petersham greatcoat whitybrown neckerchief faded black suit gambogecoloured topboots and one of those largecrowned hats formerly seldom met with but now very generally patronised by gentlemen and costermongers  ‘mr parsons’ said the man looking at the superscription of a note he held in his hand and addressing gabriel with an inquiring air  ‘my name is parsons’ responded the sugarbaker  ‘i’ve brought this here note’ replied the individual in the painted tops in a hoarse whisper ‘i’ve brought this here note from a gen’lm’n as come to our house this mornin’’  ‘i expected the gentleman at my house’ said parsons as he broke the seal which bore the impression of her majesty’s profile as it is seen on a sixpence  ‘i’ve no doubt the gen’lm’n would ha’ been here replied the stranger ‘if he hadn’t happened to call at our house first but we never trusts no gen’lm’n furder nor we can see him—no mistake about that there’—added the unknown with a facetious grin ‘beg your pardon sir no offence meant only—once in and i wish you may—catch the idea sir’  mr gabriel parsons was not remarkable for catching anything suddenly but a cold  he therefore only bestowed a glance of profound astonishment on his mysterious companion and proceeded to unfold the note of which he had been the bearer  once opened and the idea was caught with very little difficulty  mr watkins tottle had been suddenly arrested for 33l 10s 4d and dated his communication from a lockup house in the vicinity of chancerylane  ‘unfortunate affair this’ said parsons refolding the note  ‘oh nothin’ ven you’re used to it’ coolly observed the man in the petersham  ‘tom’ exclaimed parsons after a few minutes’ consideration ‘just put the horse in will you—tell the gentleman that i shall be there almost as soon as you are’ he continued addressing the sheriffofficer’s mercury  ‘werry well’ replied that important functionary adding in a confidential manner ‘i’d adwise the gen’lm’n’s friends to settle  you see it’s a mere trifle and unless the gen’lm’n means to go up afore the court it’s hardly worth while waiting for detainers you know  our governor’s wide awake he is  i’ll never say nothin’ agin him nor no man but he knows what’s o’clock he does uncommon’  having delivered this eloquent and to parsons particularly intelligible harangue the meaning of which was eked out by divers nods and winks the gentleman in the boots reseated himself in the cab which went rapidly off and was soon out of sight  mr gabriel parsons continued to pace up and down the pathway for some minutes apparently absorbed in deep meditation  the result of his cogitations seemed to be perfectly satisfactory to himself for he ran briskly into the house said that business had suddenly summoned him to town that he had desired the messenger to inform mr watkins tottle of the fact and that they would return together to dinner  he then hastily equipped himself for a drive and mounting his gig was soon on his way to the establishment of mr solomon jacobs situate as mr watkins tottle had informed him in cursitorstreet chancerylane  when a man is in a violent hurry to get on and has a specific object in view the attainment of which depends on the completion of his journey the difficulties which interpose themselves in his way appear not only to be innumerable but to have been called into existence especially for the occasion  the remark is by no means a new one and mr gabriel parsons had practical and painful experience of its justice in the course of his drive  there are three classes of animated objects which prevent your driving with any degree of comfort or celerity through streets which are but little frequented—they are pigs children and old women  on the occasion we are describing the pigs were luxuriating on cabbagestalks and the shuttlecocks fluttered from the little deal battledores and the children played in the road and women with a basket in one hand and the streetdoor key in the other would cross just before the horse’s head until mr gabriel parsons was perfectly savage with vexation and quite hoarse with hoiing and imprecating  then when he got into fleetstreet there was ‘a stoppage’ in which people in vehicles have the satisfaction of remaining stationary for half an hour and envying the slowest pedestrians and where policemen rush about and seize hold of horses’ bridles and back them into shopwindows by way of clearing the road and preventing confusion  at length mr gabriel parsons turned into chancerylane and having inquired for and been directed to cursitorstreet for it was a locality of which he was quite ignorant he soon found himself opposite the house of mr solomon jacobs confiding his horse and gig to the care of one of the fourteen boys who had followed him from the other side of blackfriarsbridge on the chance of his requiring their services mr gabriel parsons crossed the road and knocked at an inner door the upper part of which was of glass grated like the windows of this inviting mansion with iron bars—painted white to look comfortable  the knock was answered by a sallowfaced redhaired sulky boy who after surveying mr gabriel parsons through the glass applied a large key to an immense wooden excrescence which was in reality a lock but which taken in conjunction with the iron nails with which the panels were studded gave the door the appearance of being subject to warts  ‘i want to see mr watkins tottle’ said parsons  ‘it’s the gentleman that come in this morning jem’ screamed a voice from the top of the kitchenstairs which belonged to a dirty woman who had just brought her chin to a level with the passagefloor  ‘the gentleman’s in the coffeeroom’  ‘upstairs sir’ said the boy just opening the door wide enough to let parsons in without squeezing him and doublelocking it the moment he had made his way through the aperture—‘first floor—door on the left’  mr gabriel parsons thus instructed ascended the uncarpeted and illlighted staircase and after giving several subdued taps at the beforementioned ‘door on the left’ which were rendered inaudible by the hum of voices within the room and the hissing noise attendant on some frying operations which were carrying on below stairs turned the handle and entered the apartment  being informed that the unfortunate object of his visit had just gone upstairs to write a letter he had leisure to sit down and observe the scene before him  the room—which was a small confined den—was partitioned off into boxes like the commonroom of some inferior eatinghouse  the dirty floor had evidently been as long a stranger to the scrubbingbrush as to carpet or floorcloth and the ceiling was completely blackened by the flare of the oillamp by which the room was lighted at night  the gray ashes on the edges of the tables and the cigar ends which were plentifully scattered about the dusty grate fully accounted for the intolerable smell of tobacco which pervaded the place and the empty glasses and halfsaturated slices of lemon on the tables together with the porter pots beneath them bore testimony to the frequent libations in which the individuals who honoured mr solomon jacobs by a temporary residence in his house indulged  over the mantelshelf was a paltry lookingglass extending about half the width of the chimneypiece but by way of counterpoise the ashes were confined by a rusty fender about twice as long as the hearth  from this cheerful room itself the attention of mr gabriel parsons was naturally directed to its inmates  in one of the boxes two men were playing at cribbage with a very dirty pack of cards some with blue some with green and some with red backs—selections from decayed packs  the cribbage board had been long ago formed on the table by some ingenious visitor with the assistance of a pocketknife and a twopronged fork with which the necessary number of holes had been made in the table at proper distances for the reception of the wooden pegs  in another box a stout heartylooking man of about forty was eating some dinner which his wife—an equally comfortablelooking personage—had brought him in a basket and in a third a genteellooking young man was talking earnestly and in a low tone to a young female whose face was concealed by a thick veil but whom mr gabriel parsons immediately set down in his own mind as the debtor’s wife  a young fellow of vulgar manners dressed in the very extreme of the prevailing fashion was pacing up and down the room with a lighted cigar in his mouth and his hands in his pockets ever and anon puffing forth volumes of smoke and occasionally applying with much apparent relish to a pint pot the contents of which were ‘chilling’ on the hob  ‘fourpence more by gum’ exclaimed one of the cribbageplayers lighting a pipe and addressing his adversary at the close of the game ‘one ’ud think you’d got luck in a peppercruet and shook it out when you wanted it’  ‘well that a’n’t a bad un’ replied the other who was a horsedealer from islington  ‘no i’m blessed if it is’ interposed the jollylooking fellow who having finished his dinner was drinking out of the same glass as his wife in truly conjugal harmony some hot ginandwater  the faithful partner of his cares had brought a plentiful supply of the antitemperance fluid in a large flat stone bottle which looked like a halfgallon jar that had been successfully tapped for the dropsy ‘you’re a rum chap you are mr walker—will you dip your beak into this sir’  ‘thank’ee sir’ replied mr walker leaving his box and advancing to the other to accept the proffered glass  ‘here’s your health sir and your good ’ooman’s here  gentlemen all—yours and better luck still well mr willis’ continued the facetious prisoner addressing the young man with the cigar ‘you seem rather down today—floored as one may say what’s the matter sir  never say die you know’  ‘oh i’m all right’ replied the smoker  ‘i shall be bailed out tomorrow’  ‘shall you though’ inquired the other  ‘damme i wish i could say the same  i am as regularly over head and ears as the royal george and stand about as much chance of being bailed out  ha ha ha’  ‘why’ said the young man stopping short and speaking in a very loud key ‘look at me  what d’ye think i’ve stopped here two days for’  ‘’cause you couldn’t get out i suppose’ interrupted mr walker winking to the company  ‘not that you’re exactly obliged to stop here only you can’t help it  no compulsion you know only you must—eh’  ‘a’n’t he a rum un’ inquired the delighted individual who had offered the ginandwater of his wife  ‘oh he just is’ replied the lady who was quite overcome by these flashes of imagination  ‘why my case’ frowned the victim throwing the end of his cigar into the fire and illustrating his argument by knocking the bottom of the pot on the table at intervals—‘my case is a very singular one  my father’s a man of large property and i am his son’  ‘that’s a very strange circumstance’ interrupted the jocose mr walker en passant  ‘—i am his son and have received a liberal education  i don’t owe no man nothing—not the value of a farthing but i was induced you see to put my name to some bills for a friend—bills to a large amount i may say a very large amount for which i didn’t receive no consideration  what’s the consequence’  ‘why i suppose the bills went out and you came in  the acceptances weren’t taken up and you were eh’ inquired walker  ‘to be sure’ replied the liberally educated young gentleman  ‘to be sure and so here i am locked up for a matter of twelve hundred pound’  ‘why don’t you ask your old governor to stump up’ inquired walker with a somewhat sceptical air  ‘oh bless you he’d never do it’ replied the other in a tone of expostulation—‘never’  ‘well it is very odd to—be—sure’ interposed the owner of the flat bottle mixing another glass ‘but i’ve been in difficulties as one may say now for thirty year  i went to pieces when i was in a milkwalk thirty year ago arterwards when i was a fruiterer and kept a spring wan and arter that again in the coal and ’tatur line—but all that time i never see a youngish chap come into a place of this kind who wasn’t going out again directly and who hadn’t been arrested on bills which he’d given a friend and for which he’d received nothing whatsomever—not a fraction’  ‘oh it’s always the cry’ said walker  ‘i can’t see the use on it that’s what makes me so wild  why i should have a much better opinion of an individual if he’d say at once in an honourable and gentlemanly manner as he’d done everybody he possibly could’  ‘ay to be sure’ interposed the horsedealer with whose notions of bargain and sale the axiom perfectly coincided ‘so should i’  the young gentleman who had given rise to these observations was on the point of offering a rather angry reply to these sneers but the rising of the young man before noticed and of the female who had been sitting by him to leave the room interrupted the conversation  she had been weeping bitterly and the noxious atmosphere of the room acting upon her excited feelings and delicate frame rendered the support of her companion necessary as they quitted it together  there was an air of superiority about them both and something in their appearance so unusual in such a place that a respectful silence was observed until the whirr—r—bang of the spring door announced that they were out of hearing  it was broken by the wife of the exfruiterer  ‘poor creetur’ said she quenching a sigh in a rivulet of ginandwater ‘she’s very young’  ‘she’s a nicelooking ’ooman too’ added the horsedealer  ‘what’s he in for ikey’ inquired walker of an individual who was spreading a cloth with numerous blotches of mustard upon it on one of the tables and whom mr gabriel parsons had no difficulty in recognising as the man who had called upon him in the morning  ‘vy’ responded the factotum ‘it’s one of the rummiest rigs you ever heard on  he come in here last vensday which bythebye he’s agoing over the water tonight—hows’ever that’s neither here nor there  you see i’ve been a going back’ards and for’ards about his business and ha’ managed to pick up some of his story from the servants and them and so far as i can make it out it seems to be summat to this here effect—’  ‘cut it short old fellow’ interrupted walker who knew from former experience that he of the topboots was neither very concise nor intelligible in his narratives  ‘let me alone’ replied ikey ‘and i’ll ha’ wound up and made my lucky in five seconds  this here young gen’lm’n’s father—so i’m told mind ye—and the father o’ the young voman have always been on very bad outandout rig’lar knockmedown sort o’ terms but somehow or another when he was a wisitin’ at some gentlefolk’s house as he knowed at college he came into contract with the young lady  he seed her several times and then he up and said he’d keep company with her if so be as she vos agreeable  vell she vos as sweet upon him as he vos upon her and so i s’pose they made it all right for they got married ’bout six months arterwards unbeknown mind ye to the two fathers—leastways so i’m told  when they heard on it—my eyes there was such a combustion starvation vos the very least that vos to be done to ’em  the young gen’lm’n’s father cut him off vith a bob ’cos he’d cut himself off vith a wife and the young lady’s father he behaved even worser and more unnat’ral for he not only blow’d her up dreadful and swore he’d never see her again but he employed a chap as i knows—and as you knows mr valker a precious sight too well—to go about and buy up the bills and them things on which the young husband thinking his governor ’ud come round agin had raised the vind just to blow himself on vith for a time besides vich he made all the interest he could to set other people agin him  consequence vos that he paid as long as he could but things he never expected to have to meet till he’d had time to turn himself round come fast upon him and he vos nabbed  he vos brought here as i said afore last vensday and i think there’s about—ah halfadozen detainers agin him downstairs now  i have been’ added ikey ‘in the purfession these fifteen year and i never met vith such windictiveness afore’  ‘poor creeturs’ exclaimed the coaldealer’s wife once more again resorting to the same excellent prescription for nipping a sigh in the bud  ‘ah when they’ve seen as much trouble as i and my old man here have they’ll be as comfortable under it as we are’  ‘the young lady’s a pretty creature’ said walker ‘only she’s a little too delicate for my taste—there ain’t enough of her  as to the young cove he may be very respectable and what not but he’s too down in the mouth for me—he ain’t game’  ‘game’ exclaimed ikey who had been altering the position of a greenhandled knife and fork at least a dozen times in order that he might remain in the room under the pretext of having something to do ‘he’s game enough ven there’s anything to be fierce about but who could be game as you call it mr walker with a pale young creetur like that hanging about him—it’s enough to drive any man’s heart into his boots to see ’em together—and no mistake at all about it  i never shall forget her first comin’ here he wrote to her on the thursday to come—i know he did ’cos i took the letter  uncommon fidgety he was all day to be sure and in the evening he goes down into the office and he says to jacobs says he “sir can i have the loan of a private room for a few minutes this evening without incurring any additional expense—just to see my wife in” says he  jacobs looked as much as to say—“strike me bountiful if you ain’t one of the modest sort” but as the gen’lm’n who had been in the back parlour had just gone out and had paid for it for that day he says—werry grave—“sir” says he “it’s agin our rules to let private rooms to our lodgers on gratis terms but” says he “for a gentleman i don’t mind breaking through them for once”  so then he turns round to me and says “ikey put two mould candles in the back parlour and charge ’em to this gen’lm’n’s account” vich i did  vell byandby a hackneycoach comes up to the door and there sure enough was the young lady wrapped up in a hoperacloak as it might be and all alone  i opened the gate that night so i went up when the coach come and he vos a waitin’ at the parlour door—and wasn’t he a trembling neither  the poor creetur see him and could hardly walk to meet him  “oh harry” she says “that it should have come to this and all for my sake” says she putting her hand upon his shoulder  so he puts his arm round her pretty little waist and leading her gently a little way into the room so that he might be able to shut the door he says so kind and softlike—“why kate” says he—’  ‘here’s the gentleman you want’ said ikey abruptly breaking off in his story and introducing mr gabriel parsons to the crestfallen watkins tottle who at that moment entered the room  watkins advanced with a wooden expression of passive endurance and accepted the hand which mr gabriel parsons held out  ‘i want to speak to you’ said gabriel with a look strongly expressive of his dislike of the company  ‘this way’ replied the imprisoned one leading the way to the front drawingroom where rich debtors did the luxurious at the rate of a couple of guineas a day  ‘well here i am’ said mr watkins as he sat down on the sofa and placing the palms of his hands on his knees anxiously glanced at his friend’s countenance  ‘yes and here you’re likely to be’ said gabriel coolly as he rattled the money in his unmentionable pockets and looked out of the window  ‘what’s the amount with the costs’ inquired parsons after an awkward pause  ‘have you any money’  ‘nine and sixpence halfpenny’  mr gabriel parsons walked up and down the room for a few seconds before he could make up his mind to disclose the plan he had formed he was accustomed to drive hard bargains but was always most anxious to conceal his avarice  at length he stopped short and said ‘tottle you owe me fifty pounds’  ‘i do’  ‘and from all i see i infer that you are likely to owe it to me’  ‘i fear i am’  ‘though you have every disposition to pay me if you could’  ‘certainly’  ‘then’ said mr gabriel parsons ‘listen here’s my proposition  you know my way of old  accept it—yes or no—i will or i won’t  i’ll pay the debt and costs and i’ll lend you 10l more which added to your annuity will enable you to carry on the war well if you’ll give me your note of hand to pay me one hundred and fifty pounds within six months after you are married to miss lillerton’  ‘my dear—’  ‘stop a minute—on one condition and that is that you propose to miss lillerton at once’  ‘at once  my dear parsons consider’  ‘it’s for you to consider not me  she knows you well from reputation though she did not know you personally until lately  notwithstanding all her maiden modesty i think she’d be devilish glad to get married out of hand with as little delay as possible  my wife has sounded her on the subject and she has confessed’  ‘what—what’ eagerly interrupted the enamoured watkins  ‘why’ replied parsons ‘to say exactly what she has confessed would be rather difficult because they only spoke in hints and so forth but my wife who is no bad judge in these cases declared to me that what she had confessed was as good as to say that she was not insensible of your merits—in fact that no other man should have her’  mr watkins tottle rose hastily from his seat and rang the bell  ‘what’s that for’ inquired parsons  ‘i want to send the man for the bill stamp’ replied mr watkins tottle  ‘then you’ve made up your mind’  ‘i have’—and they shook hands most cordially  the note of hand was given—the debt and costs were paid—ikey was satisfied for his trouble and the two friends soon found themselves on that side of mr solomon jacobs’s establishment on which most of his visitors were very happy when they found themselves once again—to wit the outside  ‘now’ said mr gabriel parsons as they drove to norwood together—‘you shall have an opportunity to make the disclosure tonight and mind you speak out tottle’  ‘i will—i will’ replied watkins valorously  ‘how i should like to see you together’ ejaculated mr gabriel parsons—‘what fun’ and he laughed so long and so loudly that he disconcerted mr watkins tottle and frightened the horse  ‘there’s fanny and your intended walking about on the lawn’ said gabriel as they approached the house  ‘mind your eye tottle’  ‘never fear’ replied watkins resolutely as he made his way to the spot where the ladies were walking  ‘here’s mr tottle my dear’ said mrs parsons addressing miss lillerton  the lady turned quickly round and acknowledged his courteous salute with the same sort of confusion that watkins had noticed on their first interview but with something like a slight expression of disappointment or carelessness  ‘did you see how glad she was to see you’ whispered parsons to his friend  ‘why i really thought she looked as if she would rather have seen somebody else’ replied tottle  ‘pooh nonsense’ whispered parsons again—‘it’s always the way with the women young or old  they never show how delighted they are to see those whose presence makes their hearts beat  it’s the way with the whole sex and no man should have lived to your time of life without knowing it fanny confessed it to me when we were first married over and over again—see what it is to have a wife’  ‘certainly’ whispered tottle whose courage was vanishing fast  ‘well now you’d better begin to pave the way’ said parsons who having invested some money in the speculation assumed the office of director  ‘yes yes i will—presently’ replied tottle greatly flurried  ‘say something to her man’ urged parsons again  ‘confound it pay her a compliment can’t you’  ‘no not till after dinner’ replied the bashful tottle anxious to postpone the evil moment  ‘well gentlemen’ said mrs parsons ‘you are really very polite you stay away the whole morning after promising to take us out and when you do come home you stand whispering together and take no notice of us’  ‘we were talking of the business my dear which detained us this morning’ replied parsons looking significantly at tottle  ‘dear me how very quickly the morning has gone’ said miss lillerton referring to the gold watch which was wound up on state occasions whether it required it or not  ‘i think it has passed very slowly’ mildly suggested tottle  ‘that’s right—bravo’ whispered parsons  ‘indeed’ said miss lillerton with an air of majestic surprise  ‘i can only impute it to my unavoidable absence from your society madam’ said watkins ‘and that of mrs parsons’  during this short dialogue the ladies had been leading the way to the house  ‘what the deuce did you stick fanny into that last compliment for’ inquired parsons as they followed together ‘it quite spoilt the effect’  ‘oh it really would have been too broad without’ replied watkins tottle ‘much too broad’  ‘he’s mad’ parsons whispered his wife as they entered the drawingroom ‘mad from modesty’  ‘dear me’ ejaculated the lady ‘i never heard of such a thing’  ‘you’ll find we have quite a family dinner mr tottle’ said mrs parsons when they sat down to table ‘miss lillerton is one of us and of course we make no stranger of you’  mr watkins tottle expressed a hope that the parsons family never would make a stranger of him and wished internally that his bashfulness would allow him to feel a little less like a stranger himself  ‘take off the covers martha’ said mrs parsons directing the shifting of the scenery with great anxiety  the order was obeyed and a pair of boiled fowls with tongue and et ceteras were displayed at the top and a fillet of veal at the bottom  on one side of the table two green saucetureens with ladles of the same were setting to each other in a green dish and on the other was a curried rabbit in a brown suit turned up with lemon  ‘miss lillerton my dear’ said mrs parsons ‘shall i assist you’  ‘thank you no i think i’ll trouble mr tottle’  watkins started—trembled—helped the rabbit—and broke a tumbler  the countenance of the lady of the house which had been all smiles previously underwent an awful change  ‘extremely sorry’ stammered watkins assisting himself to currie and parsley and butter in the extremity of his confusion  ‘not the least consequence’ replied mrs parsons in a tone which implied that it was of the greatest consequence possible—directing aside the researches of the boy who was groping under the table for the bits of broken glass  ‘i presume’ said miss lillerton ‘that mr tottle is aware of the interest which bachelors usually pay in such cases a dozen glasses for one is the lowest penalty’  mr gabriel parsons gave his friend an admonitory tread on the toe  here was a clear hint that the sooner he ceased to be a bachelor and emancipated himself from such penalties the better  mr watkins tottle viewed the observation in the same light and challenged mrs parsons to take wine with a degree of presence of mind which under all the circumstances was really extraordinary  ‘miss lillerton’ said gabriel ‘may i have the pleasure’  ‘i shall be most happy’  ‘tottle will you assist miss lillerton and pass the decanter  thank you’  the usual pantomimic ceremony of nodding and sipping gone through—  ‘tottle were you ever in suffolk’ inquired the master of the house who was burning to tell one of his seven stock stories  ‘no’ responded watkins adding by way of a saving clause ‘but i’ve been in devonshire’  ‘ah’ replied gabriel ‘it was in suffolk that a rather singular circumstance happened to me many years ago  did you ever happen to hear me mention it’  mr watkins tottle had happened to hear his friend mention it some four hundred times  of course he expressed great curiosity and evinced the utmost impatience to hear the story again  mr gabriel parsons forthwith attempted to proceed in spite of the interruptions to which as our readers must frequently have observed the master of the house is often exposed in such cases  we will attempt to give them an idea of our meaning  ‘when i was in suffolk—’ said mr gabriel parsons  ‘take off the fowls first martha’ said mrs parsons  ‘i beg your pardon my dear’  ‘when i was in suffolk’ resumed mr parsons with an impatient glance at his wife who pretended not to observe it ‘which is now years ago business led me to the town of bury st edmund’s  i had to stop at the principal places in my way and therefore for the sake of convenience i travelled in a gig  i left sudbury one dark night—it was winter time—about nine o’clock the rain poured in torrents the wind howled among the trees that skirted the roadside and i was obliged to proceed at a footpace for i could hardly see my hand before me it was so dark—’  ‘john’ interrupted mrs parsons in a low hollow voice ‘don’t spill that gravy’  ‘fanny’ said parsons impatiently ‘i wish you’d defer these domestic reproofs to some more suitable time  really my dear these constant interruptions are very annoying’  ‘my dear i didn’t interrupt you’ said mrs parsons  ‘but my dear you did interrupt me’ remonstrated mr parsons  ‘how very absurd you are my love  i must give directions to the servants i am quite sure that if i sat here and allowed john to spill the gravy over the new carpet you’d be the first to find fault when you saw the stain tomorrow morning’  ‘well’ continued gabriel with a resigned air as if he knew there was no getting over the point about the carpet ‘i was just saying it was so dark that i could hardly see my hand before me  the road was very lonely and i assure you tottle this was a device to arrest the wandering attention of that individual which was distracted by a confidential communication between mrs parsons and martha accompanied by the delivery of a large bunch of keys i assure you tottle i became somehow impressed with a sense of the loneliness of my situation—’  ‘pie to your master’ interrupted mrs parsons again directing the servant  ‘now pray my dear’ remonstrated parsons once more very pettishly mrs p turned up her hands and eyebrows and appealed in dumb show to miss lillerton  ‘as i turned a corner of the road’ resumed gabriel ‘the horse stopped short and reared tremendously  i pulled up jumped out ran to his head and found a man lying on his back in the middle of the road with his eyes fixed on the sky  i thought he was dead but no he was alive and there appeared to be nothing the matter with him  he jumped up and putting his hand to his chest and fixing upon me the most earnest gaze you can imagine exclaimed—’  ‘pudding here’ said mrs parsons  ‘oh it’s no use’ exclaimed the host now rendered desperate  ‘here tottle a glass of wine  it’s useless to attempt relating anything when mrs parsons is present’  this attack was received in the usual way  mrs parsons talked to miss lillerton and at her better half expatiated on the impatience of men generally hinted that her husband was peculiarly vicious in this respect and wound up by insinuating that she must be one of the best tempers that ever existed or she never could put up with it  really what she had to endure sometimes was more than any one who saw her in everyday life could by possibility suppose—the story was now a painful subject and therefore mr parsons declined to enter into any details and contented himself by stating that the man was a maniac who had escaped from a neighbouring madhouse  the cloth was removed the ladies soon afterwards retired and miss lillerton played the piano in the drawingroom overhead very loudly for the edification of the visitor  mr watkins tottle and mr gabriel parsons sat chatting comfortably enough until the conclusion of the second bottle when the latter in proposing an adjournment to the drawingroom informed watkins that he had concerted a plan with his wife for leaving him and miss lillerton alone soon after tea  ‘i say’ said tottle as they went upstairs ‘don’t you think it would be better if we put it off tilltilltomorrow’  ‘don’t you think it would have been much better if i had left you in that wretched hole i found you in this morning’ retorted parsons bluntly  ‘well—well—i only made a suggestion’ said poor watkins tottle with a deep sigh  tea was soon concluded and miss lillerton drawing a small worktable on one side of the fire and placing a little wooden frame upon it something like a miniature claymill without the horse was soon busily engaged in making a watchguard with brown silk  ‘god bless me’ exclaimed parsons starting up with wellfeigned surprise ‘i’ve forgotten those confounded letters  tottle i know you’ll excuse me’  if tottle had been a free agent he would have allowed no one to leave the room on any pretence except himself  as it was however he was obliged to look cheerful when parsons quitted the apartment  he had scarcely left when martha put her head into the room with—‘please ma’am you’re wanted’  mrs parsons left the room shut the door carefully after her and mr watkins tottle was left alone with miss lillerton  for the first five minutes there was a dead silence—mr watkins tottle was thinking how he should begin and miss lillerton appeared to be thinking of nothing  the fire was burning low mr watkins tottle stirred it and put some coals on  ‘hem’ coughed miss lillerton mr watkins tottle thought the fair creature had spoken  ‘i beg your pardon’ said he  ‘eh’  ‘i thought you spoke’  ‘no’  ‘oh’  ‘there are some books on the sofa mr tottle if you would like to look at them’ said miss lillerton after the lapse of another five minutes  ‘no thank you’ returned watkins and then he added with a courage which was perfectly astonishing even to himself ‘madam that is miss lillerton i wish to speak to you’  ‘to me’ said miss lillerton letting the silk drop from her hands and sliding her chair back a few paces—‘speak—to me’  ‘to you madam—and on the subject of the state of your affections’  the lady hastily rose and would have left the room but mr watkins tottle gently detained her by the hand and holding it as far from him as the joint length of their arms would permit he thus proceeded ‘pray do not misunderstand me or suppose that i am led to address you after so short an acquaintance by any feeling of my own merits—for merits i have none which could give me a claim to your hand  i hope you will acquit me of any presumption when i explain that i have been acquainted through mrs parsons with the state—that is that mrs parsons has told me—at least not mrs parsons but—’ here watkins began to wander but miss lillerton relieved him  ‘am i to understand mr tottle that mrs parsons has acquainted you with my feeling—my affection—i mean my respect for an individual of the opposite sex’  ‘she has’  ‘then what’ inquired miss lillerton averting her face with a girlish air ‘what could induce you to seek such an interview as this  what can your object be  how can i promote your happiness mr tottle’  here was the time for a flourish—‘by allowing me’ replied watkins falling bump on his knees and breaking two bracebuttons and a waistcoatstring in the act—‘by allowing me to be your slave your servant—in short by unreservedly making me the confidant of your heart’s feelings—may i say for the promotion of your own happiness—may i say in order that you may become the wife of a kind and affectionate husband’  ‘disinterested creature’ exclaimed miss lillerton hiding her face in a white pockethandkerchief with an eyelethole border  mr watkins tottle thought that if the lady knew all she might possibly alter her opinion on this last point  he raised the tip of her middle finger ceremoniously to his lips and got off his knees as gracefully as he could  ‘my information was correct’ he tremulously inquired when he was once more on his feet  ‘it was’  watkins elevated his hands and looked up to the ornament in the centre of the ceiling which had been made for a lamp by way of expressing his rapture  ‘our situation mr tottle’ resumed the lady glancing at him through one of the eyeletholes ‘is a most peculiar and delicate one’  ‘it is’ said mr tottle  ‘our acquaintance has been of so short duration’ said miss lillerton  ‘only a week’ assented watkins tottle  ‘oh more than that’ exclaimed the lady in a tone of surprise  ‘indeed’ said tottle  ‘more than a month—more than two months’ said miss lillerton  ‘rather odd this’ thought watkins  ‘oh’ he said recollecting parsons’s assurance that she had known him from report ‘i understand  but my dear madam pray consider  the longer this acquaintance has existed the less reason is there for delay now  why not at once fix a period for gratifying the hopes of your devoted admirer’  ‘it has been represented to me again and again that this is the course i ought to pursue’ replied miss lillerton ‘but pardon my feelings of delicacy mr tottle—pray excuse this embarrassment—i have peculiar ideas on such subjects and i am quite sure that i never could summon up fortitude enough to name the day to my future husband’  ‘then allow me to name it’ said tottle eagerly  ‘i should like to fix it myself’ replied miss lillerton bashfully ‘but i cannot do so without at once resorting to a third party’  ‘a third party’ thought watkins tottle ‘who the deuce is that to be i wonder’  ‘mr tottle’ continued miss lillerton ‘you have made me a most disinterested and kind offer—that offer i accept  will you at once be the bearer of a note from me to—to mr timson’  ‘mr timson’ said watkins  ‘after what has passed between us’ responded miss lillerton still averting her head ‘you must understand whom i mean mr timson the—the—clergyman’  ‘mr timson the clergyman’ ejaculated watkins tottle in a state of inexpressible beatitude and positive wonder at his own success  ‘angel certainly—this moment’  ‘i’ll prepare it immediately’ said miss lillerton making for the door ‘the events of this day have flurried me so much mr tottle that i shall not leave my room again this evening i will send you the note by the servant’  ‘stay—stay’ cried watkins tottle still keeping a most respectful distance from the lady ‘when shall we meet again’  ‘oh  mr tottle’ replied miss lillerton coquettishly ‘when we are married i can never see you too often nor thank you too much’ and she left the room  mr watkins tottle flung himself into an armchair and indulged in the most delicious reveries of future bliss in which the idea of ‘five hundred pounds per annum with an uncontrolled power of disposing of it by her last will and testament’ was somehow or other the foremost  he had gone through the interview so well and it had terminated so admirably that he almost began to wish he had expressly stipulated for the settlement of the annual five hundred on himself  ‘may i come in’ said mr gabriel parsons peeping in at the door  ‘you may’ replied watkins  ‘well have you done it’ anxiously inquired gabriel  ‘have i done it’ said watkins tottle  ‘hush—i’m going to the clergyman’  ‘no’ said parsons  ‘how well you have managed it’  ‘where does timson live’ inquired watkins  ‘at his uncle’s’ replied gabriel ‘just round the lane  he’s waiting for a living and has been assisting his uncle here for the last two or three months  but how well you have done it—i didn’t think you could have carried it off so’  mr watkins tottle was proceeding to demonstrate that the richardsonian principle was the best on which love could possibly be made when he was interrupted by the entrance of martha with a little pink note folded like a fancy cockedhat  ‘miss lillerton’s compliments’ said martha as she delivered it into tottle’s hands and vanished  ‘do you observe the delicacy’ said tottle appealing to mr gabriel parsons  ‘compliments not love by the servant eh’  mr gabriel parsons didn’t exactly know what reply to make so he poked the forefinger of his right hand between the third and fourth ribs of mr watkins tottle  ‘come’ said watkins when the explosion of mirth consequent on this practical jest had subsided ‘we’ll be off at once—let’s lose no time’  ‘capital’ echoed gabriel parsons and in five minutes they were at the gardengate of the villa tenanted by the uncle of mr timson  ‘is mr charles timson at home’ inquired mr watkins tottle of mr charles timson’s uncle’s man  ‘mr charles is at home’ replied the man stammering ‘but he desired me to say he couldn’t be interrupted sir by any of the parishioners’  ‘i am not a parishioner’ replied watkins  ‘is mr charles writing a sermon tom’ inquired parsons thrusting himself forward  ‘no mr parsons sir he’s not exactly writing a sermon but he is practising the violoncello in his own bedroom and gave strict orders not to be disturbed’  ‘say i’m here’ replied gabriel leading the way across the garden ‘mr parsons and mr tottle on private and particular business’  they were shown into the parlour and the servant departed to deliver his message  the distant groaning of the violoncello ceased footsteps were heard on the stairs and mr timson presented himself and shook hands with parsons with the utmost cordiality  ‘game’ exclaimed ikey who had been altering the position of a greenhandled knife and fork at least a dozen times in order that he might remain in the room under the pretext of having something to do ‘he’s game enough ven there’s anything to be fierce about but who could be game as you call it mr walker with a pale young creetur like that hanging about him—it’s enough to drive any man’s heart into his boots to see ’em together—and no mistake at all about it  i never shall forget her first comin’ here he wrote to her on the thursday to come—i know he did ’cos i took the letter  uncommon fidgety he was all day to be sure and in the evening he goes down into the office and he says to jacobs says he “sir can i have the loan of a private room for a few minutes this evening without incurring any additional expense—just to see my wife in” says he  jacobs looked as much as to say—“strike me bountiful if you ain’t one of the modest sort” but as the gen’lm’n who had been in the back parlour had just gone out and had paid for it for that day he says—werry grave—“sir” says he “it’s agin our rules to let private rooms to our lodgers on gratis terms but” says he “for a gentleman i don’t mind breaking through them for once”  so then he turns found to me and says “ikey put two mould candles in the back parlour and charge ’em to this gen’lm’n’s account” vich i did  vell byandby a hackneycoach comes up to the door and there sure enough was the young lady wrapped up in a hoperacloak as it might be and all alone  i opened the gate that night so i went up when the coach come and he vos a waitin’ at the parlour door—and wasn’t he a trembling neither  the poor creetur see him and could hardly walk to meet him  “oh harry” she says “that it should have come to this and all for my sake” says she putting her hand upon his shoulder  so he puts his arm round her pretty little waist and leading her gently a little way into the room so that he might be able to shut the door he says so kind and softlike—“why kate” says he—’  ‘here’s the gentleman you want’ said ikey abruptly breaking off in his story and introducing mr gabriel parsons to the crestfallen watkins tottle who at that moment entered the room  watkins advanced with a wooden expression of passive endurance and accepted the hand which mr gabriel parsons held out  ‘i want to speak to you’ said gabriel with a look strongly expressive of his dislike of the company  ‘this way’ replied the imprisoned one leading the way to the front drawingroom where rich debtors did the luxurious at the rate of a couple of guineas a day  ‘well here i am’ said mr watkins as he sat down on the sofa and placing the palms of his hands on his knees anxiously glanced at his friend’s countenance  ‘yes and here you’re likely to be’ said gabriel coolly as he rattled the money in his unmentionable pockets and looked out of the window  ‘what’s the amount with the costs’ inquired parsons after an awkward pause  ‘have you any money’  ‘nine and sixpence halfpenny’  mr gabriel parsons walked up and down the room for a few seconds before he could make up his mind to disclose the plan he had formed he was accustomed to drive hard bargains but was always most anxious to conceal his avarice  at length he stopped short and said ‘tottle you owe me fifty pounds’  ‘i do’  ‘and from all i see i infer that you are likely to owe it to me’  ‘i fear i am’  ‘though you have every disposition to pay me if you could’  ‘certainly’  ‘then’ said mr gabriel parsons ‘listen here’s my proposition  you know my way of old  accept it—yes or no—i will or i won’t  i’ll pay the debt and costs and i’ll lend you 10l more which added to your annuity will enable you to carry on the war well if you’ll give me your note of hand to pay me one hundred and fifty pounds within six months after you are married to miss lillerton’  ‘my dear—’  ‘stop a minute—on one condition and that is that you propose to miss lillerton at once’  ‘at once  my dear parsons consider’  ‘it’s for you to consider not me  she knows you well from reputation though she did not know you personally until lately  notwithstanding all her maiden modesty i think she’d be devilish glad to get married out of hand with as little delay as possible  my wife has sounded her on the subject and she has confessed’  ‘what—what’ eagerly interrupted the enamoured watkins  ‘why’ replied parsons ‘to say exactly what she has confessed would be rather difficult because they only spoke in hints and so forth but my wife who is no bad judge in these cases declared to me that what she had confessed was as good as to say that she was not insensible of your merits—in fact that no other man should have her’  mr watkins tottle rose hastily from his seat and rang the bell  ‘what’s that for’ inquired parsons  ‘i want to send the man for the bill stamp’ replied mr watkins tottle  ‘then you’ve made up your mind’  ‘i have’—and they shook hands most cordially  the note of hand was given—the debt and costs were paid—ikey was satisfied for his trouble and the two friends soon found themselves on that side of mr solomon jacobs’s establishment on which most of his visitors were very happy when they found themselves once again—to wit the outside  ‘now’ said mr gabriel parsons as they drove to norwood together—‘you shall have an opportunity to make the disclosure tonight and mind you speak out tottle’  ‘i will—i will’ replied watkins valorously  ‘how i should like to see you together’ ejaculated mr gabriel parsons—‘what fun’ and he laughed so long and so loudly that he disconcerted mr watkins tottle and frightened the horse  ‘there’s fanny and your intended walking about on the lawn’ said gabriel as they approached the house  ‘mind your eye tottle’  ‘never fear’ replied watkins resolutely as he made his way to the spot where the ladies were walking  ‘here’s mr tottle my dear’ said mrs parsons addressing miss lillerton  the lady turned quickly round and acknowledged his courteous salute with the same sort of confusion that watkins had noticed on their first interview but with something like a slight expression of disappointment or carelessness  ‘did you see how glad she was to see you’ whispered parsons to his friend  ‘why i really thought she looked as if she would rather have seen somebody else’ replied tottle  ‘pooh nonsense’ whispered parsons again—‘it’s always the way with the women young or old  they never show how delighted they are to see those whose presence makes their hearts beat  it’s the way with the whole sex and no man should have lived to your time of life without knowing it fanny confessed it to me when we were first married over and over again—see what it is to have a wife’  ‘certainly’ whispered tottle whose courage was vanishing fast  ‘well now you’d better begin to pave the way’ said parsons who having invested some money in the speculation assumed the office of director  ‘yes yes i will—presently’ replied tottle greatly flurried  ‘say something to her man’ urged parsons again  ‘confound it pay her a compliment can’t you’  ‘no not till after dinner’ replied the bashful tottle anxious to postpone the evil moment  ‘well gentlemen’ said mrs parsons ‘you are really very polite you stay away the whole morning after promising to take us out and when you do come home you stand whispering together and take no notice of us’  ‘we were talking of the business my dear which detained us this morning’ replied parsons looking significantly at tottle  ‘dear me how very quickly the morning has gone’ said miss lillerton referring to the gold watch which was wound up on state occasions whether it required it or not  ‘i think it has passed very slowly’ mildly suggested tottle  ‘that’s right—bravo’ whispered parsons  ‘indeed’ said miss lillerton with an air of majestic surprise  ‘i can only impute it to my unavoidable absence from your society madam’ said watkins ‘and that of mrs parsons’  during this short dialogue the ladies had been leading the way to the house  ‘what the deuce did you stick fanny into that last compliment for’ inquired parsons as they followed together ‘it quite spoilt the effect’  ‘oh it really would have been too broad without’ replied watkins tottle ‘much too broad’  ‘he’s mad’ parsons whispered his wife as they entered the drawingroom ‘mad from modesty’  ‘dear me’ ejaculated the lady ‘i never heard of such a thing’  ‘you’ll find we have quite a family dinner mr tottle’ said mrs parsons when they sat down to table ‘miss lillerton is one of us and of course we make no stranger of you’  mr watkins tottle expressed a hope that the parsons family never would make a stranger of him and wished internally that his bashfulness would allow him to feel a little less like a stranger himself  ‘take off the covers martha’ said mrs parsons directing the shifting of the scenery with great anxiety  the order was obeyed and a pair of boiled fowls with tongue and et ceteras were displayed at the top and a fillet of veal at the bottom  on one side of the table two green saucetureens with ladles of the same were setting to each other in a green dish and on the other was a curried rabbit in a brown suit turned up with lemon  ‘miss lillerton my dear’ said mrs parsons ‘shall i assist you’  ‘thank you no i think i’ll trouble mr tottle’  watkins started—trembled—helped the rabbit—and broke a tumbler  the countenance of the lady of the house which had been all smiles previously underwent an awful change  ‘extremely sorry’ stammered watkins assisting himself to currie and parsley and butter in the extremity of his confusion  ‘not the least consequence’ replied mrs parsons in a tone which implied that it was of the greatest consequence possible—directing aside the researches of the boy who was groping under the table for the bits of broken glass  ‘i presume’ said miss lillerton ‘that mr tottle is aware of the interest which bachelors usually pay in such cases a dozen glasses for one is the lowest penalty’  mr gabriel parsons gave his friend an admonitory tread on the toe  here was a clear hint that the sooner he ceased to be a bachelor and emancipated himself from such penalties the better  mr watkins tottle viewed the observation in the same light and challenged mrs parsons to take wine with a degree of presence of mind which under all the circumstances was really extraordinary  ‘miss lillerton’ said gabriel ‘may i have the pleasure’  ‘i shall be most happy’  ‘tottle will you assist miss lillerton and pass the decanter  thank you’  the usual pantomimic ceremony of nodding and sipping gone through—  ‘tottle were you ever in suffolk’ inquired the master of the house who was burning to tell one of his seven stock stories  ‘no’ responded watkins adding by way of a saving clause ‘but i’ve been in devonshire’  ‘ah’ replied gabriel ‘it was in suffolk that a rather singular circumstance happened to me many years ago  did you ever happen to hear me mention it’  mr watkins tottle had happened to hear his friend mention it some four hundred times  of course he expressed great curiosity and evinced the utmost impatience to hear the story again  mr gabriel parsons forthwith attempted

through mrs parsons with the state—that is that mrs parsons has told me—at least not mrs parsons but—’ here watkins began to wander but miss lillerton relieved him  ‘am i to understand mr tottle that mrs parsons has acquainted you with my feeling—my affection—i mean my respect for an individual of the opposite sex’  ‘she has’  ‘then what’ inquired miss lillerton averting her face with a girlish air ‘what could induce you to seek such an interview as this  what can your object be  how can i promote your happiness mr tottle’  here was the time for a flourish—‘by allowing me’ replied watkins falling bump on his knees and breaking two bracebuttons and a waistcoatstring in the act—‘by allowing me to be your slave your servant—in short by unreservedly making me the confidant of your heart’s feelings—may i say for the promotion of your own happiness—may i say in order that you may become the wife of a kind and affectionate husband’  ‘disinterested creature’ exclaimed miss lillerton hiding her face in a white pockethandkerchief with an eyelethole border  mr watkins tottle thought that if the lady knew all she might possibly alter her opinion on this last point  he raised the tip of her middle finger ceremoniously to his lips and got off his knees as gracefully as he could  ‘my information was correct’ he tremulously inquired when he was once more on his feet  ‘it was’  watkins elevated his hands and looked up to the ornament in the centre of the ceiling which had been made for a lamp by way of expressing his rapture  ‘our situation mr tottle’ resumed the lady glancing at him through one of the eyeletholes ‘is a most peculiar and delicate one’  ‘it is’ said mr tottle  ‘our acquaintance has been of so short duration’ said miss lillerton  ‘only a week’ assented watkins tottle  ‘oh more than that’ exclaimed the lady in a tone of surprise  ‘indeed’ said tottle  ‘more than a month—more than two months’ said miss lillerton  ‘rather odd this’ thought watkins  ‘oh’ he said recollecting parsons’s assurance that she had known him from report ‘i understand  but my dear madam pray consider  the longer this acquaintance has existed the less reason is i there for delay now  why not at once fix a period for gratifying the hopes of your devoted admirer’  ‘it has been represented to me again and again that this is the course i ought to pursue’ replied miss lillerton ‘but pardon my feelings of delicacy mr tottle—pray excuse this embarrassment—i have peculiar ideas on such subjects and i am quite sure that i never could summon up fortitude enough to name the day to my future husband’  ‘then allow me to name it’ said tottle eagerly  ‘i should like to fix it myself’ replied miss lillerton bashfully but i cannot do so without at once resorting to a third party’  ‘a third party’ thought watkins tottle ‘who the deuce is that to be i wonder’  ‘mr tottle’ continued miss lillerton ‘you have made me a most disinterested and kind offer—that offer i accept  will you at once be the bearer of a note from me to—to mr timson’  ‘mr timson’ said watkins  ‘after what has passed between us’ responded miss lillerton still averting her head ‘you must understand whom i mean mr timson the—the—clergyman’  ‘mr timson the clergyman’ ejaculated watkins tottle in a state of inexpressible beatitude and positive wonder at his own success  ‘angel certainly—this moment’  ‘i’ll prepare it immediately’ said miss lillerton making for the door ‘the events of this day have flurried me so much mr tottle that i shall not leave my room again this evening i will send you the note by the servant’  ‘stay—stay’ cried watkins tottle still keeping a most respectful distance from the lady ‘when shall we meet again’  ‘oh  mr tottle’ replied miss lillerton coquettishly ‘when we are married i can never see you too often nor thank you too much’ and she left the room  mr watkins tottle flung himself into an armchair and indulged in the most delicious reveries of future bliss in which the idea of ‘five hundred pounds per annum with an uncontrolled power of disposing of it by her last will and testament’ was somehow or other the foremost  he had gone through the interview so well and it had terminated so admirably that he almost began to wish he had expressly stipulated for the settlement of the annual five hundred on himself  ‘may i come in’ said mr gabriel parsons peeping in at the door  ‘you may’ replied watkins  ‘well have you done it’ anxiously inquired gabriel  ‘have i done it’ said watkins tottle  ‘hush—i’m going to the clergyman’  ‘no’ said parsons  ‘how well you have managed it’  ‘where does timson live’ inquired watkins  ‘at his uncle’s’ replied gabriel ‘just round the lane  he’s waiting for a living and has been assisting his uncle here for the last two or three months  but how well you have done it—i didn’t think you could have carried it off so’  mr watkins tottle was proceeding to demonstrate that the richardsonian principle was the best on which love could possibly be made when he was interrupted by the entrance of martha with a little pink note folded like a fancy cockedhat  ‘miss lillerton’s compliments’ said martha as she delivered it into tottle’s hands and vanished  ‘do you observe the delicacy’ said tottle appealing to mr gabriel parsons  ‘compliments not love by the servant eh’  mr gabriel parsons didn’t exactly know what reply to make so he poked the forefinger of his right hand between the third and fourth ribs of mr watkins tottle  ‘come’ said watkins when the explosion of mirth consequent on this practical jest had subsided ‘we’ll be off at once—let’s lose no time’  ‘capital’ echoed gabriel parsons and in five minutes they were at the gardengate of the villa tenanted by the uncle of mr timson  ‘is mr charles timson at home’ inquired mr watkins tottle of mr charles timson’s uncle’s man  ‘mr charles is at home’ replied the man stammering ‘but he desired me to say he couldn’t be interrupted sir by any of the parishioners’  ‘i am not a parishioner’ replied watkins  ‘is mr charles writing a sermon tom’ inquired parsons thrusting himself forward  ‘no mr parsons sir he’s not exactly writing a sermon but he is practising the violoncello in his own bedroom and gave strict orders not to be disturbed’  ‘say i’m here’ replied gabriel leading the way across the garden ‘mr parsons and mr tottle on private and particular business’  they were shown into the parlour and the servant departed to deliver his message  the distant groaning of the violoncello ceased footsteps were heard on the stairs and mr timson presented himself and shook hands with parsons with the utmost cordiality  ‘how do you do sir’ said watkins tottle with great solemnity  ‘how do you do sir’ replied timson with as much coldness as if it were a matter of perfect indifference to him how he did as it very likely was  ‘i beg to deliver this note to you’ said watkins tottle producing the cockedhat  ‘from miss lillerton’ said timson suddenly changing colour  ‘pray sit down’  mr watkins tottle sat down and while timson perused the note fixed his eyes on an oystersaucecoloured portrait of the archbishop of canterbury which hung over the fireplace  mr timson rose from his seat when he had concluded the note and looked dubiously at parsons  ‘may i ask’ he inquired appealing to watkins tottle ‘whether our friend here is acquainted with the object of your visit’  ‘our friend is in my confidence’ replied watkins with considerable importance  ‘then sir’ said timson seizing both tottle’s hands ‘allow me in his presence to thank you most unfeignedly and cordially for the noble part you have acted in this affair’  ‘he thinks i recommended him’ thought tottle  ‘confound these fellows they never think of anything but their fees’  ‘i deeply regret having misunderstood your intentions my dear sir’ continued timson  ‘disinterested and manly indeed  there are very few men who would have acted as you have done’  mr watkins tottle could not help thinking that this last remark was anything but complimentary  he therefore inquired rather hastily ‘when is it to be’  ‘on thursday’ replied timson—‘on thursday morning at halfpast eight’  ‘uncommonly early’ observed watkins tottle with an air of triumphant selfdenial  ‘i shall hardly be able to get down here by that hour’ this was intended for a joke  ‘never mind my dear fellow’ replied timson all suavity shaking hands with tottle again most heartily ‘so long as we see you to breakfast you know—’  ‘eh’ said parsons with one of the most extraordinary expressions of countenance that ever appeared in a human face  ‘what’ ejaculated watkins tottle at the same moment  ‘i say that so long as we see you to breakfast’ replied timson ‘we will excuse your being absent from the ceremony though of course your presence at it would give us the utmost pleasure’  mr watkins tottle staggered against the wall and fixed his eyes on timson with appalling perseverance  ‘timson’ said parsons hurriedly brushing his hat with his left arm ‘when you say “us” whom do you mean’  mr timson looked foolish in his turn when he replied ‘why—mrs timson that will be this day week miss lillerton that is—’  ‘now don’t stare at that idiot in the corner’ angrily exclaimed parsons as the extraordinary convulsions of watkins tottle’s countenance excited the wondering gaze of timson—‘but have the goodness to tell me in three words the contents of that note’  ‘this note’ replied timson ‘is from miss lillerton to whom i have been for the last five weeks regularly engaged  her singular scruples and strange feeling on some points have hitherto prevented my bringing the engagement to that termination which i so anxiously desire  she informs me here that she sounded mrs parsons with the view of making her her confidante and gobetween that mrs parsons informed this elderly gentleman mr tottle of the circumstance and that he in the most kind and delicate terms offered to assist us in any way and even undertook to convey this note which contains the promise i have long sought in vain—an act of kindness for which i can never be sufficiently grateful’  ‘good night timson’ said parsons hurrying off and carrying the bewildered tottle with him  ‘won’t you stay—and have something’ said timson  ‘no thank ye’ replied parsons ‘i’ve had quite enough’ and away he went followed by watkins tottle in a state of stupefaction  mr gabriel parsons whistled until they had walked some quarter of a mile past his own gate when he suddenly stopped and said—  ‘you are a clever fellow tottle ain’t you’  ‘i don’t know’ said the unfortunate watkins  ‘i suppose you’ll say this is fanny’s fault won’t you’ inquired gabriel  ‘i don’t know anything about it’ replied the bewildered tottle  ‘well’ said parsons turning on his heel to go home ‘the next time you make an offer you had better speak plainly and don’t throw a chance away  and the next time you’re locked up in a spunginghouse just wait there till i come and take you out there’s a good fellow’  how or at what hour mr watkins tottle returned to cecilstreet is unknown  his boots were seen outside his bedroomdoor next morning but we have the authority of his landlady for stating that he neither emerged therefrom nor accepted sustenance for fourandtwenty hours  at the expiration of that period and when a council of war was being held in the kitchen on the propriety of summoning the parochial beadle to break his door open he rang his bell and demanded a cup of milkandwater the next morning he went through the formalities of eating and drinking as usual but a week afterwards he was seized with a relapse while perusing the list of marriages in a morning paper from which he never perfectly recovered  a few weeks after the lastnamed occurrence the body of a gentleman unknown was found in the regent’s canal  in the trouserspockets were four shillings and threepence halfpenny a matrimonial advertisement from a lady which appeared to have been cut out of a sunday paper a toothpick and a cardcase which it is confidently believed would have led to the identification of the unfortunate gentleman but for the circumstance of there being none but blank cards in it  mr watkins tottle absented himself from his lodgings shortly before  a bill which has not been taken up was presented next morning and a bill which has not been taken down was soon afterwards affixed in his parlourwindow    chapter xi—the bloomsbury christening   mr nicodemus dumps or as his acquaintance called him ‘long dumps’ was a bachelor six feet high and fifty years old cross cadaverous odd and illnatured  he was never happy but when he was miserable and always miserable when he had the best reason to be happy  the only real comfort of his existence was to make everybody about him wretched—then he might be truly said to enjoy life  he was afflicted with a situation in the bank worth five hundred ayear and he rented a ‘firstfloor furnished’ at pentonville which he originally took because it commanded a dismal prospect of an adjacent churchyard  he was familiar with the face of every tombstone and the burial service seemed to excite his strongest sympathy  his friends said he was surly—he insisted he was nervous they thought him a lucky dog but he protested that he was ‘the most unfortunate man in the world’  cold as he was and wretched as he declared himself to be he was not wholly unsusceptible of attachments he revered the memory of hoyle as he was himself an admirable and imperturbable whistplayer and he chuckled with delight at a fretful and impatient adversary  he adored king herod for his massacre of the innocents and if he hated one thing more than another it was a child however he could hardly be said to hate anything in particular because he disliked everything in general but perhaps his greatest antipathies were cabs old women doors that would not shut musical amateurs and omnibus cads  he subscribed to the ‘society for the suppression of vice’ for the pleasure of putting a stop to any harmless amusements and he contributed largely towards the support of two itinerant methodist parsons in the amiable hope that if circumstances rendered any people happy in this world they might perchance be rendered miserable by fears for the next  mr dumps had a nephew who had been married about a year and who was somewhat of a favourite with his uncle because he was an admirable subject to exercise his miserycreating powers upon  mr charles kitterbell was a small sharp spare man with a very large head and a broad goodhumoured countenance  he looked like a faded giant with the head and face partially restored and he had a cast in his eye which rendered it quite impossible for any one with whom he conversed to know where he was looking  his eyes appeared fixed on the wall and he was staring you out of countenance in short there was no catching his eye and perhaps it is a merciful dispensation of providence that such eyes are not catching  in addition to these characteristics it may be added that mr charles kitterbell was one of the most credulous and matteroffact little personages that ever took to himself a wife and for himself a house in great russellstreet bedfordsquare  uncle dumps always dropped the ‘bedfordsquare’ and inserted in lieu thereof the dreadful words ‘tottenhamcourtroad’  ‘no but uncle ’pon my life you must—you must promise to be godfather’ said mr kitterbell as he sat in conversation with his respected relative one morning  ‘i cannot indeed i cannot’ returned dumps  ‘well but why not  jemima will think it very unkind  it’s very little trouble’  ‘as to the trouble’ rejoined the most unhappy man in existence ‘i don’t mind that but my nerves are in that state—i cannot go through the ceremony  you know i don’t like going out—for god’s sake charles don’t fidget with that stool so you’ll drive me mad’  mr kitterbell quite regardless of his uncle’s nerves had occupied himself for some ten minutes in describing a circle on the floor with one leg of the officestool on which he was seated keeping the other three up in the air and holding fast on by the desk  ‘i beg your pardon uncle’ said kitterbell quite abashed suddenly releasing his hold of the desk and bringing the three wandering legs back to the floor with a force sufficient to drive them through it  ‘but come don’t refuse  if it’s a boy you know we must have two godfathers’  ‘if it’s a boy’ said dumps ‘why can’t you say at once whether it is a boy or not’  ‘i should be very happy to tell you but it’s impossible i can undertake to say whether it’s a girl or a boy if the child isn’t born yet’  ‘not born yet’ echoed dumps with a gleam of hope lighting up his lugubrious visage  ‘oh well it may be a girl and then you won’t want me or if it is a boy it may die before it is christened’  ‘i hope not’ said the father that expected to be looking very grave  ‘i hope not’ acquiesced dumps evidently pleased with the subject  he was beginning to get happy  ‘i hope not but distressing cases frequently occur during the first two or three days of a child’s life fits i am told are exceedingly common and alarming convulsions are almost matters of course’  ‘lord uncle’ ejaculated little kitterbell gasping for breath  ‘yes my landlady was confined—let me see—last tuesday an uncommonly fine boy  on the thursday night the nurse was sitting with him upon her knee before the fire and he was as well as possible  suddenly he became black in the face and alarmingly spasmodic  the medical man was instantly sent for and every remedy was tried but—’  ‘how frightful’ interrupted the horrorstricken kitterbell  ‘the child died of course  however your child may not die and if it should be a boy and should live to be christened why i suppose i must be one of the sponsors’  dumps was evidently goodnatured on the faith of his anticipations  ‘thank you uncle’ said his agitated nephew grasping his hand as warmly as if he had done him some essential service  ‘perhaps i had better not tell mrs k what you have mentioned’  ‘why if she’s lowspirited perhaps you had better not mention the melancholy case to her’ returned dumps who of course had invented the whole story ‘though perhaps it would be but doing your duty as a husband to prepare her for the worst’  a day or two afterwards as dumps was perusing a morning paper at the chophouse which he regularly frequented the followingparagraph met his eyes—      ‘births—on saturday the 18th inst in great russellstreet the     lady of charles kitterbell esq of a son’  ‘it is a boy’ he exclaimed dashing down the paper to the astonishment of the waiters  ‘it is a boy’  but he speedily regained his composure as his eye rested on a paragraph quoting the number of infant deaths from the bills of mortality  six weeks passed away and as no communication had been received from the kitterbells dumps was beginning to flatter himself that the child was dead when the following note painfully resolved his doubts—                                                    ‘great russellstreet                                                          monday morning      ‘dear uncle—you will be delighted to hear that my dear jemima has     left her room and that your future godson is getting on capitally     he was very thin at first but he is getting much larger and nurse     says he is filling out every day  he cries a good deal and is a     very singular colour which made jemima and me rather uncomfortable     but as nurse says it’s natural and as of course we know nothing     about these things yet we are quite satisfied with what nurse says     we think he will be a sharp child and nurse says she’s sure he will     because he never goes to sleep  you will readily believe that we are     all very happy only we’re a little worn out for want of rest as he     keeps us awake all night but this we must expect nurse says for     the first six or eight months  he has been vaccinated but in     consequence of the operation being rather awkwardly performed some     small particles of glass were introduced into the arm with the     matter  perhaps this may in some degree account for his being rather     fractious at least so nurse says  we propose to have him     christened at twelve o’clock on friday at saint george’s church in     hartstreet by the name of frederick charles william  pray don’t be     later than a quarter before twelve  we shall have a very few friends     in the evening when of course we shall see you  i am sorry to say     that the dear boy appears rather restless and uneasy today the     cause i fear is fever                                                    ‘believe me dear uncle                                                     ‘yours affectionately                                                       ‘charles kitterbell      ‘ps—i open this note to say that we have just discovered the cause     of little frederick’s restlessness  it is not fever as i     apprehended but a small pin which nurse accidentally stuck in his     leg yesterday evening  we have taken it out and he appears more     composed though he still sobs a good deal’  it is almost unnecessary to say that the perusal of the above interesting statement was no great relief to the mind of the hypochondriacal dumps it was impossible to recede however and so he put the best face—that is to say an uncommonly miserable one—upon the matter and purchased a handsome silver mug for the infant kitterbell upon which he ordered the initials ‘f c w k’ with the customary untrained grapevinelooking flourishes and a large full stop to be engraved forthwith  monday was a fine day tuesday was delightful wednesday was equal to either and thursday was finer than ever four successive fine days in london  hackneycoachmen became revolutionary and crossingsweepers began to doubt the existence of a first cause  the morning herald informed its readers that an old woman in camden town had been heard to say that the fineness of the season was ‘unprecedented in the memory of the oldest inhabitant’ and islington clerks with large families and small salaries left off their black gaiters disdained to carry their once green cotton umbrellas and walked to town in the conscious pride of white stockings and cleanly brushed bluchers  dumps beheld all this with an eye of supreme contempt—his triumph was at hand  he knew that if it had been fine for four weeks instead of four days it would rain when he went out he was lugubriously happy in the conviction that friday would be a wretched day—and so it was  ‘i knew how it would be’ said dumps as he turned round opposite the mansionhouse at halfpast eleven o’clock on the friday morning  ‘i knew how it would be  i am concerned and that’s enough’—and certainly the appearance of the day was sufficient to depress the spirits of a much more buoyanthearted individual than himself  it had rained without a moment’s cessation since eight o’clock everybody that passed up cheapside and down cheapside looked wet cold and dirty  all sorts of forgotten and longconcealed umbrellas had been put into requisition  cabs whisked about with the ‘fare’ as carefully boxed up behind two glazed calico curtains as any mysterious picture in any one of mrs radcliffe’s castles omnibus horses smoked like steamengines nobody thought of ‘standing up’ under doorways or arches they were painfully convinced it was a hopeless case and so everybody went hastily along jumbling and jostling and swearing and perspiring and slipping about like amateur skaters behind wooden chairs on the serpentine on a frosty sunday  dumps paused he could not think of walking being rather smart for the christening  if he took a cab he was sure to be spilt and a hackneycoach was too expensive for his economical ideas  an omnibus was waiting at the opposite corner—it was a desperate case—he had never heard of an omnibus upsetting or running away and if the cad did knock him down he could ‘pull him up’ in return  ‘now sir’ cried the young gentleman who officiated as ‘cad’ to the ‘lads of the village’ which was the name of the machine just noticed dumps crossed  ‘this vay sir’ shouted the driver of the ‘harkaway’ pulling up his vehicle immediately across the door of the opposition—‘this vay sir—he’s full’  dumps hesitated whereupon the ‘lads of the village’ commenced pouring out a torrent of abuse against the ‘harkaway’ but the conductor of the ‘admiral napier’ settled the contest in a most satisfactory manner for all parties by seizing dumps round the waist and thrusting him into the middle of his vehicle which had just come up and only wanted the sixteenth inside  ‘all right’ said the ‘admiral’ and off the thing thundered like a fireengine at full gallop with the kidnapped customer inside standing in the position of a half doubledup bootjack and falling about with every jerk of the machine first on the one side and then on the other like a ‘jackinthegreen’ on mayday setting to the lady with a brass ladle  ‘for heaven’s sake where am i to sit’ inquired the miserable man of an old gentleman into whose stomach he had just fallen for the fourth time  ‘anywhere but on my chest sir’ replied the old gentleman in a surly tone  ‘perhaps the box would suit the gentleman better’ suggested a very damp lawyer’s clerk in a pink shirt and a smirking countenance  after a great deal of struggling and falling about dumps at last managed to squeeze himself into a seat which in addition to the slight disadvantage of being between a window that would not shut and a door that must be open placed him in close contact with a passenger who had been walking about all the morning without an umbrella and who looked as if he had spent the day in a full waterbutt—only wetter  ‘don’t bang the door so’ said dumps to the conductor as he shut it after letting out four of the passengers i am very nervous—it destroys me’  ‘did any gen’lm’n say anythink’ replied the cad thrusting in his head and trying to look as if he didn’t understand the request  ‘i told you not to bang the door so’ repeated dumps with an expression of countenance like the knave of clubs in convulsions  ‘oh vy it’s rather a sing’ler circumstance about this here door sir that it von’t shut without banging’ replied the conductor and he opened the door very wide and shut it again with a terrific bang in proof of the assertion  ‘i beg your pardon sir’ said a little prim wheezing old gentleman sitting opposite dumps ‘i beg your pardon but have you ever observed when you have been in an omnibus on a wet day that four people out of five always come in with large cotton umbrellas without a handle at the top or the brass spike at the bottom’  ‘why sir’ returned dumps as he heard the clock strike twelve ‘it never struck me before but now you mention it i—hollo hollo’ shouted the persecuted individual as the omnibus dashed past drurylane where he had directed to be set down—‘where is the cad’  ‘i think he’s on the box sir’ said the young gentleman before noticed in the pink shirt which looked like a white one ruled with red ink  ‘i want to be set down’ said dumps in a faint voice overcome by his previous efforts  ‘i think these cads want to be set down’ returned the attorney’s clerk chuckling at his sally  ‘hollo’ cried dumps again  ‘hollo’ echoed the passengers  the omnibus passed st giles’s church  ‘hold hard’ said the conductor ‘i’m blowed if we ha’n’t forgot the gen’lm’n as vas to be set down at doorylane—now sir make haste if you please’ he added opening the door and assisting dumps out with as much coolness as if it was ‘all right’  dumps’s indignation was for once getting the better of his cynical equanimity  ‘drurylane’ he gasped with the voice of a boy in a cold bath for the first time  ‘doorylane sir—yes sir—third turning on the righthand side sir’  dumps’s passion was paramount he clutched his umbrella and was striding off with the firm determination of not paying the fare  the cad by a remarkable coincidence happened to entertain a directly contrary opinion and heaven knows how far the altercation would have proceeded if it had not been most ably and satisfactorily brought to a close by the driver  ‘hollo’ said that respectable person standing up on the box and leaning with one hand on the roof of the omnibus  ‘hollo tom tell the gentleman if so be as he feels aggrieved we will take him up to the edgeer edgeware road for nothing and set him down at doorylane when we comes back  he can’t reject that anyhow’  the argument was irresistible dumps paid the disputed sixpence and in a quarter of an hour was on the staircase of no 14 great russellstreet  everything indicated that preparations were making for the reception of ‘a few friends’ in the evening  two dozen extra tumblers and four ditto wineglasses—looking anything but transparent with little bits of straw in them on the slab in the passage just arrived  there was a great smell of nutmeg port wine and almonds on the staircase the covers were taken off the staircarpet and the figure of venus on the first landing looked as if she were ashamed of the compositioncandle in her right hand which contrasted beautifully with the lampblacked drapery of the goddess of love  the female servant who looked very warm and bustling ushered dumps into a front drawingroom very prettily furnished with a plentiful sprinkling of little baskets paper tablemats china watchmen pink and gold albums and rainbowbound little books on the different tables  ‘ah uncle’ said mr kitterbell ‘how d’ye do  allow me—jemima my dear—my uncle  i think you’ve seen jemima before sir’  ‘have had the pleasure’ returned big dumps his tone and look making it doubtful whether in his life he had ever experienced the sensation  ‘i’m sure’ said mrs kitterbell with a languid smile and a slight cough  ‘i’m sure—hem—any friend—of charles’s—hem—much less a relation is—’  ‘i knew you’d say so my love’ said little kitterbell who while he appeared to be gazing on the opposite houses was looking at his wife with a most affectionate air ‘bless you’  the last two words were accompanied with a simper and a squeeze of the hand which stirred up all uncle dumps’s bile  ‘jane tell nurse to bring down baby’ said mrs kitterbell addressing the servant  mrs kitterbell was a tall thin young lady with very light hair and a particularly white face—one of those young women who almost invariably though one hardly knows why recall to one’s mind the idea of a cold fillet of veal  out went the servant and in came the nurse with a remarkably small parcel in her arms packed up in a blue mantle trimmed with white fur—this was the baby  ‘now uncle’ said mr kitterbell lifting up that part of the mantle which covered the infant’s face with an air of great triumph ‘who do you think he’s like’  ‘he he  yes who’ said mrs k putting her arm through her husband’s and looking up into dumps’s face with an expression of as much interest as she was capable of displaying  ‘good god how small he is’ cried the amiable uncle starting back with wellfeigned surprise ‘remarkably small indeed’  ‘do you think so’ inquired poor little kitterbell rather alarmed ‘he’s a monster to what he was—ain’t he nurse’  ‘he’s a dear’ said the nurse squeezing the child and evading the question—not because she scrupled to disguise the fact but because she couldn’t afford to throw away the chance of dumps’s halfcrown  ‘well but who is he like’ inquired little kitterbell  dumps looked at the little pink heap before him and only thought at the moment of the best mode of mortifying the youthful parents  ‘i really don’t know who he’s like’ he answered very well knowing the reply expected of him  ‘don’t you think he’s like me’ inquired his nephew with a knowing air  ‘oh decidedly not’ returned dumps with an emphasis not to be misunderstood  ‘decidedly not like you—oh certainly not’  ‘like jemima’ asked kitterbell faintly  ‘oh dear no not in the least  i’m no judge of course in such cases but i really think he’s more like one of those little carved representations that one sometimes sees blowing a trumpet on a tombstone’  the nurse stooped down over the child and with great difficulty prevented an explosion of mirth  pa and ma looked almost as miserable as their amiable uncle  ‘well’ said the disappointed little father ‘you’ll be better able to tell what he’s like byandby  you shall see him this evening with his mantle off’  ‘thank you’ said dumps feeling particularly grateful  ‘now my love’ said kitterbell to his wife ‘it’s time we were off we’re to meet the other godfather and the godmother at the church uncle—mr and mrs wilson from over the way—uncommonly nice people  my love are you well wrapped up’  ‘yes dear’  ‘are you sure you won’t have another shawl’ inquired the anxious husband  ‘no sweet’ returned the charming mother accepting dumps’s proffered arm and the little party entered the hackneycoach that was to take them to the church dumps amusing mrs kitterbell by expatiating largely on the danger of measles thrush teethcutting and other interesting diseases to which children are subject  the ceremony which occupied about five minutes passed off without anything particular occurring  the clergyman had to dine some distance from town and had two churchings three christenings and a funeral to perform in something less than an hour  the godfathers and godmother therefore promised to renounce the devil and all his works—‘and all that sort of thing’—as little kitterbell said—‘in less than no time’ and with the exception of dumps nearly letting the child fall into the font when he handed it to the clergyman the whole affair went off in the usual businesslike and matterofcourse manner and dumps reentered the bankgates at two o’clock with a heavy heart and the painful conviction that he was regularly booked for an evening party  evening came—and so did dumps’s pumps black silk stockings and white cravat which he had ordered to be forwarded per boy from pentonville the depressed godfather dressed himself at a friend’s countinghouse from whence with his spirits fifty degrees below proof he sallied forth—as the weather had cleared up and the evening was tolerably fine—to walk to great russellstreet  slowly he paced up cheapside newgatestreet down snowhill and up holborn ditto looking as grim as the figurehead of a manofwar and finding out fresh causes of misery at every step  as he was crossing the corner of hattongarden a man apparently intoxicated rushed against him and would have knocked him down had he not been providentially caught by a very genteel young man who happened to be close to him at the time  the shock so disarranged dumps’s nerves as well as his dress that he could hardly stand  the gentleman took his arm and in the kindest manner walked with him as far as furnival’s inn  dumps for about the first time in his life felt grateful and polite and he and the gentlemanlylooking young man parted with mutual expressions of good will  ‘there are at least some welldisposed men in the world’ ruminated the misanthropical dumps as he proceeded towards his destination  rat—tat—tarararararat—knocked a hackneycoachman at kitterbell’s door in imitation of a gentleman’s servant just as dumps reached it and out came an old lady in a large toque and an old gentleman in a blue coat and three female copies of the old lady in pink dresses and shoes to match  ‘it’s a large party’ sighed the unhappy godfather wiping the perspiration from his forehead and leaning against the arearailings it was some time before the miserable man could muster up courage to knock at the door and when he did the smart appearance of a neighbouring greengrocer who had been hired to wait for seven and sixpence and whose calves alone were worth double the money the lamp in the passage and the venus on the landing added to the hum of many voices and the sound of a harp and two violins painfully convinced him that his surmises were but too well founded  ‘how are you’ said little kitterbell in a greater bustle than ever bolting out of the little back parlour with a corkscrew in his hand and various particles of sawdust looking like so many inverted commas on his inexpressibles  ‘good god’ said dumps turning into the aforesaid parlour to put his shoes on which he had brought in his coatpocket and still more appalled by the sight of seven freshdrawn corks and a corresponding number of decanters  ‘how many people are there upstairs’  ‘oh not above thirtyfive  we’ve had the carpet taken up in the back drawingroom and the piano and the cardtables are in the front  jemima thought we’d better have a regular sitdown supper in the front parlour because of the speechifying and all that  but lord uncle what’s the matter’ continued the excited little man as dumps stood with one shoe on rummaging his pockets with the most frightful distortion of visage ‘what have you lost  your pocketbook’  ‘no’ returned dumps diving first into one pocket and then into the other and speaking in a voice like desdemona with the pillow over her mouth  ‘your cardcase snuffbox the key of your lodgings’ continued kitterbell pouring question on question with the rapidity of lightning  ‘no no’ ejaculated dumps still diving eagerly into his empty pockets  ‘not—not—the mug you spoke of this morning’  ‘yes the mug’ replied dumps sinking into a chair  ‘how could you have done it’ inquired kitterbell  ‘are you sure you brought it out’  ‘yes yes  i see it all’ said dumps starting up as the idea flashed across his mind ‘miserable dog that i am—i was born to suffer  i see it all it was the gentlemanlylooking young man’  ‘mr dumps’ shouted the greengrocer in a stentorian voice as he ushered the somewhat recovered godfather into the drawingroom half an hour after the above declaration  ‘mr dumps’—everybody looked at the door and in came dumps feeling about as much out of place as a salmon might be supposed to be on a gravelwalk  ‘happy to see you again’ said mrs kitterbell quite unconscious of the unfortunate man’s confusion and misery ‘you must allow me to introduce you to a few of our friends—my mamma mr dumps—my papa and sisters’ dumps seized the hand of the mother as warmly as if she was his own parent bowed to the young ladies and against a gentleman behind him and took no notice whatever of the father who had been bowing incessantly for three minutes and a quarter  ‘uncle’ said little kitterbell after dumps had been introduced to a select dozen or two ‘you must let me lead you to the other end of the room to introduce you to my friend danton  such a splendid fellow—i’m sure you’ll like him—this way’—dumps followed as tractably as a tame bear  mr danton was a young man of about fiveandtwenty with a considerable stock of impudence and a very small share of ideas he was a great favourite especially with young ladies of from sixteen to twentysix years of age both inclusive  he could imitate the frenchhorn to admiration sang comic songs most inimitably and had the most insinuating way of saying impertinent nothings to his doting female admirers  he had acquired somehow or other the reputation of being a great wit and accordingly whenever he opened his mouth everybody who knew him laughed very heartily  the introduction took place in due form  mr danton bowed and twirled a lady’s handkerchief which he held in his hand in a most comic way everybody smiled  ‘very warm’ said dumps feeling it necessary to say something  ‘yes  it was warmer yesterday’ returned the brilliant mr danton—a general laugh  ‘i have great pleasure in congratulating you on your first appearance in the character of a father sir’ he continued addressing dumps—‘godfather i mean’—the young ladies were convulsed and the gentlemen in ecstasies  a general hum of admiration interrupted the conversation and announced the entrance of nurse with the baby  an universal rush of the young ladies immediately took place  girls are always so fond of babies in company  ‘oh you dear’ said one  ‘how sweet’ cried another in a low tone of the most enthusiastic admiration  ‘heavenly’ added a third  ‘oh what dear little arms’ said a fourth holding up an arm and fist about the size and shape of the leg of a fowl cleanly picked  ‘did you ever’—said a little coquette with a large bustle who looked like a french lithograph appealing to a gentleman in three waistcoats—‘did you ever’  ‘never in my life’ returned her admirer pulling up his collar  ‘oh do let me take it nurse’ cried another young lady  ‘the love’  ‘can it open its eyes nurse’ inquired another affecting the utmost innocence—suffice it to say that the single ladies unanimously voted him an angel and that the married ones nem con agreed that he was decidedly the finest baby they had ever beheld—except their own  the quadrilles were resumed with great spirit  mr danton was universally admitted to be beyond himself several young ladies enchanted the company and gained admirers by singing ‘we met’—‘i saw her at the fancy fair’—and other equally sentimental and interesting ballads  ‘the young men’ as mrs kitterbell said ‘made themselves very agreeable’ the girls did not lose their opportunity and the evening promised to go off excellently  dumps didn’t mind it he had devised a plan for himself—a little bit of fun in his own way—and he was almost happy  he played a rubber and lost every point mr danton said he could not have lost every point because he made a point of losing everybody laughed tremendously  dumps retorted with a better joke and nobody smiled with the exception of the host who seemed to consider it his duty to laugh till he was black in the face at everything  there was only one drawback—the musicians did not play with quite as much spirit as could have been wished  the cause however was satisfactorily explained for it appeared on the testimony of a gentleman who had come up from gravesend in the afternoon that they had been engaged on board a steamer all day and had played almost without cessation all the way to gravesend and all the way back again  the ‘sitdown supper’ was excellent there were four barleysugar temples on the table which would have looked beautiful if they had not melted away when the supper began and a watermill whose only fault was that instead of going round it ran over the tablecloth  then there were fowls and tongue and trifle and sweets and lobster salad and potted beef—and everything  and little kitterbell kept calling out for clean plates and the clean plates did not come and then the gentlemen who wanted the plates said they didn’t mind they’d take a lady’s and then mrs kitterbell applauded their gallantry and the greengrocer ran about till he thought his seven and sixpence was very hardly earned and the young ladies didn’t eat much for fear it shouldn’t look romantic and the married ladies eat as much as possible for fear they shouldn’t have enough and a great deal of wine was drunk and everybody talked and laughed considerably  ‘hush hush’ said mr kitterbell rising and looking very important ‘my love this was addressed to his wife at the other end of the table take care of mrs maxwell and your mamma and the rest of the married ladies the gentlemen will persuade the young ladies to fill their glasses i am sure’  ‘ladies and gentlemen’ said long dumps in a very sepulchral voice and rueful accent rising from his chair like the ghost in don juan ‘will you have the kindness to charge your glasses  i am desirous of proposing a toast’  a dead silence ensued and the glasses were filled—everybody looked serious  ‘ladies and gentlemen’ slowly continued the ominous dumps ‘i’—here mr danton imitated two notes from the frenchhorn in a very loud key which electrified the nervous toastproposer and convulsed his audience  ‘order order’ said little kitterbell endeavouring to suppress his laughter  ‘order’ said the gentlemen  ‘danton be quiet’ said a particular friend on the opposite side of the table  ‘ladies and gentlemen’ resumed dumps somewhat recovered and not much disconcerted for he was always a pretty good hand at a speech—‘in accordance with what is i believe the established usage on these occasions i as one of the godfathers of master frederick charles william kitterbell—here the speaker’s voice faltered for he remembered the mug—venture to rise to propose a toast  i need hardly say that it is the health and prosperity of that young gentleman the particular event of whose early life we are here met to celebrate—applause ladies and gentlemen it is impossible to suppose that our friends here whose sincere wellwishers we all are can pass through life without some trials considerable suffering severe affliction and heavy losses’—here the archtraitor paused and slowly drew forth a long white pockethandkerchief—his example was followed by several ladies ‘that these trials may be long spared them is my most earnest prayer my most fervent wish a distinct sob from the grandmother  i hope and trust ladies and gentlemen that the infant whose christening we have this evening met to celebrate may not be removed from the arms of his parents by premature decay several cambrics were in requisition that his young and now apparently healthy form may not be wasted by lingering disease  here dumps cast a sardonic glance around for a great sensation was manifest among the married ladies  you i am sure will concur with me in wishing that he may live to be a comfort and a blessing to his parents  “hear hear” and an audible sob from mr kitterbell  but should he not be what we could wish—should he forget in after times the duty which he owes to them—should they unhappily experience that distracting truth “how sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless child”’—here mrs kitterbell with her handkerchief to her eyes and accompanied by several ladies rushed from the room and went into violent hysterics in the passage leaving her better half in almost as bad a condition and a general impression in dumps’s favour for people like sentiment after all  it need hardly be added that this occurrence quite put a stop to the harmony of the evening  vinegar hartshorn and cold water were now as much in request as negus routcakes and bonbons had been a short time before  mrs kitterbell was immediately conveyed to her apartment the musicians were silenced flirting ceased and the company slowly departed  dumps left the house at the commencement of the bustle and walked home with a light step and for him a cheerful heart  his landlady who slept in the next room has offered to make oath that she heard him laugh in his peculiar manner after he had locked his door the assertion however is so improbable and bears on the face of it such strong evidence of untruth that it has never obtained credence to this hour  the family of mr kitterbell has considerably increased since the period to which we have referred he has now two sons and a daughter and as he expects at no distant period to have another addition to his blooming progeny he is anxious to secure an eligible godfather for the occasion he is determined however to impose upon him two conditions  he must bind himself by a solemn obligation not to make any speech after supper and it is indispensable that he should be in no way connected with ‘the most miserable man in the world’    chapter xii—the drunkard’s death   we will be bold to say that there is scarcely a man in the constant habit of walking day after day through any of the crowded thoroughfares of london who cannot recollect among the people whom he ‘knows by sight’ to use a familiar phrase some being of abject and wretched appearance whom he remembers to have seen in a very different condition whom he has observed sinking lower and lower by almost imperceptible degrees and the shabbiness and utter destitution of whose appearance at last strike forcibly and painfully upon him as he passes by  is there any man who has mixed much with society or whose avocations have caused him to mingle at one time or other with a great number of people who cannot call to mind the time when some shabby miserable wretch in rags and filth who shuffles past him now in all the squalor of disease and poverty with a respectable tradesman or clerk or a man following some thriving pursuit with good prospects and decent means—or cannot any of our readers call to mind from among the list of their quondam acquaintance some fallen and degraded man who lingers about the pavement in hungry misery—from whom every one turns coldly away and who preserves himself from sheer starvation nobody knows how  alas such cases are of too frequent occurrence to be rare items in any man’s experience and but too often arise from one cause—drunkenness—that fierce rage for the slow sure poison that oversteps every other consideration that casts aside wife children friends happiness and station and hurries its victims madly on to degradation and death  some of these men have been impelled by misfortune and misery to the vice that has degraded them  the ruin of worldly expectations the death of those they loved the sorrow that slowly consumes but will not break the heart has driven them wild and they present the hideous spectacle of madmen slowly dying by their own hands  but by far the greater part have wilfully and with open eyes plunged into the gulf from which the man who once enters it never rises more but into which he sinks deeper and deeper down until recovery is hopeless  such a man as this once stood by the bedside of his dying wife while his children knelt around and mingled loud bursts of grief with their innocent prayers  the room was scantily and meanly furnished and it needed but a glance at the pale form from which the light of life was fast passing away to know that grief and want and anxious care had been busy at the heart for many a weary year  an elderly woman with her face bathed in tears was supporting the head of the dying woman—her daughter—on her arm  but it was not towards her that the was face turned it was not her hand that the cold and trembling fingers clasped they pressed the husband’s arm the eyes so soon to be closed in death rested on his face and the man shook beneath their gaze  his dress was slovenly and disordered his face inflamed his eyes bloodshot and heavy he had been summoned from some wild debauch to the bed of sorrow and death  a shaded lamp by the bedside cast a dim light on the figures around and left the remainder of the room in thick deep shadow  the silence of night prevailed without the house and the stillness of death was in the chamber  a watch hung over the mantelshelf its low ticking was the only sound that broke the profound quiet but it was a solemn one for well they knew who heard it that before it had recorded the passing of another hour it would beat the knell of a departed spirit  it is a dreadful thing to wait and watch for the approach of death to know that hope is gone and recovery impossible and to sit and count the dreary hours through long long nights—such nights as only watchers by the bed of sickness know  it chills the blood to hear the dearest secrets of the heart—the pentup hidden secrets of many years—poured forth by the unconscious helpless being before you and to think how little the reserve and cunning of a whole life will avail when fever and delirium tear off the mask at last  strange tales have been told in the wanderings of dying men tales so full of guilt and crime that those who stood by the sick person’s couch have fled in horror and affright lest they should be scared to madness by what they heard and saw and many a wretch has died alone raving of deeds the very name of which has driven the boldest man away  but no such ravings were to be heard at the bedside by which the children knelt  their halfstifled sobs and moaning alone broke the silence of the lonely chamber  and when at last the mother’s grasp relaxed and turning one look from the children to the father she vainly strove to speak and fell backward on the pillow all was so calm and tranquil that she seemed to sink to sleep  they leant over her they called upon her name softly at first and then in the loud and piercing tones of desperation  but there was no reply  they listened for her breath but no sound came  they felt for the palpitation of the heart but no faint throb responded to the touch  that heart was broken and she was dead  the husband sunk into a chair by the bedside and clasped his hands upon his burning forehead  he gazed from child to child but when a weeping eye met his he quailed beneath its look  no word of comfort was whispered in his ear no look of kindness lighted on his face  all shrunk from and avoided him and when at last he staggered from the room no one sought to follow or console the widower  the time had been when many a friend would have crowded round him in his affliction and many a heartfelt condolence would have met him in his grief  where were they now  one by one friends relations the commonest acquaintance even had fallen off from and deserted the drunkard  his wife alone had clung to him in good and evil in sickness and poverty and how had he rewarded her  he had reeled from the tavern to her bedside in time to see her die  he rushed from the house and walked swiftly through the streets remorse fear shame all crowded on his mind  stupefied with drink and bewildered with the scene he had just witnessed he reentered the tavern he had quitted shortly before  glass succeeded glass  his blood mounted and his brain whirled round  death  every one must die and why not she  she was too good for him her relations had often told him so  curses on them  had they not deserted her and left her to whine away the time at home  well—she was dead and happy perhaps  it was better as it was  another glass—one more  hurrah  it was a merry life while it lasted and he would make the most of it  time went on the three children who were left to him grew up and were children no longer  the father remained the same—poorer shabbier and more dissolutelooking but the same confirmed and irreclaimable drunkard  the boys had long ago run wild in the streets and left him the girl alone remained but she worked hard and words or blows could always procure him something for the tavern  so he went on in the old course and a merry life he led  one night as early as ten o’clock—for the girl had been sick for many days and there was consequently little to spend at the publichouse—he bent his steps homeward bethinking himself that if he would have her able to earn money it would be as well to apply to the parish surgeon or at all events to take the trouble of inquiring what ailed her which he had not yet thought it worth while to do  it was a wet december night the wind blew piercing cold and the rain poured heavily down  he begged a few halfpence from a passerby and having bought a small loaf for it was his interest to keep the girl alive if he could he shuffled onwards as fast as the wind and rain would let him  at the back of fleetstreet and lying between it and the waterside are several mean and narrow courts which form a portion of whitefriars it was to one of these that he directed his steps  the alley into which he turned might for filth and misery have competed with the darkest corner of this ancient sanctuary in its dirtiest and most lawless time  the houses varying from two stories in height to four were stained with every indescribable hue that long exposure to the weather damp and rottenness can impart to tenements composed originally of the roughest and coarsest materials  the windows were patched with paper and stuffed with the foulest rags the doors were falling from their hinges poles with lines on which to dry clothes projected from every casement and sounds of quarrelling or drunkenness issued from every room  the solitary oil lamp in the centre of the court had been blown out either by the violence of the wind or the act of some inhabitant who had excellent reasons for objecting to his residence being rendered too conspicuous and the only light which fell upon the broken and uneven pavement was derived from the miserable candles that here and there twinkled in the rooms of such of the more fortunate residents as could afford to indulge in so expensive a luxury  a gutter ran down the centre of the alley—all the sluggish odours of which had been called forth by the rain and as the wind whistled through the old houses the doors and shutters creaked upon their hinges and the windows shook in their frames with a violence which every moment seemed to threaten the destruction of the whole place  the man whom we have followed into this den walked on in the darkness sometimes stumbling into the main gutter and at others into some branch repositories of garbage which had been formed by the rain until he reached the last house in the court  the door or rather what was left of it stood ajar for the convenience of the numerous lodgers and he proceeded to grope his way up the old and broken stair to the attic story  he was within a step or two of his room door when it opened and a girl whose miserable and emaciated appearance was only to be equalled by that of the candle which she shaded with her hand peeped anxiously out  ‘is that you father’ said the girl  ‘who else should it be’ replied the man gruffly  ‘what are you trembling at  it’s little enough that i’ve had to drink today for there’s no drink without money and no money without work  what the devil’s the matter with the girl’  ‘i am not well father—not at all well’ said the girl bursting into tears  ‘ah’ replied the man in the tone of a person who is compelled to admit a very unpleasant fact to which he would rather remain blind if he could  ‘you must get better somehow for we must have money  you must go to the parish doctor and make him give you some medicine  they’re paid for it damn ’em  what are you standing before the door for  let me come in can’t you’  ‘father’ whispered the girl shutting the door behind her and placing herself before it ‘william has come back’  ‘who’ said the man with a start  ‘hush’ replied the girl ‘william brother william’  ‘and what does he want’ said the man with an effort at composure—‘money meat drink  he’s come to the wrong shop for that if he does  give me the candle—give me the candle fool—i ain’t going to hurt him’  he snatched the candle from her hand and walked into the room  sitting on an old box with his head resting on his hand and his eyes fixed on a wretched cinder fire that was smouldering on the hearth was a young man of about twoandtwenty miserably clad in an old coarse jacket and trousers  he started up when his father entered  ‘fasten the door mary’ said the young man hastily—‘fasten the door you look as if you didn’t know me father  it’s long enough since you drove me from home you may well forget me’  ‘and what do you want here now’ said the father seating himself on a stool on the other side of the fireplace  ‘what do you want here now’  ‘shelter’ replied the son  ‘i’m in trouble that’s enough  if i’m caught i shall swing that’s certain  caught i shall be unless i stop here that’s as certain  and there’s an end of it’  ‘you mean to say you’ve been robbing or murdering then’ said the father  ‘yes i do’ replied the son  ‘does it surprise you father’  he looked steadily in the man’s face but he withdrew his eyes and bent them on the ground  ‘where’s your brothers’ he said after a long pause  ‘where they’ll never trouble you’ replied his son ‘john’s gone to america and henry’s dead’  ‘dead’ said the father with a shudder which even he could not express  ‘dead’ replied the young man  ‘he died in my arms—shot like a dog by a gamekeeper  he staggered back i caught him and his blood trickled down my hands  it poured out from his side like water  he was weak and it blinded him but he threw himself down on his knees on the grass and prayed to god that if his mother was in heaven he would hear her prayers for pardon for her youngest son  “i was her favourite boy will” he said “and i am glad to think now that when she was dying though i was a very young child then and my little heart was almost bursting i knelt down at the foot of the bed and thanked god for having made me so fond of her as to have never once done anything to bring the tears into her eyes  o will why was she taken away and father left” there’s his dying words father’ said the young man ‘make the best you can of ’em  you struck him across the face in a drunken fit the morning we ran away and here’s the end of it’  the girl wept aloud and the father sinking his head upon his knees rocked himself to and fro  ‘if i am taken’ said the young man ‘i shall be carried back into the country and hung for that man’s murder  they cannot trace me here without your assistance father  for aught i know you may give me up to justice but unless you do here i stop until i can venture to escape abroad’  for two whole days all three remained in the wretched room without stirring out  on the third evening however the girl was worse than she had been yet and the few scraps of food they had were gone  it was indispensably necessary that somebody should go out and as the girl was too weak and ill the father went just at nightfall  he got some medicine for the girl and a trifle in the way of pecuniary assistance  on his way back he earned sixpence by holding a horse and he turned homewards with enough money to supply their most pressing wants for two or three days to come  he had to pass the publichouse  he lingered for an instant walked past it turned back again lingered once more and finally slunk in  two men whom he had not observed were on the watch  they were on the point of giving up their search in despair when his loitering attracted their attention and when he entered the publichouse they followed him  ‘you’ll drink with me master’ said one of them proffering him a glass of liquor  ‘and me too’ said the other replenishing the glass as soon as it was drained of its contents  the man thought of his hungry children and his son’s danger  but they were nothing to the drunkard  he did drink and his reason left him  ‘a wet night warden’ whispered one of the men in his ear as he at length turned to go away after spending in liquor onehalf of the money on which perhaps his daughter’s life depended  ‘the right sort of night for our friends in hiding master warden’ whispered the other  ‘sit down here’ said the one who had spoken first drawing him into a corner  ‘we have been looking arter the young un  we came to tell him it’s all right now but we couldn’t find him ’cause we hadn’t got the precise direction  but that ain’t strange for i don’t think he know’d it himself when he come to london did he’  ‘no he didn’t’ replied the father  the two men exchanged glances  ‘there’s a vessel down at the docks to sail at midnight when it’s high water’ resumed the first speaker ‘and we’ll put him on board  his passage is taken in another name and what’s better than that it’s paid for  it’s lucky we met you’  ‘very’ said the second  ‘capital luck’ said the first with a wink to his companion  ‘great’ replied the second with a slight nod of intelligence  ‘another glass here quick’—said the first speaker  and in five minutes more the father had unconsciously yielded up his own son into the hangman’s hands  slowly and heavily the time dragged along as the brother and sister in their miserable hidingplace listened in anxious suspense to the slightest sound  at length a heavy footstep was heard upon the stair it approached nearer it reached the landing and the father staggered into the room  the girl saw that he was intoxicated and advanced with the candle in her hand to meet him she stopped short gave a loud scream and fell senseless on the ground  she had caught sight of the shadow of a man reflected on the floor  they both rushed in and in another instant the young man was a prisoner and handcuffed  ‘very quietly done’ said one of the men to his companion ‘thanks to the old man  lift up the girl tom—come come it’s no use crying young woman  it’s all over now and can’t be helped’  the young man stooped for an instant over the girl and then turned fiercely round upon his father who had reeled against the wall and was gazing on the group with drunken stupidity  ‘listen to me father’ he said in a tone that made the drunkard’s flesh creep  ‘my brother’s blood and mine is on your head i never had kind look or word or care from you and alive or dead i never will forgive you  die when you will or how i will be with you  i speak as a dead man now and i warn you father that as surely as you must one day stand before your maker so surely shall your children be there hand in hand to cry for judgment against you’  he raised his manacled hands in a threatening attitude fixed his eyes on his shrinking parent and slowly left the room and neither father nor sister ever beheld him more on this side of the grave  when the dim and misty light of a winter’s morning penetrated into the narrow court and struggled through the begrimed window of the wretched room warden awoke from his heavy sleep and found himself alone  he rose and looked round him the old flock mattress on the floor was undisturbed everything was just as he remembered to have seen it last and there were no signs of any one save himself having occupied the room during the night  he inquired of the other lodgers and of the neighbours but his daughter had not been seen or heard of  he rambled through the streets and scrutinised each wretched face among the crowds that thronged them with anxious eyes  but his search was fruitless and he returned to his garret when night came on desolate and weary  for many days he occupied himself in the same manner but no trace of his daughter did he meet with and no word of her reached his ears  at length he gave up the pursuit as hopeless  he had long thought of the probability of her leaving him and endeavouring to gain her bread in quiet elsewhere  she had left him at last to starve alone  he ground his teeth and cursed her  he begged his bread from door to door  every halfpenny he could wring from the pity or credulity of those to whom he addressed himself was spent in the old way  a year passed over his head the roof of a jail was the only one that had sheltered him for many months  he slept under archways and in brickfields—anywhere where there was some warmth or shelter from the cold and rain  but in the last stage of poverty disease and houseless want he was a drunkard still  at last one bitter night he sunk down on a doorstep faint and ill the premature decay of vice and profligacy had worn him to the bone  his cheeks were hollow and livid his eyes were sunken and their sight was dim  his legs trembled beneath his weight and a cold shiver ran through every limb  and now the longforgotten scenes of a misspent life crowded thick and fast upon him  he thought of the time when he had a home—a happy cheerful home—and of those who peopled it and flocked about him then until the forms of his elder children seemed to rise from the grave and stand about him—so plain so clear and so distinct they were that he could touch and feel them  looks that he had long forgotten were fixed upon him once more voices long since hushed in death sounded in his ears like the music of village bells  but it was only for an instant  the rain beat heavily upon him and cold and hunger were gnawing at his heart again  he rose and dragged his feeble limbs a few paces further  the street was silent and empty the few passengers who passed by at that late hour hurried quickly on and his tremulous voice was lost in the violence of the storm  again that heavy chill struck through his frame and his blood seemed to stagnate beneath it  he coiled himself up in a projecting doorway and tried to sleep  but sleep had fled from his dull and glazed eyes  his mind wandered strangely but he was awake and conscious  the wellknown shout of drunken mirth sounded in his ear the glass was at his lips the board was covered with choice rich food—they were before him he could see them all he had but to reach out his hand and take them—and though the illusion was reality itself he knew that he was sitting alone in the deserted street watching the raindrops as they pattered on the stones that death was coming upon him by inches—and that there were none to care for or help him  suddenly he started up in the extremity of terror  he had heard his own voice shouting in the night air he knew not what or why  hark  a groan—another  his senses were leaving him halfformed and incoherent words burst from his lips and his hands sought to tear and lacerate his flesh  he was going mad and he shrieked for help till his voice failed him  he raised his head and looked up the long dismal street  he recollected that outcasts like himself condemned to wander day and night in those dreadful streets had sometimes gone distracted with their own loneliness  he remembered to have heard many years before that a homeless wretch had once been found in a solitary corner sharpening a rusty knife to plunge into his own heart preferring death to that endless weary wandering to and fro  in an instant his resolve was taken his limbs received new life he ran quickly from the spot and paused not for breath until he reached the riverside  he crept softly down the steep stone stairs that lead from the commencement of waterloo bridge down to the water’s level  he crouched into a corner and held his breath as the patrol passed  never did prisoner’s heart throb with the hope of liberty and life half so eagerly as did that of the wretched man at the prospect of death  the watch passed close to him but he remained unobserved and after waiting till the sound of footsteps had died away in the distance he cautiously descended and stood beneath the gloomy arch that forms the landingplace from the river  the tide was in and the water flowed at his feet  the rain had ceased the wind was lulled and all was for the moment still and quiet—so quiet that the slightest sound on the opposite bank even the rippling of the water against the barges that were moored there was distinctly audible to his ear  the stream stole languidly and sluggishly on strange and fantastic forms rose to the surface and beckoned him to approach dark gleaming eyes peered from the water and seemed to mock his hesitation while hollow murmurs from behind urged him onwards  he retreated a few paces took a short run desperate leap and plunged into the river  not five seconds had passed when he rose to the water’s surface—but what a change had taken place in that short time in all his thoughts and feelings  life—life in any form poverty misery starvation—anything but death  he fought and struggled with the water that closed over his head and screamed in agonies of terror  the curse of his own son rang in his ears  the shore—but one foot of dry ground—he could almost touch the step  one hand’s breadth nearer and he was saved—but the tide bore him onward under the dark arches of the bridge and he sank to the bottom  again he rose and struggled for life  for one instant—for one brief instant—the buildings on the river’s banks the lights on the bridge through which the current had borne him the black water and the fastflying clouds were distinctly visible—once more he sunk and once again he rose  bright flames of fire shot up from earth to heaven and reeled before his eyes while the water thundered in his ears and stunned him with its furious roar  a week afterwards the body was washed ashore some miles down the river a swollen and disfigured mass  unrecognised and unpitied it was borne to the grave and there it has long since mouldered away     sketches of young gentlemen                              to the young ladies                                   of the

jersey alderney and sark              the humble dedication of their devoted admirer  sheweth—  that your dedicator has perused with feelings of virtuous indignation a work purporting to be ‘sketches of young ladies’ written by quiz illustrated by phiz and published in one volume square twelvemo  that after an attentive and vigilant perusal of the said work your dedicator is humbly of opinion that so many libels upon your honourable sex were never contained in any previously published work in twelvemo or any other mo  that in the title page and preface to the said work your honourable sex are described and classified as animals and although your dedicator is not at present prepared to deny that you are animals still he humbly submits that it is not polite to call you so  that in the aforesaid preface your honourable sex are also described as troglodites which being a hard word may for aught your honourable sex or your dedicator can say to the contrary be an injurious and disrespectful appellation  that the author of the said work applied himself to his task in malice prepense and with wickedness aforethought a fact which your dedicator contends is sufficiently demonstrated by his assuming the name of quiz which your dedicator submits denotes a foregone conclusion and implies an intention of quizzing  that in the execution of his evil design the said quiz or author of the said work must have betrayed some trust or confidence reposed in him by some members of your honourable sex otherwise he never could have acquired so much information relative to the manners and customs of your honourable sex in general  that actuated by these considerations and further moved by various slanders and insinuations respecting your honourable sex contained in the said work square twelvemo entitled ‘sketches of young ladies’ your dedicator ventures to produce another work square twelvemo entitled ‘sketches of young gentlemen’ of which he now solicits your acceptance and approval  that as the young ladies are the best companions of the young gentlemen so the young gentlemen should be the best companions of the young ladies and extending the comparison from animals to quote the disrespectful language of the said quiz to inanimate objects your dedicator humbly suggests that such of your honourable sex as purchased the bane should possess themselves of the antidote and that those of your honourable sex who were not rash enough to take the first should lose no time in swallowing the last—prevention being in all cases better than cure as we are informed upon the authority not only of general acknowledgment but also of traditionary wisdom  that with reference to the said bane and antidote your dedicator has no further remarks to make than are comprised in the printed directions issued with doctor morison’s pills namely that whenever your honourable sex take twentyfive of number 1 you will be pleased to take fifty of number 2 without delay                                     and your dedicator shall ever pray c    the bashful young gentleman   we found ourself seated at a small dinner party the other day opposite a stranger of such singular appearance and manner that he irresistibly attracted our attention  this was a freshcoloured young gentleman with as good a promise of light whisker as one might wish to see and possessed of a very velvetlike softlooking countenance  we do not use the latter term invidiously but merely to denote a pair of smooth plump highlycoloured cheeks of capacious dimensions and a mouth rather remarkable for the fresh hue of the lips than for any marked or striking expression it presented  his whole face was suffused with a crimson blush and bore that downcast timid retiring look which betokens a man ill at ease with himself  there was nothing in these symptoms to attract more than a passing remark but our attention had been originally drawn to the bashful young gentleman on his first appearance in the drawingroom abovestairs into which he was no sooner introduced than making his way towards us who were standing in a window and wholly neglecting several persons who warmly accosted him he seized our hand with visible emotion and pressed it with a convulsive grasp for a good couple of minutes after which he dived in a nervous manner across the room oversetting in his way a fine little girl of six years and a quarter old—and shrouding himself behind some hangings was seen no more until the eagle eye of the hostess detecting him in his concealment on the announcement of dinner he was requested to pair off with a lively single lady of two or three and thirty  this most flattering salutation from a perfect stranger would have gratified us not a little as a token of his having held us in high respect and for that reason been desirous of our acquaintance if we had not suspected from the first that the young gentleman in making a desperate effort to get through the ceremony of introduction had in the bewilderment of his ideas shaken hands with us at random  this impression was fully confirmed by the subsequent behaviour of the bashful young gentleman in question which we noted particularly with the view of ascertaining whether we were right in our conjecture  the young gentleman seated himself at table with evident misgivings and turning sharp round to pay attention to some observation of his loquacious neighbour overset his bread  there was nothing very bad in this and if he had had the presence of mind to let it go and say nothing about it nobody but the man who had laid the cloth would have been a bit the wiser but the young gentleman in various semisuccessful attempts to prevent its fall played with it a little as gentlemen in the streets may be seen to do with their hats on a windy day and then giving the roll a smart rap in his anxiety to catch it knocked it with great adroitness into a tureen of white soup at some distance to the unspeakable terror and disturbance of a very amiable bald gentleman who was dispensing the contents  we thought the bashful young gentleman would have gone off in an apoplectic fit consequent upon the violent rush of blood to his face at the occurrence of this catastrophe  from this moment we perceived in the phraseology of the fancy that it was ‘all up’ with the bashful young gentleman and so indeed it was several benevolent persons endeavoured to relieve his embarrassment by taking wine with him but finding that it only augmented his sufferings and that after mingling sherry champagne hock and moselle together he applied the greater part of the mixture externally instead of internally they gradually dropped off and left him to the exclusive care of the talkative lady who not noting the wildness of his eye firmly believed she had secured a listener  he broke a glass or two in the course of the meal and disappeared shortly afterwards it is inferred that he went away in some confusion inasmuch as he left the house in another gentleman’s coat and the footman’s hat  this little incident led us to reflect upon the most prominent characteristics of bashful young gentlemen in the abstract and as this portable volume will be the great textbook of young ladies in all future generations we record them here for their guidance and behoof  if the bashful young gentleman in turning a street corner chance to stumble suddenly upon two or three young ladies of his acquaintance nothing can exceed his confusion and agitation  his first impulse is to make a great variety of bows and dart past them which he does until observing that they wish to stop but are uncertain whether to do so or not he makes several feints of returning which causes them to do the same and at length after a great quantity of unnecessary dodging and falling up against the other passengers he returns and shakes hands most affectionately with all of them in doing which he knocks out of their grasp sundry little parcels which he hastily picks up and returns very muddy and disordered  the chances are that the bashful young gentleman then observes it is very fine weather and being reminded that it has only just left off raining for the first time these three days he blushes very much and smiles as if he had said a very good thing  the young lady who was most anxious to speak here inquires with an air of great commiseration how his dear sister harriet is today to which the young gentleman without the slightest consideration replies with many thanks that she is remarkably well  ‘well mr hopkins’ cries the young lady ‘why we heard she was bled yesterday evening and have been perfectly miserable about her’  ‘oh ah’ says the young gentleman ‘so she was  oh she’s very ill very ill indeed’  the young gentleman then shakes his head and looks very desponding he has been smiling perpetually up to this time and after a short pause gives his glove a great wrench at the wrist and says with a strong emphasis on the adjective ‘good morning good morning’  and making a great number of bows in acknowledgment of several little messages to his sister walks backward a few paces and comes with great violence against a lamppost knocking his hat off in the contact which in his mental confusion and bodily pain he is going to walk away without until a great roar from a carter attracts his attention when he picks it up and tries to smile cheerfully to the young ladies who are looking back and who he has the satisfaction of seeing are all laughing heartily  at a quadrille party the bashful young gentleman always remains as near the entrance of the room as possible from which position he smiles at the people he knows as they come in and sometimes steps forward to shake hands with more intimate friends a process which on each repetition seems to turn him a deeper scarlet than before  he declines dancing the first set or two observing in a faint voice that he would rather wait a little but at length is absolutely compelled to allow himself to be introduced to a partner when he is led in a great heat and blushing furiously across the room to a spot where halfadozen unknown ladies are congregated together  ‘miss lambert let me introduce mr hopkins for the next quadrille’ miss lambert inclines her head graciously  mr hopkins bows and his fair conductress disappears leaving mr hopkins as he too well knows to make himself agreeable  the young lady more than half expects that the bashful young gentleman will say something and the bashful young gentleman feeling this seriously thinks whether he has got anything to say which upon mature reflection he is rather disposed to conclude he has not since nothing occurs to him  meanwhile the young lady after several inspections of her bouquet all made in the expectation that the bashful young gentleman is going to talk whispers her mamma who is sitting next her which whisper the bashful young gentleman immediately suspects and possibly with very good reason must be about him  in this comfortable condition he remains until it is time to ‘stand up’ when murmuring a ‘will you allow me’ he gives the young lady his arm and after inquiring where she will stand and receiving a reply that she has no choice conducts her to the remotest corner of the quadrille and making one attempt at conversation which turns out a desperate failure preserves a profound silence until it is all over when he walks her twice round the room deposits her in her old seat and retires in confusion  a married bashful gentleman—for these bashful gentlemen do get married sometimes how it is ever brought about is a mystery to us—a married bashful gentleman either causes his wife to appear bold by contrast or merges her proper importance in his own insignificance  bashful young gentlemen should be cured or avoided  they are never hopeless and never will be while female beauty and attractions retain their influence as any young lady will find who may think it worth while on this confident assurance to take a patient in hand    the outandout young gentleman   outandout young gentlemen may be divided into two classes—those who have something to do and those who have nothing  i shall commence with the former because that species come more frequently under the notice of young ladies whom it is our province to warn and to instruct  the outandout young gentleman is usually no great dresser his instructions to his tailor being all comprehended in the one general direction to ‘make that what’saname a regular bangup sort of thing’ for some years past the favourite costume of the outandout young gentleman has been a rough pilot coat with two gilt hooks and eyes to the velvet collar buttons somewhat larger than crownpieces a black or fancy neckerchief loosely tied a widebrimmed hat with a low crown tightish inexpressibles and ironshod boots  out of doors he sometimes carries a large ash stick but only on special occasions for he prefers keeping his hands in his coat pockets  he smokes at all hours of course and swears considerably  the outandout young gentleman is employed in a city countinghouse or solicitor’s office in which he does as little as he possibly can his chief places of resort are the streets the taverns and the theatres in the streets at evening time outandout young gentlemen have a pleasant custom of walking six or eight abreast thus driving females and other inoffensive persons into the road which never fails to afford them the highest satisfaction especially if there be any immediate danger of their being run over which enhances the fun of the thing materially  in all places of public resort the outandouters are careful to select each a seat to himself upon which he lies at full length and if the weather be very dirty but not in any other case he lies with his knees up and the soles of his boots planted firmly on the cushion so that if any low fellow should ask him to make room for a lady he takes ample revenge upon her dress without going at all out of his way to do it  he always sits with his hat on and flourishes his stick in the air while the play is proceeding with a dignified contempt of the performance if it be possible for one or two outandout young gentlemen to get up a little crowding in the passages they are quite in their element squeezing pushing whooping and shouting in the most humorous manner possible  if they can only succeed in irritating the gentleman who has a family of daughters under his charge they are like to die with laughing and boast of it among their companions for a week afterwards adding that one or two of them were ‘devilish fine girls’ and that they really thought the youngest would have fainted which was the only thing wanted to render the joke complete  if the outandout young gentleman have a mother and sisters of course he treats them with becoming contempt inasmuch as they poor things having no notion of life or gaiety are far too weakspirited and moping for him  sometimes however on a birthday or at christmastime he cannot very well help accompanying them to a party at some old friend’s with which view he comes home when they have been dressed an hour or two smelling very strongly of tobacco and spirits and after exchanging his rough coat for some more suitable attire in which however he loses nothing of the outandouter gets into the coach and grumbles all the way at his own good nature his bitter reflections aggravated by the recollection that tom smith has taken the chair at a little impromptu dinner at a fighting man’s and that a setto was to take place on a diningtable between the fighting man and his brotherinlaw which is probably ‘coming off’ at that very instant  as the outandout young gentleman is by no means at his ease in ladies’ society he shrinks into a corner of the drawingroom when they reach the friend’s and unless one of his sisters is kind enough to talk to him remains there without being much troubled by the attentions of other people until he espies lingering outside the door another gentleman whom he at once knows by his air and manner for there is a kind of freemasonry in the craft to be a brother outandouter and towards whom he accordingly makes his way  conversation being soon opened by some casual remark the second outandouter confidentially informs the first that he is one of the rough sort and hates that kind of thing only he couldn’t very well be off coming to which the other replies that that’s just his case—‘and i’ll tell you what’ continues the outandouter in a whisper ‘i should like a glass of warm brandy and water just now’—‘or a pint of stout and a pipe’ suggests the other outandouter  the discovery is at once made that they are sympathetic souls each of them says at the same moment that he sees the other understands what’s what and they become fast friends at once more especially when it appears that the second outandouter is no other than a gentleman long favourably known to his familiars as ‘mr warmint blake’ who upon divers occasions has distinguished himself in a manner that would not have disgraced the fighting man and who—having been a pretty long time about town—had the honour of once shaking hands with the celebrated mr thurtell himself  at supper these gentlemen greatly distinguish themselves brightening up very much when the ladies leave the table and proclaiming aloud their intention of beginning to spend the evening—a process which is generally understood to be satisfactorily performed when a great deal of wine is drunk and a great deal of noise made both of which feats the outandout young gentlemen execute to perfection  having protracted their sitting until long after the host and the other guests have adjourned to the drawingroom and finding that they have drained the decanters empty they follow them thither with complexions rather heightened and faces rather bloated with wine and the agitated lady of the house whispers her friends as they waltz together to the great terror of the whole room that ‘both mr blake and mr dummins are very nice sort of young men in their way only they are eccentric persons and unfortunately rather too wild’  the remaining class of outandout young gentlemen is composed of persons who having no money of their own and a soul above earning any enjoy similar pleasures nobody knows how  these respectable gentlemen without aiming quite so much at the outandout in external appearance are distinguished by all the same amiable and attractive characteristics in an equal or perhaps greater degree and now and then find their way into society through the medium of the other class of outandout young gentlemen who will sometimes carry them home and who usually pay their tavern bills  as they are equally gentlemanly clever witty intelligent wise and wellbred we need scarcely have recommended them to the peculiar consideration of the young ladies if it were not that some of the gentle creatures whom we hold in such high respect are perhaps a little too apt to confound a great many heavier terms with the light word eccentricity which we beg them henceforth to take in a strictly johnsonian sense without any liberality or latitude of construction    the very friendly young gentleman   we know—and all people know—so many specimens of this class that in selecting the few heads our limits enable us to take from a great number we have been induced to give the very friendly young gentleman the preference over many others to whose claims upon a more cursory view of the question we had felt disposed to assign the priority  the very friendly young gentleman is very friendly to everybody but he attaches himself particularly to two or at most to three families regulating his choice by their dinners their circle of acquaintance or some other criterion in which he has an immediate interest  he is of any age between twenty and forty unmarried of course must be fond of children and is expected to make himself generally useful if possible let us illustrate our meaning by an example which is the shortest mode and the clearest  we encountered one day by chance an old friend of whom we had lost sight for some years and who—expressing a strong anxiety to renew our former intimacy—urged us to dine with him on an early day that we might talk over old times  we readily assented adding that we hoped we should be alone  ‘oh certainly certainly’ said our friend ‘not a soul with us but mincin’  ‘and who is mincin’ was our natural inquiry ‘o don’t mind him’ replied our friend ‘he’s a most particular friend of mine and a very friendly fellow you will find him’ and so he left us  ‘we thought no more about mincin until we duly presented ourselves at the house next day when after a hearty welcome our friend motioned towards a gentleman who had been previously showing his teeth by the fireplace and gave us to understand that it was mr mincin of whom he had spoken it required no great penetration on our part to discover at once that mr mincin was in every respect a very friendly young gentleman  ‘i am delighted’ said mincin hastily advancing and pressing our hand warmly between both of his ‘i am delighted i am sure to make your acquaintance—here he smiled—very much delighted indeed—here he exhibited a little emotion—i assure you that i have looked forward to it anxiously for a very long time’ here he released our hands and rubbing his own observed that the day was severe but that he was delighted to perceive from our appearance that it agreed with us wonderfully and then went on to observe that notwithstanding the coldness of the weather he had that morning seen in the paper an exceedingly curious paragraph to the effect that there was now in the garden of mr wilkins of chichester a pumpkin measuring four feet in height and eleven feet seven inches in circumference which he looked upon as a very extraordinary piece of intelligence  we ventured to remark that we had a dim recollection of having once or twice before observed a similar paragraph in the public prints upon which mr mincin took us confidentially by the button and said exactly exactly to be sure we were very right and he wondered what the editors meant by putting in such things  who the deuce he should like to know did they suppose cared about them that struck him as being the best of it  the lady of the house appeared shortly afterwards and mr mincin’s friendliness as will readily be supposed suffered no diminution in consequence he exerted much strength and skill in wheeling a large easychair up to the fire and the lady being seated in it carefully closed the door stirred the fire and looked to the windows to see that they admitted no air having satisfied himself upon all these points he expressed himself quite easy in his mind and begged to know how she found herself today  upon the lady’s replying very well mr mincin who it appeared was a medical gentleman offered some general remarks upon the nature and treatment of colds in the head which occupied us agreeably until dinnertime  during the meal he devoted himself to complimenting everybody not forgetting himself so that we were an uncommonly agreeable quartette  ‘i’ll tell you what capper’ said mr mincin to our host as he closed the room door after the lady had retired ‘you have very great reason to be fond of your wife  sweet woman mrs capper sir’  ‘nay mincin—i beg’ interposed the host as we were about to reply that mrs capper unquestionably was particularly sweet  ‘pray mincin don’t’  ‘why not’ exclaimed mr mincin ‘why not  why should you feel any delicacy before your old friend—our old friend if i may be allowed to call you so sir why should you i ask’  we of course wished to know why he should also upon which our friend admitted that mrs capper was a very sweet woman at which admission mr mincin cried ‘bravo’ and begged to propose mrs capper with heartfelt enthusiasm whereupon our host said ‘thank you mincin’ with deep feeling and gave us in a low voice to understand that mincin had saved mrs capper’s cousin’s life no less than fourteen times in a year and a half which he considered no common circumstance—an opinion to which we most cordially subscribed  now that we three were left to entertain ourselves with conversation mr mincin’s extreme friendliness became every moment more apparent he was so amazingly friendly indeed that it was impossible to talk about anything in which he had not the chief concern  we happened to allude to some affairs in which our friend and we had been mutually engaged nearly fourteen years before when mr mincin was all at once reminded of a joke which our friend had made on that day four years which he positively must insist upon telling—and which he did tell accordingly with many pleasant recollections of what he said and what mrs capper said and how he well remembered that they had been to the play with orders on the very night previous and had seen romeo and juliet and the pantomime and how mrs capper being faint had been led into the lobby where she smiled said it was nothing after all and went back again with many other interesting and absorbing particulars after which the friendly young gentleman went on to assure us that our friend had experienced a marvellously prophetic opinion of that same pantomime which was of such an admirable kind that two morning papers took the same view next day to this our friend replied with a little triumph that in that instance he had some reason to think he had been correct which gave the friendly young gentleman occasion to believe that our friend was always correct and so we went on until our friend filling a bumper said he must drink one glass to his dear friend mincin than whom he would say no man saved the lives of his acquaintances more or had a more friendly heart finally our friend having emptied his glass said ‘god bless you mincin’—and mr mincin and he shook hands across the table with much affection and earnestness  but great as the friendly young gentleman is in a limited scene like this he plays the same part on a larger scale with increased éclat mr mincin is invited to an evening party with his dear friends the martins where he meets his dear friends the cappers and his dear friends the watsons and a hundred other dear friends too numerous to mention  he is as much at home with the martins as with the cappers but how exquisitely he balances his attentions and divides them among his dear friends  if he flirts with one of the miss watsons he has one little martin on the sofa pulling his hair and the other little martin on the carpet riding on his foot  he carries mrs watson down to supper on one arm and miss martin on the other and takes wine so judiciously and in such exact order that it is impossible for the most punctilious old lady to consider herself neglected  if any young lady being prevailed upon to sing become nervous afterwards mr mincin leads her tenderly into the next room and restores her with port wine which she must take medicinally  if any gentleman be standing by the piano during the progress of the ballad mr mincin seizes him by the arm at one point of the melody and softly beating time the while with his head expresses in dumb show his intense perception of the delicacy of the passage  if anybody’s selflove is to be flattered mr mincin is at hand  if anybody’s overweening vanity is to be pampered mr mincin will surfeit it  what wonder that people of all stations and ages recognise mr mincin’s friendliness that he is universally allowed to be handsome as amiable that mothers think him an oracle daughters a dear brothers a beau and fathers a wonder  and who would not have the reputation of the very friendly young gentleman    the military young gentleman   we are rather at a loss to imagine how it has come to pass that military young gentlemen have obtained so much favour in the eyes of the young ladies of this kingdom  we cannot think so lightly of them as to suppose that the mere circumstance of a man’s wearing a red coat ensures him a ready passport to their regard and even if this were the case it would be no satisfactory explanation of the circumstance because although the analogy may in some degree hold good in the case of mail coachmen and guards still general postmen wear red coats and they are not to our knowledge better received than other men nor are firemen either who wear or used to wear not only red coats but very resplendent and massive badges besides—much larger than epaulettes  neither do the twopenny postoffice boys if the result of our inquiries be correct find any peculiar favour in woman’s eyes although they wear very bright red jackets and have the additional advantage of constantly appearing in public on horseback which last circumstance may be naturally supposed to be greatly in their favour  we have sometimes thought that this phenomenon may take its rise in the conventional behaviour of captains and colonels and other gentlemen in red coats on the stage where they are invariably represented as fine swaggering fellows talking of nothing but charming girls their king and country their honour and their debts and crowing over the inferior classes of the community whom they occasionally treat with a little gentlemanly swindling no less to the improvement and pleasure of the audience than to the satisfaction and approval of the choice spirits who consort with them  but we will not devote these pages to our speculations upon the subject inasmuch as our business at the present moment is not so much with the young ladies who are bewitched by her majesty’s livery as with the young gentlemen whose heads are turned by it  for ‘heads’ we had written ‘brains’ but upon consideration we think the former the more appropriate word of the two  these young gentlemen may be divided into two classes—young gentlemen who are actually in the army and young gentlemen who having an intense and enthusiastic admiration for all things appertaining to a military life are compelled by adverse fortune or adverse relations to wear out their existence in some ignoble countinghouse  we will take this latter description of military young gentlemen first  the whole heart and soul of the military young gentleman are concentrated in his favourite topic  there is nothing that he is so learned upon as uniforms he will tell you without faltering for an instant what the habiliments of any one regiment are turned up with what regiment wear stripes down the outside and inside of the leg and how many buttons the tenth had on their coats he knows to a fraction how many yards and odd inches of gold lace it takes to make an ensign in the guards is deeply read in the comparative merits of different bands and the apparelling of trumpeters and is very luminous indeed in descanting upon ‘crack regiments’ and the ‘crack’ gentlemen who compose them of whose mightiness and grandeur he is never tired of telling  we were suggesting to a military young gentleman only the other day after he had related to us several dazzling instances of the profusion of halfadozen honourable ensign somebodies or nobodies in the articles of kid gloves and polished boots that possibly ‘cracked’ regiments would be an improvement upon ‘crack’ as being a more expressive and appropriate designation when he suddenly interrupted us by pulling out his watch and observing that he must hurry off to the park in a cab or he would be too late to hear the band play  not wishing to interfere with so important an engagement and being in fact already slightly overwhelmed by the anecdotes of the honourable ensigns aforementioned we made no attempt to detain the military young gentleman but parted company with ready goodwill  some three or four hours afterwards we chanced to be walking down whitehall on the admiralty side of the way when as we drew near to one of the little stone places in which a couple of horse soldiers mount guard in the daytime we were attracted by the motionless appearance and eager gaze of a young gentleman who was devouring both man and horse with his eyes so eagerly that he seemed deaf and blind to all that was passing around him  we were not much surprised at the discovery that it was our friend the military young gentleman but we were a little astonished when we returned from a walk to south lambeth to find him still there looking on with the same intensity as before  as it was a very windy day we felt bound to awaken the young gentleman from his reverie when he inquired of us with great enthusiasm whether ‘that was not a glorious spectacle’ and proceeded to give us a detailed account of the weight of every article of the spectacle’s trappings from the man’s gloves to the horse’s shoes  we have made it a practice since to take the horse guards in our daily walk and we find it is the custom of military young gentlemen to plant themselves opposite the sentries and contemplate them at leisure in periods varying from fifteen minutes to fifty and averaging twentyfive we were much struck a day or two since by the behaviour of a very promising young butcher who evincing an interest in the service which cannot be too strongly commanded or encouraged after a prolonged inspection of the sentry proceeded to handle his boots with great curiosity and as much composure and indifference as if the man were waxwork  but the really military young gentleman is waiting all this time and at the very moment that an apology rises to our lips he emerges from the barrack gate he is quartered in a garrison town and takes the way towards the high street  he wears his undress uniform which somewhat mars the glory of his outward man but still how great how grand he is what a happy mixture of ease and ferocity in his gait and carriage and how lightly he carries that dreadful sword under his arm making no more ado about it than if it were a silk umbrella  the lion is sleeping only think if an enemy were in sight how soon he’d whip it out of the scabbard and what a terrible fellow he would be  but he walks on thinking of nothing less than blood and slaughter and now he comes in sight of three other military young gentlemen arminarm who are bearing down towards him clanking their iron heels on the pavement and clashing their swords with a noise which should cause all peaceful men to quail at heart  they stop to talk  see how the flaxenhaired young gentleman with the weak legs—he who has his pockethandkerchief thrust into the breast of his coatglares upon the fainthearted civilians who linger to look upon his glory how the next young gentleman elevates his head in the air and majestically places his arms akimbo while the third stands with his legs very wide apart and clasps his hands behind him  well may we inquire—not in familiar jest but in respectful earnest—if you call that nothing  oh if some encroaching foreign power—the emperor of russia for instance or any of those deep fellows could only see those military young gentlemen as they move on together towards the billiardroom over the way wouldn’t he tremble a little  and then at the theatre at night when the performances are by command of colonel fitzsordust and the officers of the garrison—what a splendid sight it is  how sternly the defenders of their country look round the house as if in mute assurance to the audience that they may make themselves comfortable regarding any foreign invasion for they the military young gentlemen are keeping a sharp lookout and are ready for anything  and what a contrast between them and that stagebox full of greyheaded officers with tokens of many battles about them who have nothing at all in common with the military young gentlemen and who—but for an oldfashioned kind of manly dignity in their looks and bearing—might be common hardworking soldiers for anything they take the pains to announce to the contrary  ah here is a family just come in who recognise the flaxenheaded young gentleman and the flaxenheaded young gentleman recognises them too only he doesn’t care to show it just now  very well done indeed  he talks louder to the little group of military young gentlemen who are standing by him and coughs to induce some ladies in the next box but one to look round in order that their faces may undergo the same ordeal of criticism to which they have subjected in not a wholly inaudible tone the majority of the female portion of the audience  oh a gentleman in the same box looks round as if he were disposed to resent this as an impertinence and the flaxenheaded young gentleman sees his friends at once and hurries away to them with the most charming cordiality  three young ladies one young man and the mamma of the party receive the military young gentleman with great warmth and politeness and in five minutes afterwards the military young gentleman stimulated by the mamma introduces the two other military young gentlemen with whom he was walking in the morning who take their seats behind the young ladies and commence conversation whereat the mamma bestows a triumphant bow upon a rival mamma who has not succeeded in decoying any military young gentlemen and prepares to consider her visitors from that moment three of the most elegant and superior young gentlemen in the whole world    the political young gentleman   once upon a time—not in the days when pigs drank wine but in a more recent period of our history—it was customary to banish politics when ladies were present  if this usage still prevailed we should have had no chapter for political young gentlemen for ladies would have neither known nor cared what kind of monster a political young gentleman was but as this good custom in common with many others has ‘gone out’ and left no word when it is likely to be home again as political young ladies are by no means rare and political young gentlemen the very reverse of scarce we are bound in the strict discharge of our most responsible duty not to neglect this natural division of our subject  if the political young gentleman be resident in a country town and there are political young gentlemen in country towns sometimes he is wholly absorbed in his politics as a pair of purple spectacles communicate the same uniform tint to all objects near and remote so the political glasses with which the young gentleman assists his mental vision give to everything the hue and tinge of party feeling  the political young gentleman would as soon think of being struck with the beauty of a young lady in the opposite interest as he would dream of marrying his sister to the opposite member  if the political young gentleman be a conservative he has usually some vague ideas about ireland and the pope which he cannot very clearly explain but which he knows are the right sort of thing and not to be very easily got over by the other side  he has also some choice sentences regarding church and state culled from the banners in use at the last election with which he intersperses his conversation at intervals with surprising effect  but his great topic is the constitution upon which he will declaim by the hour together with much heat and fury not that he has any particular information on the subject but because he knows that the constitution is somehow church and state and church and state somehow the constitution and that the fellows on the other side say it isn’t which is quite a sufficient reason for him to say it is and to stick to it  perhaps his greatest topic of all though is the people  if a fight takes place in a populous town in which many noses are broken and a few windows the young gentleman throws down the newspaper with a triumphant air and exclaims ‘here’s your precious people’  if halfadozen boys run across the course at race time when it ought to be kept clear the young gentleman looks indignantly round and begs you to observe the conduct of the people if the gallery demand a hornpipe between the play and the afterpiece the same young gentleman cries ‘no’ and ‘shame’ till he is hoarse and then inquires with a sneer what you think of popular moderation now in short the people form a neverfailing theme for him and when the attorney on the side of his candidate dwells upon it with great power of eloquence at election time as he never fails to do the young gentleman and his friends and the body they head cheer with great violence against the other people with whom of course they have no possible connexion  in much the same manner the audience at a theatre never fail to be highly amused with any jokes at the expense of the public—always laughing heartily at some other public and never at themselves  if the political young gentleman be a radical he is usually a very profound person indeed having great store of theoretical questions to put to you with an infinite variety of possible cases and logical deductions therefrom  if he be of the utilitarian school too which is more than probable he is particularly pleasant company having many ingenious remarks to offer upon the voluntary principle and various cheerful disquisitions connected with the population of the country the position of great britain in the scale of nations and the balance of power  then he is exceedingly well versed in all doctrines of political economy as laid down in the newspapers and knows a great many parliamentary speeches by heart nay he has a small stock of aphorisms none of them exceeding a couple of lines in length which will settle the toughest question and leave you nothing to say  he gives all the young ladies to understand that miss martineau is the greatest woman that ever lived and when they praise the good looks of mr hawkins the new member says he’s very well for a representative all things considered but he wants a little calling to account and he is more than half afraid it will be necessary to bring him down on his knees for that vote on the miscellaneous estimates  at this the young ladies express much wonderment and say surely a member of parliament is not to be brought upon his knees so easily in reply to which the political young gentleman smiles sternly and throws out dark hints regarding the speedy arrival of that day when members of parliament will be paid salaries and required to render weekly accounts of their proceedings at which the young ladies utter many expressions of astonishment and incredulity while their ladymothers regard the prophecy as little else than blasphemous  it is extremely improving and interesting to hear two political young gentlemen of diverse opinions discuss some great question across a dinnertable such as whether if the public were admitted to westminster abbey for nothing they would or would not convey small chisels and hammers in their pockets and immediately set about chipping all the noses off the statues or whether if they once got into the tower for a shilling they would not insist upon trying the crown on their own heads and loading and firing off all the small arms in the armoury to the great discomposure of whitechapel and the minories  upon these and many other momentous questions which agitate the public mind in these desperate days they will discourse with great vehemence and irritation for a considerable time together both leaving off precisely where they began and each thoroughly persuaded that he has got the better of the other  in society at assemblies balls and playhouses these political young gentlemen are perpetually on the watch for a political allusion or anything which can be tortured or construed into being one when thrusting themselves into the very smallest openings for their favourite discourse they fall upon the unhappy company tooth and nail  they have recently had many favourable opportunities of opening in churches but as there the clergyman has it all his own way and must not be contradicted whatever politics he preaches they are fain to hold their tongues until they reach the outer door though at the imminent risk of bursting in the effort  as such discussions can please nobody but the talkative parties concerned we hope they will henceforth take the hint and discontinue them otherwise we now give them warning that the ladies have our advice to discountenance such talkers altogether    the domestic young gentleman   let us make a slight sketch of our amiable friend mr felix nixon  we are strongly disposed to think that if we put him in this place he will answer our purpose without another word of comment  felix then is a young gentleman who lives at home with his mother just within the twopennypost office circle of three miles from st martinlegrand  he wears indiarubber goloshes when the weather is at all damp and always has a silk handkerchief neatly folded up in the righthand pocket of his greatcoat to tie over his mouth when he goes home at night moreover being rather nearsighted he carries spectacles for particular occasions and has a weakish tremulous voice of which he makes great use for he talks as much as any old lady breathing  the two chief subjects of felix’s discourse are himself and his mother both of whom would appear to be very wonderful and interesting persons as felix and his mother are seldom apart in body so felix and his mother are scarcely ever separate in spirit  if you ask felix how he finds himself today he prefaces his reply with a long and minute bulletin of his mother’s state of health and the good lady in her turn edifies her acquaintance with a circumstantial and alarming account how he sneezed four times and coughed once after being out in the rain the other night but having his feet promptly put into hot water and his head into a flannelsomething which we will not describe more particularly than by this delicate allusion was happily brought round by the next morning and enabled to go to business as usual  our friend is not a very adventurous or hotheaded person but he has passed through many dangers as his mother can testify there is one great story in particular concerning a hackney coachman who wanted to overcharge him one night for bringing them home from the play upon which felix gave the aforesaid coachman a look which his mother thought would have crushed him to the earth but which did not crush him quite for he continued to demand another sixpence notwithstanding that felix took out his pocketbook and with the aid of a flat candle pointed out the fare in print which the coachman obstinately disregarding he shut the streetdoor with a slam which his mother shudders to think of and then roused to the most appalling pitch of passion by the coachman knocking a double knock to show that he was by no means convinced he broke with uncontrollable force from his parent and the servant girl and running into the street without his hat actually shook his fist at the coachman and came back again with a face as white mrs nixon says looking about her for a simile as white as that ceiling  she never will forget his fury that night never  to this account felix listens with a solemn face occasionally looking at you to see how it affects you and when his mother has made an end of it adds that he looked at every coachman he met for three weeks afterwards in hopes that he might see the scoundrel whereupon mrs nixon with an exclamation of terror requests to know what he would have done to him if he had seen him at which felix smiling darkly and clenching his right fist she exclaims ‘goodness gracious’ with a distracted air and insists upon extorting a promise that he never will on any account do anything so rash which her dutiful son—it being something more than three years since the offence was committed—reluctantly concedes and his mother shaking her head prophetically fears with a sigh that his spirit will lead him into something violent yet  the discourse then by an easy transition turns upon the spirit which glows within the bosom of felix upon which point felix himself becomes eloquent and relates a thrilling anecdote of the time when he used to sit up till two o’clock in the morning reading french and how his mother used to say ‘felix you will make yourself ill i know you will’ and how he used to say ‘mother i don’t care—i will do it’ and how at last his mother privately procured a doctor to come and see him who declared the moment he felt his pulse that if he had gone on reading one night more—only one night more—he must have put a blister on each temple and another between his shoulders and who as it was sat down upon the instant and writing a prescription for a blue pill said it must be taken immediately or he wouldn’t answer for the consequences  the recital of these and many other moving perils of the like nature constantly harrows up the feelings of mr nixon’s friends  mrs nixon has a tolerably extensive circle of female acquaintance being a goodhumoured talkative bustling little body and to the unmarried girls among them she is constantly vaunting the virtues of her son hinting that she will be a very happy person who wins him but that they must mind their p’s and q’s for he is very particular and terribly severe upon young ladies  at this last caution the young ladies resident in the same row who happen to be spending the evening there put their pockethandkerchiefs before their mouths and are troubled with a short cough just then felix knocks at the door and his mother drawing the teatable nearer the fire calls out to him as he takes off his boots in the back parlour that he needn’t mind coming in in his slippers for there are only the two miss greys and miss thompson and she is quite sure they will excuse him and nodding to the two miss greys she adds in a whisper that julia thompson is a great favourite with felix at which intelligence the short cough comes again and miss thompson in particular is greatly troubled with it till felix coming in very faint for want of his tea changes the subject of discourse and enables her to laugh out boldly and tell amelia grey not to be so foolish  here they all three laugh and mrs nixon says they are giddy girls in which stage of the proceedings felix who has by this time refreshened himself with the grateful herb that ‘cheers but not inebriates’ removes his cup from his countenance and says with a knowing smile that all girls are whereat his admiring mamma pats him on the back and tells him not to be sly which calls forth a general laugh from the young ladies and another smile from felix who thinking he looks very sly indeed is perfectly satisfied  tea being over the young ladies resume their work and felix insists upon holding a skein of silk while miss thompson winds it on a card this process having been performed to the satisfaction of all parties he brings down his flute in compliance with a request from the youngest miss grey and plays divers tunes out of a very small musicbook till suppertime when he is very facetious and talkative indeed  finally after half a tumblerful of warm sherry and water he gallantly puts on his goloshes over his slippers and telling miss thompson’s servant to run on first and get the door open escorts that young lady to her house five doors off the miss greys who live in the next house but one stopping to peep with merry faces from their own door till he comes back again when they call out ‘very well mr felix’ and trip into the passage with a laugh more musical than any flute that was ever played  felix is rather prim in his appearance and perhaps a little priggish about his books and flute and so forth which have all their peculiar corners of peculiar shelves in his bedroom indeed all his female acquaintance and they are good judges have long ago set him down as a thorough old bachelor  he is a favourite with them however in a certain way as an honest inoffensive kindhearted creature and as his peculiarities harm nobody not even himself we are induced to hope that many who are not personally acquainted with him will take our good word in his behalf and be content to leave him to a long continuance of his harmless existence    the censorious young gentleman   there is an amiable kind of young gentleman going about in society upon whom after much experience of him and considerable turning over of the subject in our mind we feel it our duty to affix the above appellation young ladies mildly call him a ‘sarcastic’ young gentleman or a ‘severe’ young gentleman  we who know better beg to acquaint them with the fact that he is merely a censorious young gentleman and nothing else  the censorious young gentleman has the reputation among his familiars of a remarkably clever person which he maintains by receiving all intelligence and expressing all opinions with a dubious sneer accompanied with a half smile expressive of anything you please but goodhumour  this sets people about thinking what on earth the censorious young gentleman means and they speedily arrive at the conclusion that he means something very deep indeed for they reason in this way—‘this young gentleman looks so very knowing that he must mean something and as i am by no means a dull individual what a very deep meaning he must have if i can’t find it out’  it is extraordinary how soon a censorious young gentleman may make a reputation in his own small circle if he bear this in his mind and regulate his proceedings accordingly  as young ladies are generally—not curious but laudably desirous to acquire information the censorious young gentleman is much talked about among them and many surmises are hazarded regarding him  ‘i wonder’ exclaims the eldest miss greenwood laying down her work to turn up the lamp ‘i wonder whether mr fairfax will ever be married’  ‘bless me dear’ cries miss marshall ‘what ever made you think of him’  ‘really i hardly know’ replies miss greenwood ‘he is such a very mysterious person that i often wonder about him’  ‘well to tell you the truth’ replies miss marshall ‘and so do i’  here two other young ladies profess that they are constantly doing the like and all present appear in the same condition except one young lady who not scrupling to state that she considers mr fairfax ‘a horror’ draws down all the opposition of the others which having been expressed in a great many ejaculatory passages such as ‘well did i ever’—and ‘lor emily dear’ ma takes up the subject and gravely states that she must say she does not think mr fairfax by any means a horror but rather takes him to be a young man of very great ability ‘and i am quite sure’ adds the worthy lady ‘he always means a great deal more than he says’  the door opens at this point of the disclosure and who of all people alive walks into the room but the very mr fairfax who has been the subject of conversation  ‘well it really is curious’ cries ma ‘we were at that very moment talking about you’  ‘you did me great honour’ replies mr fairfax ‘may i venture to ask what you were saying’  ‘why if you must know’ returns the eldest girl ‘we were remarking what a very mysterious man you are’  ‘ay ay’ observes mr fairfax ‘indeed’ now mr fairfax says this ay ay and indeed which are slight words enough in themselves with so very unfathomable an air and accompanies them with such a very equivocal smile that ma and the young ladies are more than ever convinced that he means an immensity and so tell him he is a very dangerous man and seems to be always thinking ill of somebody which is precisely the sort of character the censorious young gentleman is most desirous to establish wherefore he says ‘oh dear no’ in a tone obviously intended to mean ‘you have me there’ and which gives them to understand that they have hit the right nail on the very centre of its head  when the conversation ranges from the mystery overhanging the censorious young gentleman’s behaviour to the general topics of the day he sustains his character to admiration  he considers the new tragedy well enough for a new tragedy but lord bless us—well no matter he could say a great deal on that point but he would rather not lest he should be thought illnatured as he knows he would be  ‘but is not mr soandso’s performance truly charming’ inquires a young lady ‘charming’ replies the censorious young gentleman  ‘oh dear yes certainly very charming—oh very charming indeed’  after this he stirs the fire smiling contemptuously all the while and a modest young gentleman who has been a silent listener thinks what a great thing it must be to have such a critical judgment  of music pictures books and poetry the censorious young gentleman has an equally fine conception  as to men and women he can tell all about them at a glance ‘now let us hear your opinion of young mrs barker’ says some great believer in the powers of mr fairfax ‘but don’t be too severe’  ‘i never am severe’ replies the censorious young gentleman  ‘well never mind that now  she is very ladylike is she not’  ‘ladylike’ repeats the censorious young gentleman for he always repeats when he is at a loss for anything to say  ‘did you observe her manner  bless my heart and soul mrs thompson did you observe her manner—that’s all i ask’ ‘i thought i had done so’ rejoins the poor lady much perplexed ‘i did not observe it very closely perhaps’  ‘oh not very closely’ rejoins the censorious young gentleman triumphantly  ‘very good then i did let us talk no more about her’  the censorious young gentleman purses up his lips and nods his head sagely as he says this and it is forthwith whispered about that mr fairfax who though he is a little prejudiced must be admitted to be a very excellent judge has observed something exceedingly odd in mrs barker’s manner    the funny young gentleman   as one funny young gentleman will serve as a sample of all funny young gentlemen we purpose merely to note down the conduct and behaviour of an individual specimen of this class whom we happened to meet at an annual family christmas party in the course of this very last christmas that ever came  we were all seated round a blazing fire which crackled pleasantly as the guests talked merrily and the urn steamed cheerily—for being an oldfashioned party there was an urn and a teapot besides—when there came a postman’s knock at the door so violent and sudden that it startled the whole circle and actually caused two or three very interesting and most unaffected young ladies to scream aloud and to exhibit many afflicting symptoms of terror and distress until they had been several times assured by their respective adorers that they were in no danger  we were about to remark that it was surely beyond posttime and must have been a runaway knock when our host who had hitherto been paralysed with wonder sank into a chair in a perfect ecstasy of laughter and offered to lay twenty pounds that it was that droll dog griggins  he had no sooner said this than the majority of the company and all the children of the house burst into a roar of laughter too as if some inimitable joke flashed upon them simultaneously and gave vent to various exclamations of—to be sure it must be griggins and how like him that was and what spirits he was always in with many other commendatory remarks of the like nature  not having the happiness to know griggins we became extremely desirous to see so pleasant a fellow the more especially as a stout gentleman with a powdered head who was sitting with his breeches buckles almost touching the hob whispered us he was a wit of the first water when the door opened and mr griggins being announced presented himself amidst another shout of laughter and a loud clapping of hands from the younger branches  this welcome he acknowledged by sundry contortions of countenance imitative of the clown in one of the new pantomimes which were so extremely successful that one stout gentleman rolled upon an ottoman in a paroxysm of delight protesting with many gasps that if somebody didn’t make that fellow griggins leave off he would be the death of him he knew  at this the company only laughed more boisterously than before and as we always like to accommodate our tone and spirit if possible to the humour of any society in which we find ourself we laughed with the rest and exclaimed ‘oh capital capital’ as loud as any of them  when he had quite exhausted all beholders mr griggins received the welcomes and congratulations of the circle and went through the needful introductions with much ease and many puns  this ceremony over he avowed his intention of sitting in somebody’s lap unless the young ladies made room for him on the sofa which being done after a great deal of tittering and pleasantry he squeezed himself among them and likened his condition to that of love among the roses  at this novel jest we all roared once more  ‘you should consider yourself highly honoured sir’ said we  ‘sir’ replied mr griggins ‘you do me proud’  here everybody laughed again and the stout gentleman by the fire whispered in our ear that griggins was making a dead set at us  the teathings having been removed we all sat down to a round game and here mr griggins shone forth with peculiar brilliancy abstracting other people’s fish and looking over their hands in the most comical manner he made one most excellent joke in snuffing a candle which was neither more nor less than setting fire to the hair of a pale young gentleman who sat next him and afterwards begging his pardon with considerable humour as the young gentleman could not see the joke however possibly in consequence of its being on the top of his own head it did not go off quite as well as it might have done indeed the young gentleman was heard to murmur some general references to ‘impertinence’ and a ‘rascal’ and to state the number of his lodgings in an angry tone—a turn of the conversation which might have been productive of slaughterous consequences if a young lady betrothed to the young gentleman had not used her immediate influence to bring about a reconciliation emphatically declaring in an agitated whisper intended for his peculiar edification but audible to the whole table that if he went on in that way she never would think of him otherwise than as a friend though as that she must always regard him  at this terrible threat the young gentleman became calm and the young lady overcome by the revulsion of feeling instantaneously fainted  mr griggins’s spirits were slightly depressed for a short period by this unlookedfor result of such a harmless pleasantry but being promptly elevated by the attentions of the host and several glasses of wine he soon recovered and became even more vivacious than before insomuch that the stout gentleman previously referred to assured us that although he had known him since he was that high something smaller than a nutmeggrater he had never beheld him in such excellent cue  when the round game and several games at blind man’s buff which followed it were all over and we were going down to supper the inexhaustible mr griggins produced a small sprig of mistletoe from his waistcoat pocket and commenced a general kissing of the assembled females which occasioned great commotion and much excitement  we observed that several young gentlemen—including the young gentleman with the pale countenance—were greatly scandalised at this indecorous proceeding and talked very big among themselves in corners and we observed too that several young ladies when remonstrated with by the aforesaid young gentlemen called each other to witness how they had struggled and protested vehemently that it was very rude and that they were surprised at mrs brown’s allowing it and that they couldn’t bear it and had no patience with such impertinence  but such is the gentle and forgiving nature of woman that although we looked very narrowly for it we could not detect the slightest harshness in the subsequent treatment of mr griggins  indeed upon the whole it struck us that among the ladies he seemed rather more popular than before  to recount all the drollery of mr griggins at supper would fill such a tiny volume as this 429 to the very bottom of the outside cover  how he drank out of other people’s glasses and ate of other people’s bread how he frightened into screaming convulsions a little boy who was sitting up to supper in a high chair by sinking below the table and suddenly reappearing with a mask on how the hostess was really surprised that anybody could find a pleasure in tormenting children and how the host frowned at the hostess and felt convinced that mr griggins had done it with the very best intentions how mr griggins explained and how everybody’s goodhumour was restored but the child’s—to tell these and a hundred other things ever so briefly would occupy more of our room and our readers’ patience than either they or we can conveniently spare therefore we change the subject merely observing that we have offered no description of the funny young gentleman’s personal appearance believing that almost every society has a griggins of its own and leaving all readers to supply the deficiency according to the particular circumstances of their particular case    the theatrical young gentleman   all gentlemen who love the drama—and there are few gentlemen who are not attached to the most intellectual and rational of all our amusements—do not come within this definition  as we have no mean relish for theatrical entertainments ourself we are disinterestedly anxious that this should be perfectly understood  the theatrical young gentleman has early and important information on all theatrical topics  ‘well’ says he abruptly when you meet him in the street ‘here’s a pretty todo  flimkins has thrown up his part in the melodrama at the surrey’—‘and what’s to be done’ you inquire with as much gravity as you can counterfeit  ‘ah that’s the point’ replies the theatrical young gentleman looking very serious ‘boozle declines it positively declines it  from all i am told i should say it was decidedly in boozle’s line and that he would be very likely to make a great hit in it but he objects on the ground of flimkins having been put up in the part first and says no earthly power shall induce him to take the character  it’s a fine part too—excellent business i’m told  he has to kill six people in the course of the piece and to fight over a bridge in red fire which is as safe a card you know as can be  don’t mention it but i hear that the last scene when he is first poisoned and then stabbed by mrs flimkins as vengedora will be the greatest thing that has been done these many years’  with this piece of news and laying his finger on his lips as a caution for you not to excite the town with it the theatrical young gentleman hurries away  the theatrical young gentleman from often frequenting the different theatrical establishments has pet and familiar names for them all  thus coventgarden is the garden drurylane the lane the victoria the vic and the olympic the pic  actresses too are always designated by their surnames only as taylor nisbett faucit honey that talented and ladylike girl sheriff that clever little creature horton and so on in the same manner he prefixes christian names when he mentions actors as charley young jemmy buckstone fred yates paul bedford  when he is at a loss for a christian name the word ‘old’ applied indiscriminately answers quite as well as old charley matthews at vestris’s old harley and old braham  he has a great knowledge of the private proceedings of actresses especially of their getting married and can tell you in a breath halfadozen who have changed their names without avowing it whenever an alteration of this kind is made in the playbills he will remind you that he let you into the secret six months ago  the theatrical young gentleman has a great reverence for all that is connected with the stage department of the different theatres  he would at any time prefer going a street or two out of his way to omitting to pass a stageentrance into which he always looks with a curious and searching eye  if he can only identify a popular actor in the street he is in a perfect transport of delight and no sooner meets him than he hurries back and walks a few paces in front of him so that he can turn round from time to time and have a good stare at his features  he looks upon a theatricalfund dinner as one of the most enchanting festivities ever known and thinks that to be a member of the garrick club and see so many actors in their plain clothes must be one of the highest gratifications the world can bestow  the theatrical young gentleman is a constant halfprice visitor at one or other of the theatres and has an infinite relish for all pieces which display the fullest resources of the establishment  he likes to place implicit reliance upon the playbills when he goes to see a showpiece and works himself up to such a pitch of enthusiasm as not only to believe if the bills say so that there are three hundred and seventyfive people on the stage at one time in the last scene but is highly indignant with you unless you believe it also  he considers that if the stage be opened from the footlights to the back wall in any new play the piece is a triumph of dramatic writing and applauds accordingly  he has a great notion of trapdoors too and thinks any character going down or coming up a trap no matter whether he be an angel or a demon—they both do it occasionally one of the most interesting feats in the whole range of scenic illusion  besides these acquirements he has several veracious accounts to communicate of the private manners and customs of different actors which during the pauses of a quadrille he usually communicates to his partner or imparts to his neighbour at a supper table  thus he is advised that mr liston always had a footman in gorgeous livery waiting at the sidescene with a brandy bottle and tumbler to administer half a pint or so of spirit to him every time he came off without which assistance he must infallibly have fainted  he knows for a fact that after an arduous part mr george bennett is put between two feather beds to absorb the perspiration and is credibly informed that mr baker has for many years submitted to a course of lukewarm toastandwater to qualify him to sustain his favourite characters  he looks upon mr fitz ball as the principal dramatic genius and poet of the day but holds that there are great writers extant besides him—in proof whereof he refers you to various dramas and melodramas recently produced of which he takes in all the sixpenny and threepenny editions as fast as they appear  the theatrical young gentleman is a great advocate for violence of emotion and redundancy of action  if a father has to curse a child upon the stage he likes to see it done in the thoroughgoing style with no mistake about it to which end it is essential that the child should follow the father on her knees and be knocked violently over on her face by the old gentleman as he goes into a small cottage and shuts the door behind him  he likes to see a blessing invoked upon the young lady when the old gentleman repents with equal earnestness and accompanied by the usual conventional forms which consist of the old gentleman looking anxiously up into the clouds as if to see whether it rains and then spreading an imaginary tablecloth in the air over the young lady’s head—soft music playing all the while  upon these and other points of a similar kind the theatrical young gentleman is a great critic indeed he is likewise very acute in judging of natural expressions of the passions and knows precisely the frown wink nod or leer which stands for any one of them or the means by which it may be converted into any other as jealousy with a good stamp of the right foot becomes anger or wildness with the hands clasped before the throat instead of tearing the wig is passionate love  if you venture to express a doubt of the accuracy of any of these portraitures the theatrical young gentleman assures you with a haughty smile that it always has been done in that way and he supposes they are not going to change it at this time of day to please you to which of course you meekly reply that you suppose not  there are innumerable disquisitions of this nature in which the theatrical young gentleman is very profound especially to ladies whom he is most in the habit of entertaining with them but as we have no space to recapitulate them at greater length we must rest content with calling the attention of the young ladies in general to the theatrical young gentlemen of their own acquaintance    the poetical young gentleman   time was and not very long ago either when a singular epidemic raged among the young gentlemen vast numbers of whom under the influence of the malady tore off their neckerchiefs turned down their shirt collars and exhibited themselves in the open streets with bare throats and dejected countenances before the eyes of an astonished public  these were poetical young gentlemen  the custom was gradually found to be inconvenient as involving the necessity of too much clean linen and too large washing bills and these outward symptoms have consequently passed away but we are disposed to think notwithstanding that the number of poetical young gentlemen is considerably on the increase  we know a poetical young gentleman—a very poetical young gentleman  we do not mean to say that he is troubled with the gift of poesy in any remarkable degree but his countenance is of a plaintive and melancholy cast his manner is abstracted and bespeaks affliction of soul he seldom has his hair cut and often talks about being an outcast and wanting a kindred spirit from which as well as from many general observations in which he is wont to indulge concerning mysterious impulses and yearnings of the heart and the supremacy of intellect gilding all earthly things with the glowing magic of immortal verse it is clear to all his friends that he has been stricken poetical  the favourite attitude of the poetical young gentleman is lounging on a sofa with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling or sitting bolt upright in a highbacked chair staring with very round eyes at the opposite wall when he is in one of these positions his mother who is a worthy affectionate old soul will give you a nudge to bespeak your attention without disturbing the abstracted one and whisper with a shake of the head that john’s imagination is at some extraordinary work or other you may take her word for it  hereupon john looks more fiercely intent upon vacancy than before and suddenly snatching a pencil from his pocket puts down three words and a cross on the back of a card sighs deeply paces once or twice across the room inflicts a most unmerciful slap upon his head and walks moodily up to his dormitory  the poetical young gentleman is apt to acquire peculiar notions of things too which plain ordinary people unblessed with a poetical obliquity of vision would suppose to be rather distorted  for instance when the sickening murder and mangling of a wretched woman was affording delicious food wherewithal to gorge the insatiable curiosity of the public our friend the poetical young gentleman was in ecstasies—not of disgust but admiration  ‘heavens’ cried the poetical young gentleman ‘how grand how great’  we ventured deferentially to inquire upon whom these epithets were bestowed our humble thoughts oscillating between the police officer who found the criminal and the lockkeeper who found the head  ‘upon whom’ exclaimed the poetical young gentleman in a frenzy of poetry ‘upon whom should they be bestowed but upon the murderer’—and thereupon it came out in a fine torrent of eloquence that the murderer was a great spirit a bold creature full of daring and nerve a man of dauntless heart and determined courage and withal a great casuist and able reasoner as was fully demonstrated in his philosophical colloquies with the great and noble of the land  we held our peace and meekly signified our indisposition to controvert these opinions—firstly because we were no match at quotation for the poetical young gentleman and secondly because we felt it would be of little use our entering into any disputation if we were being perfectly convinced that the respectable and immoral hero in question is not the first and will not be the last hanged gentleman upon whom false sympathy or diseased curiosity will be plentifully expended  this was a stern mystic flight of the poetical young gentleman  in his milder and softer moments he occasionally lays down his neckcloth and pens stanzas which sometimes find their way into a lady’s magazine or the ‘poets’ corner’ of some country newspaper or which in default of either vent for his genius adorn the rainbow leaves of a lady’s album these are generally written upon some such occasions as contemplating the bank of england by midnight or beholding saint paul’s in a snowstorm and when these gloomy objects fail to afford him inspiration he pours forth his soul in a touching address to a violet or a plaintive lament that he is no longer a child but has gradually grown up  the poetical young gentleman is fond of quoting passages from his favourite authors who are all of the gloomy and desponding school  he has a great deal to say too about the world and is much given to opining especially if he has taken anything strong to drink that there is nothing in it worth living for  he gives you to understand however that for the sake of society he means to bear his part in the tiresome play manfully resisting the gratification of his own strong desire to make a premature exit and consoles himself with the reflection that immortality has some chosen nook for himself and the other great spirits whom earth has chafed and wearied  when the poetical young gentleman makes use of adjectives they are all superlatives  everything is of the grandest greatest noblest mightiest loftiest or the lowest meanest obscurest vilest and most pitiful  he knows no medium for enthusiasm is the soul of poetry and who so enthusiastic as a poetical young gentleman  ‘mr milkwash’ says a young lady as she unlocks her album to receive the young gentleman’s original impromptu contribution ‘how very silent you are  i think you must be in love’  ‘love’ cries the poetical young gentleman starting from his seat by the fire and terrifying the cat who scampers off at full speed ‘love that burning consuming passion that ardour of the soul that fierce glowing of the heart  love  the withering blighting influence of hope misplaced and affection slighted  love did you say ha ha ha’  with this the poetical young gentleman laughs a laugh belonging only to poets and mr o smith of the adelphi theatre and sits down pen in hand to throw off a page or two of verse in the biting semiatheistical demoniac style which like the poetical young gentleman himself is full of sound and fury signifying nothing    the ‘throwingoff’ young gentleman   there is a certain kind of impostor—a bragging vaunting puffing young gentleman—against whom we are desirous to warn that fairer part of the creation to whom we more peculiarly devote these our labours  and we are particularly induced to lay especial stress upon this division of our subject by a little dialogue we held some short time ago with an esteemed young lady of our acquaintance touching a most gross specimen of this class of men  we had been urging all the absurdities of his conduct and conversation and dwelling upon the impossibilities he constantly recounted—to which indeed we had not scrupled to prefix a certain hard little word of one syllable and three letters—when our fair friend unable to maintain the contest any longer reluctantly cried ‘well he certainly has a habit of throwingoff but then—’  what then throw him off yourself said we  and so she did but not at our instance for other reasons appeared and it might have been better if she had done so at first  the throwingoff young gentleman has so often a father possessed of vast property in some remote district of ireland that we look with some suspicion upon all young gentlemen who volunteer this description of themselves  the deceased grandfather of the throwingoff young gentleman was a man of immense possessions and untold wealth the throwingoff young gentleman remembers as well as if it were only yesterday the deceased baronet’s library with its long rows of scarce and valuable books in superbly embossed bindings arranged in cases reaching from the lofty ceiling to the oaken floor and the fine antique chairs and tables and the noble old castle of ballykillbabaloo with its splendid prospect of hill and dale and wood and rich wild scenery and the fine hunting stables and the spacious courtyards ‘and—and—everything upon the same magnificent scale’ says the throwingoff young gentleman ‘princely quite princely  ah’  and he sighs as if mourning over the fallen fortunes of his noble house  the throwingoff young gentleman is a universal genius at walking running rowing swimming and skating he is unrivalled at all games of chance or skill at hunting shooting fishing riding driving or amateur theatricals no one can touch him—that is could not because he gives you carefully to understand lest there should be any opportunity of testing his skill that he is quite out of practice just now and has been for some years  if you mention any beautiful girl of your common acquaintance in his hearing the throwingoff young gentleman starts smiles and begs you not to mind him for it was quite involuntary people do say indeed that they were once engaged but no—although she is a very fine girl he was so situated at that time that he couldn’t possibly encourage the—‘but it’s of no use talking about it’ he adds interrupting himself  ‘she has got over it now and i firmly hope and trust is happy’  with this benevolent aspiration he nods his head in a mysterious manner and whistling the first part of some popular air thinks perhaps it will be better to change the subject  there is another great characteristic of the throwingoff young gentleman which is that he ‘happens to be acquainted’ with a most extraordinary variety of people in all parts of the world  thus in all disputed questions when the throwingoff young gentleman has no argument to bring forward he invariably happens to be acquainted with some distant person intimately connected with the subject whose testimony decides the point against you to the great—may we say it—to the great admiration of three young ladies out of every four who consider the throwingoff young gentleman a very highlyconnected young man and a most charming person  sometimes the throwingoff young gentleman happens to look in upon a little family circle of young ladies who are quietly spending the evening together and then indeed is he at the very height and summit of his glory for it is to be observed that he by no means shines to equal advantage in the presence of men as in the society of overcredulous young ladies which is his proper element  it is delightful to hear the number of pretty things the throwingoff young gentleman gives utterance to during tea and still more so to observe the ease with which from long practice and study he delicately blends one compliment to a lady with two for himself  ‘did you ever see a more lovely blue than this flower mr caveton’ asks a young lady who truth to tell is rather smitten with the throwingoff young gentleman  ‘never’ he replies bending over the object of admiration ‘never but in your eyes’  ‘oh mr caveton’ cries the young lady blushing of course  ‘indeed i speak the truth’ replies the throwingoff young gentleman ‘i never saw any approach to them  i used to think my cousin’s blue eyes lovely but they grow dim and colourless beside yours’  ‘oh a beautiful cousin mr caveton’ replies the young lady with that perfect artlessness which is the distinguishing characteristic of all young ladies ‘an affair of course’  ‘no indeed indeed you wrong me’ rejoins the throwingoff young gentleman with great energy  ‘i fervently hope that her attachment towards me may be nothing but the natural result of our close intimacy in childhood and that in change of scene and among new faces she may soon overcome it  i love her  think not so meanly of me miss lowfield i beseech as to suppose that title lands riches and beauty can influence my choice  the heart the heart miss lowfield’  here the throwingoff young gentleman sinks his voice to a still lower whisper and the young lady duly proclaims to all the other young ladies when they go upstairs to put their bonnets on that mr caveton’s relations are all immensely rich and that he is hopelessly beloved by title lands riches and beauty  we have seen a throwingoff young gentleman who to our certain knowledge was innocent of a note of music and scarcely able to recognise a tune by ear volunteer a spanish air upon the guitar when he had previously satisfied himself that there was not such an instrument within a mile of the house  we have heard another throwingoff young gentleman after striking a note or two upon the piano and accompanying it correctly by dint of laborious practice with his voice assure a circle of wondering listeners that so acute was his ear that he was wholly unable to sing out of tune let him try as he would  we have lived to witness the unmasking of another throwingoff young gentleman who went out a visiting in a military cap with a gold band and tassel and who after passing successfully for a captain and being lauded to the skies for his red whiskers his bravery his soldierly bearing and his pride turned out to be the dishonest son of an honest linendraper in a small country town and whom if it were not for this fortunate exposure we should not yet despair of encountering as the fortunate husband of some rich heiress ladies ladies the throwingoff young gentlemen are often swindlers and always fools  so pray you avoid them    the young ladies’ young gentleman   this young gentleman has several titles  some young ladies consider him ‘a nice young man’ others ‘a fine young man’ others ‘quite a lady’s man’ others ‘a handsome man’ others ‘a remarkably goodlooking young man’  with some young ladies he is ‘a perfect angel’ and with others ‘quite a love’  he is likewise a charming creature a duck and a dear  the young ladies’ young gentleman has usually a fresh colour and very white teeth which latter articles of course he displays on every possible opportunity  he has brown or black hair and whiskers of the same if possible but a slight tinge of red or the hue which is vulgarly known as sandy is not considered an objection  if his head and face be large his nose prominent and his figure square he is an uncommonly fine young man and worshipped accordingly  should his whiskers meet beneath his chin so much the better though this is not absolutely insisted on but he must wear an underwaistcoat and smile constantly  there was a great party got up by some partyloving friends of ours last summer to go and dine in epping forest  as we hold that such wild expeditions should never be indulged in save by people of the smallest means who have no dinner at home we should indubitably have excused ourself from attending if we had not recollected that the projectors of the excursion were always accompanied on such occasions by a choice sample of the young ladies’ young gentleman whom we were very anxious to have an opportunity of meeting  this determined us and we went  we were to make for chigwell in four glass coaches each with a trifling company of six or eight inside and a little boy belonging to the projectors on the box—and to start from the residence of the projectors woburnplace russellsquare at halfpast ten precisely  we arrived at the place of rendezvous at the appointed time and found the glass coaches and the little boys quite ready and divers young ladies and young gentlemen looking anxiously over the breakfastparlour blinds who appeared by no means so much gratified by our approach as we might have expected but evidently wished we had been somebody else  observing that our arrival in lieu of the unknown occasioned some disappointment we ventured to inquire who was yet to come when we found from the hasty reply of a dozen voices that it was no other than the young ladies’ young gentleman  ‘i cannot imagine’ said the mamma ‘what has become of mr balim—always so punctual always so pleasant and agreeable  i am sure i cannot think’  as these last words were uttered in that measured emphatic manner which painfully announces that the speaker has not quite made up his or her mind what to say but is determined to talk on nevertheless the eldest daughter took up the subject and hoped no accident had happened to mr balim upon which there was a general chorus of ‘dear mr balim’ and one young lady more adventurous than the rest proposed that an express should be straightway sent to dear mr balim’s lodgings this however the papa resolutely opposed observing in what a short young lady behind us termed ‘quite a bearish way’ that if mr balim didn’t choose to come he might stop at home  at this all the daughters raised a murmur of ‘oh pa’ except one sprightly little girl of eight or ten years old who taking advantage of a pause in the discourse remarked that perhaps mr balim might have been married that morning—for which impertinent suggestion she was summarily ejected from the room by her eldest sister  we were all in a state of great mortification and uneasiness when one of the little boys running into the room as airily as little boys usually run who have an unlimited allowance of animal food in the holidays and keep their hands constantly forced down to the bottoms of very deep trouserpockets when they take exercise joyfully announced that mr balim was at that moment coming up the street in a hackneycab and the intelligence was confirmed beyond all doubt a minute afterwards by the entry of mr balim himself who was received with repeated cries of ‘where have you been you naughty creature’ whereunto the naughty creature replied that he had been in bed in consequence of a late party the night before and had only just risen  the acknowledgment awakened a variety of agonizing fears that he had taken no breakfast which appearing after a slight crossexamination to be the real state of the case breakfast for one was immediately ordered notwithstanding mr balim’s repeated protestations that he couldn’t think of it  he did think of it though and thought better of it too for he made a remarkably good meal when it came and was assiduously served by a select knot of young ladies  it was quite delightful to see how he ate and drank while one pair of fair hands poured out his coffee and another put in the sugar and another the milk the rest of the company ever and anon casting angry glances at their watches and the glass coaches—and the little boys looking on in an agony of apprehension lest it should begin to rain before we set out it might have rained all day after we were once too far to turn back again and welcome for aught they cared  however the cavalcade moved at length every coachman being accommodated with a hamper between his legs something larger than a wheelbarrow and the company being packed as closely as they possibly could in the carriages ‘according’ as one married lady observed ‘to the immemorial custom which was half the diversion of gipsy parties’  thinking it very likely it might be we have never been able to discover the other half we submitted to be stowed away with a cheerful aspect and were fortunate enough to occupy one corner of a coach in which were one old lady four young ladies and the renowned mr balim the young ladies’ young gentleman  we were no sooner fairly off than the young ladies’ young gentleman hummed a fragment of an air which induced a young lady to inquire whether he had danced to that the night before  ‘by heaven then i did’ replied the young gentleman ‘and with a lovely heiress a superb creature with twenty thousand pounds’  ‘you seem rather struck’ observed another young lady  ‘’gad she was a sweet creature’ returned the young gentleman arranging his hair  ‘of course she was struck too’ inquired the first young lady  ‘how can you ask love’ interposed the second ‘could she fail to be’  ‘well honestly i think she was’ observed the young gentleman  at this point of the dialogue the young lady who had spoken first and who sat on the young gentleman’s right struck him a severe blow on the arm with a rosebud and said he was a vain man—whereupon the young gentleman insisted on having the rosebud and the young lady appealing for help to the other young ladies a charming struggle ensued terminating in the victory of the young gentleman and the capture of the rosebud  this little skirmish over the married lady who was the mother of the rosebud smiled sweetly upon the young gentleman and accused him of being a flirt the young gentleman pleading not guilty a most interesting discussion took place upon the important point whether the young gentleman was a flirt or not which being an agreeable conversation of a light kind lasted a considerable time  at length a short silence occurring the young ladies on either side of the young gentleman fell suddenly fast asleep and the young gentleman winking upon us to preserve silence won a pair of gloves from each thereby causing them to wake with equal suddenness and to scream very loud  the lively conversation to which this pleasantry gave rise lasted for the remainder of the ride and would have eked out a much longer one  we dined rather more comfortably than people usually do under such circumstances nothing having been left behind but the corkscrew and the bread  the married gentlemen were unusually thirsty which they attributed to the heat of the weather the little boys ate to inconvenience mammas were very jovial and their daughters very fascinating and the attendants being wellbehaved men got exceedingly drunk at a respectful distance  we had our eye on mr balim at dinnertime and perceived that he flourished wonderfully being still surrounded by a little group of young ladies who listened to him as an oracle while he ate from their plates and drank from their glasses in a manner truly captivating from its excessive playfulness  his conversation too was exceedingly brilliant in fact one elderly lady assured us that in the course of a little lively badinage on the subject of ladies’ dresses he had evinced as much knowledge as if he had been born and bred a milliner  as such of the fat people who did not happen to fall asleep after dinner entered upon a most vigorous game at ball we slipped away alone into a thicker part of the wood hoping to fall in with mr balim the greater part of the young people having dropped off in twos and threes and the young ladies’ young gentleman among them  nor were we disappointed for we had not walked far when peeping through the trees we discovered him before us and truly it was a pleasant thing to contemplate his greatness  the young ladies’ young gentleman was seated upon the ground at the feet of a few young ladies who were reclining on a bank he was so profusely decked with scarfs ribands flowers and other pretty spoils that he looked like a lamb—or perhaps a calf would be a better simile—adorned for the sacrifice  one young lady supported a parasol over his interesting head another held his hat and a third his neckcloth which in romantic fashion he had thrown off the young gentleman himself with his hand upon his breast and his face moulded into an expression of the most honeyed sweetness was warbling forth some choice specimens of vocal music in praise of female loveliness in a style so exquisitely perfect that we burst into an involuntary shout of laughter and made a hasty retreat  what charming fellows these young ladies’ young gentlemen are  ducks dears loves angels are all terms inadequate to express their merit they are such amazingly uncommonly wonderfully nice men    conclusion   as we have placed before the young ladies so many specimens of young gentlemen and have also in the dedication of this volume given them to understand how much we reverence and admire their numerous virtues and perfections as we have given them such strong reasons to treat us with confidence and to banish in our case all that reserve and distrust of the male sex which as a point of general behaviour they cannot do better than preserve and maintain—we say as we have done all this we feel that now when we have arrived at the close of our task they may naturally press upon us the inquiry what particular description of young gentlemen we can conscientiously recommend  here we are at a loss  we look over our list and can neither recommend the bashful young gentleman nor the outandout young gentleman nor the very friendly young gentleman nor the military young gentleman nor the political young gentleman nor the domestic young gentleman nor the censorious young gentleman nor the funny young gentleman nor the theatrical young gentleman nor the poetical young gentleman nor the throwingoff young gentleman nor the young ladies’ young gentleman  as there are some good points about many of them which still are not sufficiently numerous to render any one among them eligible as a whole our respectful advice to the young ladies is to seek for a young gentleman who unites in himself the best qualities of all and the worst weaknesses of none and to lead him forthwith to the hymeneal altar whether he will or no  and to the young lady who secures him we beg to tender one short fragment of matrimonial advice selected from many sound passages of a similar tendency to be found in a letter written by dean swift to a young lady on her marriage  ‘the grand affair of your life will be to gain and preserve the esteem of your husband  neither goodnature nor virtue will suffer him to esteem you against his judgment and although he is not capable of using you ill yet you will in time grow a thing indifferent and perhaps contemptible unless you can supply the loss of youth and beauty with more durable qualities  you have but a very few years to be young and handsome in the eyes of the world and as few months to be so in the eyes of a husband who is not a fool for i hope you do not still dream of charms and raptures which marriage ever did and ever will put a sudden end to’  from the anxiety we express for the proper behaviour of the fortunate lady after marriage it may possibly be inferred that the young gentleman to whom we have so delicately alluded is no other than ourself  without in any way committing ourself upon this point we have merely to observe that we are ready to receive sealed offers containing a full specification of age temper appearance and condition but we beg it to be distinctly understood that we do not pledge ourself to accept the highest bidder  these offers may be forwarded to the publishers messrs chapman and hall london to whom all pieces of plate and other testimonials of approbation from the young ladies generally are respectfully requested to be addressed     sketches of young couples   an urgent remonstrance c                          to the gentlemen of england                       being bachelors or widowers             the remonstrance of their faithful fellowsubject  sheweth—  that her most gracious majesty victoria by the grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland queen defender of the faith did on the 23rd day of november last past declare and pronounce to her most honourable privy council her majesty’s most gracious intention of entering into the bonds of wedlock  that her most gracious majesty in so making known her most gracious intention to her most honourable privy council as aforesaid did use and employ the words—‘it is my intention to ally myself in marriage with prince albert of saxe coburg and gotha’  that the present is bissextile or leap year in which it is held and considered lawful for any lady to offer and submit proposals of marriage to any gentleman and to enforce and insist upon acceptance of the same under pain of a certain fine or penalty to wit one silk or satin dress of the first quality to be chosen by the lady and paid or owed for by the gentleman  that these and other the horrors and dangers with which the said bissextile or leap year threatens the gentlemen of england on every occasion of its periodical return have been greatly aggravated and augmented by the terms of her majesty’s said most gracious communication which have filled the heads of divers young ladies in this realm with certain new ideas destructive to the peace of mankind that never entered their imagination before  that a case has occurred in camberwell in which a young lady informed her papa that ‘she intended to ally herself in marriage’ with mr smith of stepney and that another and a very distressing case has occurred at tottenham in which a young lady not only stated her intention of allying herself in marriage with her cousin john but taking violent possession of her said cousin actually married him  that similar outrages are of constant occurrence not only in the capital and its neighbourhood but throughout the kingdom and that unless the excited female populace be speedily checked and restrained in their lawless proceedings most deplorable results must ensue therefrom among which may be anticipated a most alarming increase in the population of the country with which no efforts of the agricultural or manufacturing interest can possibly keep pace  that there is strong reason to suspect the existence of a most extensive plot conspiracy or design secretly contrived by vast numbers of single ladies in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and now extending its ramifications in every quarter of the land the object and intent of which plainly appears to be the holding and solemnising of an enormous and unprecedented number of marriages on the day on which the nuptials of her said most gracious majesty are performed  that such plot conspiracy or design strongly savours of popery as tending to the discomfiture of the clergy of the established church by entailing upon them great mental and physical exhaustion and that such popish plots are fomented and encouraged by her majesty’s ministers which clearly appears—not only from her majesty’s principal secretary of state for foreign affairs traitorously getting married while holding office under the crown but from mr o’connell having been heard to declare and avow that if he had a daughter to marry she should be married on the same day as her said most gracious majesty  that such arch plots conspiracies and designs besides being fraught with danger to the established church and consequently to the state cannot fail to bring ruin and bankruptcy upon a large class of her majesty’s subjects as a great and sudden increase in the number of married men occasioning the comparative desertion for a time of taverns hotels billiardrooms and gaminghouses will deprive the proprietors of their accustomed profits and returns  and in further proof of the depth and baseness of such designs it may be here observed that all proprietors of taverns hotels billiardrooms and gaminghouses are especially the last solemnly devoted to the protestant religion  for all these reasons and many others of no less gravity and import an urgent appeal is made to the gentlemen of england being bachelors or widowers to take immediate steps for convening a public meeting to consider of the best and surest means of averting the dangers with which they are threatened by the recurrence of bissextile or leap year and the additional sensation created among single ladies by the terms of her majesty’s most gracious declaration to take measures without delay for resisting the said single ladies and counteracting their evil designs and to pray her majesty to dismiss her present ministers and to summon to her councils those distinguished gentlemen in various honourable professions who by insulting on all occasions the only lady in england who can be insulted with safety have given a sufficient guarantee to her majesty’s loving subjects that they at least are qualified to make war with women and are already expert in the use of those weapons which are common to the lowest and most abandoned of the sex    the young couple   there is to be a wedding this morning at the corner house in the terrace the pastrycook’s people have been there halfadozen times already all day yesterday there was a great stir and bustle and they were up this morning as soon as it was light  miss emma fielding is going to be married to young mr harvey  heaven alone can tell in what bright colours this marriage is painted upon the mind of the little housemaid at number six who has hardly slept a wink all night with thinking of it and now stands on the unswept doorsteps leaning upon her broom and looking wistfully towards the enchanted house  nothing short of omniscience can divine what visions of the baker or the greengrocer or the smart and most insinuating butterman are flitting across her mind—what thoughts of how she would dress on such an occasion if she were a lady—of how she would dress if she were only a bride—of how cook would dress being bridesmaid conjointly with her sister ‘in place’ at fulham and how the clergyman deeming them so many ladies would be quite humbled and respectful  what daydreams of hope and happiness—of life being one perpetual holiday with no master and no mistress to grant or withhold it—of every sunday being a sunday out—of pure freedom as to curls and ringlets and no obligation to hide fine heads of hair in caps—what pictures of happiness vast and immense to her but utterly ridiculous to us bewilder the brain of the little housemaid at number six all called into existence by the wedding at the corner  we smile at such things and so we should though perhaps for a better reason than commonly presents itself  it should be pleasant to us to know that there are notions of happiness so moderate and limited since upon those who entertain them happiness and lightness of heart are very easily bestowed  but the little housemaid is awakened from her reverie for forth from the door of the magical corner house there runs towards her all fluttering in smart new dress and streaming ribands her friend jane adams who comes all out of breath to redeem a solemn promise of taking her in under cover of the confusion to see the breakfast table spread forth in state and—sight of sights—her young mistress ready dressed for church  and there in good truth when they have stolen upstairs on tiptoe and edged themselves in at the chamberdoor—there is miss emma ‘looking like the sweetest picter’ in a white chip bonnet and orange flowers and all other elegancies becoming a bride with the make shape and quality of every article of which the girl is perfectly familiar in one moment and never forgets to her dying day—and there is miss emma’s mamma in tears and miss emma’s papa comforting her and saying how that of course she has been long looking forward to this and how happy she ought to be—and there too is miss emma’s sister with her arms round her neck and the other bridesmaid all smiles and tears quieting the children who would cry more but that they are so finely dressed and yet sob for fear sister emma should be taken away—and it is all so affecting that the two servantgirls cry more than anybody and jane adams sitting down upon the stairs when they have crept away declares that her legs tremble so that she don’t know what to do and that she will say for miss emma that she never had a hasty word from her and that she does hope and pray she may be happy  but jane soon comes round again and then surely there never was anything like the breakfast table glittering with plate and china and set out with flowers and sweets and longnecked bottles in the most sumptuous and dazzling manner  in the centre too is the mighty charm the cake glistening with frosted sugar and garnished beautifully  they agree that there ought to be a little cupid under one of the barleysugar temples or at least two hearts and an arrow but with this exception there is nothing to wish for and a table could not be handsomer  as they arrive at this conclusion who should come in but mr john to whom jane says that its only anne from number six and john says he knows for he’s often winked his eye down the area which causes anne to blush and look confused  she is going away indeed when mr john will have it that she must drink a glass of wine and he says never mind it’s being early in the morning it won’t hurt her so they shut the door and pour out the wine and anne drinking lane’s health and adding ‘and here’s wishing you yours mr john’ drinks it in a great many sips—mr john all the time making jokes appropriate to the occasion  at last mr john who has waxed bolder by degrees pleads the usage at weddings and claims the privilege of a kiss which he obtains after a great scuffle and footsteps being now heard on the stairs they disperse suddenly  by this time a carriage has driven up to convey the bride to church and anne of number six prolonging the process of ‘cleaning her door’ has the satisfaction of beholding the bride and bridesmaids and the papa and mamma hurry into the same and drive rapidly off  nor is this all for soon other carriages begin to arrive with a posse of company all beautifully dressed at whom she could stand and gaze for ever but having something else to do is compelled to take one last long look and shut the streetdoor  and now the company have gone down to breakfast and tears have given place to smiles for all the corks are out of the longnecked bottles and their contents are disappearing rapidly  miss emma’s papa is at the top of the table miss emma’s mamma at the bottom and beside the latter are miss emma herself and her husband—admitted on all hands to be the handsomest and most interesting young couple ever known  all down both sides of the table too are various young ladies beautiful to see and various young gentlemen who seem to think so and there in a post of honour is an unmarried aunt of miss emma’s reported to possess unheardof riches and to have expressed vast testamentary intentions respecting her favourite niece and new nephew  this lady has been very liberal and generous already as the jewels worn by the bride abundantly testify but that is nothing to what she means to do or even to what she has done for she put herself in close communication with the dressmaker three months ago and prepared a wardrobe with some articles worked by her own hands fit for a princess  people may call her an old maid and so she may be but she is neither cross nor ugly for all that on the contrary she is very cheerful and pleasantlooking and very kind and tenderhearted which is no matter of surprise except to those who yield to popular prejudices without thinking why and will never grow wiser and never know better  of all the company though none are more pleasant to behold or better pleased with themselves than two young children who in honour of the day have seats among the guests  of these one is a little fellow of six or eight years old brother to the bride—and the other a girl of the same age or something younger whom he calls ‘his wife’  the real bride and bridegroom are not more devoted than they he all love and attention and she all blushes and fondness toying with a little bouquet which he gave her this morning and placing the scattered roseleaves in her bosom with nature’s own coquettishness  they have dreamt of each other in their quiet dreams these children and their little hearts have been nearly broken when the absent one has been dispraised in jest  when will there come in afterlife a passion so earnest generous and true as theirs what even in its gentlest realities can have the grace and charm that hover round such fairy lovers  by this time the merriment and happiness of the feast have gained their height certain ominous looks begin to be exchanged between the bridesmaids and somehow it gets whispered about that the carriage which is to take the young couple into the country has arrived  such members of the party as are most disposed to prolong its enjoyments affect to consider this a false alarm but it turns out too true being speedily confirmed first by the retirement of the bride and a select file of intimates who are to prepare her for the journey and secondly by the withdrawal of the ladies generally  to this there ensues a particularly awkward pause in which everybody essays to be facetious and nobody succeeds at length the bridegroom makes a mysterious disappearance in obedience to some equally mysterious signal and the table is deserted  now for at least six weeks last past it has been solemnly devised and settled that the young couple should go away in secret but they no sooner appear without the door than the drawingroom windows are blocked up with ladies waving their handkerchiefs and kissing their hands and the diningroom panes with gentlemen’s faces beaming farewell in every queer variety of its expression  the hall and steps are crowded with servants in white favours mixed up with particular friends and relations who have darted out to say goodbye and foremost in the group are the tiny lovers arm in arm thinking with fluttering hearts what happiness it would be to dash away together in that gallant coach and never part again  the bride has barely time for one hurried glance at her old home when the steps rattle the door slams the horses clatter on the pavement and they have left it far away  a knot of women servants still remain clustered in the hall whispering among themselves and there of course is anne from number six who has made another escape on some plea or other and been an admiring witness of the departure  there are two points on which anne expatiates over and over again without the smallest appearance of fatigue or intending to leave off one is that she ‘never see in all her life such a—oh such a angel of a gentleman as mr harvey’—and the other that she ‘can’t tell how it is but it don’t seem a bit like a workaday or a sunday neither—it’s all so unsettled and unregular’    the formal couple   the formal couple are the most prim cold immovable and unsatisfactory people on the face of the earth  their faces voices dress house furniture walk and manner are all the essence of formality unrelieved by one redeeming touch of frankness heartiness or nature  everything with the formal couple resolves itself into a matter of form they don’t call upon you on your account but their own not to see how you are but to show how they are it is not a ceremony to do honour to you but to themselves—not due to your position but to theirs  if one of a friend’s children die the formal couple are as sure and punctual in sending to the house as the undertaker if a friend’s family be increased the monthly nurse is not more attentive than they  the formal couple in fact joyfully seize all occasions of testifying their goodbreeding and precise observance of the little usages of society and for you who are the means to this end they care as much as a man does for the tailor who has enabled him to cut a figure or a woman for the milliner who has assisted her to a conquest  having an extensive connexion among that kind of people who make acquaintances and eschew friends the formal gentleman attends from time to time a great many funerals to which he is formally invited and to which he formally goes as returning a call for the last time  here his deportment is of the most faultless description he knows the exact pitch of voice it is proper to assume the sombre look he ought to wear the melancholy tread which should be his gait for the day  he is perfectly acquainted with all the dreary courtesies to be observed in a mourningcoach knows when to sigh and when to hide his nose in the white handkerchief and looks into the grave and shakes his head when the ceremony is concluded with the sad formality of a mute  ‘what kind of funeral was it’ says the formal lady when he returns home  ‘oh’ replies the formal gentleman ‘there never was such a gross and disgusting impropriety there were no feathers’  ‘no feathers’ cries the lady as if on wings of black feathers dead people fly to heaven and lacking them they must of necessity go elsewhere  her husband shakes his head and further adds that they had seedcake instead of plumcake and that it was all white wine  ‘all white wine’ exclaims his wife  ‘nothing but sherry and madeira’ says the husband ‘what no port’  ‘not a drop’  no port no plums and no feathers ‘you will recollect my dear’ says the formal lady in a voice of stately reproof ‘that when we first met this poor man who is now dead and gone and he took that very strange course of addressing me at dinner without being previously introduced i ventured to express my opinion that the family were quite ignorant of etiquette and very imperfectly acquainted with the decencies of life  you have now had a good opportunity of judging for yourself and all i have to say is that i trust you will never go to a funeral there again’  ‘my dear’ replies the formal gentleman ‘i never will’  so the informal deceased is cut in his grave and the formal couple when they tell the story of the funeral shake their heads and wonder what some people’s feelings are made of and what their notions of propriety can be  if the formal couple have a family which they sometimes have they are not children but little pale sour sharpnosed men and women and so exquisitely brought up that they might be very old dwarfs for anything that appeareth to the contrary  indeed they are so acquainted with forms and conventionalities and conduct themselves with such strict decorum that to see the little girl break a lookingglass in some wild outbreak or the little boy kick his parents would be to any visitor an unspeakable relief and consolation  the formal couple are always sticklers for what is rigidly proper and have a great readiness in detecting hidden impropriety of speech or thought which by less scrupulous people would be wholly unsuspected thus if they pay a visit to the theatre they sit all night in a perfect agony lest anything improper or immoral should proceed from the stage and if anything should happen to be said which admits of a double construction they never fail to take it up directly and to express by their looks the great outrage which their feelings have sustained perhaps this is their chief reason for absenting themselves almost entirely from places of public amusement  they go sometimes to the exhibition of the royal academy—but that is often more shocking than the stage itself and the formal lady thinks that it really is high time mr etty was prosecuted and made a public example of  we made one at a christening party not long since where there were amongst the guests a formal couple who suffered the acutest torture from certain jokes incidental to such an occasion cut—and very likely dried also—by one of the godfathers a redfaced elderly gentleman who being highly popular with the rest of the company had it all his own way and was in great spirits  it was at suppertime that this gentleman came out in full force  we—being of a grave and quiet demeanour—had been chosen to escort the formal lady downstairs and sitting beside her had a favourable opportunity of observing her emotions  we have a shrewd suspicion that in the very beginning and in the first blush—literally the first blush—of the matter the formal lady had not felt quite certain whether the being present at such a ceremony and encouraging as it were the public exhibition of a baby was not an act involving some degree of indelicacy and impropriety but certain we are that when that baby’s health was drunk and allusions were made by a greyheaded gentleman proposing it to the time when he had dandled in his arms the young christian’s mother—certain we are that then the formal lady took the alarm and recoiled from the old gentleman as from a hoary profligate  still she bore it she fanned herself with an indignant air but still she bore it  a comic song was sung involving a confession from some imaginary gentleman that he had kissed a female and yet the formal lady bore it  but when at last the health of the godfather beforementioned being drunk the godfather rose to return thanks and in the course of his observations darkly hinted at babies yet unborn and even contemplated the possibility of the subject of that festival having brothers and sisters the formal lady could endure no more but bowing slightly round and sweeping haughtily past the offender left the room in tears under the protection of the formal gentleman    the loving couple   there cannot be a better practical illustration of the wise saw and ancient instance that there may be too much of a good thing than is presented by a loving couple  undoubtedly it is meet and proper that two persons joined together in holy matrimony should be loving and unquestionably it is pleasant to know and see that they are so but there is a time for all things and the couple who happen to be always in a loving state before company are wellnigh intolerable  and in taking up this position we would have it distinctly understood that we do not seek alone the sympathy of bachelors in whose objection to loving couples we recognise interested motives and personal considerations  we grant that to that unfortunate class of society there may be something very irritating tantalising and provoking in being compelled to witness those gentle endearments and chaste interchanges which to loving couples are quite the ordinary business of life  but while we recognise the natural character of the prejudice to which these unhappy men are subject we can neither receive their biassed evidence nor address ourself to their inflamed and angered minds  dispassionate experience is our only guide and in these moral essays we seek no less to reform hymeneal offenders than to hold out a timely warning to all rising couples and even to those who have not yet set forth upon their pilgrimage towards the matrimonial market  let all couples present or to come therefore profit by the example of mr and mrs leaver themselves a loving couple in the first degree  mr and mrs leaver are pronounced by mrs starling a widow lady who lost her husband when she was young and lost herself about the sametime—for by her own count she has never since grown five years older—to be a perfect model of wedded felicity  ‘you would suppose’ says the romantic lady ‘that they were lovers only just now engaged never was such happiness  they are so tender so affectionate so attached to each other so enamoured that positively nothing can be more charming’  ‘augusta my soul’ says mr leaver  ‘augustus my life’ replies mrs leaver  ‘sing some little ballad darling’ quoth mr leaver  ‘i couldn’t indeed dearest’ returns mrs leaver  ‘do my dove’ says mr leaver  ‘i couldn’t possibly my love’ replies mrs leaver ‘and it’s very naughty of you to ask me’  ‘naughty darling’ cries mr leaver ‘yes very naughty and very cruel’ returns mrs leaver ‘for you know i have a sore throat and that to sing would give me great pain  you’re a monster and i hate you  go away’  mrs leaver has said ‘go away’ because mr leaver has tapped her under the chin mr leaver not doing as he is bid but on the contrary sitting down beside her mrs leaver slaps mr leaver and mr leaver in return slaps mrs leaver and it being now time for all persons present to look the other way they look the other way and hear a still small sound as of kissing at which mrs starling is thoroughly enraptured and whispers her neighbour that if all married couples were like that what a heaven this earth would be  the loving couple are at home when this occurs and maybe only three or four friends are present but unaccustomed to reserve upon this interesting point they are pretty much the same abroad  indeed upon some occasions such as a picnic or a waterparty their lovingness is even more developed as we had an opportunity last summer of observing in person  there was a great waterparty made up to go to twickenham and dine and afterwards dance in an empty villa by the riverside hired expressly for the purpose  mr and mrs leaver were of the company and it was our fortune to have a seat in the same boat which was an eightoared galley manned by amateurs with a blue striped awning of the same pattern as their guernsey shirts and a dingy red flag of the same shade as the whiskers of the stroke oar  a coxswain being appointed and all other matters adjusted the eight gentlemen threw themselves into strong paroxysms and pulled up with the tide stimulated by the compassionate remarks of the ladies who one and all exclaimed that it seemed an immense exertion—as indeed it did  at first we raced the other boat which came alongside in gallant style but this being found an unpleasant amusement as giving rise to a great quantity of splashing and rendering the cold pies and other viands very moist it was unanimously voted down and we were suffered to shoot ahead while the second boat followed ingloriously in our wake  it was at this time that we first recognised mr leaver  there were two firemenwatermen in the boat lying by until somebody was exhausted and one of them who had taken upon himself the direction of affairs was heard to cry in a gruff voice ‘pull away number two—give it her number two—take a longer reach number two—now number two sir think you’re winning a boat’  the greater part of the company had no doubt begun to wonder which of the striped guernseys it might be that stood in need of such encouragement when a stifled shriek from mrs leaver confirmed the doubtful and informed the ignorant and mr leaver still further disguised in a straw hat and no neckcloth was observed to be in a fearful perspiration and failing visibly  nor was the general consternation diminished at this instant by the same gentleman in the performance of an accidental aquatic feat termed ‘catching a crab’ plunging suddenly backward and displaying nothing of himself to the company but two violently struggling legs  mrs leaver shrieked again several times and cried piteously—‘is he dead  tell me the worst  is he dead’  now a moment’s reflection might have convinced the loving wife that unless her husband were endowed with some most surprising powers of muscular action he never could be dead while he kicked so hard but still mrs leaver cried ‘is he dead is he dead’ and still everybody else cried—‘no no no’ until such time as mr leaver was replaced in a sitting posture and his oar which had been going through all kinds of wrongheaded performances on its own account was once more put in his hand by the exertions of the two firemenwatermen  mr leaver then exclaimed ‘augustus my child come to me’ and mr leaver said ‘augusta my love compose yourself i am not injured’  but mrs leaver cried again more piteously than before ‘augustus my child come to me’ and now the company generally who seemed to be apprehensive that if mr leaver remained where he was he might contribute more than his proper share towards the drowning of the party disinterestedly took part with mrs leaver and said he really ought to go and that he was not strong enough for such violent exercise and ought never to have undertaken it reluctantly mr leaver went and laid himself down at mrs leaver’s feet and mrs leaver stooping over him said ‘oh augustus how could you terrify me so’ and mr leaver said ‘augusta my sweet i never meant to terrify you’ and mrs leaver said ‘you are faint my dear’ and mr leaver said ‘i am rather so my love’ and they were very loving indeed under mrs leaver’s veil until at length mr leaver came forth again and pleasantly asked if he had not heard something said about bottled stout and sandwiches  mrs starling who was one of the party was perfectly delighted with this scene and frequently murmured halfaside ‘what a loving couple you are’ or ‘how delightful it is to see man and wife so happy together’ to us she was quite poetical for we are a kind of cousins observing that hearts beating in unison like that made life a paradise of sweets and that when kindred creatures were drawn together by sympathies so fine and delicate what more than mortal happiness did not our souls partake to all this we answered ‘certainly’ or ‘very true’ or merely sighed as the case might be  at every new act of the loving couple the widow’s admiration broke out afresh and when mrs leaver would not permit mr leaver to keep his hat off lest the sun should strike to his head and give him a brain fever mrs starling actually shed tears and said it reminded her of adam and eve  the loving couple were thus loving all the way to twickenham but when we arrived there by which time the amateur crew looked very thirsty and vicious they were more playful than ever for mrs leaver threw stones at mr leaver and mr leaver ran after mrs leaver on the grass in a most innocent and enchanting manner  at dinner too mr leaver would steal mrs leaver’s tongue and mrs leaver would retaliate upon mr leaver’s fowl and when mrs leaver was going to take some lobster salad mr leaver wouldn’t let her have any saying that it made her ill and she was always sorry for it afterwards which afforded mrs leaver an opportunity of pretending to be cross and showing many other prettinesses  but this was merely the smiling surface of their loves not the mighty depths of the stream down to which the company to say the truth dived rather unexpectedly from the following accident  it chanced that mr leaver took upon himself to propose the bachelors who had first originated the notion of that entertainment in doing which he affected to regret that he was no longer of their body himself and pretended grievously to lament his fallen state  this mrs leaver’s feelings could not brook even in jest and consequently exclaiming aloud ‘he loves me not he loves me not’ she fell in a very pitiable state into the arms of mrs starling and directly becoming insensible was conveyed by that lady and her husband into another room  presently mr leaver came running back to know if there was a medical gentleman in company and as there was in what company is there not both mr leaver and the medical gentleman hurried away together  the medical gentleman was the first who returned and among his intimate friends he was observed to laugh and wink and look as unmedical as might be but when mr leaver came back he was very solemn and in answer to all inquiries shook his head and remarked that augusta was far too sensitive to be trifled with—an opinion which the widow subsequently confirmed  finding that she was in no imminent peril however the rest of the party betook themselves to dancing on the green and very merry and happy they were and a vast quantity of flirtation there was the last circumstance being no doubt attributable partly to the fineness of the weather and partly to the locality which is well known to be favourable to all harmless recreations  in the bustle of the scene mr and mrs leaver stole down to the boat and disposed themselves under the awning mrs leaver reclining her head upon mr leaver’s shoulder and mr leaver grasping her hand with great fervour and looking in her face from time to time with a melancholy and sympathetic aspect  the widow sat apart feigning to be occupied with a book but stealthily observing them from behind her fan and the two firemenwatermen smoking their pipes on the bank hard by nudged each other and grinned in enjoyment of the joke  very few of the party missed the loving couple and the few who did heartily congratulated each other on their disappearance    the contradictory couple   one would suppose that two people who are to pass their whole lives together and must necessarily be very often alone with each other could find little pleasure in mutual contradiction and yet what is more common than a contradictory couple  the contradictory couple agree in nothing but contradiction  they return home from mrs bluebottle’s dinnerparty each in an opposite corner of the coach and do not exchange a syllable until they have been seated for at least twenty minutes by the fireside at home when the gentleman raising his eyes from the stove all at once breaks silence  ‘what a very extraordinary thing it is’ says he ‘that you will contradict charlotte’  ‘i contradict’ cries the lady ‘but that’s just like you’  ‘what’s like me’ says the gentleman sharply  ‘saying that i contradict you’ replies the lady  ‘do you mean to say that you do not contradict me’ retorts the gentleman ‘do you mean to say that you have not been contradicting me the whole of this day’  ‘do you mean to tell me now that you have not  i mean to tell you nothing of the kind’ replies the lady quietly ‘when you are wrong of course i shall contradict you’  during this dialogue the gentleman has been taking his brandyandwater on one side of the fire and the lady with her dressingcase on the table has been curling her hair on the other  she now lets down her back hair and proceeds to brush it preserving at the same time an air of conscious rectitude and suffering virtue which is intended to exasperate the gentleman—and does so  ‘i do believe’ he says taking the spoon out of his glass and tossing it on the table ‘that of all the obstinate positive wrongheaded creatures that were ever born you are the most so charlotte’ ‘certainly certainly have it your own way pray  you see how much i contradict you’ rejoins the lady  ‘of course you didn’t contradict me at dinnertime—oh no not you’ says the gentleman  ‘yes i did’ says the lady  ‘oh you did’ cries the gentleman ‘you admit that’  ‘if you call that contradiction i do’ the lady answers ‘and i say again edward that when i know you are wrong i will contradict you  i am not your slave’  ‘not my slave’ repeats the gentleman bitterly ‘and you still mean to say that in the blackburns’ new house there are not more than fourteen doors including the door of the winecellar’  ‘i mean to say’ retorts the lady beating time with her hairbrush on the palm of her hand ‘that in that house there are fourteen doors and no more’ ‘well then—’ cries the gentleman rising in despair and pacing the room with rapid strides  ‘by g this is enough to destroy a man’s intellect and drive him mad’  by and by the gentleman comesto a little and passing his hand gloomily across his forehead reseats himself in his former chair  there is a long silence and this time the lady begins  ‘i appealed to mr jenkins who sat next to me on the sofa in the drawingroom during tea—’  ‘morgan you mean’ interrupts the gentleman  ‘i do not mean anything of the kind’ answers the lady  ‘now by all that is aggravating and impossible to bear’ cries the gentleman clenching his hands and looking upwards in agony ‘she is going to insist upon it that morgan is jenkins’  ‘do you take me for a perfect fool’ exclaims the lady ‘do you suppose i don’t know the one from the other  do you suppose i don’t know that the man in the blue coat was mr jenkins’  ‘jenkins in a blue coat’ cries the gentleman with a groan ‘jenkins in a blue coat a man who would suffer death rather than wear anything but brown’  ‘do you dare to charge me with telling an untruth’ demands the lady bursting into tears  ‘i charge you ma’am’ retorts the gentleman starting up ‘with being a monster of contradiction a monster of aggravation a—a—a—jenkins in a blue coat—what have i done that i should be doomed to hear such statements’  expressing himself with great scorn and anguish the gentleman takes up his candle and stalks off to bed where feigning to be fast asleep when the lady comes upstairs drowned in tears murmuring lamentations over her hard fate and indistinct intentions of consulting her brothers he undergoes the secret torture of hearing her exclaim between whiles ‘i know there are only fourteen doors in the house i know it was mr jenkins i know he had a blue coat on and i would say it as positively as i do now if they were the last words i had to speak’  if the contradictory couple are blessed with children they are not the less contradictory on that account  master james and miss charlotte present themselves after dinner and being in perfect good humour and finding their parents in the same amiable state augur from these appearances half a glass of wine apiece and other extraordinary indulgences  but unfortunately master james growing talkative upon such prospects asks his mamma how tall mrs parsons is and whether she is not six feet high to which his mamma replies ‘yes she should think she was for mrs parsons is a very tall lady indeed quite a giantess’ ‘for heaven’s sake charlotte’ cries her husband ‘do not tell the child such preposterous nonsense  six feet high’  ‘well’ replies the lady ‘surely i may be permitted to have an opinion my opinion is that she is six feet high—at least six feet’  ‘now you know charlotte’ retorts the gentleman sternly ‘that that is not your opinion—that you have no such idea—and that you only say this for the sake of contradiction’  ‘you are exceedingly polite’ his wife replies ‘to be wrong about such a paltry question as anybody’s height would be no great crime but i say again that i believe mrs parsons to be six feet—more than six feet nay i believe you know her to be full six feet and only say she is not because i say she is’  this taunt disposes the gentleman to become violent but he cheeks himself and is content to mutter in a haughty tone ‘six feet—ha ha  mrs parsons six feet’ and the lady answers ‘yes six feet  i am sure i am glad you are amused and i’ll say it again—six feet’  thus the subject gradually drops off and the contradiction begins to be forgotten when master james with some undefined notion of making himself agreeable and putting things to rights again unfortunately asks his mamma what the moon’s made of which gives her occasion to say that he had better not ask her for she is always wrong and never can be right that he only exposes her to contradiction by asking any question of her and that he had better ask his papa who is infallible and never can be wrong  papa smarting under this attack gives a terrible pull at the bell and says that if the conversation is to proceed in this way the children had better be removed  removed they are after a few tears and many struggles and pa having looked at ma sideways for a minute or two with a baleful eye draws his pockethandkerchief over his face and composes himself for his afterdinner nap  the friends of the contradictory couple often deplore their frequent disputes though they rather make light of them at the same time observing that there is no doubt they are very much attached to each other and that they never quarrel except about trifles  but neither the friends of the contradictory couple nor the contradictory couple themselves reflect that as the most stupendous objects in nature are but vast collections of minute particles so the slightest and least considered trifles make up the sum of human happiness or misery    the couple who dote upon their children   the couple who dote upon their children have usually a great many of them six or eight at least  the children are either the healthiest in all the world or the most unfortunate in existence  in either case they are equally the theme of their doting parents and equally a source of mental anguish and irritation to their doting parents’ friends  the couple who dote upon their children recognise no dates but those connected with their births accidents illnesses or remarkable deeds they keep a mental almanack with a vast number of innocents’days all in red letters  they recollect the last coronation because on that day little tom fell down the kitchen stairs the anniversary of the gunpowder plot because it was on the fifth of november that ned asked whether wooden legs were made in heaven and cocked hats grew in gardens  mrs whiffler will never cease to recollect the last day of the old year as long as she lives for it was on that day that the baby had the four red spots on its nose which they took for measles nor christmasday for twentyone days after christmasday the twins were born nor good friday for it was on a good friday that she was frightened by the donkeycart when she was in the family way with georgiana  the movable feasts have no motion for mr and mrs whiffler but remain pinned down tight and fast to the shoulders of some small child from whom they can never be separated any more  time was made according to their creed not for slaves but for girls and boys the restless sands in his glass are but little children at play  as we have already intimated the children of this couple can know no medium  they are either prodigies of good health or prodigies of bad health whatever they are they must be prodigies  mr whiffler must have to describe at his office such excruciating agonies constantly undergone by his eldest boy as nobody else’s eldest boy ever underwent or he must be able to declare that there never was a child endowed with such amazing health such an indomitable constitution and such a castiron frame as his child  his children must be in some respect or other above and beyond the children of all other people  to such an extent is this feeling pushed that we were once slightly acquainted with a lady and gentleman who carried their heads so high and became so proud after their youngest child fell out of a twopairofstairs window without hurting himself much that the greater part of their friends were obliged to forego their acquaintance  but perhaps this may be an extreme case and one not justly entitled to be considered as a precedent of general application  if a friend happen to dine in a friendly way with one of these couples who dote upon their children it is nearly impossible for him to divert the conversation from their favourite topic  everything reminds mr whiffler of ned or mrs whiffler of mary anne or of the time before ned was born or the time before mary anne was thought of  the slightest remark however harmless in itself will awaken slumbering recollections of the twins  it is impossible to steer clear of them  they will come uppermost let the poor man do what he may  ned has been known to be lost sight of for half an hour dick has been forgotten the name of mary anne has not been mentioned but the twins will out  nothing can keep down the twins  ‘it’s a very extraordinary thing saunders’ says mr whiffler to the visitor ‘but—you have seen our little babies the—the—twins’  the friend’s heart sinks within him as he answers ‘oh yes—often’  ‘your talking of the pyramids’ says mr whiffler quite as a matter of course ‘reminds me of the twins  it’s a very extraordinary thing about those babies—what colour should you say their eyes were’  ‘upon my word’ the friend stammers ‘i hardly know how to answer’—the fact being that except as the friend does not remember to have heard of any departure from the ordinary course of nature in the instance of these twins they might have no eyes at all for aught he has observed to the contrary ‘you wouldn’t say they were red i suppose’ says mr whiffler  the friend hesitates and rather thinks they are but inferring from the expression of mr whiffler’s face that red is not the colour smiles with some confidence and says ‘no no very different from that’  ‘what should you say to blue’ says mr whiffler  the friend glances at him and observing a different expression in his face ventures to say ‘i should say they were blue—a decided blue’  ‘to be sure’ cries mr whiffler triumphantly ‘i knew you would  but what should you say if i was to tell you that the boy’s eyes are blue and the girl’s hazel eh’ ‘impossible’ exclaims the friend not at all knowing why it should be impossible  ‘a fact notwithstanding’ cries mr whiffler ‘and let me tell you saunders that’s not a common thing in twins or a circumstance that’ll happen every day’  in this dialogue mrs whiffler as being deeply responsible for the twins their charms and singularities has taken no share but she now relates in broken english a witticism of little dick’s bearing upon the subject just discussed which delights mr whiffler beyond measure and causes him to declare that he would have sworn that was dick’s if he had heard it anywhere  then he requests that mrs whiffler will tell saunders what tom said about mad bulls and mrs whiffler relating the anecdote a discussion ensues upon the different character of tom’s wit and dick’s wit from which it appears that dick’s humour is of a lively turn while tom’s style is the dry and caustic  this discussion being enlivened by various illustrations lasts a long time and is only stopped by mrs whiffler instructing the footman to ring the nursery bell as the children were promised that they should come down and taste the pudding  the friend turns pale when this order is given and paler still when it is followed up by a great pattering on the staircase not unlike the sound of rain upon a skylight a violent bursting open of the diningroom door and the tumultuous appearance of six small children closely succeeded by a strong nurserymaid with a twin in each arm  as the whole eight are screaming shouting or kicking—some influenced by a ravenous appetite some by a horror of the stranger and some by a conflict of the two feelings—a pretty long space elapses before all their heads can be ranged round the table and anything like order restored in bringing about which happy state of things both the nurse and footman are severely scratched  at length mrs whiffler is heard to say ‘mr saunders shall i give you some pudding’  a breathless silence ensues and sixteen small eyes are fixed upon the guest in expectation of his reply  a wild shout of joy proclaims that he has said ‘no thank you’ spoons are waved in the air legs appear above the tablecloth in uncontrollable ecstasy and eighty short fingers dabble in damson syrup  while the pudding is being disposed of mr and mrs whiffler look on with beaming countenances and mr whiffler nudging his friend saunders begs him to take notice of tom’s eyes or dick’s chin or ned’s nose or mary anne’s hair or emily’s figure or little bob’s calves or fanny’s mouth or carry’s head as the case may be  whatever the attention of mr saunders is called to mr saunders admires of course though he is rather confused about the sex of the youngest branches and looks at the wrong children turning to a girl when mr whiffler directs his attention to a boy and falling into raptures with a boy when he ought to be enchanted with a girl  then the dessert comes and there is a vast deal of scrambling after fruit and sudden spirting forth of juice out of tight oranges into infant eyes and much screeching and wailing in consequence  at length it becomes time for mrs whiffler to retire and all the children are by force of arms compelled to kiss and love mr saunders before going upstairs except tom who lying on his back in the hall proclaims that mr saunders ‘is a naughty beast’ and dick who having drunk his father’s wine when he was looking another way is found to be intoxicated and is carried out very limp and helpless  mr whiffler and his friend are left alone together but mr whiffler’s thoughts are still with his family if his family are not with him ‘saunders’ says he after a short silence ‘if you please we’ll drink mrs whiffler and the children’  mr saunders feels this to be a reproach against himself for not proposing the same sentiment and drinks it in some confusion  ‘ah’ mr whiffler sighs ‘these children saunders make one quite an old man’  mr saunders thinks that if they were his they would make him a very old man but he says nothing  ‘and yet’ pursues mr whiffler ‘what can equal domestic happiness what can equal the engaging ways of children  saunders why don’t you get married’  now this is an embarrassing question because mr saunders has been thinking that if he had at any time entertained matrimonial designs the revelation of that day would surely have routed them for ever  ‘i am glad however’ says mr whiffler ‘that you are a bachelor—glad on one account saunders a selfish one i admit  will you do mrs whiffler and myself a favour’  mr saunders is surprised—evidently surprised but he replies ‘with the greatest pleasure’  ‘then will you saunders’ says mr whiffler in an impressive manner ‘will you cement and consolidate our friendship by coming into the family so to speak as a godfather’  ‘i shall be proud and delighted’ replies mr saunders ‘which of the children is it really i thought they were all christened or—’  ‘saunders’ mr whiffler interposes ‘they are all christened you are right  the fact is that mrs whiffler is—in short we expect another’  ‘not a ninth’ cries the friend all aghast at the idea  ‘yes saunders’ rejoins mr whiffler solemnly ‘a ninth  did we drink mrs whiffler’s health  let us drink it again saunders and wish her well over it’  doctor johnson used to tell a story of a man who had but one idea which was a wrong one  the couple who dote upon their children are in the same predicament at home or abroad at all times and in all places their thoughts are bound up in this one subject and have no sphere beyond they relate the clever things their offspring say or do and weary every company with their prolixity and absurdity  mr whiffler takes a friend by the button at a street corner on a windy day to tell him a bon mot of his youngest boy’s and mrs whiffler calling to see a sick acquaintance entertains her with a cheerful account of all her own past sufferings and present expectations  in such cases the sins of the fathers indeed descend upon the children for people soon come to regard them as predestined little bores  the couple who dote upon their children cannot be said to be actuated by a general love for these engaging little people which would be a great excuse for they are apt to underrate and entertain a jealousy of any children but their own  if they examined their own hearts they would perhaps find at the bottom of all this more selflove and egotism than they think of  selflove and egotism are bad qualities of which the unrestrained exhibition though it may be sometimes amusing never fails to be wearisome and unpleasant  couples who dote upon their children therefore are best avoided    the cool couple   there is an oldfashioned weatherglass representing a house with two doorways in one of which is the figure of a gentleman in the other the figure of a lady  when the weather is to be fine the lady comes out and the gentleman goes in when wet the gentleman comes out and the lady goes in  they never seek each other’s society are never elevated and depressed by the same cause and have nothing in common  they are the model of a cool couple except that there is something of politeness and consideration about the behaviour of the gentleman in the weatherglass in which neither of the cool couple can be said to participate  the cool couple are seldom alone together and when they are nothing can exceed their apathy and dulness the gentleman being for the most part drowsy and the lady silent  if they enter into conversation it is usually of an ironical or recriminatory nature  thus when the gentleman has indulged in a very long yawn and settled himself more snugly in his easychair the lady will perhaps remark ‘well i am sure charles  i hope you’re comfortable’  to which the gentleman replies ‘oh yes he’s quite comfortable quite’  ‘there are not many married men i hope’ returns the lady ‘who seek comfort in such selfish gratifications as you do’  ‘nor many wives who seek comfort in such selfish gratifications as you do i hope’ retorts the gentleman  ‘whose fault is that’ demands the lady  the gentleman becoming more sleepy returns no answer  ‘whose fault is that’ the lady repeats  the gentleman still returning no answer she goes on to say that she believes there never was in all this world anybody so attached to her home so thoroughly domestic so unwilling to seek a moment’s gratification or pleasure beyond her own fireside as she  god knows that before she was married she never thought or dreamt of such a thing and she remembers that her poor papa used to say again and again almost every day of his life ‘oh my dear louisa if you only marry a man who understands you and takes the trouble to consider your happiness and accommodate himself a very little to your disposition what a treasure he will find in you’  she supposes her papa knew what her disposition was—he had known her long enough—he ought to have been acquainted with it but what can she do  if her home is always dull and lonely and her husband is always absent and finds no pleasure in her society she is naturally sometimes driven seldom enough she is sure to seek a little recreation elsewhere she is not expected to pine and mope to death she hopes  ‘then come louisa’ says the gentleman waking up as suddenly as he fell asleep ‘stop at home this evening and so will i’  ‘i should be sorry to suppose charles that you took a pleasure in aggravating me’ replies the lady ‘but you know as well as i do that i am particularly engaged to mrs mortimer and that it would be an act of the grossest rudeness and illbreeding after accepting a seat in her box and preventing her from inviting anybody else not to go’ ‘ah there it is’ says the gentleman shrugging his shoulders ‘i knew that perfectly well  i knew you couldn’t devote an evening to your own home  now all i have to say louisa is this—recollect that i was quite willing to stay at home and that it’s no fault of mine we are not oftener together’  with that the gentleman goes away to keep an old appointment at his club and the lady hurries off to dress for mrs mortimer’s and neither thinks of the other until by some odd chance they find themselves alone again  but it must not be supposed that the cool couple are habitually a quarrelsome one  quite the contrary  these differences are only occasions for a little selfexcuse—nothing more  in general they are as easy and careless and dispute as seldom as any common acquaintances may for it is neither worth their while to put each other out of the way nor to ruffle themselves  when they meet in society the cool couple are the bestbred people in existence  the lady is seated in a corner among a little knot of lady friends one of whom exclaims ‘why i vow and declare there is your husband my dear’  ‘whose—mine’ she says carelessly  ‘ay yours and coming this way too’  ‘how very odd’ says the lady in a languid tone ‘i thought he had been at dover’  the gentleman coming up and speaking to all the other ladies and nodding slightly to his wife it turns out that he has been at dover and has just now returned  ‘what a strange creature you are’ cries his wife ‘and what on earth brought you here i wonder’  ‘i came to look after you of course’ rejoins her husband this is so pleasant a jest that the lady is mightily amused as are all the other ladies similarly situated who are within hearing and while they are enjoying it to the full the gentleman nods again turns upon his heel and saunters away  there are times however when his company is not so agreeable though equally unexpected such as when the lady has invited one or two particular friends to tea and scandal and he happens to come home in the very midst of their diversion  it is a hundred chances to one that he remains in the house half an hour but the lady is rather disturbed by the intrusion notwithstanding and reasons within herself—‘i am sure i never interfere with him and why should he interfere with me  it can scarcely be accidental it never happens that i have a particular reason for not wishing him to come home but he always comes  it’s very provoking and tiresome and i am sure when he leaves me so much alone for his own pleasure the least he could do would be to do as much for mine’ observing what passes in her mind the gentleman who has come home for his own accommodation makes a merit of it with himself arrives at the conclusion that it is the very last place in which he can hope to be comfortable and determines as he takes up his hat and cane never to be so virtuous again  thus a great many cool couples go on until they are cold couples and the grave has closed over their folly and indifference  loss of name station character life itself has ensued from causes as slight as these before now and when gossips tell such tales and aggravate their deformities they elevate their hands and eyebrows and call each other to witness what a cool couple mr and mrs soandso always were even in the best of times    the plausible couple   the plausible couple have many titles  they are ‘a delightful couple’ an ‘affectionate couple’ ‘a most agreeable couple ‘a goodhearted couple’ and ‘the bestnatured couple in existence’  the truth is that the plausible couple are people of the world and either the way of pleasing the world has grown much easier than it was in the days of the old man and his ass or the old man was but a bad hand at it and knew very little of the trade  ‘but is it really possible to please the world’ says some doubting reader  it is indeed  nay it is not only very possible but very easy the ways are crooked and sometimes foul and low  what then  a man need but crawl upon his hands and knees know when to close his eyes and when his ears when to stoop and when to stand upright and if by the world is meant that atom of it in which he moves himself he shall please it never fear  now it will be readily seen that if a plausible man or woman have an easy means of pleasing the world by an adaptation of self to all its twistings and twinings a plausible man and woman or in other words a plausible couple playing into each other’s hands and acting in concert have a manifest advantage  hence it is that plausible couples scarcely ever fail of success on a pretty large scale and hence it is that if the reader laying down this unwieldy volume at the next full stop will have the goodness to review his or her circle of acquaintance and to search particularly for some man and wife with a large connexion and a good name not easily referable to their abilities or their wealth he or she that is the male or female reader will certainly find that gentleman or lady on a very short reflection to be a plausible couple  the plausible couple are the most ecstatic people living the most sensitive people—to merit—on the face of the earth  nothing clever or virtuous escapes them  they have microscopic eyes for such endowments and can find them anywhere  the plausible couple never fawn—oh no  they don’t even scruple to tell their friends of their faults  one is too generous another too candid a third has a tendency to think all people like himself and to regard mankind as a company of angels a fourth is kindhearted to a fault  ‘we never flatter my dear mrs jackson’ say the plausible couple ‘we speak our minds  neither you nor mr jackson have faults enough  it may sound strangely but it is true  you have not faults enough  you know our way—we must speak out and always do quarrel with us for saying so if you will but we repeat it—you have not faults enough’  the plausible couple are no less plausible to each other than to third parties  they are always loving and harmonious  the plausible gentleman calls his wife ‘darling’ and the plausible lady addresses him as ‘dearest’  if it be mr and mrs bobtail widger mrs widger is ‘lavinia darling’ and mr widger is ‘bobtail dearest’  speaking of each other they observe the same tender form  mrs widger relates what ‘bobtail’ said and mr widger recounts what ‘darling’ thought and did  if you sit next to the plausible lady at a dinnertable she takes the earliest opportunity of expressing her belief that you are acquainted with the clickits she is sure she has heard the clickits speak of you—she must not tell you in what terms or you will take her for a flatterer  you admit a knowledge of the clickits the plausible lady immediately launches out in their praise  she quite loves the clickits were there ever such truehearted hospitable excellent people—such a gentle interesting little woman as mrs clickit or such a frank unaffected creature as mr clickit were there ever two people in short so little spoiled by the world as they are  ‘as who darling’ cries mr widger from the opposite side of the table  ‘the clickits dearest’ replies mrs widger  ‘indeed you are right darling’ mr widger rejoins ‘the clickits are a very highminded worthy estimable couple’ mrs widger remarking that bobtail always grows quite eloquent upon this subject mr widger admits that he feels very strongly whenever such people as the clickits and some other friends of his here he glances at the host and hostess are mentioned for they are an honour to human nature and do one good to think of  ‘you know the clickits mrs jackson’ he says addressing the lady of the house  ‘no indeed we have not that pleasure’ she replies  ‘you astonish me’ exclaims mr widger ‘not know the clickits why you are the very people of all others who ought to be their bosom friends  you are kindred beings you are one and the same thing—not know the clickits  now will you know the clickits  will you make a point of knowing them  will you meet them in a friendly way at our house one evening and be acquainted with them’ mrs jackson will be quite delighted nothing would give her more pleasure  ‘then lavinia my darling’ says mr widger ‘mind you don’t lose sight of that now pray take care that mr and mrs jackson know the clickits without loss of time  such people ought not to be strangers to each other’  mrs widger books both families as the centre of attraction for her next party and mr widger going on to expatiate upon the virtues of the clickits adds to their other moral qualities that they keep one of the neatest phaetons in town and have two thousand a year  as the plausible couple never laud the merits of any absent person without dexterously contriving that their praises shall reflect upon somebody who is present so they never depreciate anything or anybody without turning their depreciation to the same account  their friend mr slummery say they is unquestionably a clever painter and would no doubt be very popular and sell his pictures at a very high price if that cruel mr fithers had not forestalled him in his department of art and made it thoroughly and completely his own—fithers it is to be observed being present and within hearing and slummery elsewhere  is mrs tabblewick really as beautiful as people say  why there indeed you ask them a very puzzling question because there is no doubt that she is a very charming woman and they have long known her intimately  she is no doubt beautiful very beautiful they once thought her the most beautiful woman ever seen still if you press them for an honest answer they are bound to say that this was before they had ever seen our lovely friend on the sofa the sofa is hard by and our lovely friend can’t help hearing the whispers in which this is said since that time perhaps they have been hardly fair judges mrs tabblewick is no doubt extremely handsome—very like our friend in fact in the form of the features—but in point of expression and soul and figure and air altogether—oh dear  but while the plausible couple depreciate they are still careful to preserve their character for amiability and kind feeling indeed the depreciation itself is often made to grow out of their excessive sympathy and good will  the plausible lady calls on a lady who dotes upon her children and is sitting with a little girl upon her knee enraptured by her artless replies and protesting that there is nothing she delights in so much as conversing with these fairies when the other lady inquires if she has seen young mrs finching lately and whether the baby has turned out a finer one than it promised to be  ‘oh dear’ cries the plausible lady ‘you cannot think how often bobtail and i have talked about poor mrs finching—she is such a dear soul and was so anxious that the baby should be a fine child—and very naturally because she was very much here at one time and there is you know a natural emulation among mothers—that it is impossible to tell you how much we have felt for her’ ‘is it weak or plain or what’ inquires the other  ‘weak or plain my love’ returns the plausible lady ‘it’s a fright—a perfect little fright you never saw such a miserable creature in all your days positively you must not let her see one of these beautiful dears again or you’ll break her heart you will indeed—heaven bless this child see how she is looking in my face can you conceive anything prettier than that  if poor mrs finching could only hope—but that’s impossible—and the gifts of providence you know—what did i do with my pockethandkerchief’  what prompts the mother who dotes upon her children to comment to her lord that evening on the plausible lady’s engaging qualities and feeling heart and what is it that procures mr and mrs bobtail widger an immediate invitation to dinner    the nice little couple   a custom once prevailed in oldfashioned circles that when a lady or gentleman was unable to sing a song he or she should enliven the company with a story  as we find ourself in the predicament of not being able to describe to our own satisfaction nice little couples in the abstract we purpose telling in this place a little story about a nice little couple of our acquaintance  mr and mrs chirrup are the nice little couple in question  mr chirrup has the smartness and something of the brisk quick manner of a small bird  mrs chirrup is the prettiest of all little women and has the prettiest little figure conceivable  she has the neatest little foot and the softest little voice and the pleasantest little smile and the tidiest little curls and the brightest little eyes and the quietest little manner and is in short altogether one of the most engaging of all little women dead or alive  she is a condensation of all the domestic virtues—a pocket edition of the young man’s best companion—a little woman at a very high pressure with an amazing quantity of goodness and usefulness in an exceedingly small space  little as she is mrs chirrup might furnish forth matter for the moral equipment of a score of housewives six feet high in their stockings—if in the presence of ladies we may be allowed the expression—and of corresponding robustness  nobody knows all this better than mr chirrup though he rather takes on that he don’t  accordingly he is very proud of his betterhalf and evidently considers himself as all other people consider him rather fortunate in having her to wife  we say evidently because mr chirrup is a warmhearted little fellow and if you catch his eye when he has been slyly glancing at mrs chirrup in company there is a certain complacent twinkle in it accompanied perhaps by a halfexpressed toss of the head which as clearly indicates what has been passing in his mind as if he had put it into words and shouted it out through a speakingtrumpet  moreover mr chirrup has a particularly mild and birdlike manner of calling mrs chirrup ‘my dear’ and—for he is of a jocose turn—of cutting little witticisms upon her and making her the subject of various harmless pleasantries which nobody enjoys more thoroughly than mrs chirrup herself  mr chirrup too now and then affects to deplore his bachelordays and to bemoan with a marvellously contented and smirking face the loss of his freedom and the sorrow of his heart at having been taken captive by mrs chirrup—all of which circumstances combine to show the secret triumph and satisfaction of mr chirrup’s soul  we have already had occasion to observe that mrs chirrup is an incomparable housewife  in all the arts of domestic arrangement and management in all the mysteries of confectionerymaking pickling and preserving never was such a thorough adept as that nice little body she is besides a cunning worker in muslin and fine linen and a special hand at marketing to the very best advantage  but if there be one branch of housekeeping in which she excels to an utterly unparalleled and unprecedented extent it is in the important one of carving  a roast goose is universally allowed to be the great stumblingblock in the way of young aspirants to perfection in this department of science many promising carvers beginning with legs of mutton and preserving a good reputation through fillets of veal sirloins of beef quarters of lamb fowls and even ducks have sunk before a roast goose and lost caste and character for ever  to mrs chirrup the resolving a goose into its smallest component parts is a pleasant pastime—a practical joke—a thing to be done in a minute or so without the smallest interruption to the conversation of the time  no handing the dish over to an unfortunate man upon her right or left no wild sharpening of the knife no hacking and sawing at an unruly joint no noise no splash no heat no leaving off in despair all is confidence and cheerfulness  the dish is set upon the table the cover is removed for an instant and only an instant you observe that mrs chirrup’s attention is distracted she smiles but heareth not  you proceed with your story meanwhile the glittering knife is slowly upraised both mrs chirrup’s wrists are slightly but not ungracefully agitated she compresses her lips for an instant then breaks into a smile and all is over  the legs of the bird slide gently down into a pool of gravy the wings seem to melt from the body the breast separates into a row of juicy slices the smaller and more complicated parts of his anatomy are perfectly developed a cavern of stuffing is revealed and the goose is gone  to dine with mr and mrs chirrup is one of the pleasantest things in the world  mr chirrup has a bachelor friend who lived with him in his own days of single blessedness and to whom he is mightily attached contrary to the usual custom this bachelor friend is no less a friend of mrs chirrup’s and consequently whenever you dine with mr and mrs chirrup you meet the bachelor friend  it would put any reasonablyconditioned mortal into goodhumour to observe the entire unanimity which subsists between these three but there is a quiet welcome dimpling in mrs chirrup’s face a bustling hospitality oozing as it were out of the waistcoatpockets of mr chirrup and a patronising enjoyment of their cordiality and satisfaction on the part of the bachelor friend which is quite delightful  on these occasions mr chirrup usually takes an opportunity of rallying the friend on being single and the friend retorts on mr chirrup for being married at which moments some single young ladies present are like to die of laughter and we have more than once observed them bestow looks upon the friend which convinces us that his position is by no means a safe one as indeed we hold no bachelor’s to be who visits married friends and cracks jokes on wedlock for certain it is that such men walk among traps and nets and pitfalls innumerable and often find themselves down upon their knees at the altar rails taking m or n for their wedded wives before they know anything about the matter  however this is no business of mr chirrup’s who talks and laughs and drinks his wine and laughs again and talks more until it is time to repair to the drawingroom where coffee served and over mrs chirrup prepares for a round game by sorting the nicest possible little fish into the nicest possible little pools and calling mr chirrup to assist her which mr chirrup does  as they stand side by side you find that mr chirrup is the least possible shadow of a shade taller than mrs chirrup and that they are the neatest and bestmatched little couple that can be which the chances are ten to one against your observing with such effect at any other time unless you see them in the street arminarm or meet them some rainy day trotting along under a very small umbrella  the round game at which mr chirrup is the merriest of the party being done and over in course of time a nice little tray appears on which is a nice little supper and when that is finished likewise and you have said ‘good night’ you find yourself repeating a dozen times as you ride home that there never was such a nice little couple as mr and mrs chirrup  whether it is that pleasant qualities being packed more closely in small bodies than in large come more readily to hand than when they are diffused over a wider space and have to be gathered together for use we don’t know but as a general rule—strengthened like all other rules by its exceptions—we hold that little people are sprightly and goodnatured  the more sprightly and goodnatured people we have the better therefore let us wish well to all nice little couples and hope that they may increase and multiply    the egotistical couple   egotism in couples is of two kinds—it is our purpose to show this by two examples  the egotistical couple may be young old middleaged well to do or ill to do they may have a small family a large family or no family at all there is no outward sign by which an egotistical couple may be known and avoided  they come upon you unawares there is no guarding against them no man can of himself be forewarned or forearmed against an egotistical couple  the egotistical couple have undergone every calamity and experienced every pleasurable and painful sensation of which our nature is susceptible  you cannot by possibility tell the egotistical couple anything they don’t know or describe to them anything they have not felt  they have been everything but dead  sometimes we are tempted to wish they had been even that but only in our uncharitable moments which are few and far between  we happened the other day in the course of a morning call to encounter an egotistical couple nor were we suffered to remain long in ignorance of the fact for our very first inquiry of the lady of the house brought them into active and vigorous operation  the inquiry was of course touching the lady’s health and the answer happened to be that she had not been very well  ‘oh my dear’ said the egotistical lady ‘don’t talk of not being well  we have been in such a state since we saw you last’—the lady of the house happening to remark that her lord had not been well either the egotistical gentleman struck in ‘never let briggs complain of not being well—never let briggs complain my dear mrs briggs after what i have undergone within these six weeks  he doesn’t know what it is to be ill he hasn’t the least idea of it not the faintest conception’—‘my dear’ interposed his wife smiling ‘you talk as if it were almost a crime in mr briggs not to have been as ill as we have been instead of feeling thankful to providence that both he and our dear mrs briggs are in such blissful ignorance of real suffering’—‘my love’ returned the egotistical gentleman in a low and pious voice ‘you mistake me—i feel grateful—very grateful  i trust our friends may never purchase their experience as dearly as we have bought ours i hope they never may’  having put down mrs briggs upon this theme and settled the question thus the egotistical gentleman turned to us and after a few preliminary remarks all tending towards and leading up to the point he had in his mind inquired if we happened to be acquainted with the dowager lady snorflerer  on our replying in the negative he presumed we had often met lord slang or beyond all doubt that we were on intimate terms with sir chipkins glogwog  finding that we were equally unable to lay claim to either of these distinctions he expressed great astonishment and turning to his wife with a retrospective smile inquired who it was that had told that capital story about the mashed potatoes  ‘who my dear’ returned the egotistical lady ‘why sir chipkins of course how can you ask  don’t you remember his applying it to our cook and saying that you and i were so like the prince and princess that he could almost have sworn we were they’  ‘to be sure i remember that’ said the egotistical gentleman ‘but are you quite certain that didn’t apply to the other anecdote about the emperor of austria and the pump’  ‘upon my word then i think it did’ replied his wife  ‘to be sure it did’ said the egotistical gentleman ‘it was slang’s story i remember now perfectly’  however it turned out a few seconds afterwards that the egotistical gentleman’s memory was rather treacherous as he began to have a misgiving that the story had been told by the dowager lady snorflerer the very last time they dined there but there appearing on further consideration strong circumstantial evidence tending to show that this couldn’t be inasmuch as the dowager lady snorflerer had been on the occasion in question wholly engrossed by the egotistical lady the egotistical gentleman recanted this opinion and after laying the story at the doors of a great many great people happily left it at last with the duke of scuttlewig—observing that it was not extraordinary he had forgotten his grace hitherto as it often happened that the names of those with whom we were upon the most familiar footing were the very last to present themselves to our thoughts  it not only appeared that the egotistical couple knew everybody but that scarcely any event of importance or notoriety had occurred for many years with which they had not been in some way or other connected  thus we learned that when the wellknown attempt upon the life of george the third was made by hatfield in drury lane theatre the egotistical gentleman’s grandfather sat upon his right hand and was the first man who collared him and that the egotistical lady’s aunt sitting within a few boxes of the royal party was the only person in the audience who heard his majesty exclaim ‘charlotte charlotte don’t be frightened don’t be frightened they’re letting off squibs they’re letting off squibs’ when the fire broke out which ended in the destruction of the two houses of parliament the egotistical couple being at the time at a drawingroom window on blackheath then and there simultaneously exclaimed to the astonishment of a whole party—‘it’s the house of lords’  nor was this a solitary instance of their peculiar discernment for chancing to be as by a comparison of dates and circumstances they afterwards found in the same omnibus with mr greenacre when he carried his victim’s head about town in a blue bag they both remarked a singular twitching in the muscles of his countenance and walking down fish street hill a few weeks since the egotistical gentleman said to his lady—slightly casting up his eyes to the top of the monument—‘there’s a boy up there my dear reading a bible  it’s very strange  i don’t like it—in five seconds afterwards sir’ says the egotistical gentleman bringing his hands together with one violent clap—‘the lad was over’  diversifying these topics by the introduction of many others of the same kind and entertaining us between whiles with a minute account of what weather and diet agreed with them and what weather and diet disagreed with them and at what time they usually got up and at what time went to bed with many other particulars of their domestic economy too numerous to mention the egotistical couple at length took their leave and afforded us an opportunity of doing the same  mr and mrs sliverstone are an egotistical couple of another class for all the lady’s egotism is about her husband and all the gentleman’s about his wife  for example—mr sliverstone is a clerical gentleman and occasionally writes sermons as clerical gentlemen do  if you happen to obtain admission at the streetdoor while he is so engaged mrs sliverstone appears on tiptoe and speaking in a solemn whisper as if there were at least three or four particular friends upstairs all upon the point of death implores you to be very silent for mr sliverstone is composing and she need not say how very important it is that he should not be disturbed  unwilling to interrupt anything so serious you hasten to withdraw with many apologies but this mrs sliverstone will by no means allow observing that she knows you would like to see him as it is very natural you should and that she is determined to make a trial for you as you are a great favourite  so you are led upstairs—still on tiptoe—to the door of a little back room in which as the lady informs you in a whisper mr sliverstone always writes  no answer being returned to a couple of soft taps the lady opens the door and there sure enough is mr sliverstone with dishevelled hair powdering away with pen ink and paper at a rate which if he has any power of sustaining it would settle the longest sermon in no time  at first he is too much absorbed to be roused by this intrusion but presently looking up says faintly ‘ah’ and pointing to his desk with a weary and languid smile extends his hand and hopes you’ll forgive him then mrs sliverstone sits down beside him and taking his hand in hers tells you how that mr sliverstone has been shut up there ever since nine o’clock in the morning it is by this time twelve at noon and how she knows it cannot be good for his health and is very uneasy about it unto this mr sliverstone replies firmly that ‘it must be done’ which agonizes mrs sliverstone still more and she goes on to tell you that such were mr sliverstone’s labours last week—what with the buryings marryings churchings christenings and all together—that when he was going up the pulpit stairs on sunday evening he was obliged to hold on by the rails or he would certainly have fallen over into his own pew mr sliverstone who has been listening and smiling meekly says ‘not quite so bad as that not quite so bad’ he admits though on crossexamination that he was very near falling upon the verger who was following him up to bolt the door but adds that it was his duty as a christian to fall upon him if need were and that he mr sliverstone and possibly the verger too ought to glory in it  this sentiment communicates new impulse to mrs sliverstone who launches into new praises of mr sliverstone’s worth and excellence to which he listens in the same meek silence save when he puts in a word of selfdenial relative to some question of fact as—‘not seventytwo christenings that week my dear  only seventyone only seventyone’ at length his lady has quite concluded and then he says why should he repine why should he give way why should he suffer his heart to sink within him  is it he alone who toils and suffers  what has she gone through he should like to know  what does she go through every day for him and for society  with such an exordium mr sliverstone launches out into glowing praises of the conduct of mrs sliverstone in the production of eight young children and the subsequent rearing and fostering of the same and thus the husband magnifies the wife and the wife the husband  this would be well enough if mr and mrs sliverstone kept it to themselves or even to themselves and a friend or two but they do not the more hearers they have the more egotistical the couple become and the more anxious they are to make believers in their merits  perhaps this is the worst kind of egotism  it has not even the poor excuse of being spontaneous but is the result of a deliberate system and malice aforethought  mere emptyheaded conceit excites our pity but ostentatious hypocrisy awakens our disgust    the couple who coddle themselves   mrs merrywinkle’s maiden name was chopper  she was the only child of mr and mrs chopper  her father died when she was as the playbooks express it ‘yet an infant’ and so old mrs chopper when her daughter married made the house of her soninlaw her home from that time henceforth and set up her staff of rest with mr and mrs merrywinkle  mr and mrs merrywinkle are a couple who coddle themselves and the venerable mrs chopper is an aider and abettor in the same  mr merrywinkle is a rather lean and longnecked gentleman middleaged and middlesized and usually troubled with a cold in the head  mrs merrywinkle is a delicatelooking lady with very light hair and is exceedingly subject to the same unpleasant disorder  the venerable mrs chopper—who is strictly entitled to the appellation her daughter not being very young otherwise than by courtesy at the time of her marriage which was some years ago—is a mysterious old lady who lurks behind a pair of spectacles and is afflicted with a chronic disease respecting which she has taken a vast deal of medical advice and referred to a vast number of medical books without meeting any definition of symptoms that at all suits her or enables her to say ‘that’s my complaint’  indeed the absence of authentic information upon the subject of this complaint would seem to be mrs chopper’s greatest ill as in all other respects she is an uncommonly hale and hearty gentlewoman  both mr and mrs chopper wear an extraordinary quantity of flannel and have a habit of putting their feet in hot water to an unnatural extent they likewise indulge in chamomile tea and suchlike compounds and rub themselves on the slightest provocation with camphorated spirits and other lotions applicable to mumps sorethroat rheumatism or lumbago  mr merrywinkle’s leaving home to go to business on a damp or wet morning is a very elaborate affair  he puts on washleather socks over his stockings and indiarubber shoes above his boots and wears under his waistcoat a cuirass of hareskin  besides these precautions he winds a thick shawl round his throat and blocks up his mouth with a large silk handkerchief  thus accoutred and furnished besides with a greatcoat and umbrella he braves the dangers of the streets travelling in severe weather at a gentle trot the better to preserve the circulation and bringing his mouth to the surface to take breath but very seldom and with the utmost caution  his officedoor opened he shoots past his clerk at the same pace and diving into his own private room closes the door examines the windowfastenings and gradually unrobes himself hanging his pockethandkerchief on the fender to air and determining to write to the newspapers about the fog which he says ‘has really got to that pitch that it is quite unbearable’  in this last opinion mrs merrywinkle and her respected mother fully concur for though not present their thoughts and tongues are occupied with the same subject which is their constant theme all day  if anybody happens to call mrs merrywinkle opines that they must assuredly be mad and her first salutation is ‘why what in the name of goodness can bring you out in such weather  you know you must catch your death’  this assurance is corroborated by mrs chopper who adds in further confirmation a dismal legend concerning an individual of her acquaintance who making a call under precisely parallel circumstances and being then in the best health and spirits expired in fortyeight hours afterwards of a complication of inflammatory disorders  the visitor rendered not altogether comfortable perhaps by this and other precedents inquires very affectionately after mr merrywinkle but by so doing brings about no change of the subject for mr merrywinkle’s name is inseparably connected with his complaints and his complaints are inseparably connected with mrs merrywinkle’s and when these are done with mrs chopper who has been biding her time cuts in with the chronic disorder—a subject upon which the amiable old lady never leaves off speaking until she is left alone and very often not then  but mr merrywinkle comes home to dinner  he is received by mrs merrywinkle and mrs chopper who on his remarking that he thinks his feet are damp turn pale as ashes and drag him upstairs imploring him to have them rubbed directly with a dry coarse towel  rubbed they are one by mrs merrywinkle and one by mrs chopper until the friction causes mr merrywinkle to make horrible faces and look as if he had been smelling very powerful onions when they desist and the patient provided for his better security with thick worsted stockings and list slippers is borne downstairs to dinner  now the dinner is always a good one the appetites of the diners being delicate and requiring a little of what mrs merrywinkle calls ‘tittivation’ the secret of which is understood to lie in good cookery and tasteful spices and which process is so successfully performed in the present instance that both mr and mrs merrywinkle eat a remarkably good dinner and even the afflicted mrs chopper wields her knife and fork with much of the spirit and elasticity of youth  but mr merrywinkle in his desire to gratify his appetite is not unmindful of his health for he has a bottle of carbonate of soda with which to qualify his porter and a little pair of scales in which to weigh it out  neither in his anxiety to take care of his body is he unmindful of the welfare of his immortal part as he always prays that for what he is going to receive he may be made truly thankful and in order that he may be as thankful as possible eats and drinks to the utmost  either from eating and drinking so much or from being the victim of this constitutional infirmity among others mr merrywinkle after two or three glasses of wine falls fast asleep and he has scarcely closed his eyes when mrs merrywinkle and mrs chopper fall asleep likewise  it is on awakening at teatime that their most alarming symptoms prevail for then mr merrywinkle feels as if his temples were tightly bound round with the chain of the streetdoor and mrs merrywinkle as if she had made a hearty dinner of halfhundredweights and mrs chopper as if cold water were running down her back and oysterknives with sharp points were plunging of their own accord into her ribs  symptoms like these are enough to make people peevish and no wonder that they remain so until suppertime doing little more than doze and complain unless mr merrywinkle calls out very loudly to a servant ‘to keep that draught out’ or rushes into the passage to flourish his fist in the countenance of the twopennypostman for daring to give such a knock as he had just performed at the door of a private gentleman with nerves  supper coming after dinner should consist of some gentle provocative and therefore the tittivating art is again in requisition and again—done honour to by mr and mrs merrywinkle still comforted and abetted by mrs chopper  after supper it is ten to one but the lastnamed old lady becomes worse and is led off to bed with the chronic complaint in full vigour  mr and mrs merrywinkle having administered to her a warm cordial which is something of the strongest then repair to their own room where mr merrywinkle with his legs and feet in hot water superintends the mulling of some wine which he is to drink at the very moment he plunges into bed while mrs merrywinkle in garments whose nature is unknown to and unimagined by all but married men takes four small pills with a spasmodic look between each and finally comes to something hot and fragrant out of another little saucepan which serves as her composingdraught for the night  there is another kind of couple who coddle themselves and who do so at a cheaper rate and on more spare diet because they are niggardly and parsimonious for which reason they are kind enough to coddle their visitors too  it is unnecessary to describe them for our readers may rest assured of the accuracy of these general principles—that all couples who coddle themselves are selfish and slothful—that they charge upon every wind that blows every rain that falls and every vapour that hangs in the air the evils which arise from their own imprudence or the gloom which is engendered in their own tempers—and that all men and women in couples or otherwise who fall into exclusive habits of selfindulgence and forget their natural sympathy and close connexion with everybody and everything in the world around them not only neglect the first duty of life but by a happy retributive justice deprive themselves of its truest and best enjoyment    the old couple   they are grandfather and grandmother to a dozen grown people and have greatgrandchildren besides their bodies are bent their hair is grey their step tottering and infirm  is this the lightsome pair whose wedding was so merry and have the young couple indeed grown old so soon  it seems but yesterday—and yet what a host of cares and griefs are crowded into the intervening time which reckoned by them lengthens out into a century  how many new associations have wreathed themselves about their hearts since then  the old time is gone and a new time has come for others—not for them  they are but the rusting link that feebly joins the two and is silently loosening its hold and dropping asunder  it seems but yesterday—and yet three of their children have sunk into the grave and the tree that shades it has grown quite old  one was an infant—they wept for him the next a girl a slight young thing too delicate for earth—her loss was hard indeed to bear  the third a man that was the worst of all but even that grief is softened now  it seems but yesterday—and yet how the gay and laughing faces of that bright morning have changed and vanished from above ground  faint likenesses of some remain about them yet but they are very faint and scarcely to be traced  the rest are only seen in dreams and even they are unlike what they were in eyes so old and dim  one or two dresses from the bridal wardrobe are yet preserved  they are of a quaint and antique fashion and seldom seen except in pictures white has turned yellow and brighter hues have faded  do you wonder child  the wrinkled face was once as smooth as yours the eyes as bright the shrivelled skin as fair and delicate  it is the work of hands that have been dust these many years  where are the fairy lovers of that happy day whose annual return comes upon the old man and his wife like the echo of some village bell which has long been silent  let yonder peevish bachelor racked by rheumatic pains and quarrelling with the world let him answer to the question he recollects something of a favourite playmate her name was lucy—so they tell him  he is not sure whether she was married or went abroad or died  it is a long while ago and he don’t remember  is nothing as it used to be does no one feel or think or act as in days of yore  yes  there is an aged woman who once lived servant with the old lady’s father and is sheltered in an almshouse not far off she is still attached to the family and loves them all she nursed the children in her lap and tended in their sickness those who are no more her old mistress has still something of youth in her eyes the young ladies are like what she was but not quite so handsome nor are the gentlemen as stately as mr harvey used to be  she has seen a great deal of trouble her husband and her son died long ago but she has got over that and is happy now—quite happy  if ever her attachment to her old protectors were disturbed by fresher cares and hopes it has long since resumed its former current  it has filled the void in the poor creature’s heart and replaced the love of kindred  death has not left her alone and this with a roof above her head and a warm hearth to sit by makes her cheerful and contented does she remember the marriage of greatgrandmamma  ay that she does as well—as if it was only yesterday  you wouldn’t think it to look at her now and perhaps she ought not to say so of herself but she was as smart a young girl then as you’d wish to see  she recollects she took a friend of hers upstairs to see miss emma dressed for church her name was—ah she forgets the name but she remembers that she was a very pretty girl and that she married not long afterwards and lived—it has quite passed out of her mind where she lived but she knows she had a bad husband who used her ill and that she died in lambeth workhouse  dear dear in lambeth workhouse  and the old couple—have they no comfort or enjoyment of existence  see them among their grandchildren and greatgrandchildren how garrulous they are how they compare one with another and insist on likenesses which no one else can see how gently the old lady lectures the girls on points of breeding and decorum and points the moral by anecdotes of herself in her young days—how the old gentleman chuckles over boyish feats and roguish tricks and tells long stories of a ‘barringout’ achieved at the school he went to which was very wrong he tells the boys and never to be imitated of course but which he cannot help letting them know was very pleasant too—especially when he kissed the master’s niece  this last however is a point on which the old lady is very tender for she considers it a shocking and indelicate thing to talk about and always says so whenever it is mentioned never failing to observe that he ought to be very penitent for having been so sinful  so the old gentleman gets no further and what the schoolmaster’s niece said afterwards which he is always going to tell is lost to posterity  the old gentleman is eighty years old today—‘eighty years old crofts and never had a headache’ he tells the barber who shaves him the barber being a young fellow and very subject to that complaint  ‘that’s a great age crofts’ says the old gentleman  ‘i don’t think it’s sich a wery great age sir’ replied the barber  ‘crofts’ rejoins the old gentleman ‘you’re talking nonsense to me  eighty not a great age’ ‘it’s a wery great age sir for a gentleman to be as healthy and active as you are’ returns the barber ‘but my grandfather sir he was ninetyfour’  ‘you don’t mean that crofts’ says the old gentleman  ‘i do indeed sir’ retorts the barber ‘and as wiggerous as julius caesar my grandfather was’  the old gentleman muses a little time and then says ‘what did he die of crofts’  ‘he died accidentally sir’ returns the barber ‘he didn’t mean to do it  he always would go a running about the streets—walking never satisfied his spirit—and he run against a post and died of a hurt in his chest’  the old gentleman says no more until the shaving is concluded and then he gives crofts halfacrown to drink his health  he is a little doubtful of the barber’s veracity afterwards and telling the anecdote to the old lady affects to make very light of it—though to be sure he adds there was old parr and in some parts of england ninetyfive or so is a common age quite a common age  this morning the old couple are cheerful but serious recalling old times as well as they can remember them and dwelling upon many passages in their past lives which the day brings to mind  the old lady reads aloud in a tremulous voice out of a great bible and the old gentleman with his hand to his ear listens with profound respect  when the book is closed they sit silent for a short space and afterwards resume their conversation with a reference perhaps to their dead children as a subject not unsuited to that they have just left  by degrees they are led to consider which of those who survive are the most like those dearlyremembered objects and so they fall into a less solemn strain and become cheerful again  how many people in all grandchildren greatgrandchildren and one or two intimate friends of the family dine together today at the eldest son’s to congratulate the old couple and wish them many happy returns is a calculation beyond our powers but this we know that the old couple no sooner present themselves very sprucely and carefully attired than there is a violent shouting and rushing forward of the younger branches with all manner of presents such as pocketbooks pencilcases penwipers watchpapers pincushions sleevebuckles workedslippers watchguards and even a nutmeggrater the latter article being presented by a very chubby and very little boy who exhibits it in great triumph as an extraordinary variety  the old couple’s emotion at these tokens of remembrance occasions quite a pathetic scene of which the chief ingredients are a vast quantity of kissing and hugging and repeated wipings of small eyes and noses with small square pockethandkerchiefs which don’t come at all easily out of small pockets  even the peevish bachelor is moved and he says as he presents the old gentleman with a queer sort of antique ring from his own finger that he’ll be de’ed if he doesn’t think he looks younger than he did ten years ago  but the great time is after dinner when the dessert and wine are on the table which is pushed back to make plenty of room and they are all gathered in a large circle round the fire for it is then—the glasses being filled and everybody ready to drink the toast—that two greatgrandchildren rush out at a given signal and presently return dragging in old jane adams leaning upon her crutched stick and trembling with age and pleasure  who so popular as poor old jane nurse and storyteller in ordinary to two generations and who so happy as she striving to bend her stiff limbs into a curtsey while tears of pleasure steal down her withered cheeks  the old couple sit side by side and the old time seems like yesterday indeed  looking back upon the path they have travelled its dust and ashes disappear the flowers that withered long ago show brightly again upon its borders and they grow young once more in the youth of those about them    conclusion   we have taken for the subjects of the foregoing moral essays twelve samples of married couples carefully selected from a large stock on hand open to the inspection of all comers  these samples are intended for the benefit of the rising generation of both sexes and for their more easy and pleasant information have been separately ticketed and labelled in the manner they have seen  we have purposely excluded from consideration the couple in which the lady reigns paramount and supreme holding such cases to be of a very unnatural kind and like hideous births and other monstrous deformities only to be discreetly and sparingly exhibited  and here our selfimposed task would have ended but that to those young ladies and gentlemen who are yet revolving singly round the church awaiting the advent of that time when the mysterious laws of attraction shall draw them towards it in couples we are desirous of addressing a few last words  before marriage and afterwards let them learn to centre all their hopes of real and lasting happiness in their own fireside let them cherish the faith that in home and all the english virtues which the love of home engenders lies the only true source of domestic felicity let them believe that round the household gods contentment and tranquillity cluster in their gentlest and most graceful forms and that many weary hunters of happiness through the noisy world have learnt this truth too late and found a cheerful spirit and a quiet mind only at home at last  how much may depend on the education of daughters and the conduct of mothers how much of the brightest part of our old national character may be perpetuated by their wisdom or frittered away by their folly—how much of it may have been lost already and how much more in danger of vanishing every day—are questions too weighty for discussion here but well deserving a little serious consideration from all young couples nevertheless  to that one young couple on whose bright destiny the thoughts of nations are fixed may the youth of england look and not in vain for an example  from that one young couple blessed and favoured as they are may they learn that even the glare and glitter of a court the splendour of a palace and the pomp and glory of a throne yield in their power of conferring happiness to domestic worth and virtue  from that one young couple may they learn that the crown of a great empire costly and jewelled though it be gives place in the estimation of a queen to the plain gold ring that links her woman’s nature to that of tens of thousands of her humble subjects and guards in her woman’s heart one secret store of tenderness whose proudest boast shall be that it knows no royalty save nature’s own and no pride of birth but being the child of heaven  so shall the highest young couple in the land for once hear the truth when men throw up their caps and cry with loving shouts—                                 god bless them     the mudfog and other sketches   public life of mr tulrumble—once mayor of mudfog   mudfog is a pleasant town—a remarkably pleasant town—situated in a charming hollow by the side of a river from which river mudfog derives an agreeable scent of pitch tar coals and ropeyarn a roving population in oilskin hats a pretty steady influx of drunken bargemen and a great many other maritime advantages  there is a good deal of water about mudfog and yet it is not exactly the sort of town for a wateringplace either  water is a perverse sort of element at the best of times and in mudfog it is particularly so  in winter it comes oozing down the streets and tumbling over the fields—nay rushes into the very cellars and kitchens of the houses with a lavish prodigality that might well be dispensed with but in the hot summer weather it will dry up and turn green and although green is a very good colour in its way especially in grass still it certainly is not becoming to water and it cannot be denied that the beauty of mudfog is rather impaired even by this trifling circumstance  mudfog is a healthy place—very healthy—damp perhaps but none the worse for that  it’s quite a mistake to suppose that damp is unwholesome plants thrive best in damp situations and why shouldn’t men  the inhabitants of mudfog are unanimous in asserting that there exists not a finer race of people on the face of the earth here we have an indisputable and veracious contradiction of the vulgar error at once  so admitting mudfog to be damp we distinctly state that it is salubrious  the town of mudfog is extremely picturesque  limehouse and ratcliff highway are both something like it but they give you a very faint idea of mudfog  there are a great many more publichouses in mudfog—more than in ratcliff highway and limehouse put together  the public buildings too are very imposing  we consider the townhall one of the finest specimens of shed architecture extant it is a combination of the pigsty and teagardenbox orders and the simplicity of its design is of surpassing beauty  the idea of placing a large window on one side of the door and a small one on the other is particularly happy  there is a fine old doric beauty too about the padlock and scraper which is strictly in keeping with the general effect  in this room do the mayor and corporation of mudfog assemble together in solemn council for the public weal  seated on the massive wooden benches which with the table in the centre form the only furniture of the whitewashed apartment the sage men of mudfog spend hour after hour in grave deliberation  here they settle at what hour of the night the publichouses shall be closed at what hour of the morning they shall be permitted to open how soon it shall be lawful for people to eat their dinner on churchdays and other great political questions and sometimes long after silence has fallen on the town and the distant lights from the shops and houses have ceased to twinkle like faroff stars to the sight of the boatmen on the river the illumination in the two unequalsized windows of the townhall warns the inhabitants of mudfog that its little body of legislators like a larger and betterknown body of the same genus a great deal more noisy and not a whit more profound are patriotically dozing away in company far into the night for their country’s good  among this knot of sage and learned men no one was so eminently distinguished during many years for the quiet modesty of his appearance and demeanour as nicholas tulrumble the wellknown coaldealer however exciting the subject of discussion however animated the tone of the debate or however warm the personalities exchanged and even in mudfog we get personal sometimes nicholas tulrumble was always the same  to say truth nicholas being an industrious man and always up betimes was apt to fall asleep when a debate began and to remain asleep till it was over when he would wake up very much refreshed and give his vote with the greatest complacency  the fact was that nicholas tulrumble knowing that everybody there had made up his mind beforehand considered the talking as just a long botheration about nothing at all and to the present hour it remains a question whether on this point at all events nicholas tulrumble was not pretty near right  time which strews a man’s head with silver sometimes fills his pockets with gold  as he gradually performed one good office for nicholas tulrumble he was obliging enough not to omit the other  nicholas began life in a wooden tenement of four feet square with a capital of two and ninepence and a stock in trade of three bushels and ahalf of coals exclusive of the large lump which hung by way of signboard outside then he enlarged the shed and kept a truck then he left the shed and the truck too and started a donkey and a mrs tulrumble then he moved again and set up a cart the cart was soon afterwards exchanged for a waggon and so he went on like his great predecessor whittington—only without a cat for a partner—increasing in wealth and fame until at last he gave up business altogether and retired with mrs tulrumble and family to mudfog hall which he had himself erected on something which he attempted to delude himself into the belief was a hill about a quarter of a mile distant from the town of mudfog  about this time it began to be murmured in mudfog that nicholas tulrumble was growing vain and haughty that prosperity and success had corrupted the simplicity of his manners and tainted the natural goodness of his heart in short that he was setting up for a public character and a great gentleman and affected to look down upon his old companions with compassion and contempt  whether these reports were at the time wellfounded or not certain it is that mrs tulrumble very shortly afterwards started a fourwheel chaise driven by a tall postilion in a yellow cap—that mr tulrumble junior took to smoking cigars and calling the footman a ‘feller’—and that mr tulrumble from that time forth was no more seen in his old seat in the chimneycorner of the lighterman’s arms at night  this looked bad but more than this it began to be observed that mr nicholas tulrumble attended the corporation meetings more frequently than heretofore and he no longer went to sleep as he had done for so many years but propped his eyelids open with his two forefingers that he read the newspapers by himself at home and that he was in the habit of indulging abroad in distant and mysterious allusions to ‘masses of people’ and ‘the property of the country’ and ‘productive power’ and ‘the monied interest’ all of which denoted and proved that nicholas tulrumble was either mad or worse and it puzzled the good people of mudfog amazingly  at length about the middle of the month of october mr tulrumble and family went up to london the middle of october being as mrs tulrumble informed her acquaintance in mudfog the very height of the fashionable season  somehow or other just about this time despite the healthpreserving air of mudfog the mayor died  it was a most extraordinary circumstance he had lived in mudfog for eightyfive years  the corporation didn’t understand it at all indeed it was with great difficulty that one old gentleman who was a great stickler for forms was dissuaded from proposing a vote of censure on such unaccountable conduct  strange as it was however die he did without taking the slightest notice of the corporation and the corporation were imperatively called upon to elect his successor  so they met for the purpose and being very full of nicholas tulrumble just then and nicholas tulrumble being a very important man they elected him and wrote off to london by the very next post to acquaint nicholas tulrumble with his new elevation  now it being november time and mr nicholas tulrumble being in the capital it fell out that he was present at the lord mayor’s show and dinner at sight of the glory and splendour whereof he mr tulrumble was greatly mortified inasmuch as the reflection would force itself on his mind that had he been born in london instead of in mudfog he might have been a lord mayor too and have patronized the judges and been affable to the lord chancellor and friendly with the premier and coldly condescending to the secretary to the treasury and have dined with a flag behind his back and done a great many other acts and deeds which unto lord mayors of london peculiarly appertain  the more he thought of the lord mayor the more enviable a personage he seemed  to be a king was all very well but what was the king to the lord mayor  when the king made a speech everybody knew it was somebody else’s writing whereas here was the lord mayor talking away for half an hourall out of his own head—amidst the enthusiastic applause of the whole company while it was notorious that the king might talk to his parliament till he was black in the face without getting so much as a single cheer  as all these reflections passed through the mind of mr nicholas tulrumble the lord mayor of london appeared to him the greatest sovereign on the face of the earth beating the emperor of russia all to nothing and leaving the great mogul immeasurably behind  mr nicholas tulrumble was pondering over these things and inwardly cursing the fate which had pitched his coalshed in mudfog when the letter of the corporation was put into his hand  a crimson flush mantled over his face as he read it for visions of brightness were already dancing before his imagination  ‘my dear’ said mr tulrumble to his wife ‘they have elected me mayor of mudfog’  ‘loramussy’ said mrs tulrumble ‘why what’s become of old sniggs’  ‘the late mr sniggs mrs tulrumble’ said mr tulrumble sharply for he by no means approved of the notion of unceremoniously designating a gentleman who filled the high office of mayor as ‘old sniggs’—‘the late mr sniggs mrs tulrumble is dead’  the communication was very unexpected but mrs tulrumble only ejaculated ‘loramussy’ once again as if a mayor were a mere ordinary christian at which mr tulrumble frowned gloomily  ‘what a pity ’tan’t in london ain’t it’ said mrs tulrumble after a short pause ‘what a pity ’tan’t in london where you might have had a show’  ‘i might have a show in mudfog if i thought proper i apprehend’ said mr tulrumble mysteriously  ‘lor so you might i declare’ replied mrs tulrumble  ‘and a good one too’ said mr tulrumble  ‘delightful’ exclaimed mrs tulrumble  ‘one which would rather astonish the ignorant people down there’ said mr tulrumble  ‘it would kill them with envy’ said mrs tulrumble  so it was agreed that his majesty’s lieges in mudfog should be astonished with splendour and slaughtered with envy and that such a show should take place as had never been seen in that town or in any other town before—no not even in london itself  on the very next day after the receipt of the letter down came the tall postilion in a postchaise—not upon one of the horses but inside—actually inside the chaise—and driving up to the very door of the townhall where the corporation were assembled delivered a letter written by the lord knows who and signed by nicholas tulrumble in which nicholas said all through four sides of closelywritten giltedged hotpressed bath post letter paper that he responded to the call of his fellowtownsmen with feelings of heartfelt delight that he accepted the arduous office which their confidence had imposed upon him that they would never find him shrinking from the discharge of his duty that he would endeavour to execute his functions with all that dignity which their magnitude and importance demanded and a great deal more to the same effect  but even this was not all  the tall postilion produced from his righthand topboot a damp copy of that afternoon’s number of the county paper and there in large type running the whole length of the very first column was a long address from nicholas tulrumble to the inhabitants of mudfog in which he said that he cheerfully complied with their requisition and in short as if to prevent any mistake about the matter told them over again what a grand fellow he meant to be in very much the same terms as those in which he had already told them all about the matter in his letter  the corporation stared at one another very hard at all this and then looked as if for explanation to the tall postilion but as the tall postilion was intently contemplating the gold tassel on the top of his yellow cap and could have afforded no explanation whatever even if his thoughts had been entirely disengaged they contented themselves with coughing very dubiously and looking very grave  the tall postilion then delivered another letter in which nicholas tulrumble informed the corporation that he intended repairing to the townhall in grand state and gorgeous procession on the monday afternoon next ensuing  at this the corporation looked still more solemn but as the epistle wound up with a formal invitation to the whole body to dine with the mayor on that day at mudfog hall mudfog hill mudfog they began to see the fun of the thing directly and sent back their compliments and they’d be sure to come  now there happened to be in mudfog as somehow or other there does happen to be in almost every town in the british dominions and perhaps in foreign dominions too—we think it very likely but being no great traveller cannot distinctly say—there happened to be in mudfog a merrytempered pleasantfaced goodfornothing sort of vagabond with an invincible dislike to manual labour and an unconquerable attachment to strong beer and spirits whom everybody knew and nobody except his wife took the trouble to quarrel with who inherited from his ancestors the appellation of edward twigger and rejoiced in the sobriquet of bottlenosed ned  he was drunk upon the average once a day and penitent upon an equally fair calculation once a month and when he was penitent he was invariably in the very last stage of maudlin intoxication  he was a ragged roving roaring kind of fellow with a burly form a sharp wit and a ready head and could turn his hand to anything when he chose to do it  he was by no means opposed to hard labour on principle for he would work away at a cricketmatch by the day together—running and catching and batting and bowling and revelling in toil which would exhaust a galleyslave  he would have been invaluable to a fireoffice never was a man with such a natural taste for pumping engines running up ladders and throwing furniture out of twopairofstairs’ windows nor was this the only element in which he was at home he was a humane society in himself a portable drag an animated lifepreserver and had saved more people in his time from drowning than the plymouth lifeboat or captain manby’s apparatus  with all these qualifications notwithstanding his dissipation bottlenosed ned was a general favourite and the authorities of mudfog remembering his numerous services to the population allowed him in return to get drunk in his own way without the fear of stocks fine or imprisonment  he had a general licence and he showed his sense of the compliment by making the most of it  we have been thus particular in describing the character and avocations of bottlenosed ned because it enables us to introduce a fact politely without hauling it into the reader’s presence with indecent haste by the head and shoulders and brings us very naturally to relate that on the very same evening on which mr nicholas tulrumble and family returned to mudfog mr tulrumble’s new secretary just imported from london with a pale face and light whiskers thrust his head down to the very bottom of his neckclothtie in at the taproom door of the lighterman’s arms and inquiring whether one ned twigger was luxuriating within announced himself as the bearer of a message from nicholas tulrumble esquire requiring mr twigger’s immediate attendance at the hall on private and particular business  it being by no means mr twigger’s interest to affront the mayor he rose from the fireplace with a slight sigh and followed the lightwhiskered secretary through the dirt and wet of mudfog streets up to mudfog hall without further ado  mr nicholas tulrumble was seated in a small cavern with a skylight which he called his library sketching out a plan of the procession on a large sheet of paper and into the cavern the secretary ushered ned twigger  ‘well twigger’ said nicholas tulrumble condescendingly  there was a time when twigger would have replied ‘well nick’ but that was in the days of the truck and a couple of years before the donkey so he only bowed  ‘i want you to go into training twigger’ said mr tulrumble  ‘what for sir’ inquired ned with a stare  ‘hush hush twigger’ said the mayor  ‘shut the door mr jennings look here twigger’  as the mayor said this he unlocked a high closet and disclosed a complete suit of brass armour of gigantic dimensions  ‘i want you to wear this next monday twigger’ said the mayor  ‘bless your heart and soul sir’ replied ned ‘you might as well ask me to wear a seventyfour pounder or a castiron boiler’  ‘nonsense twigger nonsense’ said the mayor  ‘i couldn’t stand under it sir’ said twigger ‘it would make mashed potatoes of me if i attempted it’  ‘pooh pooh twigger’ returned the mayor  ‘i tell you i have seen it done with my own eyes in london and the man wasn’t half such a man as you are either’  ‘i should as soon have thought of a man’s wearing the case of an eightday clock to save his linen’ said twigger casting a look of apprehension at the brass suit  ‘it’s the easiest thing in the world’ rejoined the mayor  ‘it’s nothing’ said mr jennings  ‘when you’re used to it’ added ned  ‘you do it by degrees’ said the mayor  ‘you would begin with one piece tomorrow and two the next day and so on till you had got it all on mr jennings give twigger a glass of rum  just try the breastplate twigger  stay take another glass of rum first  help me to lift it mr jennings  stand firm twigger  there—it isn’t half as heavy as it looks is it’  twigger was a good strong stout fellow so after a great deal of staggering he managed to keep himself up under the breastplate and even contrived with the aid of another glass of rum to walk about in it and the gauntlets into the bargain  he made a trial of the helmet but was not equally successful inasmuch as he tipped over instantly—an accident which mr tulrumble clearly demonstrated to be occasioned by his not having a counteracting weight of brass on his legs  ‘now wear that with grace and propriety on monday next’ said tulrumble ‘and i’ll make your fortune’  ‘i’ll try what i can do sir’ said twigger  ‘it must be kept a profound secret’ said tulrumble  ‘of course sir’ replied twigger  ‘and you must be sober’ said tulrumble ‘perfectly sober’  mr twigger at once solemnly pledged himself to be as sober as a judge and nicholas tulrumble was satisfied although had we been nicholas we should certainly have exacted some promise of a more specific nature inasmuch as having attended the mudfog assizes in the evening more than once we can solemnly testify to having seen judges with very strong symptoms of dinner under their wigs  however that’s neither here nor there  the next day and the day following and the day after that ned twigger was securely locked up in the small cavern with the skylight hard at work at the armour  with every additional piece he could manage to stand upright in he had an additional glass of rum and at last after many partial suffocations he contrived to get on the whole suit and to stagger up and down the room in it like an intoxicated effigy from westminster abbey  never was man so delighted as nicholas tulrumble never was woman so charmed as nicholas tulrumble’s wife  here was a sight for the common people of mudfog  a live man in brass armour  why they would go wild with wonder  the day—the monday—arrived  if the morning had been made to order it couldn’t have been better adapted to the purpose  they never showed a better fog in london on lord mayor’s day than enwrapped the town of mudfog on that eventful occasion it had risen slowly and surely from the green and stagnant water with the first light of morning until it reached a little above the lamppost tops and there it had stopped with a sleepy sluggish obstinacy which bade defiance to the sun who had got up very bloodshot about the eyes as if he had been at a drinkingparty overnight and was doing his day’s work with the worst possible grace  the thick damp mist hung over the town like a huge gauze curtain  all was dim and dismal  the church steeples had bidden a temporary adieu to the world below and every object of lesser importance—houses barns hedges trees and barges—had all taken the veil  the churchclock struck one  a cracked trumpet from the front garden of mudfog hall produced a feeble flourish as if some asthmatic person had coughed into it accidentally the gate flew open and out came a gentleman on a moistsugar coloured charger intended to represent a herald but bearing a much stronger resemblance to a courtcard on horseback  this was one of the circus people who always came down to mudfog at that time of the year and who had been engaged by nicholas tulrumble expressly for the occasion  there was the horse whisking his tail about balancing himself on his hindlegs and flourishing away with his forefeet in a manner which would have gone to the hearts and souls of any reasonable crowd  but a mudfog crowd never was a reasonable one and in all probability never will be  instead of scattering the very fog with their shouts as they ought most indubitably to have done and were fully intended to do by nicholas tulrumble they no sooner recognized the herald than they began to growl forth the most unqualified disapprobation at the bare notion of his riding like any other man  if he had come out on his head indeed or jumping through a hoop or flying through a redhot drum or even standing on one leg with his other foot in his mouth they might have had something to say to him but for a professional gentleman to sit astride in the saddle with his feet in the stirrups was rather too good a joke  so the herald was a decided failure and the crowd hooted with great energy as he pranced ingloriously away  on the procession came  we are afraid to say how many supernumeraries there were in striped shirts and black velvet caps to imitate the london watermen or how many base imitations of runningfootmen or how many banners which owing to the heaviness of the atmosphere could by no means be prevailed on to display their inscriptions still less do we feel disposed to relate how the men who played the wind instruments looking up into the sky we mean the fog with musical fervour walked through pools of water and hillocks of mud till they covered the powdered heads of the runningfootmen aforesaid with splashes that looked curious but not ornamental or how the barrelorgan performer put on the wrong stop and played one tune while the band played another or how the horses being used to the arena and not to the streets would stand still and dance instead of going on and prancing—all of which are matters which might be dilated upon to great advantage but which we have not the least intention of dilating upon notwithstanding  oh it was a grand and beautiful sight to behold a corporation in glass coaches provided at the sole cost and charge of nicholas tulrumble coming rolling along like a funeral out of mourning and to watch the attempts the corporation made to look great and solemn when nicholas tulrumble himself in the fourwheel chaise with the tall postilion rolled out after them with mr jennings on one side to look like a chaplain and a supernumerary on the other with an old lifeguardsman’s sabre to imitate the swordbearer and to see the tears rolling down the faces of the mob as they screamed with merriment  this was beautiful and so was the appearance of mrs tulrumble and son as they bowed with grave dignity out of their coachwindow to all the dirty faces that were laughing around them but it is not even with this that we have to do but with the sudden stopping of the procession at another blast of the trumpet whereat and whereupon a profound silence ensued and all eyes were turned towards mudfog hall in the confident anticipation of some new wonder  ‘they won’t laugh now mr jennings’ said nicholas tulrumble  ‘i think not sir’ said mr jennings  ‘see how eager they look’ said nicholas tulrumble  ‘aha the laugh will be on our side now eh mr jennings’  ‘no doubt of that sir’ replied mr jennings and nicholas tulrumble in a state of pleasurable excitement stood up in the fourwheel chaise and telegraphed gratification to the mayoress behind  while all this was going forward ned twigger had descended into the kitchen of mudfog hall for the purpose of indulging the servants with a private view of the curiosity that was to burst upon the town and somehow or other the footman was so companionable and the housemaid so kind and the cook so friendly that he could not resist the offer of the firstmentioned to sit down and take something—just to drink success to master in  so down ned twigger sat himself in his brass livery on the top of the kitchentable and in a mug of something strong paid for by the unconscious nicholas tulrumble and provided by the companionable footman drank success to the mayor and his procession and as ned laid by his helmet to imbibe the something strong the companionable footman put it on his own head to the immeasurable and unrecordable delight of the cook and housemaid  the companionable footman was very facetious to ned and ned was very gallant to the cook and housemaid by turns  they were all very cosy and comfortable and the something strong went briskly round  at last ned twigger was loudly called for by the procession people and having had his helmet fixed on in a very complicated manner by the companionable footman and the kind housemaid and the friendly cook he walked gravely forth and appeared before the multitude  the crowd roared—it was not with wonder it was not with surprise it was most decidedly and unquestionably with laughter  ‘what’ said mr tulrumble starting up in the fourwheel chaise ‘laughing  if they laugh at a man in real brass armour they’d laugh when their own fathers were dying  why doesn’t he go into his place mr jennings  what’s he rolling down towards us for he has no business here’  ‘i am afraid sir—’ faltered mr jennings  ‘afraid of what sir’ said nicholas tulrumble looking up into the secretary’s face  ‘i am afraid he’s drunk sir’ replied mr jennings  nicholas tulrumble took one look at the extraordinary figure that was bearing down upon them and then clasping his secretary by the arm uttered an audible groan in anguish of spirit  it is a melancholy fact that mr twigger having full licence to demand a single glass of rum on the putting on of every piece of the armour got by some means or other rather out of his calculation in the hurry and confusion of preparation and drank about four glasses to a piece instead of one not to mention the something strong which went on the top of it whether the brass armour checked the natural flow of perspiration and thus prevented the spirit from evaporating we are not scientific enough to know but whatever the cause was mr twigger no sooner found himself outside the gate of mudfog hall than he also found himself in a very considerable state of intoxication and hence his extraordinary style of progressing  this was bad enough but as if fate and fortune had conspired against nicholas tulrumble mr twigger not having been penitent for a good calendar month took it into his head to be most especially and particularly sentimental just when his repentance could have been most conveniently dispensed with  immense tears were rolling down his cheeks and he was vainly endeavouring to conceal his grief by applying to his eyes a blue cotton pockethandkerchief with white spots—an article not strictly in keeping with a suit of armour some three hundred years old or thereabouts  ‘twigger you villain’ said nicholas tulrumble quite forgetting his dignity ‘go back’  ‘never’ said ned  ‘i’m a miserable wretch  i’ll never leave you’  the bystanders of course received this declaration with acclamations of ‘that’s right ned don’t’  ‘i don’t intend it’ said ned with all the obstinacy of a very tipsy man  ‘i’m very unhappy  i’m the wretched father of an unfortunate family but i am very faithful sir  i’ll never leave you’  having reiterated this obliging promise ned proceeded in broken words to harangue the crowd upon the number of years he had lived in mudfog the excessive respectability of his character and other topics of the like nature  ‘here will anybody lead him away’ said nicholas ‘if they’ll call on me afterwards i’ll reward them well’  two or three men stepped forward with the view of bearing ned off when the secretary interposed  ‘take care take care’ said mr jennings  ‘i beg your pardon sir but they’d better not go too near him because if he falls over he’ll certainly crush somebody’  at this hint the crowd retired on all sides to a very respectful distance and left ned like the duke of devonshire in a little circle of his own  ‘but mr jennings’ said nicholas tulrumble ‘he’ll be suffocated’  ‘i’m very sorry for it sir’ replied mr jennings ‘but nobody can get that armour off without his own assistance  i’m quite certain of it from the way he put it on’  here ned wept dolefully and shook his helmeted head in a manner that might have touched a heart of stone but the crowd had not hearts of stone and they laughed heartily  ‘dear me mr jennings’ said nicholas turning pale at the possibility of ned’s being smothered in his antique costume—‘dear me mr jennings can nothing be done with him’  ‘nothing at all’ replied ned ‘nothing at all  gentlemen i’m an unhappy wretch  i’m a body gentlemen in a brass coffin’  at this poetical idea of his own conjuring up ned cried so much that the people began to get sympathetic and to ask what nicholas tulrumble meant by putting a man into such a machine as that and one individual in a hairy waistcoat like the top of a trunk who had previously expressed his opinion that if ned hadn’t been a poor man nicholas wouldn’t have dared do it hinted at the propriety of breaking the fourwheel chaise or nicholas’s head or both which last compound proposition the crowd seemed to consider a very good notion  it was not acted upon however for it had hardly been broached when ned twigger’s wife made her appearance abruptly in the little circle before noticed and ned no sooner caught a glimpse of her face and form than from the mere force of habit he set off towards his home just as fast as his legs could carry him and that was not very quick in the present instance either for however ready they might have been to carry him they couldn’t get on very well under the brass armour  so mrs twigger had plenty of time to denounce nicholas tulrumble to his face to express her opinion that he was a decided monster and to intimate that if her illused husband sustained any personal damage from the brass armour she would have the law of nicholas tulrumble for manslaughter  when she had said all this with due vehemence she posted after ned who was dragging himself along as best he could and deploring his unhappiness in most dismal tones  what a wailing and screaming ned’s children raised when he got home at last  mrs twigger tried to undo the armour first in one place and then in another but she couldn’t manage it so she tumbled ned into bed helmet armour gauntlets and all  such a creaking as the bedstead made under ned’s weight in his new suit  it didn’t break down though and there ned lay like the anonymous vessel in the bay of biscay till next day drinking barleywater and looking miserable and every time he groaned his good lady said it served him right which was all the consolation ned twigger got  nicholas tulrumble and the gorgeous procession went on together to the townhall amid the hisses and groans of all the spectators who had suddenly taken it into their heads to consider poor ned a martyr nicholas was formally installed in his new office in acknowledgment of which ceremony he delivered himself of a speech composed by the secretary which was very long and no doubt very good only the noise of the people outside prevented anybody from hearing it but nicholas tulrumble himself  after which the procession got back to mudfog hall any how it could and nicholas and the corporation sat down to dinner  but the dinner was flat and nicholas was disappointed  they were such dull sleepy old fellows that corporation  nicholas made quite as long speeches as the lord mayor of london had done nay he said the very same things that the lord mayor of london had said and the deuce a cheer the corporation gave him  there was only one man in the party who was thoroughly awake and he was insolent and called him nick  nick  what would be the consequence thought nicholas of anybody presuming to call the lord mayor of london ‘nick’  he should like to know what the swordbearer would say to that or the recorder or the toastmaster or any other of the great officers of the city  they’d nick him  but these were not the worst of nicholas tulrumble’s doings  if they had been he might have remained a mayor to this day and have talked till he lost his voice  he contracted a relish for statistics and got philosophical and the statistics and the philosophy together led him into an act which increased his unpopularity and hastened his downfall  at the very end of the mudfog highstreet and abutting on the riverside stands the jolly boatmen an oldfashioned lowroofed baywindowed house with a bar kitchen and taproom all in one and a large fireplace with a kettle to correspond round which the working men have congregated time out of mind on a winter’s night refreshed by draughts of good strong beer and cheered by the sounds of a fiddle and tambourine the jolly boatmen having been duly licensed by the mayor and corporation to scrape the fiddle and thumb the tambourine from time whereof the memory of the oldest inhabitants goeth not to the contrary now nicholas tulrumble had been reading pamphlets on crime and parliamentary reports—or had made the secretary read them to him which is the same thing in effect—and he at once perceived that this fiddle and tambourine must have done more to demoralize mudfog than any other operating causes that ingenuity could imagine  so he read up for the subject and determined to come out on the corporation with a burst the very next time the licence was applied for  the licensing day came and the redfaced landlord of the jolly boatmen walked into the townhall looking as jolly as need be having actually put on an extra fiddle for that night to commemorate the anniversary of the jolly boatmen’s music licence  it was applied for in due form and was just about to be granted as a matter of course when up rose nicholas tulrumble and drowned the astonished corporation in a torrent of eloquence  he descanted in glowing terms upon the increasing depravity of his native town of mudfog and the excesses committed by its population  then he related how shocked he had been to see barrels of beer sliding down into the cellar of the jolly boatmen week after week and how he had sat at a window opposite the jolly boatmen for two days together to count the people who went in for beer between the hours of twelve and one o’clock alone—which bythebye was the time at which the great majority of the mudfog people dined  then he went on to state how the number of people who came out with beerjugs averaged twentyone in five minutes which being multiplied by twelve gave two hundred and fiftytwo people with beerjugs in an hour and multiplied again by fifteen the number of hours during which the house was open daily yielded three thousand seven hundred and eighty people with beerjugs per day or twentysix thousand four hundred and sixty people with beerjugs per week  then he proceeded to show that a tambourine and moral degradation were synonymous terms and a fiddle and vicious propensities wholly inseparable  all these arguments he strengthened and demonstrated by frequent references to a large book with a blue cover and sundry quotations from the middlesex magistrates and in the end the corporation who were posed with the figures and sleepy with the speech and sadly in want of dinner into the bargain yielded the palm to nicholas tulrumble and refused the music licence to the jolly boatmen  but although nicholas triumphed his triumph was short  he carried on the war against beerjugs and fiddles forgetting the time when he was glad to drink out of the one and to dance to the other till the people hated and his old friends shunned him  he grew tired of the lonely magnificence of mudfog hall and his heart yearned towards the lighterman’s arms  he wished he had never set up as a public man and sighed for the good old times of the coalshop and the chimney corner  at length old nicholas being thoroughly miserable took heart of grace paid the secretary a quarter’s wages in advance and packed him off to london by the next coach  having taken this step he put his hat on his head and his pride in his pocket and walked down to the old room at the lighterman’s arms  there were only two of the old fellows there and they looked coldly on nicholas as he proffered his hand  ‘are you going to put down pipes mr tulrumble’ said one  ‘or trace the progress of crime to ‘bacca’ growled another  ‘neither’ replied nicholas tulrumble shaking hands with them both whether they would or not  ‘i’ve come down to say that i’m very sorry for having made a fool of myself and that i hope you’ll give me up the old chair again’  the old fellows opened their eyes and three or four more old fellows opened the door to whom nicholas with tears in his eyes thrust out his hand too and told the same story  they raised a shout of joy that made the bells in the ancient churchtower vibrate again and wheeling the old chair into the warm corner thrust old nicholas down into it and ordered in the very largestsized bowl of hot punch with an unlimited number of pipes directly  the next day the jolly boatmen got the licence and the next night old nicholas and ned twigger’s wife led off a dance to the music of the fiddle and tambourine the tone of which seemed mightily improved by a little rest for they never had played so merrily before  ned twigger was in the very height of his glory and he danced hornpipes and balanced chairs on his chin and straws on his nose till the whole company including the corporation were in raptures of admiration at the brilliancy of his acquirements  mr tulrumble junior couldn’t make up his mind to be anything but magnificent so he went up to london and drew bills on his father and when he had overdrawn and got into debt he grew penitent and came home again  as to old nicholas he kept his word and having had six weeks of public life never tried it any more  he went to sleep in the townhall at the very next meeting and in full proof of his sincerity has requested us to write this faithful narrative  we wish it could have the effect of reminding the tulrumbles of another sphere that puffedup conceit is not dignity and that snarling at the little pleasures they were once glad to enjoy because they would rather forget the times when they were of lower station renders them objects of contempt and ridicule  this is the first time we have published any of our gleanings from this particular source  perhaps at some future period we may venture to open the chronicles of mudfog    full report of the first meeting of the mudfog association for the advancement of everything   we have made the most unparalleled and extraordinary exertions to place before our readers a complete and accurate account of the proceedings at the late grand meeting of the mudfog association holden in the town of mudfog it affords us great happiness to lay the result before them in the shape of various communications received from our able talented and graphic correspondent expressly sent down for the purpose who has immortalized us himself mudfog and the association all at one and the same time  we have been indeed for some days unable to determine who will transmit the greatest name to posterity ourselves who sent our correspondent down our correspondent who wrote an account of the matter or the association who gave our correspondent something to write about  we rather incline to the opinion that we are the greatest man of the party inasmuch as the notion of an exclusive and authentic report originated with us this may be prejudice it may arise from a prepossession on our part in our own favour  be it so  we have no doubt that every gentleman concerned in this mighty assemblage is troubled with the same complaint in a greater or less degree and it is a consolation to us to know that we have at least this feeling in common with the great scientific stars the brilliant and extraordinary luminaries whose speculations we record  we give our correspondent’s letters in the order in which they reached us  any attempt at amalgamating them into one beautiful whole would only destroy that glowing tone that dash of wildness and rich vein of picturesque interest which pervade them throughout                                 ‘mudfog monday night seven o’clock  ‘we are in a state of great excitement here  nothing is spoken of but the approaching meeting of the association  the inndoors are thronged with waiters anxiously looking for the expected arrivals and the numerous bills which are wafered up in the windows of private houses intimating that there are beds to let within give the streets a very animated and cheerful appearance the wafers being of a great variety of colours and the monotony of printed inscriptions being relieved by every possible size and style of handwriting  it is confidently rumoured that professors snore doze and wheezy have engaged three beds and a sittingroom at the pig and tinderbox  i give you the rumour as it has reached me but i cannot as yet vouch for its accuracy  the moment i have been enabled to obtain any certain information upon this interesting point you may depend upon receiving it’                                                         ‘halfpast seven  i have just returned from a personal interview with the landlord of the pig and tinderbox  he speaks confidently of the probability of professors snore doze and wheezy taking up their residence at his house during the sitting of the association but denies that the beds have been yet engaged in which representation he is confirmed by the chambermaid—a girl of artless manners and interesting appearance  the boots denies that it is at all likely that professors snore doze and wheezy will put up here but i have reason to believe that this man has been suborned by the proprietor of the original pig which is the opposition hotel amidst such conflicting testimony it is difficult to arrive at the real truth but you may depend upon receiving authentic information upon this point the moment the fact is ascertained  the excitement still continues  a boy fell through the window of the pastrycook’s shop at the corner of the highstreet about half an hour ago which has occasioned much confusion  the general impression is that it was an accident pray heaven it may prove so’                                                         ‘tuesday noon  ‘at an early hour this morning the bells of all the churches struck seven o’clock the effect of which in the present lively state of the town was extremely singular  while i was at breakfast a yellow gig drawn by a dark grey horse with a patch of white over his right eyelid proceeded at a rapid pace in the direction of the original pig stables it is currently reported that this gentleman has arrived here for the purpose of attending the association and from what i have heard i consider it extremely probable although nothing decisive is yet known regarding him you may conceive the anxiety with which we are all looking forward to the arrival of the four o’clock coach this afternoon  ‘notwithstanding the excited state of the populace no outrage has yet been committed owing to the admirable discipline and discretion of the police who are nowhere to be seen  a barrelorgan is playing opposite my window and groups of people offering fish and vegetables for sale parade the streets  with these exceptions everything is quiet and i trust will continue so’                                                            ‘five o’clock  ‘it is now ascertained beyond all doubt that professors snore doze and wheezy will not repair to the pig and tinderbox but have actually engaged apartments at the original pig  this intelligence is exclusive and i leave you and your readers to draw their own inferences from it  why professor wheezy of all people in the world should repair to the original pig in preference to the pig and tinderbox it is not easy to conceive  the professor is a man who should be above all such petty feelings  some people here openly impute treachery and a distinct breach of faith to professors snore and doze while others again are disposed to acquit them of any culpability in the transaction and to insinuate that the blame rests solely with professor wheezy  i own that i incline to the latter opinion and although it gives me great pain to speak in terms of censure or disapprobation of a man of such transcendent genius and acquirements still i am bound to say that if my suspicions be well founded and if all the reports which have reached my ears be true i really do not well know what to make of the matter  ‘mr slug so celebrated for his statistical researches arrived this afternoon by the four o’clock stage  his complexion is a dark purple and he has a habit of sighing constantly  he looked extremely well and appeared in high health and spirits  mr woodensconce also came down in the same conveyance  the distinguished gentleman was fast asleep on his arrival and i am informed by the guard that he had been so the whole way  he was no doubt preparing for his approaching fatigues but what gigantic visions must those be that flit through the brain of such a man when his body is in a state of torpidity  ‘the influx of visitors increases every moment  i am told i know not how truly that two postchaises have arrived at the original pig within the last halfhour and i myself observed a wheelbarrow containing three carpet bags and a bundle entering the yard of the pig and tinderbox no longer ago than five minutes since  the people are still quietly pursuing their ordinary occupations but there is a wildness in their eyes and an unwonted rigidity in the muscles of their countenances which shows to the observant spectator that their expectations are strained to the very utmost pitch  i fear unless some very extraordinary arrivals take place tonight that consequences may arise from this popular ferment which every man of sense and feeling would deplore’                                                 ‘twenty minutes past six  ‘i have just heard that the boy who fell through the pastrycook’s window last night has died of the fright  he was suddenly called upon to pay three and sixpence for the damage done and his constitution it seems was not strong enough to bear up against the shock  the inquest it is said will be held tomorrow’                                               ‘threequarters part seven  ‘professors muff and nogo have just driven up to the hotel door they at once ordered dinner with great condescension  we are all very much delighted with the urbanity of their manners and the ease with which they adapt themselves to the forms and ceremonies of ordinary life immediately on their arrival they sent for the head waiter and privately requested him to purchase a live dog—as cheap a one as he could meet with—and to send him up after dinner with a pieboard a knife and fork and a clean plate  it is conjectured that some experiments will be tried upon the dog tonight if any particulars should transpire i will forward them by express’                                                         ‘halfpast eight  ‘the animal has been procured  he is a pugdog of rather intelligent appearance in good condition and with very short legs  he has been tied to a curtainpeg in a dark room and is howling dreadfully’                                                     ‘ten minutes to nine  ‘the dog has just been rung for  with an instinct which would appear almost the result of reason the sagacious animal seized the waiter by the calf of the leg when he approached to take him and made a desperate though ineffectual resistance  i have not been able to procure admission to the apartment occupied by the scientific gentlemen but judging from the sounds which reached my ears when i stood upon the landingplace outside the door just now i should be disposed to say that the dog had retreated growling beneath some article of furniture and was keeping the professors at bay  this conjecture is confirmed by the testimony of the ostler who after peeping through the keyhole assures me that he distinctly saw professor nogo on his knees holding forth a small bottle of prussic acid to which the animal who was crouched beneath an armchair obstinately declined to smell  you cannot imagine the feverish state of irritation we are in lest the interests of science should be sacrificed to the prejudices of a brute creature who is not endowed with sufficient sense to foresee the incalculable benefits which the whole human race may derive from so very slight a concession on his part’                                                            ‘nine o’clock  ‘the dog’s tail and ears have been sent downstairs to be washed from which circumstance we infer that the animal is no more  his forelegs have been delivered to the boots to be brushed which strengthens the supposition’                                                          ‘half after ten  ‘my feelings are so overpowered by what has taken place in the course of the last hour and a half that i have scarcely strength to detail the rapid succession of events which have quite bewildered all those who are cognizant of their occurrence  it appears that the pugdog mentioned in my last was surreptitiously obtained—stolen in fact—by some person attached to the stable department from an unmarried lady resident in this town  frantic on discovering the loss of her favourite the lady rushed distractedly into the street calling in the most heartrending and pathetic manner upon the passengers to restore her her augustus—for so the deceased was named in affectionate remembrance of a former lover of his mistress to whom he bore a striking personal resemblance which renders the circumstances additionally affecting  i am not yet in a condition to inform you what circumstance induced the bereaved lady to direct her steps to the hotel which had witnessed the last struggles of her protégé  i can only state that she arrived there at the very instant when his detached members were passing through the passage on a small tray  her shrieks still reverberate in my ears  i grieve to say that the expressive features of professor muff were much scratched and lacerated by the injured lady and that professor nogo besides sustaining several severe bites has lost some handfuls of hair from the same cause  it must be some consolation to these gentlemen to know that their ardent attachment to scientific pursuits has alone occasioned these unpleasant consequences for which the sympathy of a grateful country will sufficiently reward them  the unfortunate lady remains at the pig and tinderbox and up to this time is reported in a very precarious state  ‘i need scarcely tell you that this unlookedfor catastrophe has cast a damp and gloom upon us in the midst of our exhilaration natural in any case but greatly enhanced in this by the amiable qualities of the deceased animal who appears to have been much and deservedly respected by the whole of his acquaintance’                                                          ‘twelve o’clock  ‘i take the last opportunity before sealing my parcel to inform you that the boy who fell through the pastrycook’s window is not dead as was universally believed but alive and well  the report appears to have had its origin in his mysterious disappearance  he was found half an hour since on the premises of a sweetstuff maker where a raffle had been announced for a secondhand sealskin cap and a tambourine and where—a sufficient number of members not having been obtained at first—he had patiently waited until the list was completed  this fortunate discovery has in some degree restored our gaiety and cheerfulness  it is proposed to get up a subscription for him without delay  ‘everybody is nervously anxious to see what tomorrow will bring forth if any one should arrive in the course of the night i have left strict directions to be called immediately  i should have sat up indeed but the agitating events of this day have been too much for me  ‘no news yet of either of the professors snore doze or wheezy  it is very strange’                                                     ‘wednesday afternoon  ‘all is now over and upon one point at least i am at length enabled to set the minds of your readers at rest  the three professors arrived at ten minutes after two o’clock and instead of taking up their quarters at the original pig as it was universally understood in the course of yesterday that they would assuredly have done drove straight to the pig and tinderbox where they threw off the mask at once and openly announced their intention of remaining  professor wheezy may reconcile this very extraordinary conduct with his notions of fair and equitable dealing but i would recommend professor wheezy to be cautious how he presumes too far upon his wellearned reputation  how such a man as professor snore or which is still more extraordinary such an individual as professor doze can quietly allow himself to be mixed up with such proceedings as these you will naturally inquire  upon this head rumour is silent i have my speculations but forbear to give utterance to them just now’

highlyrespectable tinker of great practical skill who had forwarded a paper to the president of section d mechanical science on the construction of pipkins with copper bottoms and safetyvalues of which report speaks highly  the incarceration of this gentleman is greatly to be regretted as his absence will preclude any discussion on the subject  ‘the bills are being taken down in all directions and lodgings are being secured on almost any terms  i have heard of fifteen shillings a week for two rooms exclusive of coals and attendance but i can scarcely believe it  the excitement is dreadful  i was informed this morning that the civil authorities apprehensive of some outbreak of popular feeling had commanded a recruiting sergeant and two corporals to be under arms and that with the view of not irritating the people unnecessarily by their presence they had been requested to take up their position before daybreak in a turnpike distant about a quarter of a mile from the town  the vigour and promptness of these measures cannot be too highly extolled  ‘intelligence has just been brought me that an elderly female in a state of inebriety has declared in the open street her intention to “do” for mr slug  some statistical returns compiled by that gentleman relative to the consumption of raw spirituous liquors in this place are supposed to be the cause of the wretch’s animosity  it is added that this declaration was loudly cheered by a crowd of persons who had assembled on the spot and that one man had the boldness to designate mr slug aloud by the opprobrious epithet of “stickinthemud”  it is earnestly to be hoped that now when the moment has arrived for their interference the magistrates will not shrink from the exercise of that power which is vested in them by the constitution of our common country’                                                           ‘halfpast ten  ‘the disturbance i am happy to inform you has been completely quelled and the ringleader taken into custody  she had a pail of cold water thrown over her previous to being locked up and expresses great contrition and uneasiness  we are all in a fever of anticipation about tomorrow but now that we are within a few hours of the meeting of the association and at last enjoy the proud consciousness of having its illustrious members amongst us i trust and hope everything may go off peaceably  i shall send you a full report of tomorrow’s proceedings by the night coach’                                                          ‘eleven o’clock  ‘i open my letter to say that nothing whatever has occurred since i folded it up’                                                                ‘thursday  ‘the sun rose this morning at the usual hour  i did not observe anything particular in the aspect of the glorious planet except that he appeared to me it might have been a delusion of my heightened fancy to shine with more than common brilliancy and to shed a refulgent lustre upon the town such as i had never observed before  this is the more extraordinary as the sky was perfectly cloudless and the atmosphere peculiarly fine  at halfpast nine o’clock the general committee assembled with the last year’s president in the chair  the report of the council was read and one passage which stated that the council had corresponded with no less than three thousand five hundred and seventyone persons all of whom paid their own postage on no fewer than seven thousand two hundred and fortythree topics was received with a degree of enthusiasm which no efforts could suppress  the various committees and sections having been appointed and the more formal business transacted the great proceedings of the meeting commenced at eleven o’clock precisely  i had the happiness of occupying a most eligible position at that time in   ‘section a—zoology and botany great room pig and tinderbox   president—professor snore  vicepresidents—professors doze and wheezy  ‘the scene at this moment was particularly striking  the sun streamed through the windows of the apartments and tinted the whole scene with its brilliant rays bringing out in strong relief the noble visages of the professors and scientific gentlemen who some with bald heads some with red heads some with brown heads some with grey heads some with black heads some with block heads presented a coup d’oeil which no eyewitness will readily forget  in front of these gentlemen were papers and inkstands and round the room on elevated benches extending as far as the forms could reach were assembled a brilliant concourse of those lovely and elegant women for which mudfog is justly acknowledged to be without a rival in the whole world  the contrast between their fair faces and the dark coats and trousers of the scientific gentlemen i shall never cease to remember while memory holds her seat  ‘time having been allowed for a slight confusion occasioned by the falling down of the greater part of the platforms to subside the president called on one of the secretaries to read a communication entitled “some remarks on the industrious fleas with considerations on the importance of establishing infantschools among that numerous class of society of directing their industry to useful and practical ends and of applying the surplus fruits thereof towards providing for them a comfortable and respectable maintenance in their old age”  ‘the author stated that having long turned his attention to the moral and social condition of these interesting animals he had been induced to visit an exhibition in regentstreet london commonly known by the designation of “the industrious fleas”  he had there seen many fleas occupied certainly in various pursuits and avocations but occupied he was bound to add in a manner which no man of wellregulated mind could fail to regard with sorrow and regret  one flea reduced to the level of a beast of burden was drawing about a miniature gig containing a particularly small effigy of his grace the duke of wellington while another was staggering beneath the weight of a golden model of his great adversary napoleon bonaparte  some brought up as mountebanks and balletdancers were performing a figuredance he regretted to observe that of the fleas so employed several were females others were in training in a small cardboard box for pedestrians—mere sporting characters—and two were actually engaged in the coldblooded and barbarous occupation of duelling a pursuit from which humanity recoiled with horror and disgust  he suggested that measures should be immediately taken to employ the labour of these fleas as part and parcel of the productive power of the country which might easily be done by the establishment among them of infant schools and houses of industry in which a system of virtuous education based upon sound principles should be observed and moral precepts strictly inculcated  he proposed that every flea who presumed to exhibit for hire music or dancing or any species of theatrical entertainment without a licence should be considered a vagabond and treated accordingly in which respect he only placed him upon a level with the rest of mankind  he would further suggest that their labour should be placed under the control and regulation of the state who should set apart from the profits a fund for the support of superannuated or disabled fleas their widows and orphans  with this view he proposed that liberal premiums should be offered for the three best designs for a general almshouse from which—as insect architecture was well known to be in a very advanced and perfect state—we might possibly derive many valuable hints for the improvement of our metropolitan universities national galleries and other public edifices  ‘the president wished to be informed how the ingenious gentleman proposed to open a communication with fleas generally in the first instance so that they might be thoroughly imbued with a sense of the advantages they must necessarily derive from changing their mode of life and applying themselves to honest labour  this appeared to him the only difficulty  ‘the author submitted that this difficulty was easily overcome or rather that there was no difficulty at all in the case  obviously the course to be pursued if her majesty’s government could be prevailed upon to take up the plan would be to secure at a remunerative salary the individual to whom he had alluded as presiding over the exhibition in regentstreet at the period of his visit  that gentleman would at once be able to put himself in communication with the mass of the fleas and to instruct them in pursuance of some general plan of education to be sanctioned by parliament until such time as the more intelligent among them were advanced enough to officiate as teachers to the rest  ‘the president and several members of the section highly complimented the author of the paper last read on his most ingenious and important treatise  it was determined that the subject should be recommended to the immediate consideration of the council  ‘mr wigsby produced a cauliflower somewhat larger than a chaiseumbrella which had been raised by no other artificial means than the simple application of highly carbonated sodawater as manure  he explained that by scooping out the head which would afford a new and delicious species of nourishment for the poor a parachute in principle something similar to that constructed by m garnerin was at once obtained the stalk of course being kept downwards  he added that he was perfectly willing to make a descent from a height of not less than three miles and a quarter and had in fact already proposed the same to the proprietors of vauxhall gardens who in the handsomest manner at once consented to his wishes and appointed an early day next summer for the undertaking merely stipulating that the rim of the cauliflower should be previously broken in three or four places to ensure the safety of the descent  ‘the president congratulated the public on the grand gala in store for them and warmly eulogised the proprietors of the establishment alluded to for their love of science and regard for the safety of human life both of which did them the highest honour  ‘a member wished to know how many thousand additional lamps the royal property would be illuminated with on the night after the descent  ‘mr wigsby replied that the point was not yet finally decided but he believed it was proposed over and above the ordinary illuminations to exhibit in various devices eight millions and ahalf of additional lamps  ‘the member expressed himself much gratified with this announcement  ‘mr blunderum delighted the section with a most interesting and valuable paper “on the last moments of the learned pig” which produced a very strong impression on the assembly the account being compiled from the personal recollections of his favourite attendant  the account stated in the most emphatic terms that the animal’s name was not toby but solomon and distinctly proved that he could have no near relatives in the profession as many designing persons had falsely stated inasmuch as his father mother brothers and sisters had all fallen victims to the butcher at different times  an uncle of his indeed had with very great labour been traced to a sty in somers town but as he was in a very infirm state at the time being afflicted with measles and shortly afterwards disappeared there appeared too much reason to conjecture that he had been converted into sausages  the disorder of the learned pig was originally a severe cold which being aggravated by excessive trough indulgence finally settled upon the lungs and terminated in a general decay of the constitution  a melancholy instance of a presentiment entertained by the animal of his approaching dissolution was recorded after gratifying a numerous and fashionable company with his performances in which no falling off whatever was visible he fixed his eyes on the biographer and turning to the watch which lay on the floor and on which he was accustomed to point out the hour deliberately passed his snout twice round the dial  in precisely fourandtwenty hours from that time he had ceased to exist  ‘professor wheezy inquired whether previous to his demise the animal had expressed by signs or otherwise any wishes regarding the disposal of his little property  ‘mr blunderum replied that when the biographer took up the pack of cards at the conclusion of the performance the animal grunted several times in a significant manner and nodding his head as he was accustomed to do when gratified  from these gestures it was understood that he wished the attendant to keep the cards which he had ever since done  he had not expressed any wish relative to his watch which had accordingly been pawned by the same individual  ‘the president wished to know whether any member of the section had ever seen or conversed with the pigfaced lady who was reported to have worn a black velvet mask and to have taken her meals from a golden trough  ‘after some hesitation a member replied that the pigfaced lady was his motherinlaw and that he trusted the president would not violate the sanctity of private life  ‘the president begged pardon  he had considered the pigfaced lady a public character  would the honourable member object to state with a view to the advancement of science whether she was in any way connected with the learned pig  ‘the member replied in the same low tone that as the question appeared to involve a suspicion that the learned pig might be his halfbrother he must decline answering it   ‘section b—anatomy and medicine coachhouse pig and tinderbox   president—dr toorell  vicepresidents—professors muff and nogo  dr kutankumagen of moscow read to the section a report of a case which had occurred within his own practice strikingly illustrative of the power of medicine as exemplified in his successful treatment of a virulent disorder  he had been called in to visit the patient on the 1st of april 1837  he was then labouring under symptoms peculiarly alarming to any medical man  his frame was stout and muscular his step firm and elastic his cheeks plump and red his voice loud his appetite good his pulse full and round  he was in the constant habit of eating three meals per diem and of drinking at least one bottle of wine and one glass of spirituous liquors diluted with water in the course of the fourandtwenty hours  he laughed constantly and in so hearty a manner that it was terrible to hear him  by dint of powerful medicine low diet and bleeding the symptoms in the course of three days perceptibly decreased  a rigid perseverance in the same course of treatment for only one week accompanied with small doses of watergruel weak broth and barleywater led to their entire disappearance  in the course of a month he was sufficiently recovered to be carried downstairs by two nurses and to enjoy an airing in a close carriage supported by soft pillows  at the present moment he was restored so far as to walk about with the slight assistance of a crutch and a boy  it would perhaps be gratifying to the section to learn that he ate little drank little slept little and was never heard to laugh by any accident whatever  ‘dr w r fee in complimenting the honourable member upon the triumphant cure he had effected begged to ask whether the patient still bled freely  ‘dr kutankumagen replied in the affirmative  ‘dr w r fee—and you found that he bled freely during the whole course of the disorder  ‘dr kutankumagen—oh dear yes most freely  ‘dr neeshawts supposed that if the patient had not submitted to be bled with great readiness and perseverance so extraordinary a cure could never in fact have been accomplished  dr kutankumagen rejoined certainly not  ‘mr knight bell mrcs exhibited a wax preparation of the interior of a gentleman who in early life had inadvertently swallowed a doorkey it was a curious fact that a medical student of dissipated habits being present at the post mortem examination found means to escape unobserved from the room with that portion of the coats of the stomach upon which an exact model of the instrument was distinctly impressed with which he hastened to a locksmith of doubtful character who made a new key from the pattern so shown to him  with this key the medical student entered the house of the deceased gentleman and committed a burglary to a large amount for which he was subsequently tried and executed  ‘the president wished to know what became of the original key after the lapse of years  mr knight bell replied that the gentleman was always much accustomed to punch and it was supposed the acid had gradually devoured it  ‘dr neeshawts and several of the members were of opinion that the key must have lain very cold and heavy upon the gentleman’s stomach  ‘mr knight bell believed it did at first  it was worthy of remark perhaps that for some years the gentleman was troubled with a nightmare under the influence of which he always imagined himself a winecellar door  ‘professor muff related a very extraordinary and convincing proof of the wonderful efficacy of the system of infinitesimal doses which the section were doubtless aware was based upon the theory that the very minutest amount of any given drug properly dispersed through the human frame would be productive of precisely the same result as a very large dose administered in the usual manner  thus the fortieth part of a grain of calomel was supposed to be equal to a fivegrain calomel pill and so on in proportion throughout the whole range of medicine  he had tried the experiment in a curious manner upon a publican who had been brought into the hospital with a broken head and was cured upon the infinitesimal system in the incredibly short space of three months  this man was a hard drinker  he professor muff had dispersed three drops of rum through a bucket of water and requested the man to drink the whole what was the result  before he had drunk a quart he was in a state of beastly intoxication and five other men were made dead drunk with the remainder  ‘the president wished to know whether an infinitesimal dose of sodawater would have recovered them  professor muff replied that the twentyfifth part of a teaspoonful properly administered to each patient would have sobered him immediately  the president remarked that this was a most important discovery and he hoped the lord mayor and court of aldermen would patronize it immediately  ‘a member begged to be informed whether it would be possible to administer—say the twentieth part of a grain of bread and cheese to all grownup paupers and the fortieth part to children with the same satisfying effect as their present allowance  ‘professor muff was willing to stake his professional reputation on the perfect adequacy of such a quantity of food to the support of human life—in workhouses the addition of the fifteenth part of a grain of pudding twice a week would render it a high diet  ‘professor nogo called the attention of the section to a very extraordinary case of animal magnetism  a private watchman being merely looked at by the operator from the opposite side of a wide street was at once observed to be in a very drowsy and languid state  he was followed to his box and being once slightly rubbed on the palms of the hands fell into a sound sleep in which he continued without intermission for ten hours   ‘section c—statistics hayloft original pig   president—mr woodensconce  vicepresidents—mr ledbrain and mr timbered  ‘mr slug stated to the section the result of some calculations he had made with great difficulty and labour regarding the state of infant education among the middle classes of london  he found that within a circle of three miles from the elephant and castle the following were the names and numbers of children’s books principally in circulation—  ‘jack the giantkiller                7943 ditto and beanstalk                  8621 ditto and eleven brothers             2845 ditto and jill                        1998                          total       21407  ‘he found that the proportion of robinson crusoes to philip quarlls was as four and a half to one and that the preponderance of valentine and orsons over goody two shoeses was as three and an eighth of the former to half a one of the latter a comparison of seven champions with simple simons gave the same result  the ignorance that prevailed was lamentable  one child on being asked whether he would rather be saint george of england or a respectable tallowchandler instantly replied “taint george of ingling”  another a little boy of eight years old was found to be firmly impressed with a belief in the existence of dragons and openly stated that it was his intention when he grew up to rush forth sword in hand for the deliverance of captive princesses and the promiscuous slaughter of giants  not one child among the number interrogated had ever heard of mungo park—some inquiring whether he was at all connected with the black man that swept the crossing and others whether he was in any way related to the regent’s park  they had not the slightest conception of the commonest principles of mathematics and considered sindbad the sailor the most enterprising voyager that the world had ever produced  ‘a member strongly deprecating the use of all the other books mentioned suggested that jack and jill might perhaps be exempted from the general censure inasmuch as the hero and heroine in the very outset of the tale were depicted as going up a hill to fetch a pail of water which was a laborious and useful occupation—supposing the family linen was being washed for instance  ‘mr slug feared that the moral effect of this passage was more than counterbalanced by another in a subsequent part of the poem in which very gross allusion was made to the mode in which the heroine was personally chastised by her mother      “‘for laughing at jack’s disaster”  besides the whole work had this one great fault it was not true  ‘the president complimented the honourable member on the excellent distinction he had drawn  several other members too dwelt upon the immense and urgent necessity of storing the minds of children with nothing but facts and figures which process the president very forcibly remarked had made them the section the men they were  ‘mr slug then stated some curious calculations respecting the dogs’meat barrows of london  he found that the total number of small carts and barrows engaged in dispensing provision to the cats and dogs of the metropolis was one thousand seven hundred and fortythree  the average number of skewers delivered daily with the provender by each dogs’meat cart or barrow was thirtysix  now multiplying the number of skewers so delivered by the number of barrows a total of sixtytwo thousand seven hundred and fortyeight skewers daily would be obtained  allowing that of these sixtytwo thousand seven hundred and fortyeight skewers the odd two thousand seven hundred and fortyeight were accidentally devoured with the meat by the most voracious of the animals supplied it followed that sixty thousand skewers per day or the enormous number of twentyone millions nine hundred thousand skewers annually were wasted in the kennels and dustholes of london which if collected and warehoused would in ten years’ time afford a mass of timber more than sufficient for the construction of a firstrate vessel of war for the use of her majesty’s navy to be called “the royal skewer” and to become under that name the terror of all the enemies of this island  ‘mr x ledbrain read a very ingenious communication from which it appeared that the total number of legs belonging to the manufacturing population of one great town in yorkshire was in round numbers forty thousand while the total number of chair and stool legs in their houses was only thirty thousand which upon the very favourable average of three legs to a seat yielded only ten thousand seats in all  from this calculation it would appear—not taking wooden or cork legs into the account but allowing two legs to every person—that ten thousand individuals onehalf of the whole population were either destitute of any rest for their legs at all or passed the whole of their leisure time in sitting upon boxes   ‘section d—mechanical science coachhouse original pig   president—mr carter  vicepresidents—mr truck and mr waghorn  ‘professor queerspeck exhibited an elegant model of a portable railway neatly mounted in a green case for the waistcoat pocket  by attaching this beautiful instrument to his boots any bank or publicoffice clerk could transport himself from his place of residence to his place of business at the easy rate of sixtyfive miles an hour which to gentlemen of sedentary pursuits would be an incalculable advantage  ‘the president was desirous of knowing whether it was necessary to have a level surface on which the gentleman was to run  ‘professor queerspeck explained that city gentlemen would run in trains being handcuffed together to prevent confusion or unpleasantness  for instance trains would start every morning at eight nine and ten o’clock from camden town islington camberwell hackney and various other places in which city gentlemen are accustomed to reside  it would be necessary to have a level but he had provided for this difficulty by proposing that the best line that the circumstances would admit of should be taken through the sewers which undermine the streets of the metropolis and which well lighted by jets from the gas pipes which run immediately above them would form a pleasant and commodious arcade especially in wintertime when the inconvenient custom of carrying umbrellas now so general could be wholly dispensed with  in reply to another question professor queerspeck stated that no substitute for the purposes to which these arcades were at present devoted had yet occurred to him but that he hoped no fanciful objection on this head would be allowed to interfere with so great an undertaking  ‘mr jobba produced a forcingmachine on a novel plan for bringing jointstock railway shares prematurely to a premium  the instrument was in the form of an elegant gilt weatherglass of most dazzling appearance and was worked behind by strings after the manner of a pantomime trick the strings being always pulled by the directors of the company to which the machine belonged  the quicksilver was so ingeniously placed that when the acting directors held shares in their pockets figures denoting very small expenses and very large returns appeared upon the glass but the moment the directors parted with these pieces of paper the estimate of needful expenditure suddenly increased itself to an immense extent while the statements of certain profits became reduced in the same proportion  mr jobba stated that the machine had been in constant requisition for some months past and he had never once known it to fail  ‘a member expressed his opinion that it was extremely neat and pretty he wished to know whether it was not liable to accidental derangement mr jobba said that the whole machine was undoubtedly liable to be blown up but that was the only objection to it  ‘professor nogo arrived from the anatomical section to exhibit a model of a safety fireescape which could be fixed at any time in less than half an hour and by means of which the youngest or most infirm persons successfully resisting the progress of the flames until it was quite ready could be preserved if they merely balanced themselves for a few minutes on the sill of their bedroom window and got into the escape without falling into the street  the professor stated that the number of boys who had been rescued in the daytime by this machine from houses which were not on fire was almost incredible  not a conflagration had occurred in the whole of london for many months past to which the escape had not been carried on the very next day and put in action before a concourse of persons  ‘the president inquired whether there was not some difficulty in ascertaining which was the top of the machine and which the bottom in cases of pressing emergency  ‘professor nogo explained that of course it could not be expected to act quite as well when there was a fire as when there was not a fire but in the former case he thought it would be of equal service whether the top were up or down’                                        with the last section our correspondent concludes his most able and faithful report which will never cease to reflect credit upon him for his scientific attainments and upon us for our enterprising spirit  it is needless to take a review of the subjects which have been discussed of the mode in which they have been examined of the great truths which they have elicited  they are now before the world and we leave them to read to consider and to profit  the place of meeting for next year has undergone discussion and has at length been decided regard being had to and evidence being taken upon the goodness of its wines the supply of its markets the hospitality of its inhabitants and the quality of its hotels  we hope at this next meeting our correspondent may again be present and that we may be once more the means of placing his communications before the world  until that period we have been prevailed upon to allow this number of our miscellany to be retailed to the public or wholesaled to the trade without any advance upon our usual price  we have only to add that the committees are now broken up and that mudfog is once again restored to its accustomed tranquillity—that professors and members have had balls and soirées and suppers and great mutual complimentations and have at length dispersed to their several homes—whither all good wishes and joys attend them until next year                                                                 signed boz    full report of the second meeting of the mudfog association for the advancement of everything   in october last we did ourselves the immortal credit of recording at an enormous expense and by dint of exertions unnpralleled in the history of periodical publication the proceedings of the mudfog association for the advancement of everything which in that month held its first great halfyearly meeting to the wonder and delight of the whole empire  we announced at the conclusion of that extraordinary and most remarkable report that when the second meeting of the society should take place we should be found again at our post renewing our gigantic and spirited endeavours and once more making the world ring with the accuracy authenticity immeasurable superiority and intense remarkability of our account of its proceedings  in redemption of this pledge we caused to be despatched per steam to oldcastle at which place this second meeting of the society was held on the 20th instant the same superhumanlyendowed gentleman who furnished the former report and who—gifted by nature with transcendent abilities and furnished by us with a body of assistants scarcely inferior to himself—has forwarded a series of letters which for faithfulness of description power of language fervour of thought happiness of expression and importance of subjectmatter have no equal in the epistolary literature of any age or country  we give this gentleman’s correspondence entire and in the order in which it reached our office                  ‘saloon of steamer thursday night halfpast eight  ‘when i left new burlington street this evening in the hackney cabriolet number four thousand two hundred and eightyfive i experienced sensations as novel as they were oppressive  a sense of the importance of the task i had undertaken a consciousness that i was leaving london and stranger still going somewhere else a feeling of loneliness and a sensation of jolting quite bewildered my thoughts and for a time rendered me even insensible to the presence of my carpetbag and hatbox i shall ever feel grateful to the driver of a blackwall omnibus who by thrusting the pole of his vehicle through the small door of the cabriolet awakened me from a tumult of imaginings that are wholly indescribable  but of such materials is our imperfect nature composed  ‘i am happy to say that i am the first passenger on board and shall thus be enabled to give you an account of all that happens in the order of its occurrence  the chimney is smoking a good deal and so are the crew and the captain i

suppose that any such event had recently occurred there  from this point i proceeded—passing the gasworks and tallowmelter’s—to a lane which had been pointed out to me as the beadle’s place of residence and before i had driven a dozen yards further i had the good fortune to meet sowster himself advancing towards me  ‘sowster is a fat man with a more enlarged development of that peculiar

boy and stomachache   president—sir william joltered  vicepresidents—mr muddlebranes and mr drawley  ‘mr x x misty communicated some remarks on the disappearance of dancingbears from the streets of london with observations on the exhibition of monkeys as connected with barrelorgans  the writer had observed with feelings of the utmost pain and regret that some years ago a sudden and unaccountable change in the public taste took place with reference to itinerant bears who being discountenanced by the populace gradually fell off one by one from the streets of the metropolis until not one remained to create a taste for natural history in the breasts of the poor and uninstructed  one bear indeed—a brown and ragged animal—had lingered about the haunts of his former triumphs with a worn and dejected visage and feeble limbs and had essayed to wield his quarterstaff for the amusement of the multitude but hunger and an utter want of any due recompense for his abilities had at length driven him from the field and it was only too probable that he had fallen a sacrifice to the rising taste for grease  he regretted to add that a similar and no less lamentable change had taken place with reference to monkeys  these delightful animals had formerly been almost as plentiful as the organs on the tops of which they were accustomed to sit the proportion in the year 1829 it appeared by the parliamentary return being as one monkey to three organs  owing however to an altered taste in musical instruments and the substitution in a great measure of narrow boxes of music for organs which left the monkeys nothing to sit upon this source of public amusement was wholly dried up  considering it a matter of the deepest importance in connection with national education that the people should not lose such opportunities of making themselves acquainted with the manners and customs of two most interesting species of animals the author submitted that some measures should be immediately taken for the restoration of these pleasing and truly intellectual amusements  ‘the president inquired by what means the honourable member proposed to attain this most desirable end  ‘the author submitted that it could be most fully and satisfactorily accomplished if her majesty’s government would cause to be brought over to england and maintained at the public expense and for the public amusement such a number of bears as would enable every quarter of the town to be visited—say at least by three bears a week  no difficulty whatever need be experienced in providing a fitting place for the reception of these animals as a commodious beargarden could be erected in the immediate neighbourhood of both houses of parliament obviously the most proper and eligible spot for such an establishment  ‘professor mull doubted very much whether any correct ideas of natural history were propagated by the means to which the honourable member had so ably adverted  on the contrary he believed that they had been the means of diffusing very incorrect and imperfect notions on the subject he spoke from personal observation and personal experience when he said that many children of great abilities had been induced to believe from what they had observed in the streets at and before the period to which the honourable gentleman had referred that all monkeys were born in red coats and spangles and that their hats and feathers also came by nature he wished to know distinctly whether the honourable gentleman attributed the want of encouragement the bears had met with to the decline of public taste in that respect or to a want of ability on the part of the bears themselves  ‘mr x x misty replied that he could not bring himself to believe but that there must be a great deal of floating talent among the bears and monkeys generally which in the absence of any proper encouragement was dispersed in other directions  ‘professor pumpkinskull wished to take that opportunity of calling the attention of the section to a most important and serious point  the author of the treatise just read had alluded to the prevalent taste for bears’grease as a means of promoting the growth of hair which undoubtedly was diffused to a very great and as it appeared to him very alarming extent  no gentleman attending that section could fail to be aware of the fact that the youth of the present age evinced by their behaviour in the streets and at all places of public resort a considerable lack of that gallantry and gentlemanly feeling which in more ignorant times had been thought becoming  he wished to know whether it were possible that a constant outward application of bears’grease by the young gentlemen about town had imperceptibly infused into those unhappy persons something of the nature and quality of the bear  he shuddered as he threw out the remark but if this theory on inquiry should prove to be well founded it would at once explain a great deal of unpleasant eccentricity of behaviour which without some such discovery was wholly unaccountable  ‘the president highly complimented the learned gentleman on his most valuable suggestion which produced the greatest effect upon the assembly and remarked that only a week previous he had seen some young gentlemen at a theatre eyeing a box of ladies with a fierce intensity which nothing but the influence of some brutish appetite could possibly explain  it was dreadful to reflect that our youth were so rapidly verging into a generation of bears  ‘after a scene of scientific enthusiasm it was resolved that this important question should be immediately submitted to the consideration of the council  ‘the president wished to know whether any gentleman could inform the section what had become of the dancingdogs  ‘a member replied after some hesitation that on the day after three gleesingers had been committed to prison as criminals by a late most zealous policemagistrate of the metropolis the dogs had abandoned their professional duties and dispersed themselves in different quarters of the town to gain a livelihood by less dangerous means  he was given to understand that since that period they had supported themselves by lying in wait for and robbing blind men’s poodles  ‘mr flummery exhibited a twig claiming to be a veritable branch of that noble tree known to naturalists as the shakspeare which has taken root in every land and climate and gathered under the shade of its broad green boughs the great family of mankind  the learned gentleman remarked that the twig had been undoubtedly called by other names in its time but that it had been pointed out to him by an old lady in warwickshire where the great tree had grown as a shoot of the genuine shakspeare by which name he begged to introduce it to his countrymen  ‘the president wished to know what botanical definition the honourable gentleman could afford of the curiosity  ‘mr flummery expressed his opinion that it was a decided plant   ‘section b—display of models

size than an ordinary snuffbox manufactured entirely by himself and composed exclusively of steel by the aid of which more pockets could be picked in one hour than by the present slow and tedious process in fourandtwenty  the inventor remarked that it had been put into active operation in fleet street the strand and other thoroughfares and had never been once known to fail  ‘after some slight delay occasioned by the various members of the section buttoning their pockets  ‘the president narrowly inspected the invention and declared that he had never seen a machine of more beautiful or exquisite construction  would the inventor be good enough to inform the section whether he had taken any and what means for bringing it into general operation  ‘mr crinkles stated that after encountering some preliminary difficulties he had succeeded in putting himself in communication with mr fogle hunter and other gentlemen connected with the swell mob who had awarded the invention the very highest and most unqualified approbation  he regretted to say however that these distinguished practitioners in common with a gentleman of the name of gimleteyed tommy and other members of a secondary grade of the profession whom he was understood to represent entertained an insuperable objection to its being brought into general use on the ground that it would have the inevitable effect of almost entirely superseding manual labour and throwing a great number of highlydeserving persons out of employment  ‘the president hoped that no such fanciful objections would be allowed to stand in the way of such a great public improvement  ‘mr crinkles hoped so too but he feared that if the gentlemen of the swell mob persevered in their objection nothing could be done  ‘professor grime suggested that surely in that case her majesty’s government might be prevailed upon to take it up  ‘mr crinkles said that if the objection were found to be insuperable he should apply to parliament which he thought could not fail to recognise the utility of the invention  ‘the president observed that up to this time parliament had certainly got on very well without it but as they did their business on a very large scale he had no doubt they would gladly adopt the improvement his only fear was that the machine might be worn out by constant working  ‘mr coppernose called the attention of the section to a proposition of great magnitude and interest illustrated by a vast number of models and stated with much clearness and perspicuity in a treatise entitled “practical suggestions on the necessity of providing some harmless and wholesome relaxation for the young noblemen of england”  his proposition was that a space of ground of not less than ten miles in length and four in breadth should be purchased by a new company to be incorporated by act of parliament and inclosed by a brick wall of not less than twelve feet in height  he proposed that it should be laid out with highway roads turnpikes bridges miniature villages and every object that could conduce to the comfort and glory of fourinhand clubs so that they might be fairly presumed to require no drive beyond it  this delightful retreat would be fitted up with most commodious and extensive stables for the convenience of such of the nobility and gentry as had a taste for ostlering and with houses of entertainment furnished in the most expensive and handsome style  it would be further provided with whole streets of doorknockers and bellhandles of extra size so constructed that they could be easily wrenched off at night and regularly screwed on again by attendants provided for the purpose every day  there would also be gas lamps of real glass which could be broken at a comparatively small expense per dozen and a broad and handsome foot pavement for gentlemen to drive their cabriolets upon when they were humorously disposed—for the full enjoyment of which feat live pedestrians would be procured from the workhouse at a very small charge per head the place being inclosed and carefully screened from the intrusion of the public there would be no objection to gentlemen laying aside any article of their costume that was considered to interfere with a pleasant frolic or indeed to their walking about without any costume at all if they liked that better  in short every facility of enjoyment would be afforded that the most gentlemanly person could possibly desire  but as even these advantages would be incomplete unless there were some means provided of enabling the nobility and gentry to display their prowess when they sallied forth after dinner and as some inconvenience might be experienced in the event of their being reduced to the necessity of pummelling each other the inventor had turned his attention to the construction of an entirely new police force composed exclusively of automaton figures which with the assistance of the ingenious signor gagliardi of windmillstreet in the haymarket he had succeeded in making with such nicety that a policeman cabdriver or old woman made upon the principle of the models exhibited would walk about until knocked down like any real man nay more if set upon and beaten by six or eight noblemen or gentlemen after it was down the figure would utter divers groans mingled with entreaties for mercy thus rendering the illusion complete and the enjoyment perfect  but the invention did not stop even here for stationhouses would be built containing good beds for noblemen and gentlemen during the night and in the morning they would repair to a commodious police office where a pantomimic investigation would take place before the automaton magistrates—quite equal to life—who would fine them in so many counters with which they would be previously provided for the purpose  this office would be furnished with an inclined plane for the convenience of any nobleman or gentleman who might wish to bring in his horse as a witness and the prisoners would be at perfect liberty as they were now to interrupt the complainants as much as they pleased and to make any remarks that they thought proper  the charge for these amusements would amount to very little more than they already cost and the inventor submitted that the public would be much benefited and comforted by the proposed arrangement  ‘professor nogo wished to be informed what amount of automaton police force it was proposed to raise in the first instance  ‘mr coppernose replied that it was proposed to begin with seven divisions of police of a score each lettered from a to g inclusive  it was proposed that not more than half this number should be placed on active duty and that the remainder should be kept on shelves in the police office ready to be called out at a moment’s notice  ‘the president awarding the utmost merit to the ingenious gentleman who had originated the idea doubted whether the automaton police would quite answer the purpose  he feared that noblemen and gentlemen would perhaps require the excitement of thrashing living subjects  ‘mr coppernose submitted that as the usual odds in such cases were ten noblemen or gentlemen to one policeman or cabdriver it could make very little difference in point of excitement whether the policeman or cabdriver were a man or a block  the great advantage would be that a policeman’s limbs might be all knocked off and yet he would be in a condition to do duty next day  he might even give his evidence next morning with his head in his hand and give it equally well  ‘professor muff—will you allow me to ask you sir of what materials it is intended that the magistrates’ heads shall be composed  ‘mr coppernose—the magistrates will have wooden heads of course and they will be made of the toughest and thickest materials that can possibly be obtained  ‘professor muff—i am quite satisfied  this is a great invention  ‘professor nogo—i see but one objection to it  it appears to me that the magistrates ought to talk  ‘mr coppernose no sooner heard this suggestion than he touched a small spring in each of the two models of magistrates which were placed upon the table one of the figures immediately began to exclaim with great volubility that he was sorry to see gentlemen in such a situation and the other to express a fear that the policeman was intoxicated  ‘the section as with one accord declared with a shout of applause that the invention was complete and the president much excited retired with mr coppernose to lay it before the council  on his return  ‘mr tickle displayed his newlyinvented spectacles which enabled the wearer to discern in very bright colours objects at a great distance and rendered him wholly blind to those immediately before him  it was he said a most valuable and useful invention based strictly upon the principle of the human eye  ‘the president required some information upon this point  he had yet to learn that the human eye was remarkable for the peculiarities of which the honourable gentleman had spoken  ‘mr tickle was rather astonished to hear this when the president could not fail to be aware that a large number of most excellent persons and great statesmen could see with the naked eye most marvellous horrors on west india plantations while they could discern nothing whatever in the interior of manchester cotton mills  he must know too with what quickness of perception most people could discover their neighbour’s faults and how very blind they were to their own  if the president differed from the great majority of men in this respect his eye was a defective one and it was to assist his vision that these glasses were made  ‘mr blank exhibited a model of a fashionable annual composed of copperplates gold leaf and silk boards and worked entirely by milk and water  ‘mr prosee after examining the machine declared it to be so ingeniously composed that he was wholly unable to discover how it went on at all  ‘mr

stated to the section a most interesting case of monomania and described the course of treatment he had pursued with perfect success  the patient was a married lady in the middle rank of life who having seen another lady at an evening party in a full suit of pearls was suddenly seized with a desire to possess a similar equipment although her husband’s finances were by no means equal to the necessary outlay  finding her wish ungratified she fell sick and the symptoms soon became so alarming that he dr grummidge was called in  at this period the prominent tokens of the disorder were sullenness a total indisposition to perform domestic duties great peevishness and extreme languor except when pearls were mentioned at which times the pulse quickened the eyes grew brighter the pupils dilated and the patient after various incoherent exclamations burst into a passion of tears and exclaimed that nobody cared for her and that she wished herself dead finding that the patient’s appetite was affected in the presence of company he began by ordering a total abstinence from all stimulants and forbidding any sustenance but weak gruel he then took twenty ounces of blood applied a blister under each ear one upon the chest and another on the back having done which and administered five grains of calomel he left the patient to her repose  the next day she was somewhat low but decidedly better and all appearances of irritation were removed the next day she improved still further and on the next again  on the fourth there was some appearance of a return of the old symptoms which no sooner developed themselves than he administered another dose of calomel and left strict orders that unless a decidedly favourable change occurred within two hours the patient’s head should be immediately shaved to the very last curl  from that moment she began to mend and in less than fourandtwenty hours was perfectly restored she did not now betray the least emotion at the sight or mention of pearls or any other ornaments  she was cheerful and goodhumoured and a most beneficial change had been effected in her whole temperament and condition  ‘mr pipkin mrcs read a short but most interesting communication in which he sought to prove the complete belief of sir william courtenay otherwise thorn recently shot at canterbury in the homoeopathic system the section would bear in mind that one of the homoeopathic doctrines was that infinitesimal doses of any medicine which would occasion the disease under which the patient laboured supposing him to be in a healthy state would cure it  now it was a remarkable circumstance—proved in the evidence—that the deceased thorn employed a woman to follow him about all day with a pail of water assuring her that one drop a purely homoeopathic remedy the section would observe placed upon his tongue after death would restore him  what was the obvious inference  that thorn who was marching and countermarching in osier beds and other swampy places was impressed with a presentiment that he should be drowned in which case had his instructions been complied with he could not fail to have been brought to life again instantly by his own prescription  as it was if this woman or any other person had administered an infinitesimal dose of lead and gunpowder immediately after he fell he would have recovered forthwith but unhappily the woman concerned did not possess the power of reasoning by analogy or carrying out a principle and thus the unfortunate gentleman had been sacrificed to the ignorance of the peasantry   ‘section

difference between the value of the qualification of several members of parliament as published to the world and its real nature and amount  after reminding the section that every member of parliament for a town or borough was supposed to possess a clear freehold estate of three hundred pounds per annum the honourable gentleman excited great amusement and laughter by stating the exact amount of freehold property possessed by a column of legislators in which he had included himself  it appeared from this table that the amount of such income possessed by each was 0 pounds 0 shillings and 0 pence yielding an average of the same great laughter  it was pretty well known that there were accommodating gentlemen in the habit of furnishing new members with temporary qualifications to the ownership of which they swore solemnly—of course as a mere matter of form  he argued from these data that it was wholly unnecessary for members of parliament to possess any property at all especially

by the secretary descriptive of a bay pony with one eye which had been seen by the author standing in a butcher’s cart at the corner of newgate market  the communication described the author of the paper as having in the prosecution of a mercantile pursuit betaken himself one saturday morning last summer from somers town to cheapside in the course of which expedition he had beheld the extraordinary appearance above described  the pony had one distinct eye and it had been pointed out to him by his friend captain blunderbore of the horse marines who assisted the author in his search that whenever he winked this eye he whisked his tail possibly to drive the flies off but that he always winked and whisked at the same time  the animal was lean spavined and tottering and the author proposed to constitute it of the family of fitfordogsmeataurious  it certainly did occur to him that there was no case on record of a pony with one clearlydefined and distinct organ of vision winking and whisking at the same moment  ‘mr q j snuffletoffle had heard of a pony winking his eye and likewise of a pony whisking his tail but whether they were two ponies or the same pony he could not undertake positively to say  at all events he was acquainted with no authenticated instance of a simultaneous winking and whisking and he really could not but doubt the existence of such a marvellous pony in opposition to all those natural laws by which ponies were governed  referring however to the mere question of his one organ of vision might he suggest the possibility of this pony having been literally half asleep at the time he was seen and having closed only one eye  ‘the president observed that whether the pony was half asleep or fast asleep there could be no doubt that the association was wide awake and therefore that they had better get the business over and go to dinner he had certainly never seen anything analogous to this pony but he was not prepared to doubt its existence for he had seen many queerer ponies in his time though he did not pretend to have seen any more remarkable donkeys than the other gentlemen around him  ‘professor john ketch was then called upon to exhibit the skull of the late mr greenacre which he produced from a blue bag remarking on being invited to make any observations that occurred to him “that he’d pound it as that ’ere ’spectable section had never seed a more gamerer cove nor he vos”  ‘a most animated discussion upon this interesting relic ensued and some difference of opinion arising respecting the real character of the deceased gentleman mr blubb delivered a lecture upon the cranium before him clearly showing that mr greenacre possessed the organ of destructiveness to a most unusual extent with a most remarkable development of the organ of carveativeness  sir hookham snivey was proceeding to combat this opinion when professor ketch suddenly interrupted the proceedings by exclaiming with great excitement of manner “walker”  ‘the president begged to call the learned gentleman to order  ‘professor ketch—“order be blowed you’ve got the wrong un i tell you it ain’t no ’ed at all it’s a cokernut as my brotherinlaw has been acarvin’ to hornament his new baked taturstall wots acomin’ down ’ere vile the ’sociation’s in the town  hand over vill you”  ‘with these words professor ketch hastily repossessed himself of the cocoanut and drew forth the skull in mistake for which he had exhibited it  a most interesting conversation ensued but as there appeared some doubt ultimately whether the skull was mr greenacre’s or a hospital patient’s or a pauper’s or a man’s or a woman’s or a monkey’s no particular result was obtained’                                        ‘i cannot’ says our talented correspondent in conclusion ‘i cannot close my account of these gigantic researches and sublime and noble triumphs without repeating a bon mot of professor woodensconce’s which shows how the greatest minds may occasionally unbend when truth can be presented to listening ears clothed in an attractive and playful form i was standing by when after a week of feasting and feeding that learned gentleman accompanied by the whole body of wonderful men entered the hall yesterday where a sumptuous dinner was prepared where the richest wines sparkled on the board and fat bucks—propitiatory sacrifices to learning—sent forth their savoury odours  “ah” said professor woodensconce rubbing his hands “this is what we meet for this is what inspires us this is what keeps us together and beckons us onward this is the spread of science and a glorious spread it is”’    the pantomime of life   before we plunge headlong into this paper let us at once confess to a fondness for pantomimes—to a gentle sympathy with clowns and pantaloons—to an unqualified admiration of harlequins and columbines—to a chaste delight in every action of their brief existence varied and manycoloured as those actions are and inconsistent though they occasionally be with those rigid and formal rules of propriety which regulate the proceedings of meaner and less comprehensive minds  we revel in pantomimes—not because they dazzle one’s eyes with tinsel and gold leaf not because they present to us once again the wellbeloved chalked faces and goggle eyes of our childhood not even because like christmasday and twelfthnight and shrovetuesday and one’s own birthday they come to us but once a year—our attachment is founded on a graver and a very different reason  a pantomime is to us a mirror of life nay more we maintain that it is so to audiences generally although they are not aware of it and that this very circumstance is the secret cause of their amusement and delight  let us take a slight example  the scene is a street an elderly gentleman with a large face and strongly marked features appears  his countenance beams with a sunny smile and a perpetual dimple is on his broad red cheek  he is evidently an opulent elderly gentleman comfortable in circumstances and welltodo in the world  he is not unmindful of the adornment of his person for he is richly not to say gaudily dressed and that he indulges to a reasonable extent in the pleasures of the table may be inferred from the joyous and oily manner in which he rubs his stomach by way of informing the audience that he is going home to dinner  in the fulness of his heart in the fancied security of wealth in the possession and enjoyment of all the good things of life the elderly gentleman suddenly loses his footing and stumbles  how the audience roar  he is set upon by a noisy and officious crowd who buffet and cuff him unmercifully  they scream with delight  every time the elderly gentleman struggles to get up his relentless persecutors knock him down again  the spectators are convulsed with merriment  and when at last the elderly gentleman does get up and staggers away despoiled of hat wig and clothing himself battered to pieces and his watch and money gone they are exhausted with laughter and express their merriment and admiration in rounds of applause  is this like life  change the scene to any real street—to the stock exchange or the city banker’s the merchant’s countinghouse or even the tradesman’s shop  see any one of these men fall—the more suddenly and the nearer the zenith of his pride and riches the better  what a wild hallo is raised over his prostrate carcase by the shouting mob how they whoop and yell as he lies humbled beneath them  mark how eagerly they set upon him when he is down and how they mock and deride him as he slinks away  why it is the pantomime to the very letter  of all the pantomimic dramatis personae we consider the pantaloon the most worthless and debauched  independent of the dislike one naturally feels at seeing a gentleman of his years engaged in pursuits highly unbecoming his gravity and time of life we cannot conceal from ourselves the fact that he is a treacherous worldlyminded old villain constantly enticing his younger companion the clown into acts of fraud or petty larceny and generally standing aside to watch the result of the enterprise  if it be successful he never forgets to return for his share of the spoil but if it turn out a failure he generally retires with remarkable caution and expedition and keeps carefully aloof until the affair has blown over  his amorous propensities too are eminently disagreeable and his mode of addressing ladies in the open street at noonday is downright improper being usually neither more nor less than a perceptible tickling of the aforesaid ladies in the waist after committing which he starts back manifestly ashamed as well he may be of his own indecorum and temerity continuing nevertheless to ogle and beckon to them from a distance in a very unpleasant and immoral manner  is there any man who cannot count a dozen pantaloons in his own social circle  is there any man who has not seen them swarming at the west end of the town on a sunshiny day or a summer’s evening going through the lastnamed pantomimic feats with as much liquorish energy and as total an absence of reserve as if they were on the very stage itself  we can tell upon our fingers a dozen pantaloons of our acquaintance at this moment—capital pantaloons who have been performing all kinds of strange freaks to the great amusement of their friends and acquaintance for years past and who to this day are making such comical and ineffectual attempts to be young and dissolute that all beholders are like to die with laughter  take that old gentleman who has just emerged from the café de l’europe in the haymarket where he has been dining at the expense of the young man upon town with whom he shakes hands as they part at the door of the tavern  the affected warmth of that shake of the hand the courteous nod the obvious recollection of the dinner the savoury flavour of which still hangs upon his lips are all characteristics of his great prototype  he hobbles away humming an opera tune and twirling his cane to and fro with affected carelessness  suddenly he stops—’tis at the milliner’s window  he peeps through one of the large panes of glass and his view of the ladies within being obstructed by the india shawls directs his attentions to the young girl with the bandbox in her hand who is gazing in at the window also  see he draws beside her  he coughs she turns away from him  he draws near her again she disregards him  he gleefully chucks her under the chin and retreating a few steps nods and beckons with fantastic grimaces while the girl bestows a contemptuous and supercilious look upon his wrinkled visage  she turns away with a flounce and the old gentleman trots after her with a toothless chuckle the pantaloon to the life  but the close resemblance which the clowns of the stage bear to those of everyday life is perfectly extraordinary  some people talk with a sigh of the decline of pantomime and murmur in low and dismal tones the name of grimaldi  we mean no disparagement to the worthy and excellent old man when we say that this is downright nonsense  clowns that beat grimaldi all to nothing turn up every day and nobody patronizes them—more’s the pity  ‘i know who you mean’ says some dirtyfaced patron of mr osbaldistone’s laying down the miscellany when he has got thus far and bestowing upon vacancy a most knowing glance ‘you mean c j smith as did guy fawkes and george barnwell at the garden’  the dirtyfaced gentleman has hardly uttered the words when he is interrupted by a young gentleman in no shirtcollar and a petersham coat  ‘no no’ says the young gentleman ‘he means brown king and gibson at the ‘delphi’ now with great deference both to the firstnamed gentleman with the dirty face and the lastnamed gentleman in the nonexisting shirtcollar we do not mean either the performer who so grotesquely burlesqued the popish conspirator or the three unchangeables who have been dancing the same dance under different imposing titles and doing the same thing under various highsounding names for some five or six years last past  we have no sooner made this avowal than the public who have hitherto been silent witnesses of the dispute inquire what on earth it is we do mean and with becoming respect we proceed to tell them  it is very well known to all playgoers and pantomimeseers that the scenes in which a theatrical clown is at the very height of his glory are those which are described in the playbills as ‘cheesemonger’s shop and crockery warehouse’ or ‘tailor’s shop and mrs queertable’s boardinghouse’ or places bearing some such title where the great fun of the thing consists in the hero’s taking lodgings which he has not the slightest intention of paying for or obtaining goods under false pretences or abstracting the stockintrade of the respectable shopkeeper next door or robbing warehouse porters as they pass under his window or to shorten the catalogue in his swindling everybody he possibly can it only remaining to be observed that the more extensive the swindling is and the more barefaced the impudence of the swindler the greater the rapture and ecstasy of the audience  now it is a most remarkable fact that precisely this sort of thing occurs in real life day after day and nobody sees the humour of it  let us illustrate our position by detailing the plot of this portion of the pantomime—not of the theatre but of life  the honourable captain fitzwhisker fiercy attended by his livery servant do’em—a most respectable servant to look at who has grown grey in the service of the captain’s family—views treats for and ultimately obtains possession of the unfurnished house such a number such a street  all the tradesmen in the neighbourhood are in agonies of competition for the captain’s custom the captain is a goodnatured kindhearted easy man and to avoid being the cause of disappointment to any he most handsomely gives orders to all  hampers of wine baskets of provisions cartloads of furniture boxes of jewellery supplies of luxuries of the costliest description flock to the house of the honourable captain fitzwhisker fiercy where they are received with the utmost readiness by the highly respectable do’em while the captain himself struts and swaggers about with that compound air of conscious superiority and general bloodthirstiness which a military captain should always and does most times wear to the admiration and terror of plebeian men  but the tradesmen’s backs are no sooner turned than the captain with all the eccentricity of a mighty mind and assisted by the faithful do’em whose devoted fidelity is not the least touching part of his character disposes of everything to great advantage for although the articles fetch small sums still they are sold considerably above cost price the cost to the captain having been nothing at all  after various manoeuvres the imposture is discovered fitzfiercy and do’em are recognized as confederates and the police office to which they are both taken is thronged with their dupes  who can fail to recognize in this the exact counterpart of the best portion of a theatrical pantomime—fitzwhisker fiercy by the clown do’em by the pantaloon and supernumeraries by the tradesmen  the best of the joke too is that the very coalmerchant who is loudest in his complaints against the person who defrauded him is the identical man who sat in the centre of the very front row of the pit last night and laughed the most boisterously at this very same thing—and not so well done either  talk of grimaldi we say again  did grimaldi in his best days ever do anything in this way equal to da costa  the mention of this latter justly celebrated clown reminds us of his last piece of humour the fraudulently obtaining certain stamped acceptances from a young gentleman in the army  we had scarcely laid down our pen to contemplate for a few moments this admirable actor’s performance of that exquisite practical joke than a new branch of our subject flashed suddenly upon us  so we take it up again at once  all people who have been behind the scenes and most people who have been before them know that in the representation of a pantomime a good many men are sent upon the stage for the express purpose of being cheated or knocked down or both  now down to a moment ago we had never been able to understand for what possible purpose a great number of odd lazy largeheaded men whom one is in the habit of meeting here and there and everywhere could ever have been created  we see it all now  they are the supernumeraries in the pantomime of life the men who have been thrust into it with no other view than to be constantly tumbling over each other and running their heads against all sorts of strange things we sat opposite to one of these men at a suppertable only last week now we think of it he was exactly like the gentlemen with the pasteboard heads and faces who do the corresponding business in the theatrical pantomimes there was the same broad stolid simper—the same dull leaden eye—the same unmeaning vacant stare and whatever was said or whatever was done he always came in at precisely the wrong place or jostled against something that he had not the slightest business with  we looked at the man across the table again and again and could not satisfy ourselves what race of beings to class him with  how very odd that this never occurred to us before  we will frankly own that we have been much troubled with the harlequin we see harlequins of so many kinds in the real living pantomime that we hardly know which to select as the proper fellow of him of the theatres at one time we were disposed to think that the harlequin was neither more nor less than a young man of family and independent property who had run away with an operadancer and was fooling his life and his means away in light and trivial amusements  on reflection however we remembered that harlequins are occasionally guilty of witty and even clever acts and we are rather disposed to acquit our young men of family and independent property generally speaking of any such misdemeanours  on a more mature consideration of the subject we have arrived at the conclusion that the harlequins of life are just ordinary men to be found in no particular walk or degree on whom a certain station or particular conjunction of circumstances confers the magic wand  and this brings us to a few words on the pantomime of public and political life which we shall say at once and then conclude—merely premising in this place that we decline any reference whatever to the columbine being in no wise satisfied of the nature of her connection with her particoloured lover and not feeling by any means clear that we should be justified in introducing her to the virtuous and respectable ladies who peruse our lucubrations  we take it that the commencement of a session of parliament is neither more nor less than the drawing up of the curtain for a grand comic pantomime and that his majesty’s most gracious speech on the opening thereof may be not inaptly compared to the clown’s opening speech of ‘here we are’  ‘my lords and gentlemen here we are’ appears to our mind at least to be a very good abstract of the point and meaning of the propitiatory address of the ministry  when we remember how frequently this speech is made immediately after the change too the parallel is quite perfect and still more singular  perhaps the cast of our political pantomime never was richer than at this day  we are particularly strong in clowns  at no former time we should say have we had such astonishing tumblers or performers so ready to go through the whole of their feats for the amusement of an admiring throng their extreme readiness to exhibit indeed has given rise to some illnatured reflections it having been objected that by exhibiting gratuitously through the country when the theatre is closed they reduce themselves to the level of mountebanks and thereby tend to degrade the respectability of the profession  certainly grimaldi never did this sort of thing and though brown king and gibson have gone to the surrey in vacation time and mr c j smith has ruralised at sadler’s wells we find no theatrical precedent for a general tumbling through the country except in the gentleman name unknown who threw summersets on behalf of the late mr richardson and who is no authority either because he had never been on the regular boards  but laying aside this question which after all is a mere matter of taste we may reflect with pride and gratification of heart on the proficiency of our clowns as exhibited in the season  night after night will they twist and tumble about till two three and four o’clock in the morning playing the strangest antics and giving each other the funniest slaps on the face that can possibly be imagined without evincing the smallest tokens of fatigue  the strange noises the confusion the shouting and roaring amid which all this is done too would put to shame the most turbulent sixpenny gallery that ever yelled through a boxingnight  it is especially curious to behold one of these clowns compelled to go through the most surprising contortions by the irresistible influence of the wand of office which his leader or harlequin holds above his head acted upon by this wonderful charm he will become perfectly motionless moving neither hand foot nor finger and will even lose the faculty of speech at an instant’s notice or on the other hand he will become all life and animation if required pouring forth a torrent of words without sense or meaning throwing himself into the wildest and most fantastic contortions and even grovelling on the earth and licking up the dust these exhibitions are more curious than pleasing indeed they are rather disgusting than otherwise except to the admirers of such things with whom we confess we have no fellowfeeling  strange tricks—very strange tricks—are also performed by the harlequin who holds for the time being the magic wand which we have just mentioned the mere waving it before a man’s eyes will dispossess his brains of all the notions previously stored there and fill it with an entirely new set of ideas one gentle tap on the back will alter the colour of a man’s coat completely and there are some expert performers who having this wand held first on one side and then on the other will change from side to side turning their coats at every evolution with so much rapidity and dexterity that the quickest eye can scarcely detect their motions occasionally the genius who confers the wand wrests it from the hand of the temporary possessor and consigns it to some new performer on which occasions all the characters change sides and then the race and the hard knocks begin anew  we might have extended this chapter to a much greater length—we might have carried the comparison into the liberal professions—we might have shown as was in fact our original purpose that each is in itself a little pantomime with scenes and characters of its own complete but as we fear we have been quite lengthy enough already we shall leave this chapter just where it is  a gentleman not altogether unknown as a dramatic poet wrote thus a year or two ago—                  ‘all the world’s a stage     and all the men and women merely players’  and we tracking out his footsteps at the scarcelyworthmentioning little distance of a few millions of leagues behind venture to add by way of new reading that he meant a pantomime and that we are all actors in the pantomime of life    some particulars concerning a lion   we have a great respect for lions in the abstract  in common with most other people we have heard and read of many instances of their bravery and generosity  we have duly admired that heroic selfdenial and charming philanthropy which prompts them never to eat people except when they are hungry and we have been deeply impressed with a becoming sense of the politeness they are said to display towards unmarried ladies of a certain state  all natural histories teem with anecdotes illustrative of their excellent qualities and one old spellingbook in particular recounts a touching instance of an old lion of high moral dignity and stern principle who felt it his imperative duty to devour a young man who had contracted a habit of swearing as a striking example to the rising generation  all this is extremely pleasant to reflect upon and indeed says a very great deal in favour of lions as a mass  we are bound to state however that such individual lions as we have happened to fall in with have not put forth any very striking characteristics and have not acted up to the chivalrous character assigned them by their chroniclers  we never saw a lion in what is called his natural state certainly that is to say we have never met a lion out walking in a forest or crouching in his lair under a tropical sun waiting till his dinner should happen to come by hot from the baker’s  but we have seen some under the influence of captivity and the pressure of misfortune and we must say that they appeared to us very apathetic heavyheaded fellows  the lion at the zoological gardens for instance  he is all very well he has an undeniable mane and looks very fierce but lord bless us what of that  the lions of the fashionable world look just as ferocious and are the most harmless creatures breathing  a boxlobby lion or a regentstreet animal will put on a most terrible aspect and roar fearfully if you affront him but he will never bite and if you offer to attack him manfully will fairly turn tail and sneak off  doubtless these creatures roam about sometimes in herds and if they meet any especially meeklooking and peaceablydisposed fellow will endeavour to frighten him but the faintest show of a vigorous resistance is sufficient to scare them even then  these are pleasant characteristics whereas we make it matter of distinct charge against the zoological lion and his brethren at the fairs that they are sleepy dreamy sluggish quadrupeds  we do not remember to have ever seen one of them perfectly awake except at feedingtime  in every respect we uphold the biped lions against their fourfooted namesakes and we boldly challenge controversy upon the subject  with these opinions it may be easily imagined that our curiosity and interest were very much excited the other day when a lady of our acquaintance called on us and resolutely declined to accept our refusal of her invitation to an evening party ‘for’ said she ‘i have got a lion coming’  we at once retracted our plea of a prior engagement and became as anxious to go as we had previously been to stay away  we went early and posted ourselves in an eligible part of the drawingroom from whence we could hope to obtain a full view of the interesting animal  two or three hours passed the quadrilles began the room filled but no lion appeared  the lady of the house became inconsolable—for it is one of the peculiar privileges of these lions to make solemn appointments and never keep them—when all of a sudden there came a tremendous double rap at the streetdoor and the master of the house after gliding out unobserved as he flattered himself to peep over the banisters came into the room rubbing his hands together with great glee and cried out in a very important voice ‘my dear mr—naming the lion has this moment arrived’  upon this all eyes were turned towards the door and we observed several young ladies who had been laughing and conversing previously with great gaiety and good humour grow extremely quiet and sentimental while some young gentlemen who had been cutting great figures in the facetious and smalltalk way suddenly sank very obviously in the estimation of the company and were looked upon with great coldness and indifference  even the young man who had been ordered from the music shop to play the pianoforte was visibly affected and struck several false notes in the excess of his excitement  all this time there was a great talking outside more than once accompanied by a loud laugh and a cry of ‘oh capital excellent’ from which we inferred that the lion was jocose and that these exclamations were occasioned by the transports of his keeper and our host  nor were we deceived for when the lion at last appeared we overheard his keeper who was a little prim man whisper to several gentlemen of his acquaintance with uplifted hands and every expression of halfsuppressed admiration that—naming the lion again was in such cue tonight  the lion was a literary one  of course there were a vast number of people present who had admired his roarings and were anxious to be introduced to him and very pleasant it was to see them brought up for the purpose and to observe the patient dignity with which he received all their patting and caressing  this brought forcibly to our mind what we had so often witnessed at country fairs where the other lions are compelled to go through as many forms of courtesy as they chance to be acquainted with just as often as admiring parties happen to drop in upon them  while the lion was exhibiting in this way his keeper was not idle for he mingled among the crowd and spread his praises most industriously to one gentleman he whispered some very choice thing that the noble animal had said in the very act of coming upstairs which of course rendered the mental effort still more astonishing to another he murmured a hasty account of a grand dinner that had taken place the day before where twentyseven gentlemen had got up all at once to demand an extra cheer for the lion and to the ladies he made sundry promises of interceding to procure the majestic brute’s signmanual for their albums then there were little private consultations in different corners relative to the personal appearance and stature of the lion whether he was shorter than they had expected to see him or taller or thinner or fatter or younger or older whether he was like his portrait or unlike it and whether the particular shade of his eyes was black or blue or hazel or green or yellow or mixture  at all these consultations the keeper assisted and in short the lion was the sole and single subject of discussion till they sat him down to whist and then the people relapsed into their old topics of conversation—themselves and each other  we must confess that we looked forward with no slight impatience to the announcement of supper for if you wish to see a tame lion under particularly favourable circumstances feedingtime is the period of all others to pitch upon  we were therefore very much delighted to observe a sensation among the guests which we well knew how to interpret and immediately afterwards to behold the lion escorting the lady of the house downstairs  we offered our arm to an elderly female of our acquaintance who—dear old soul—is the very best person that ever lived to lead down to any meal for be the room ever so small or the party ever so large she is sure by some intuitive perception of the eligible to push and pull herself and conductor close to the best dishes on the table—we say we offered our arm to this elderly female and descending the stairs shortly after the lion were fortunate enough to obtain a seat nearly opposite him  of course the keeper was there already  he had planted himself at precisely that distance from his charge which afforded him a decent pretext for raising his voice when he addressed him to so loud a key as could not fail to attract the attention of the whole company and immediately began to apply himself seriously to the task of bringing the lion out and putting him through the whole of his manoeuvres  such flashes of wit as he elicited from the lion  first of all they began to make puns upon a saltcellar and then upon the breast of a fowl and then upon the trifle but the best jokes of all were decidedly on the lobster salad upon which latter subject the lion came out most vigorously and in the opinion of the most competent authorities quite outshone himself  this is a very excellent mode of shining in society and is founded we humbly conceive upon the classic model of the dialogues between mr punch and his friend the proprietor wherein the latter takes all the uphill work and is content to pioneer to the jokes and repartees of mr p himself who never fails to gain great credit and excite much laughter thereby  whatever it be founded on however we recommend it to all lions present and to come for in this instance it succeeded to admiration and perfectly dazzled the whole body of hearers  when the saltcellar and the fowl’s breast and the trifle and the lobster salad were all exhausted and could not afford standingroom for another solitary witticism the keeper performed that very dangerous feat which is still done with some of the caravan lions although in one instance it terminated fatally of putting his head in the animal’s mouth and placing himself entirely at its mercy  boswell frequently presents a melancholy instance of the lamentable results of this achievement and other keepers and jackals have been terribly lacerated for their daring  it is due to our lion to state that he condescended to be trifled with in the most gentle manner and finally went home with the showman in a hack cab perfectly peaceable but slightly fuddled  being in a contemplative mood we were led to make some reflections upon the character and conduct of this genus of lions as we walked homewards and we were not long in arriving at the conclusion that our former impression in their favour was very much strengthened and confirmed by what we had recently seen  while the other lions receive company and compliments in a sullen moody not to say snarling manner these appear flattered by the attentions that are paid them while those conceal themselves to the utmost of their power from the vulgar gaze these court the popular eye and unlike their brethren whom nothing short of compulsion will move to exertion are ever ready to display their acquirements to the wondering throng  we have known bears of undoubted ability who when the expectations of a large audience have been wound up to the utmost pitch have peremptorily refused to dance welltaught monkeys who have unaccountably objected to exhibit on the slack wire and elephants of unquestioned genius who have suddenly declined to turn the barrelorgan but we never once knew or heard of a biped lion literary or otherwise—and we state it as a fact which is highly creditable to the whole species—who occasion offering did not seize with avidity on any opportunity which was afforded him of performing to his heart’s content on the first violin    mr robert bolton the ‘gentleman connected with the press’   in the parlour of the green dragon a publichouse in the immediate neighbourhood of westminster bridge everybody talks politics every evening the great political authority being mr robert bolton an individual who defines himself as ‘a gentleman connected with the press’ which is a definition of peculiar indefiniteness  mr robert bolton’s regular circle of admirers and listeners are an undertaker a greengrocer a hairdresser a baker a large stomach surmounted by a man’s head and placed on the top of two particularly short legs and a thin man in black name profession and pursuit unknown who always sits in the same position always displays the same long vacant face and never opens his lips surrounded as he is by most enthusiastic conversation except to puff forth a volume of tobacco smoke or give vent to a very snappy loud and shrill hem  the conversation sometimes turns upon literature mr bolton being a literary character and always upon such news of the day as is exclusively possessed by that talented individual  i found myself of course accidentally in the green dragon the other evening and being somewhat amused by the following conversation preserved it  ‘can you lend me a tenpound note till christmas’ inquired the hairdresser of the stomach  ‘where’s your security mr clip’  ‘my stock in trade—there’s enough of it i’m thinking mr thicknesse some fifty wigs two poles halfadozen head blocks and a dead bruin’  ‘no i won’t then’ growled out thicknesse  ‘i lends nothing on the security of the whigs or the poles either  as for whigs they’re cheats as for the poles they’ve got no cash  i never have nothing to do with blockheads unless i can’t awoid it ironically and a dead bear’s about as much use to me as i could be to a dead bear’  ‘well then’ urged the other ‘there’s a book as belonged to pope byron’s poems valued at forty pounds because it’s got pope’s identical scratch on the back what do you think of that for security’  ‘well to be sure’ cried the baker  ‘but how d’ye mean mr clip’  ‘mean why that it’s got the hottergruff of pope      “steal not this book for fear of hangman’s rope     for it belongs to alexander pope”  all that’s written on the inside of the binding of the book so as my son says we’re bound to believe it’  ‘well sir’ observed the undertaker deferentially and in a halfwhisper leaning over the table and knocking over the hairdresser’s grog as he spoke ‘that argument’s very easy upset’  ‘perhaps sir’ said clip a little flurried ‘you’ll pay for the first upset afore you thinks of another’  ‘now’ said the undertaker bowing amicably to the hairdresser ‘i think i says i think—you’ll excuse me mr clip i think you see that won’t go down with the present company—unfortunately my master had the honour of making the coffin of that ere lord’s housemaid not no more nor twenty year ago  don’t think i’m proud on it gentlemen others might be but i hate rank of any sort  i’ve no more respect for a lord’s footman than i have for any respectable tradesman in this room  i may say no more nor i have for mr clip bowing  therefore that ere lord must have been born long after pope died  and it’s a logical interference to defer that they neither of them lived at the same time so what i mean is this here that pope never had no book never seed felt never smelt no book triumphantly as belonged to that ere lord and gentlemen when i consider how patiently you have ’eared the ideas what i have expressed i feel bound as the best way to reward you for the kindness you have exhibited to sit down without saying anything more—partickler as i perceive a worthier visitor nor myself is just entered  i am not in the habit of paying compliments gentlemen when i do therefore i hope i strikes with double force’  ‘ah mr murgatroyd what’s all this about striking with double force’ said the object of the above remark as he entered  ‘i never excuse a man’s getting into a rage during winter even when he’s seated so close to the fire as you are  it is very injudicious to put yourself into such a perspiration  what is the cause of this extreme physical and mental excitement sir’  such was the very philosophical address of mr robert bolton a shorthandwriter as he termed himself—a bit of equivoque passing current among his fraternity which must give the uninitiated a vast idea of the establishment of the ministerial organ while to the initiated it signifies that no one paper can lay claim to the enjoyment of their services  mr bolton was a young man with a somewhat sickly and very dissipated expression of countenance  his habiliments were composed of an exquisite union of gentility slovenliness assumption simplicity newness and old age  half of him was dressed for the winter the other half for the summer  his hat was of the newest cut the d’orsay his trousers had been white but the inroads of mud and ink etc had given them a piebald appearance round his throat he wore a very high black cravat of the most tyrannical stiffness while his tout ensemble was hidden beneath the enormous folds of an old brown poodlecollared greatcoat which was closely buttoned up to the aforesaid cravat  his fingers peeped through the ends of his black kid gloves and two of the toes of each foot took a similar view of society through the extremities of his highlows  sacred to the bare walls of his garret be the mysteries of his interior dress  he was a short spare man of a somewhat inferior deportment  everybody seemed influenced by his entry into the room and his salutation of each member partook of the patronizing  the hairdresser made way for him between himself and the stomach  a minute afterwards he had taken possession of his pint and pipe  a pause in the conversation took place  everybody was waiting anxious for his first observation  ‘horrid murder in westminster this morning’ observed mr bolton  everybody changed their positions  all eyes were fixed upon the man of paragraphs  ‘a baker murdered his son by boiling him in a copper’ said mr bolton  ‘good heavens’ exclaimed everybody in simultaneous horror  ‘boiled him gentlemen’ added mr bolton with the most effective emphasis ‘boiled him’  ‘and the particulars mr b’ inquired the hairdresser ‘the particulars’  mr bolton took a very long draught of porter and some two or three dozen whiffs of tobacco doubtless to instil into the commercial capacities of the company the superiority of a gentlemen connected with the press and then said—  ‘the man was a baker gentlemen’  every one looked at the baker present who stared at bolton  ‘his victim being his son also was necessarily the son of a baker  the wretched murderer had a wife whom he was frequently in the habit while in an intoxicated state of kicking pummelling flinging mugs at knocking down and halfkilling while in bed by inserting in her mouth a considerable portion of a sheet or blanket’  the speaker took another draught everybody looked at everybody else and exclaimed ‘horrid’  ‘it appears in evidence gentlemen’ continued mr bolton ‘that on the evening of yesterday sawyer the baker came home in a reprehensible state of beer  mrs s connubially considerate carried him in that condition upstairs into his chamber and consigned him to their mutual couch  in a minute or two she lay sleeping beside the man whom the morrow’s dawn beheld a murderer’  entire silence informed the reporter that his picture had attained the awful effect he desired  ‘the son came home about an hour afterwards opened the door and went up to bed  scarcely gentlemen conceive his feelings of alarm scarcely had he taken off his indescribables when shrieks to his experienced ear maternal shrieks scared the silence of surrounding night  he put his indescribables on again and ran downstairs  he opened the door of the parental bedchamber  his father was dancing upon his mother  what must have been his feelings  in the agony of the minute he rushed at his male parent as he was about to plunge a knife into the side of his female the mother shrieked  the father caught the son who had wrested the knife from the paternal grasp up in his arms carried him downstairs shoved him into a copper of boiling water among some linen closed the lid and jumped upon the top of it in which position he was found with a ferocious countenance by the mother who arrived in the melancholy washhouse just as he had so settled himself  ‘“where’s my boy” shrieked the mother  ‘“in that copper boiling” coolly replied the benign father  ‘struck by the awful intelligence the mother rushed from the house and alarmed the neighbourhood  the police entered a minute afterwards  the father having bolted the washhouse door had bolted himself  they dragged the lifeless body of the boiled baker from the cauldron and with a promptitude commendable in men of their station they immediately carried it to the stationhouse  subsequently the baker was apprehended while seated on the top of a lamppost in parliament street lighting his pipe’  the whole horrible ideality of the mysteries of udolpho condensed into the pithy effect of a tenline paragraph could not possibly have so affected the narrator’s auditory  silence the purest and most noble of all kinds of applause bore ample testimony to the barbarity of the baker as well as to bolton’s knack of narration and it was only broken after some minutes had elapsed by interjectional expressions of the intense indignation of every man present  the baker wondered how a british baker could so disgrace himself and the highly honourable calling to which he belonged and the others indulged in a variety of wonderments connected with the subject among which not the least wonderment was that which was awakened by the genius and information of mr robert bolton who after a glowing eulogium on himself and his unspeakable influence with the daily press was proceeding with a most solemn countenance to hear the pros and cons of the pope autograph question when i took up my hat and left    familiar epistle from a parent to a child aged two years and two months   my child  to recount with what trouble i have brought you up—with what an anxious eye i have regarded your progress—how late and how often i have sat up at night working for you—and how many thousand letters i have received from and written to your various relations and friends many of whom have been of a querulous and irritable turn—to dwell on the anxiety and tenderness with which i have as far as i possessed the power inspected and chosen your food rejecting the indigestible and heavy matter which some injudicious but wellmeaning old ladies would have had you swallow and retaining only those light and pleasant articles which i deemed calculated to keep you free from all gross humours and to render you an agreeable child and one who might be popular with society in general—to dilate on the steadiness with which i have prevented your annoying any company by talking politics—always assuring you that you would thank me for it yourself some day when you grew older—to expatiate in short upon my own assiduity as a parent is beside my present purpose though i cannot but contemplate your fair appearance—your robust health and unimpeded circulation which i take to be the great secret of your good looks without the liveliest satisfaction and delight  it is a trite observation and one which young as you are i have no doubt you have often heard repeated that we have fallen upon strange times and live in days of constant shiftings and changes  i had a melancholy instance of this only a week or two since  i was returning from manchester to london by the mail train when i suddenly fell into another train—a mixed train—of reflection occasioned by the dejected and disconsolate demeanour of the postoffice guard  we were stopping at some station where they take in water when he dismounted slowly from the little box in which he sits in ghastly mockery of his old condition with pistol and blunderbuss beside him ready to shoot the first highwayman or railwayman who shall attempt to stop the horses which now travel when they travel at all inside and in a portable stable invented for the purpose—he dismounted i say slowly and sadly from his post and looking mournfully about him as if in dismal recollection of the old roadside publichouse the blazing fire—the glass of foaming ale—the buxom handmaid and admiring hangerson of taproom and stable all honoured by his notice and retiring a little apart stood leaning against a signalpost surveying the engine with a look of combined affliction and disgust which no words can describe  his scarlet coat and golden lace were tarnished with ignoble smoke flakes of soot had fallen on his bright green shawl—his pride in days of yore—the steam condensed in the tunnel from which we had just emerged shone upon his hat like rain  his eye betokened that he was thinking of the coachman and as it wandered to his own seat and his own fastfading garb it was plain to see that he felt his office and himself had alike no business there and were nothing but an elaborate practical joke  as we whirled away i was led insensibly into an anticipation of those days to come when mailcoach guards shall no longer be judges of horseflesh—when a mailcoach guard shall never even have seen a horse—when stations shall have superseded stables and corn shall have given place to coke  ‘in those dawning times’ thought i ‘exhibitionrooms shall teem with portraits of her majesty’s favourite engine with boilers after nature by future landseers  some amburgh yet unborn shall break wild horses by his magic power and in the dress of a mailcoach guard exhibit his trained animals in a mock mailcoach  then shall wondering crowds observe how that with the exception of his whip it is all his eye and crowned heads shall see them fed on oats and stand alone unmoved and undismayed while counters flee affrighted when the coursers neigh’  such my child were the reflections from which i was only awakened then as i am now by the necessity of attending to matters of present though minor importance  i offer no apology to you for the digression for it brings me very naturally to the subject of change which is the very subject of which i desire to treat  in fact my child you have changed hands  henceforth i resign you to the guardianship and protection of one of my most intimate and valued friends mr ainsworth with whom and with you my best wishes and warmest feelings will ever remain  i reap no gain or profit by parting from you nor will any conveyance of your property be required for in this respect you have always been literally ‘bentley’s’ miscellany and never mine  unlike the driver of the old manchester mail i regard this altered state of things with feelings of unmingled pleasure and satisfaction  unlike the guard of the new manchester mail your guard is at home in his new place and has roystering highwaymen and gallant desperadoes ever within call  and if i might compare you my child to an engine not a tory engine nor a whig engine but a brisk and rapid locomotive your friends and patrons to passengers and he who now stands towards you in loco parentis as the skilful engineer and supervisor of the whole i would humbly crave leave to postpone the departure of the train on its new and auspicious course for one brief instant while with hat in hand i approach side by side with the friend who travelled with me on the old road and presume to solicit favour and kindness in behalf of him and his new charge both for their sakes and that of the old coachman
