chapter i monsieur the secretary   it was spring at bellecourthe spring of 1789 a short three months before the fall of the bastille came to give the nobles pause and make them realise that these new philosophies which so long they have derided were by no means the idle vapours they had deemed them  by the brook plashing its glittering course through the park of bellecour wandered la boulaye his long lean figure clad with a sombreness that was out of harmony in that sunlit vernal landscape but the sadhued coat belied that morning a heart that sang within his breast as joyously as any linnet of the woods through which he strayed that he was garbed in black was but the outward indication of his clerkly office for he was secretary to the most noble the marquis de fresnoy de bellecour and so clothed in the livery of the ink by which he lived his face was pale and lean and thoughtful but within his great intelligent eyes there shone a light of newborn happiness under his arm he carried a volume of the new philosophies which rousseau had lately given to the world and which was contributing so vastly to the mighty change that was impending but within his soul there dwelt in that hour no such musty subject as the metaphysical dreams of old rousseau his mood inclined little to the discourses upon the origin of inequality which his elbow hugged to his side rather was it a mood of song and joy and things of light and his mind was running on a string of rhymes which mentally he offered up to his divinity a highborn lady was she daughter to his lordly employer the most noble marquis of bellecour and he a secretary a clerk aye but a clerk with a great soul a secretary with a great belief in the things to come which in that musty tome beneath his arm were dimly prophesied  and as he roamed beside the brook his feet treading the elastic velvety turf and crushing heedlessly late primrose and stray violet his blood quickened by the soft spring breeze fragrant with hawthorn and the smell of the moist brown earth la boulayes happiness gathered strength from the joy that on that day of spring seemed to invest all nature an oldworld song stole from his firm lipsat first timidly like a thing abashed in new surroundings then in bolder tones that echoed faintly through the trees    si le roi mavait donne    paris sa grande ville    et quiil me fallut quitter    lamour de ma mie    je dirais au roi louis    reprenez votre paris    jaime mieux ma mie o gai    jaime mieux ma mie  how mercurial a thing is a lovers heart here was one whose habits were of solemnity and gloomy thought turned so joyous that he could sing aloud alone in the midst of sunny nature for no better reason than that suzanne de bellecour had yesternight smiled asfor some two minutes by the clockshe had stood speaking with him  presumptuous that i am said he to the rivulet to contradict himself the next moment but no the times are changing soon we shall be equals all as the good god made us and  he paused and smiled pensively and as again the memory of her yesternights kindness rose before him his smile broadened it became a laugh that went ringing down the glade scaring a noisy thrush into silence and sending it flying in affright across the scintillant waters of the brook then that hearty laugh broke sharply off as behind him the sweetest voice in all the world demanded the reason of this madsounding mirth  la boulayes breath seemed in that instant to forsake him and he grew paler than nature and the writers desk had fashioned him awkwardly he turned and made her a deep bow  mademoiselle youyou see that you surprised me he faltered like a fool for how should he whose only comrades had been books have learnt to bear himself in the company of a woman particularly when she belonged to the ranks of those whomdespite rousseau and his other dear philosophershe had been for years in the habit of accounting his betters  why then i am glad monsieur that i surprised you in so gay a humourfor my faith it is a rare enough thing  true lady said he foolishly yet politely agreeing with her it is a rare thing and he sighedhelas  at that the laughter leapt from her young lips and turned him hot and cold as he stood awkwardly before her  i see that we shall have you sad at the thought of how rare is happiness you that but a moment back wereor so it seemedso joyous or is it that my coming has overcast the sky of your good humour she demanded archly  he blushed like a schoolgirl and strenuously protested that it was not so in his haste he fell headlong into the sin of hastinessas was but naturaland said perhaps too much  your coming mademoiselle he echoed nay but even had i been sad your coming must have dispelled my melancholy as the coming of the sun dispels the mist upon the mountains  a poet she mocked him playfully with a toss of black curls and a distracting glance of eyes blue as the heavens above them a poet monsieur and i never suspected it for all that i held you a great scholar my father says you are  are we not all poets at some season of our lives quoth he for growing accustomed to her presenceravished by it indeedhis courage was returning fast and urging him beyond the limits of discretion  and in what season may this rhyming fancy touch us she asked enlighten me monsieur  he smiled responsive to her merry mood and his courage ever swelling under the suasion of it he answered her in a fearless daring fashion that was oddly unlike his wont but then he was that day a man transformed  it comes mademoiselle upon some spring morning such as thisfor is not spring the mating season and have not poets sung of it inspired and conquered by it it comes in the april of life when in our hearts we bear the first fragrant bud of what shall anon blossom into a glorious summer bloom red as is loves livery and perfumed beyond all else that god has set on earth for mans delight and thankfulness  the intensity with which he spoke and the essence of the speech itself left her a moment dumb with wonder and with an incomprehensible consternation born of some intuition not yet understood  and so monsieur the secretary said she at last a nervous laugh quivering in her first words from all this wondrous verbiage i am to take it that you love  aye that i love dear lady he cried his eyes so intent upon her that her glance grew timid and fell before them and then a second later she could have screamed aloud in apprehension for the book of jean jacques rousseau lay tumbled in the grass where he had flung it even as he flung himself upon his knees before her you may take it indeed that i lovethat i love you mademoiselle  the audacious words being spoken his courage oozed away and anticlimax followed he paled and trembled yet he knelt on until she should bid him rise and furtively he watched her face he saw it darken he saw the brows knit he noted the quickening breath and in all these signs he read his doom before she uttered it  monsieur monsieur she answered him and sad was her tone to what lengths do you urge this springtime folly have you forgotten so your stationyes and minethat because i talk with you and laugh with you and am kind to you you must presume to speak to me in this fashion what answer shall i make you monsieurfor i am not so cruel that i can answer you as you deserve  an odd thing indeed was la boulayes courage an instant ago he had felt a very coward and had quivered appalled by the audacity of his own words now that she assailed him thus and taxed him with that same audacity the blood of anger rushed to his faceanger of the quality that has its source in shame in a second he was on his feet before her towering to the full of his lean height the words came from him in a hot stream which for reckless passion by far outvied his erstwhile amatory address  my station he cried throwing wide his arms what fault lies in my station i am a secretary a scholar and so by academic right a gentleman nay mademoiselle never laugh do not mock me yet in what do you find me less a man than any of the vapid caperers that fill your fathers salon is not my shape as good are not my arms as strong my hands as deft my wits as keen and my soul as true aye he pursued with another wild wave of his long arms my attributes have all these virtues and yet you scorn meyou scorn me because of my station so you say  how she had angered him all the pentup gall of years against the supercilia of the class from which she sprang surged in that moment to his lips he bethought him now of the thousand humiliations his proud spirit had suffered at their hands when he noted the disdain with which they addressed him speaking to himbecause he was compelled to carve his living with a quillas though he were less than mire it was not so much against her scorn of him that he voiced his bitter grievance but against the entire noblesse of france which denied him the right to carry a high head because he had not been born of madame la duchesse madame la marquise or madame la comtesse all the great thoughts of a wondrous transformation which had been sown in him by the revolutionary philosophers he had devoured with such appreciation welled up now and such scraps of that infinity of thought as could find utterance he cast before the woman who had scorned him for his station presumptuous he had accounted himselfbut only until she had found him so by that the presumption it seemed had been lifted from him and he held that what he had said to her of the love he bore her was no more than by virtue of his manhood he had the right to say  she drew back before him and shrank in some measure of fear for he looked very fierce moreover he had said things which professed him a revolutionist and the revolutionists whilst being a class which she had been taught to despise and scorn dealt she knew in a violence which it might be ill to excite  monsieur she faltered and with her hand she clutched at her ridinghabit of green velvet as if preparing to depart you are not yourself i am beyond measure desolated that you should have so spoken to me we have been good friends m la boulaye let us forget this scene shall we her tones grew seductively conciliatory  la boulaye half turned from her and his smouldering eye fell upon the discourses lying on the grass he stooped and picked up the volume the act might have seemed symbolical for a moment he had cast aside his creed to woo a woman and now that she had denied him he returned to rousseau and gathered up the tome almost in penitence at his momentary defection  i am quite myself mademoiselle he answered quietly his cheeks were flushed but beyond that his excitement seemed to have withered it is you who yesternight for one brief moment and again todaywere not yourself and to that you owe it that i have spoken to you as i have done  between these two it would seem as the humour of the one waned that of the other waxed her glance kindled anew at his last words  i she echoed i was not myself what are you saying monsieur the secretary  last night and again just now you were so kind youyou smiled so sweetly  mon dieu she exclaimed angrily interrupting him see what you are for all your highsounding vaunts of yourself and your attributes a woman may not smile upon you may not say one kind word to you but you must imagine you have made a conquest ma foi you and yours do not deserve to be treated as anything but vassals when we show you a kindness see how you abuse it we extend to you our little finger and you instantly lay claim to the whole arm because last night i permitted myself to exchange a jest with you because i chance to be kind to you again today you repay me with insults  stop he cried rousing himself once more that is too much to say mademoiselle to tell a woman that you love her is never to insult her to be loved is never to be slighted upon the meanest of his creatures it is enjoined to love the same god whom the king loves and there is no insult to god in professing love for him would you make a woman more than that  monsieur you put questions i have no mind to answer you suggest a discussion i have no inclination to pursue for you and me let it suffice that i account myself affronted by your words your tone and your manner you drive me to say these things by your insistence you compel me to be harsh we will end this matter here and now monsieur and i will ask you to understand that i never wish it reopened else shall i be forced to seek protection at the hands of my father or my brother  you may seek it now suzanne quoth a voice from the thicket at her back a voice which came to startle both of them though in different ways before they had recovered from their surprise the marquis de bellecour stood before them he was a tall man of some fifty years of age but so powerful of frame and so scrupulous in dress that he might have conveyed an impression of more youth his face though handsome in a highbred way was puffed and of an unhealthy yellow but the eyes were as keen as the mouth was voluptuous and in his carefully dressed black hair there were few strands of grey  he came slowly forward and his lowering glance wandered from his daughter to his secretary in inquiry at last  well he demanded what is the matter  it is nothing monsieur his daughter answered him a trifling affair twixt m la boulaye and me with which i will not trouble you  it is not nothing my lord cried la boulaye his voice vibrating oddly it is that i love your daughter and that i have told her of it he was in a very daring mood that morning  the marquis glanced at him in dull amazement then a flush crept into his sallow cheeks and mounted to his brow an inarticulate grunt came from his thick lips  canaille he exclaimed through set teeth can you have presumed so far  he carried a ridingswitch and he seemed to grasp it now in a manner peculiarly menacing but la boulaye was nothing daunted lost he already accounted himself and on the strength of the logic that if a man must hang a sheep as well as a lamb may be the cause of it he took what chances the time afforded him to pile up his debt  there is neither insolence nor presumption in what i have done he answered giving back the marquis look for look and scowl for scowl you deem it so because i am the secretary to the marquis de bellecour and she is the daughter of that same marquis but these are no more than the fortuitous circumstances in which we chance to find ourselves that she is a woman must take rank before the fact that she is your daughter and that i am a man must take rank before the fact that i am your secretary not then as your secretary speaking to your daughter have i told this lady that i love her but as a man speaking to a woman to utter that should benay isthe right of every man to hear it should be honouring to every woman worthy of the name in a primitive condition  a thousand devils blazed the marquis unable longer to contain himself am i to have my ears offended by this braying miserable scum you shall be taught what is due to your betters  his whip cracked suddenly and the lash leapt serpentlike into the air to descend and coil itself about la boulayes head and face a cry broke from the young man as much of pain as of surprise and as the lash was drawn back he clapped his hands to his seared face but again he felt it cutting him now across the hand with which he had masked himself with a maddened roar he sprang upon his aggressor in height he was the equal of the marquis but in weight he seemed to be scarce more than the half of his opponents yet a nervous strength dwelt unsuspected in those lean arms and steely wrists  mademoiselle stood by looking on with parted lips and eyes that were intent and anxious she saw that figure spare and lithe as a greyhound leap suddenly upon her father and the next instant the whip was in the secretarys hands and he sprang back from the nobleman who stood white and quivering with rage and perhaps too with some dismay  that i do not break it across your back m le marquis said the young man as he snapped the whip on his knee you may thank your years with that he flung the two pieces wide into the sunlit waters of the brook but i will have satisfaction monsieur i will take payment for this and he pointed to the weal that disfigured his face  satisfaction roared the marquis hoarse in his passion would you demand satisfaction of me animal  no answered the young man with a wry smile your years again protect you but you have a son and if by tomorrow it should come to pass that you have a son no more you may account yourself through thisand again he pointed to the wealhis murderer  do you mean that you would seek to cross swords with the vicomte gasped the nobleman in an unbelief so great that it gained the ascendency over his anger  that is what i mean monsieur in practice he has often done so he shall do so for once in actual earnest  fool was the contemptuous answer more coldly delivered now for the marquis was getting himself in hand if you come near bellecour again if you are so much as found within the grounds of the park ill have you beaten to death by my grooms for your presumption keep you the memory of that promise in mind sir secretary and let it warn you to avoid bellecour as you would a plaguehouse come suzanne he said turning abruptly to his daughter enough of this delightful morning have we already wasted on this canaille  with that he offered her his wrist and so without so much as another glance at la boulaye she took her departure  the secretary remained where they had left him pale of facesaving the fortuitous crimson mark which the whip had cutand very sick at heart the heat of the moment being spent he had leisure to contemplate his plight a scorned lover a beaten man a dismissed secretary he looked sorrowfully upon his volume of the discourses and for the first time a doubt crossed his mind touching the wisdom of old jean jacques was there would there ever be any remedy for such a condition of things as now prevailed  already the trees had hidden the marquis and his daughter from la boulayes sight the young revolutionist felt weary and lonelydear god how lonely neither kith nor kin had he and of late all the interest of his lifesaving always that absorbed by jean jacqueshad lain in watching suzanne de bellecour and in loving her silently and distantly now that little crumb of comfort was to be his no more he was to go away from bellecour away from the sight of her for all time and he loved her loved her loved her  he tossed his arms to heaven with a great sigh that was a sob almost then he passed his hands over his face and as they came in contact with the swollen ridge that scored it love faded from his mind and vindictiveness came to fill its room  but for this he cried aloud i shall take paymentaye as there is a god  then turning and with the discourses held tightly to his side he moved slowly away following the course of the gleaming waters     chapter ii lords of life and death   one friend did la boulaye count in the village of bellecour this was old duhamel the schoolmaster an eccentric pedant and a fellowworshipper of the immortal jean jacques it was to him that la boulaye now repaired intent upon seeking counsel touching a future that wore that morning a singularly gloomy outlook  he found duhamels door open and he stepped across the threshold into the chief room of the house but there he paused and hesitated the chamber was crowded with people in holiday attire and the centre of attraction was a wellsetup peasant with a happy suntanned face whose golden locks were covered by a huge round hat decked with a score of gailycoloured ribbons  at sight of him la boulaye remembered that it was charlots weddingday popular amongst the women by virtue of his comeliness and respected by the men by virtue of his strength charlot tardivet was a general favourite of the countryside and here in the room of old duhamel the schoolmaster was half the village gathered to do him honour upon his wedding morn it was like duhamel who in fatherliness towards the villagers went near outrivalling m le cure to throw open his house for the assembling of charlots friends and la boulaye was touched by this fresh sign of kindliness from a man whose good heart he had not lacked occasion to observe and appreciate but it came to the secretary that there was no place for him in this happy assemblage his advent would probably but serve to cast a gloom upon them considering the conditions under which he came with the signs of violence upon his face to remind them of the lords of life and death who dwelt at the chateau up yonder and such a reminder must fall upon them as does the reminder of some overhanging evil clutch suddenly at our hearts in happy moments of forgetfulness to let them be happy that day to leave their feasts free of a deaths head la boulaye would have withdrawn had he not already been too late duhamel had espied him and the little wizened old man came hurrying forward his hornrimmed spectacles perched on the very end of his nose his keen little eyes beaming with delight and welcome  ah caron you are very choicely come he cried holding out both hands to la boulaye you shall embrace our happy hercules yonder and wish him joy of the wedded life he has the audacity to exploit then as he espied the crimson ridge across the secretarys countenance mon dieu he exclaimed what have you done to yourself caron  pish it is nothing answered la boulaye hurriedly and would have had the subject dismissed but that one of the onlooking peasants swore by the memory of some longdead saint that it was the cut of a whip duhamels eyes kindled and his parchmentlike skin was puckered into a hundred evil wrinkles  who did it caron he demanded  since you insist old master answered the secretary still endeavouring to make light of it learn that is the lord marquiss signature to his order of my dismissal from his service  the dog ejaculated the schoolmaster  sh let it be perhaps i braved him overmuch i will tell you of it when these good folks have gone do not let us cast a gloom over their happiness old master and now to embrace this good charlot  though inwardly burning with curiosity and boiling with indignation duhamel permitted himself to be guided by la boulaye and for the moment allowed the matter to rest la boulaye himself laughingly set aside the many questions with which they pressed him he drank the health of the brideelectwho was not yet of the partyand he pledged the happiness of the pair he embraced charlot and even went so far as to urge upon him out of his own scanty store a louis dor with which to buy marie a trinket in memory of him  then presently came one with the announcement that m le cure was waiting and in answer to that reminder that there was a ceremony to be gone through charlot and his friends flung out of the house in joyous confusion and went their way with laughter and jest to the little church of st ildefonse  we will follow presentlym la boulaye and icharlot duhamel had said as the sturdy bridegroom was departing we shall be there to shake madame by the hand and wish her joy of you  when at last they were alone in the schoolmasters room the old man turned to la boulaye the very embodiment of a note of interrogation the secretary told him all that had passed he reddened slightly when it came to speaking of his love for mlle de bellecour but he realised that if he would have guidance he must withhold nothing from his friend  duhamels face grew dark as the young man spoke and his eyes became sad and very thoughtful  alas he sighed when la boulaye had ended what shall i say to you my friend the time is not yet for such as weyou and ito speak of love for a daughter of the seigneurie it is coming i doubt it not all things have their climax and france is tending swiftly to the climax of her serfdom very soon we shall have the crisis this fire that is already smouldering will leap into a great blaze that shall lick the old regime as completely from the face of history as though it had never been a new condition of things will spring up of that i am convinced does not history afford us many instances and what is history but the repetition of events under similar circumstances with different peoples it will come in france and it will come soon for it is very direly needed  i know i know old master broke in la boulaye but how shall all this help me for all that i have the welfare of france at heart it weighs little with me at the moment by comparison with my own affairs what am i to do duhamel how am i to take payment for this and he pressed his finger to his seared cheek  wait said the old man impressively that is the moral you might have drawn from what i have said be patient i promise you your patience shall not be overtaxed today they say that you presume that you are not one of themalthough by my soul you have as good an air as any nobleman in france and he eyed the lean height of the secretary with a glance of such pride as a father might take in a wellgrown son  elegant of figure la boulaye was no less elegant in dress for all that from head to footsaving the silver buckles on his shoes and the unpretentious lace at throat and wristshe was dressed in the black that his office demanded his countenance too though cast in a mould of thoughtfulness that bordered on the melancholy bore a lofty stamp that might have passed for birth and breeding and this was enhanced by the careful dressing of his black unpowdered hair gathered into a club by a broad ribbon of black silk  but what shall waiting avail me cried the young man with some impatience what am i to do in the meantime  go to amiens said the other you have learning you have eloquence you have a presence and an excellent address for success no better attributes could be yours he approached the secretary and instinctively lowered his voice we have a little club therea sort of succursal to the jacobins we are numerous but we have no very shining member yet come with me and i will nominate you beginning thus i promise you that you shall presently become a man of prominence in picardy anon we may send you to paris to represent us in the statesgeneral then when the change comes who shall say to what heights it may not be yours to leap  i will think of it answered la boulaye cordially and not a doubt of it but that i will come i did not know that you had gone so far  sh you know now let that suffice it is not good to talk of these things just yet  but in the meantime la boulaye persisted what of this and again he pointed to his cheek  why let it heal boy  i promised the marquis that i would demand satisfaction of his son and i am tempted to do so and risk the consequences  i am afraid the consequences will be the only satisfaction that you will get in fact they will be anticipations rather than consequences for theyll never let you near the boy  i know not that he answered the lad is more generous than his sire and if i were to send him word that i have been affronted he might consent to meet me for the rest i could kill him blindfolded he added with a shrug  bloodthirsty animal rejoined duhamel unnatural tutor do you forget that you were the boys preceptor  with that duhamel carried the argument into new fields and showed la boulaye that to avenge upon the young vicomte the insults received at the hands of the old marquis was hardly a worthy method of taking vengeance at last he won him to his way and it was settled that on the morrow la boulaye should journey with him to amiens  but caron we are forgetting our friend charlot and his bride he broke off suddenly come boy the ceremony will be at an end by this  he took la boulaye by the arm and led him out and down the street to the open space opposite st ildefonse the weddingparty was streaming out through the door of the little church into the warm sunshine of that april morning in the churchyard they formed into a procession of happy beribboned and nosegayed men and womenthe young preceding the old following the bridal couple two by two they came and the air rang with their laughter and joyous chatter then another sound arose and if the secretary and the pedagogue could have guessed of what that beating of hoofs was to be the prelude they had scarce smiled so easily as they watched the approaching cortege  from a side street there now emerged a gaily apparelled cavalcade at its head rode the marquis de bellecour the vicomte and a halfdozen other gentlemen followed by perhaps a dozen lacqueys it was a hunting party that was making its way across the village to the open country beyond the bridal procession crossing their path caused them to draw rein and to wait until it should have passedwhich argued a very condescending humour for it would not have been out of keeping with their habits to have ridden headlong through it their presence cast a restraint upon the peasants the jests were silenced the laughter hushed and like a flight of pigeons under the eye of the hawk they scurried past the seigneurie and some of them prayed god that they might be suffered to pass indeed  bellecour eyed them in cold disdain until presently charlot and his bride were abreast of him then his eye seemed to take life and his sallow face to kindle into expression he leant lightly from the saddle  stay he commanded coldly and as they came to a halt daring not to disobey himapproach girl he added  charlots brows grew black he looked up at the marquis but if his glance was sullen and threatening it was also not free from fear marie obeyed with eyes downcast and a heightened colour if she conjectured at all why they had been stopped it was but to conclude that m le marquis was about to offer her some mark of appreciation uneasiness in her dear innocence she knew none  what is your name child inquired the marquis more gently  it was marie michelin monseigneur she made answer timidly but it has just been changed to marie tardivet  you have just been wed eh  we are on our way from church monseigneur  cest ca he murmured as if to himself and his eyes taking such stock of her as made charlot burn to tear him from his horse then in a kindly fatherly voice he added my felicitations marie may you be a happy wife and a happier mother  merci monseigneur she murmured with crimson cheeks whilst charlot breathed once more and from his heart gave thanks to heaven believing the interview at an end but he went too fast  do you know marie that you are a very comely child quoth the marquis in tones which made the bridegrooms blood run cold  some in that noble company nudged one another and one there was who burst into a loud guffaw  charlot has often told me so she laughed all unsuspicious  the marquis moved on his horse that he might bend lower with his forefinger he uptilted her chin and now as she met his glance thus at close quarters an unaccountable fear took possession of her and the colour died out of her plump cheeks  yes said bellecour with a smile this tardivet has good taste my congratulations to him we must find you a wedding gift little woman he continued more briskly it is an ancient and honoured custom that is falling somewhat into neglect go up to the chateau with blaise and jean there this good tardivet must curb his impatience until tomorrow  he turned in his saddle and beckoning the two servants he had named he bade marie to mount behind blaise  she drew back now her cheeks white as those of the dead with a wild terror in her eyes she turned to charlot who stood the very picture of anguish and impotent rage in the cortege where but a few moments ago all had been laughter a sob or two sounded now from some of the women  by my faith laughed bellecour contemptuously eyeing their dejection you have more the air of a burial than a bridal party  mercy my lord cried the agonised voice of charlot as distraught with grief he flung himself before the marquis  who seeks to harm you fool was bellecours halfderisive rejoinder  do not take her from me my lord the young man pleaded piteously  she shall return tomorrow booby answered the noble out of the way  but charlot was obstinate the marquis might be claiming no more than by ancient law was the due of the seigneur but charlot was by no means minded to submit in craven acquiescence to that brutal barbarous law  my lord he cried you shall not take her she is my wife she belongs to me you shall not take her  he caught hold of the marquiss bridle with such a strength and angry will that the horse was forced to back before him  insolent clod exclaimed bellecour with an angry laugh and a sharp downward blow of the butt of his whip upon the peasants head charlots hand grew nerveless and released the bridle as he sank stunned to the ground bellecour touched his horse with the spur and rode over the prostrate fellow with no more concern than had he been a dogs carcase blaise see to the girl he called over his shoulder adding to his company come messieurs we have wasted time enough  not a hand was raised to stay him not a word of protest uttered as the nobles rode by laughing and chatting among themselves with the utmost unconcern of the tragedy that was being enacted  like a flock of frightened sheep the peasants stood huddled together and watched them go in the same inactionfor all that not a little grief was blent with the terror on their countenancesthey stood by and allowed blaise to lift the halfswooning girl to the withers of his horse no reply had they to the coarse jest with which he and his fellowservant rode off but la boulaye who from the point where he and duhamel had halted had observed the whole scene from its inception turned now a livid face upon his companion  shall such things be he cried passionately merciful god are we men duhamel and do we permit such things to take place  the old pedagogue shrugged his shoulders in despair his face was heavily scored by sorrow  helas he sighed are they not masters of all that they may take the marquis goes no further than is by ancient law allowed his class it is the law needs altering my friend and then the men will alter meanwhile behold themlords of life and death  lords of hell are they blazed the young revolutionist that is where they belong whence they are come and whither they shall return poltroons he cried shaking his fist at the group of cowed peasants that surrounded the prostrate charlot sheep worthless clods the nobles do well to despise you for by my faith you invite nothing but contempt you that will suffer rape and murder to be done under your eyes and never do more than look scared encouragement upon your ravishers  blame not these poor wretches caron sighed the old man they dare not raise a hand  then pardieu here at least is one who does dare he cried furiously as from the breast pocket of his coat he drew a pistol  blaise with the girl across the withers of his horse was approaching them followed by jean  what would you do cried the old man fearfully setting a restraining hand upon la boulayes sleeve but caron shook himself free  this was all he answered and simultaneously he levelled his pistol and fired at blaise  shot through the head the servant collapsed forward then as the horse reared and started off at a gallop he toppled sideways and fell the girl went down with him and lay in the road whilst he was dragged along his head bumping horribly on the stones as faster and faster went the frightened horse  with a shout that may have been either anger or dismay jean reined in his horse and sat for a second hesitating whether to begin by recovering the girl or avenging his comrade but his doubts were solved for him by la boulaye who took a deliberate aim at him  begone cried the secretary unless you prefer to go by the road ive sent your fellow and being a discreet youth jean made off in silence by the street down which poor blaise had been dragged  carom cried duhamel in a frenzy of apprehension i tremble for you my son fly from bellecour at oncenow this very instant go to my friends at amiens they will  but caron had already left his side to repair to the spot where marie was lying the peasantry followed him though leisurely in their timid hesitation they were asking themselves whether even so remotely as by tending the girl they dared participate in the violence la boulaye had committed that a swift vengeance would be the seigneurs answer they were well assured and a great fear possessed them that in that vengeance those of the chateau might lack discrimination charlot was amongst them and on his feet but still too dazed to have a clear knowledge of the circumstances presently however his faculties awakening and taking in the situation he staggered forward and came lurching towards la boulaye who was assisting the frightened marie to rise with a great sob the girl flung herself into her husbands arms  charlot mon charlot she cried and added a moment later it was hethis brave gentlemanwho rescued me  monsieur said charlot i shall remember it to my dying day  he would have said more but the peasants stirred by fear now roused themselves and plucked at his coat  get you gone charlot get you gone quickly they advised him and if you are wise you will leave bellecour without delay it is not safe for you here  it is not safe for any of us exclaimed one i have no mind to be caught when the seigneur returns there will be a vengeance ah dieu what a vengeance  the warning acted magically there were hurried leavetakings and then like a parcel of scuttling rabbits they made for their burrows to hide from the huntsman that would not be long in coming and ere the last of them was out of sight there arose a stamping of hoofs and a chorus of angry voices down tine street thundered the marquiss cavalcade brought back by the servant who had escaped and who had ridden after them some anger there wasparticularly in the heart of the lord of bellecourbut greater than their anger was their excitement at the prospect of a manhunt with which the chase on which they had been originally bent made but a poor comparison  there he is monseigneur cried jean as he pointed to la boulaye and yonder are the girl and her husband  ah the secretary again eh laughed the nobleman grimly as he came nearer ma foi life must have grown wearisome to him secure the woman jean  caron stood before him pale in his impotent rage which was directed as much against the peasants who had fled as against the nobles who approached had these clods but stood there and defended themselves and their manhood with sticks and stones and such weapons as came to their hands they might have taken pride in being trampled beneath the hoofs of the seigneurie thus at least might they have proved themselves men but to fly thussome fifty of them from the approach of less than a scorewas to confess unworthiness of a better fate than that of which their seigneurs rendered themselves the instruments  himself he could do no more than the single shot in his pistol would allow that much however he would do and like him whose resources are reduced and yet who desires to spend the little that he has to best advantage he levelled the weapon boldly at the advancing marquis and pulled the trigger but bellecour was an old campaigner and by an old campaigners trick he saved himself at the last moment at sight of that levelled barrel he pulled his horse suddenly on to its haunches and received the charge in the animals belly with a shriek of pain the horse sought to recover its feet then tumbled forward hurling the marquis from the saddle la boulaye had an inspiration to fling himself upon the old roue and seek with his hands to kill him before they made an end of himself but ere he could move to execute his design a horseman was almost on top of him he received a stunning blow on the head the daylight faded in his eyes he felt a sensation of sinking and a reverberating darkness engulfed him     chapter iii the word of bellecour   when la boulaye recovered consciousness he was lying on his back in the middle of the courtyard of the chateau de bellecour from a great stone balcony above a little group of which mademoiselle de bellecour was the centre observed the scene about the captive who was being resuscitated that he might fittingly experience the seigneurs vengeance  she had returned from the mornings affair in the park with a conscience not altogether easy to have stood by whilst her father had struck caron and moreover to have done so without any sense of horror or even of regret was a matter in which she asked herself whether she had done well certainly la boulaye had presumed unpardonably in speaking to her as he had spoken and for his presumption it was fitting that he should be punished had she interfered she must have seemed to sympathise and thus the lesson might have suffered in salutariness and yet caron la boulaye was a man of most excellent exterior and when passion had roused him out of his restraint and awkwardness of most ardent and eloquent address the very sombreness thatbe it from his mournful garments or from a mind of thoughtful habitseemed to envelop him was but an additional note of poetry in a personality which struck her now as eminently poetical in the seclusion of her own chamber as she recalled the burning words and the fall of her fathers whip upon the young mans pale face she even permitted herself to sigh had he but been of her own station he had been such a man as she would have taken pride in being wooed by as it wasshe halted there and laughed disdainfully yet with never so faint a note of regret it was absurd she was mademoiselle de bellecour and he her fathers secretary educated if you willaye and beyond his stationbut a vassal withal and very humbly born yes it was absurd she told herself again the eagle may not mate with the sparrow  and when presently she had come from her chamber she had been greeted with the story of a rebellion in the village and an attempted assassination of her father the ringleader she was told had been brought to the chateau and he was even then in the courtyard and about to be hanged by the marquis curious to behold this unfortunate she had stepped out on to the balcony where already an idle group had formed inexpressible had been her shock upon seeing him that lay below his white face upturned to the heavens his eyes closed  is he dead she asked when presently she had overcome her feelings  not yet mademoiselle answered the graceful chevalier de jacquelin toying with his solitaire your father is bringing him to life that he may send him back to death  and then she heard her fathers voice behind her the marquis had stepped out on to the balcony to ascertain whether la boulaye had yet regained consciousness  he seems to be even now recovering said someone  ah you are there suzanne cried bellecour you see your friend the secretary there he has chosen to present himself in a new role today from being my servant it seems that he would constitute himself my murderer  however unfilial it might be she could not stifle a certain sympathy for this young man she imagined that his rebellion whatever shape it had assumed had been provoked by that weal upon his face and it seemed to her then that he had been less than a man had he not attempted to exact some reparation for the hurt the whip had inflicted at once upon his body and his soul  but what is it that he has done monsieur she asked seeking more than the scant information which so far she had received  enough at least to justify my hanging him answered bellecour grimly he sought to withstand my authority he incited the peasants of bellecour to withstand it he has killed blaise and he would have killed me but that i preferred to let him kill my horse  in what way did he seek to withstand your authority she persisted  he stared at her half surprised half angry  what doers the manner of it signify he asked impatiently is not the fact enough is it not enough that blaise is dead and that i have had a narrow escape at his hands  insolent hound that he is put in madame la marquisea fleshly lady monstrously coiffed if we allow such men as thus to live in france our days are numbered  they say that you are going to hang him said suzanne heedless of her mothers words and there was the faintest note of horror in her voice  they are mistaken i am not  you are not cried the marquise but what then do you intend to do  to keep my word madame he answered her i promised that canaille that if he ever came within the grounds of bellecour i would have him flogged to death that is what i propose  father gasped suzanne in horror a horror that was echoed by the other three or four ladies present but the marquise only laughed  he will be richly served she approved with a sage nod of her pumpkinlike headdressmost richly served  a great pity arose now in the heart of mademoiselle as her father went below that he might carry out his barbarous design she was deaf to the dainty trifles which the most elegant chevalier de jacquelin was murmuring into her ear she stood a tall queenly figure at the balconys parapet and watched the preparations that were being made  she heard her fathers harshlyvoiced commands she saw them literally tear the clothes from the unfortunate secretarys back and lash himnaked to the waistto the pump that stood by the horsetrough at the far end of the yard his body was now hidden from her sight but his head appeared surmounting the pillar of the pump his chin seeming to rest upon its summit and his face was towards her at his side stood a powerful knave armed with a stout leatherthonged whip  how many strokes monseigneur she heard the man inquire  how many echoed the marquise do i know how many it will take to make an end of him beat him to death man allons set about it  she saw the man uncoil his lash and step forward in that instant carons eyes were raised and they met hers across the intervening space he smiled a valedictory smile that seemed to make her heart stand still she and her mother were now the only women on the balcony the others had made haste to withdraw as soon as la boulaye had been pilloried the marquise remained because she seemed to find entertainment in the spectacle suzanne remained because horror rooted her to the spothorror and a great pity for this unfortunate who had looked so strong and brave that morning when he had had the audacity to tell her that he loved her  the lash sang through the air quivered hummed and cut with a sickening crackle into the young mans flesh  the hideous sound roused her she shuddered from head to foot and turning she put her hands to her face and rushed within followed by the marquises derisive laughter  mon dieu it is horrible horrible she cried as she sank into the nearest chair and clapped her hands to her ears but she could not shut it out still she heard the humming of the whip and the cruel sound of the falling blows mechanically she counted them unconsciously almost and at twenty she heard them cease was it over was he dead this poor unfortunate moved by a curiosity that was greater than her loathing she rose and went to the threshold of the balcony  is it ended she asked  ended echoed monsieur de jacquelin with a shrug it is scarce begun it seems the executioner is pausing for breath that is all the fellow has not uttered a sound he is as obstinate as a mule  as enduring as a spartan more generously put in the vicomte her brother look at him suzanne  almost involuntarily she obeyed and moved forward a step that she might behold him a face deathly pale she saw which in the sunshine glistened with the sweat of agony that bedewed it but the lips were tightly closed and the countenance grimly expressionless even as she looked she heard her father command the man to lay on anew then as before his eyes met hers but this time no smile did she see investing them  again the whip cracked and fell she drew back but his glance seemed to haunt her even when she no longer saw his face a sudden resolution moved her and in a frenzy of anger and compassion she flung out of the room a moment later she burst like a beautiful virago into the courtyard  stop she commanded shrilly causing both her father and the executioner to turn and the latter pausing in his hideous work but a glance from the marquis bade him resume and resume he did as though there had been no interruption  what is this demanded bellecour half amused half vexed whilst a sudden new light leapt to the eyes of la boulaye which but a moment back had been so full of agony  but mademoiselle never paused to answer her father seeing the executioner proceeding despite her call to cease she sprang upon him caught him by the arms and wrested the whip from hands that dared not resist her  did i not bid you stop she blazed her face white her eyes on fire and raising the whip she brought it down upon his head and shoulders not once but halfadozen times in quick succession until he fled howling to the other side of the horse trough for shelter it stings you does it she cried whilst the marquis from angered that at first he had been now burst into a laugh at her fury and at this turning of tables upon the executioner she made shift to pursue the fellow to his place of refuge but coming of a sudden upon the ghastly sight presented by la boulayes lacerated back she drew back in horror then mastering herselffor girl though she was her courage was of a high ordershe turned to her father  give this man to me monsieur she begged  to you he exclaimed what will you do with him  i will see that you are rid of him she promised what more can you desire you have tortured him enough  maybe but am i to blame that he dies so hard  she answered him with renewed insistence and unexpectedly she received an ally in m des cadouxan elderly gentleman who had been observing the flogging with disapproval and who had followed her into the courtyard  he is too brave a man to die like this bellecour put in the newcomer i doubt if he can survive the punishment he has already received yet i would ask you in the name of courage to give him the slender chance he may have  i promised him he should be flogged to death began the marquis when des cadoux and mademoiselle jointly interrupted him to renew their intercessions  but sangdieu the marquis protested you seem to forget that he has killed one of my servants  why then you should have hanged him out of hand not tortured him thus answered des cadoux shortly  for a moment it almost seemed as if the pair of them would have fallen aquarrelling their words grew more heated and then while they were still wrangling the executioner came forward to solve matters with the news that the secretary had expired to bellecour this proved a very welcome conclusion  most opportunely he laughed had the rascal lived another minute i think we had quarrelled cadoux he turned to the servant you are certain that it is so he asked  look monsieur said the fellow as he pointed with his whip to the pilloried figure of la boulaye the marquis looked and saw that the secretary had collapsed and hung limp in his bonds his head fallen back upon his shoulders and his eyes closed  with a shrug and a short laugh bellecour turned to his daughter  you may take the carrion if you want to but i think you can do no more than order it to be flung into a ditch and buried there  but she had no mind to be advised by him she had the young mans body cut down from the pump and she bade a couple of servants convey it to the house of master duhamel she for remembered that la boulaye and the old pedagogue were friends  an odd thing is a womans heart grumbled the marquis who begrudged la boulaye even his last act of mercy she may care never a fig for a man and yet if he has but told her that he loves her be he never so mean and she never so exalted he seems thereby to establish some measure of claim to her     chapter iv the disciples of rousseau   the marquis of bellecour would perhaps have philosophised less complacently had he known that the secretary was far from dead and that what the executioner had genuinely enough mistaken for death was no more than a passing swoon under ordinary circumstances he might not have been satisfied to have taken the fellows word he would himself have ascertained the truth of the statement by a close inspection of the victim but as we have seen the news came as so desirable a solution to the altercation that was waxing twixt himself and des cadoux that he was more than glad to avail himself of it  the discovery that caron lived was made while they were cutting him down from his pillory and just as the marquis was turning to go within a flutter of the eyelids and a gasp for breath announced the fact and the executioner was on the point of crying out his discovery when mademoiselles eyes flashed him a glance of warning and her voice whispered feverishly  hush there are ten louis for each of you if you but keep silent and carry him to master duhamel as i told you  the secretary opened his eyes but saw nothing and a low moan escaped him she shot a fearful glance at the retreating figure of her father whilst gillesthe executionerhissed sharply into his ear  mille diables be still man you are dead  thus did he escape and thus was he bornea limp agonised and bleeding mass to the house of duhamel the old schoolmaster received them with tears in his eyesnor were they altogether tears of sorrow for all that poor carons mangled condition grieved him sorely they were in a measure tears of thankfulness for duhamel had not dared hope to see the young man alive again  at the pedagogues door stood a berline and within his house there was a visitor this was a slight young man of medium stature who had not the appearance of more than twentyfive years of age for all that as a matter of fact he was just over thirty he was dressed with so scrupulous a neatness as to convey in spite of the dark colour of his garments an impression almost of foppishness there was an amplitude about his cravat an air of extreme care about the dressing of his wig and the powdering of it and a shining brightness about his buttons and the buckles of his shoes which seemed to proclaim the dandy just as the sombreness of the colour chosen seemed to deny it in his singularly pale countenance a similar contradiction was observable the weak kindly eyes almost appeared to give the lie to the astute prominence of his cheekbones the sensitiveness of the mouth seemed neutralised by the thinness of the lips whilst the oddly tiptilted nose made a mock of the austerity of the brow  he was perfectly at ease in his surroundings and as la boulaye was carried into the schoolmasters study and laid on a couch he came forward and peered curiously at the secretarys figure voicing an inquiry concerning him  it is the young man of whom i was telling you maximilien answered duhamel i give thanks to god that they have not killed him outright it is a mercy i had not expected from those wolves and one which on my soul i cannot understand  monsieur said gilles will understand it better perhaps if i tell you that the marquis believes him to be dead he was cut down for dead and when we discovered that he still lived it was mademoiselle who prevailed upon us to save him she is paying us to keep the secret but not a fortune would tempt me if i thought the seigneur were ever likely to hear of it he must be got away from bellecour indeed he must be got out of picardy at once monsieur and you must promise me that this shall be done or we will carry him back to the chateau and tell the marquis that he has suddenly revived i must insist monsieur for if ever it should transpire that he was not dead the seigneur would hang us  the strangers weak eyes seemed to kindle in anger and his lips curled until they exaggerated the already preposterous tilt of his nose  he would hang you eh said he ma foi duhamel we shall change all this very soon i promise you  god knows it needs changing growled duhamel it seems that it was only in the old testament that heaven interfered with human iniquity why it does not rain fire and brimstone on the chateau de bellecour passes the understanding of a good christian ill swear that in neither sodom nor gomorrah was villainy more rampant  the stranger plucked at his sleeve to remind him of the presence of the servants from the chateau duhamel turned to them  i will keep him concealed here until he is able to get about he assured them then i shall find him the means to leave the province  but gilles shook his head and his companion grunted an echo of his disapproval  that will not serve master he answered sullenly what if the seigneur should have word of his presence here it is overdangerous someone may see him no no either he leaves bellecour this very night and you swear that he shall or else we carry him back to the chateau  but how can i swear this cried duhamel impatiently  why easily enough put in the stranger let me take him in my berline i can leave him at amiens or at beauvais or any one of the convenient places that i pass or i can even carry him on to paris with me  you are very good maximilien answered the old man to which the other returned a gesture of deprecation  in this fashion then was the matter settled to the satisfaction of the seigneurs retainers and upon having received duhamels solemn promise that caron should be carried out of bellecour and for that matter out of picardy before the night was spent they withdrew  within the schoolmasters study he whom duhamel called maximilien strode to and fro his hands clasped behind his back his head bent his chin thrust forward denouncing the seigneurial system of whose atrocity he had received that evening instances enoughfor he had heard the whole story of la boulayes rebellion against the power of bellecour and the causes that had led to it  we will mend all this i promise you duhamel he was repeating but not until we have united to shield the weak from oppression to restrain the arrogant and to secure to each the possession of what belongs to him not until all men are free and started upon equal terms in the race of life not until we shall have set up rules of justice and of peace to which allrich and poor noble and simple alikeshall be obliged to conform thus only can we repair the evil done by the caprice of fortune which causes the one to be born into silk and the other into fustian we must subject the weak and the mighty alike to mutual duties collecting our forces into the supreme power to govern us all impartially by the same laws to protect alike all members of the community to repel our common foes and preserve us in neverending concord how many crimes murders wars miseries horrors shall thus be spared us duhamel and it will come it will come soon never fear  caron stirred on the couch where duhamel was tending him and raised his head to glance at the man who was voicing the doctrines that for years had dwelt in his heart  dear jean jacques he murmured  the stranger turned sharply and stepped to the young mans side  you have read the master he inquired with a sudden newborn interest in the secretary  read him cried carom forgetting for the moment the sore condition of his body in the delight of discovering one who was bound to him by such bonds of sympathy as old rousseau established  read him monsieur there is scarce a line in all his discourses that i do not know by heart and that i do not treasure vaguely hoping and praying that some day such a state as he dreamt of may find itself established and may sweep aside these corrupt tyrannical conditions  maximiliens eyes kindled  boy he answered impressively your hopes are on the eve of fruition your prayers are about to be heard yeseven though it should entail trampling the lilies of france into the very dust  who are you monsieur asked la boulaye eyeing this prophet with growing interest  robespierre is my name was the answer and to la boulaye it conveyed no enlightenment for the name of maximilien marie isidore de robespierre which within so very short a time was to mean so much in france as yet meant nothing  la boulaye inclined his head as if acknowledging an introduction then turned his attention to duhamel who was offering him a cup of wine he drank gratefully and the invigorating effects were almost instantaneous  now let us see to your hurts said the schoolmaster who had taken some linen and a pot of unguents from a cupboard la boulaye sat up and what time duhamel was busy dressing his lacerated back the young man talked with robespierre  you are going to paris you say monsieur  yes to the statesgeneral answered maximilien  as a deputy inquired caron with everheightening interest  as a deputy monsieur my friends of arras have elected me to the third estate of artois  dieu how i envy you exclaimed la boulaye to cry out a moment later in the pain to which duhamels wellintentioned operations were subjecting him i would it might be mine he added presently to take a hand in legislation and the mending of it for as it stands at present it is inferior far to the lawless anarchy of the aborigines among them at least the conditions are more normal they offer better balance between faculty and execution they are by far more propitious to happiness and order than is this broken wreck of civilisation that we call france it is to equality alone he continued warming to his subject that nature has attached the preservation of our social faculties and all legislation that aims at being efficient should be directed to the establishment of equality as it is the rich will always prefer their own fortune to that of the state whilst the poor will never lovenor can lovea condition of laws that leaves them in misery  robespierre eyed the young man in some surprise his delivery was impassioned and although in what he said there was perhaps nothing that was fresh to the lawyer of arras yet the manner in which he said it was impressive to a degree  but duhamel he cried to the schoolmaster you did not tell me this young patriot was an orator  nor am i monsieur smiled la boulaye i am but the mouthpiece of the great rousseau i have so assimilated his thoughts that they come from me as spontaneously as if they were my own and often i go so far as to delude myself into believing that they are  no better recommendation than this could he have had to the attention of robespierre who was himself much in the same case imbued with and inspired by those doctrines so ideal in theory but alas so difficult so impossible in practice for fully an hour they sat and talked and each improved in his liking of the other until at last bethinking him of the flight of time robespierre announced that he must start  you will take him to paris with you maximilien quoth the old pedagogue  ma foi yes and if with such gifts as nature appears to have given him and such cultivation of them as through the teachings of rousseau he has effected i do not make something of him why then i am unworthy of the confidence my good friends of arras repose in me  they made their adieux and the schoolmaster opening his door peered out the street was deserted save for de robespierres berline and his impatient postillion between them duhamel and maximilien assisted caron to the door of the carriage the moving subjected him to an excruciating agony but he caught his nether lip in his teeth and never allowed them to suspect it as they raised him into the berline however he toppled forward fainting duhamel hastened indoors for a cordial and brought also some pillows with which to promote the young mans comfort on the journey that was before himor rather to lessen the discomfort which the jolting was likely to occasion him  caron recovered before they started and with tears in his eyes he thanked old duhamel and voiced a hope that they might meet again ere long  then robespierre jumped nimbly into the berline the door closed the postillions whip cracked briskly and they set out upon a journey which to la boulaye was to be as the passing from one life to another     part ii the new rule       allons  marchons      quun sang impur      abreuve nos sillons         la marseillaise     chapter v the sheep turned wolves   there were roars of anger and screams of terror in the night and above the chateau de bellecour the inky blackness of the heavens was broken by a dull red glow which the distant wayfarer might have mistaken for the roseate tint of dawn were it possible for the dawn to restrict itself to so narrow an area  ever and anon a tongue of flame would lick up into the night towards that russet patch of sky betraying the cause of it and proclaiming that incendiaries were at work above the ominous din that told of the business afoot there came now and again the crack of a musket and dominating all other sounds was the sullen roar of the revolted peasants the risen serfs the rebellious vassals of the siegneur de bellecour  for time has sped and has much altered in the speeding four years have gone by since the night on which the lacerated caron la boulaye was smuggled out of bellecour in robespierres berline and in that four years much of the things that were prophesied have come to pass aye and much more besides that was undreamt of at the outset by the revolutionaries a gruesome engine that they facetiously called the national razorinvented and designed some years ago by one dr guillotinis but an item in the changes that have been yet an item that in its way has become a very factor it stands not overhigh yet the shadow of it has fallen athwart the whole length and breadth of france and in that shadow the tyrants have trembled shaken to the very souls of them by the rude hand of fear in that shadow the spurned and downtrodden children of the soil have taken heart of grace the bonds of servile cowardice that for centuries had trammelled them have been shaken off like cobwebs and they that were as sheep are now become the wolves that prey on those that preyed on them for generations  there is in the whole of france no corner so remote but that sooner or later this great upheaval has penetrated to it louis xvior louis capet as he is now more generally spoken ofhas been arraigned condemned and executed the aristocrats are in full emigratory flight across the frontiersthose that have not been rent by the vassals they had brought to bay the people they had outraged the lilies of france lie trampled under foot in the shambles they have made of that fair land whilst overhead the tricolourthat symbol of the new trinity liberty equality fraternityis flaunted in the breeze  a few of the more proud and obstinateso proud and obstinate as to find it a thing incredible that the order should indeed change and the old regime pass awaystill remain and by their vain endeavours to lord it in their castles provoke such scenes as that enacted at bellecour in february of 93 by the style of slaves or pluviose of the year one of the french republic as it shall presently come to be known in the annals of the revolution  bellecour the most arrogant of arrogants had stood firm and desperately contrived through all these months of revolution to maintain his dominion in his corner of picardy but even he was beginning to realise that the end was at hand and he made his preparations to emigrate too proud however to permit his emigration to savour of a flight he carried the leisureliness of his going to dangerous extremes and now on the eve of departure he must needs pause to give a fete at once of farewell and in honour of his daughters betrothal to the vicomte anatole dombreval this very betrothal at so unpropitious a season was partly no more than contrived by the marquis that he might mark his ignoring and his serene contempt of the upheaval and the new rule which it had brought  all that was left of the noblesse in picardy had flocked that day to the chateau de bellecour and the company there assembled numbered perhaps some thirty gallants and some twenty ladies a banquet there had been which in the main was a gloomy function for the kings death was too recent a matter to be utterly lost sight of later however as the generous supply of wine did its work and so far thawed the ice of apprehension that bound their souls as to dispose them to enjoy at least the present hour in forgetfulness there was a better humour in the air this developed and so far indeed did it go that in the evening a pavane was suggested and the musicians being found it was held in the great salon of the chateau  it was then that the first alarm had penetrated to their midst it had found them a recklessly merry crew good to behold in their silks and satins powder and patches gold lace and red heels moving with waving fans or hand on sword and laced beaver under elbow through the stately figures of the gavotte  scared whitefaced lackeys had brought the news dashing wildly in upon that courtly assembly the peasants had risen and were marching on bellecour  some of his sudden rage the marquis vented by striking the servants spokesman in the face  dare you bring me such a message he cried furiously  but my lord what are we to do gasped the frightened lackey  do fool returned bellecour why close the gates and bid them return home as they value their lives for if they give me trouble ill hang a round dozen of them  still was there that same big talk of hanging men still did it seem that the marquis of bellecour accounted himself the same lord of life and death that he and his forbears had been for generations but there were others who thought differently the music had ceased abruptly and a little knot of gentlemen now gathered about the host and urged him to take some measures of precaution in particular they desired to ensure the safety of the ladies who were being thrown into a great state of alarm so that of some of these were the screams that were heard in that night of terror bellecours temper was fast gaining and as he lost control of himself the inherent brutality of his character came uppermost  mesdames he cried rudely this screeching will profit us nothing even if we must die let us die becomingly not shrieking like butchered geese  a dozen men raised their voices angrily against him in defence of the women he had slighted but he waved them impatiently away  is this an hour in which to fall aquarrelling among ourselves he exclaimed or do you think it one in which a man can stop to choose his words sangdieu that screaming is a more serious matter than at first may seem if these rebellious dogs should chance to hear it it will be but so much encouragement to them a fearless front a cold contempt are weapons unrivalled if you would prevail against these mutinous cravens  but his guests were insistent that something more than fearless fronts and cold contempts should be set up as barriers between themselves and the advancing peasantry and in the end bellecour impatiently quitted the room to give orders for the barricading of the gates and the defending of the chateau leaving behind him in the salon the very wildest of confusions  from the windows the peasantry could now be seen by the light of their torches marching up the long avenue that fronted the chateau and headed by a single drum on which the bearer did no more than beat the step they were a fierce unkempt band rudely armedsome with scythes some with sickles some with hedgeknives and some with hangers whilst here and there was one who carried a gun and perhaps a bayonet as well nor were there men only in the rebellious ranks there were an almost equal number of women in crimson caps their bosoms bare their heads dishevelled their garments filthy and in ragsfor the tooth of poverty had bitten deeply into them during the past months  as they swung along to the rhythmical thud of the drum their voices were raised in a fearful chorus that must have made one think of the choirs of hell and the song they sang was the song of rouget de lisle which all france had been singing these twelve months past     aux armes citoyens     formez vos bataillons     allons marchons     quun sang inpur     abreuve nos sillons  ever swelling as they drew nearer came the sound of that terrible hymn to the ears of the elegant bejewelled bepowdered company in the chateau the gates were reached and found barred an angry roar went up to heaven followed by a hail of blows upon the stout ironbound oak and an imperious call to open  in the courtyard below the marquis had posted the handful of servants that remained faithfulfor reasons that heaven alone may discernto the fortunes of the house he had armed them with carbines and supplied them with ammunition he had left them orders to hold off the mob from the outer gates as long as possible but should these be carried they were to fall back into the chateau itself and make fast the doors meanwhile he was haranguing the gentlemensome thirty of them as we have seenin the salon and urging them to arm themselves so that they might render assistance  his instances were met with a certain coldness which at last was given expression by the most elegant vicomte dombrevalthe man who was about to become his soninlaw  my dear marquis protested the young man his habitually supercilious mouth looking even more supercilious than usual as he now spoke i beg that you will consider what you are proposing we are your guests we others and you ask us to defend your gates against your own people for you surely surely sir your first duty should have been to have ensured our safety against such mutinies on the part of the rabble of bellecour  the seigneur angrily stamped his foot in his choler he was within an ace of striking ombreval and might have done so had not the broadminded and everreasonable old des cadoux interposed at that moment to make clear to the marquiss guests a situation than which nothing could have been clearer he put it to them that the times were changed and that france was no longer what france had been that allowances must be made for m de bellecour who was in no better case than any other gentleman in that unhappy country and finally that either they must look to arming and defending themselves or they must say their prayers and submit to being butchered with the ladies  for ourselves he concluded calmly tapping his gold snuffbox and holding it out to bellecour for all the world with the air of one who was discussing the latest fashion in wigs i can understand your repugnance at coming to blows with this obscene canaille it is doing them an honour of which they are not worthy but we have these ladies to think of messieurs and he paused to apply the rappee to his nostrilsand we must exert ourselves to save them however disagreeable the course we may be compelled to pursue messieurs i am the oldest here permit that i show you the way  his words were not without effect they kindled chivalry in hearts that after all were nothing if not prone to chivalryaccording to their own lightsand presently something very near enthusiasm prevailed but the supercilious and very noble ombreval still grumbled  to ask me to fight this scum he ejaculated in horror pardi it is too much ask me to beat them off with a whip like a pack of curs and ill do it readily but fight them  nothing could delight us more vicomte than to see you beat them off with a whip des cadoux assured him arm yourself with a whip by all means my friend and let us witness the prodigies you can perform with it  see what valour inflames the vicomte suzanne sneered a handsome woman into mademoiselles ear with what alacrity he flies to arms that he may defend you even with his life  m dombreval is behaving according to his lights answered suzanne coldly  ma foi then his lights are unspeakably dim was the contemptuous answer  mademoiselle gave no outward sign of the deep wound her pride was receiving the girl of nineteen who had scorned the young secretarylover in the park of bellecour that morning four years ago was developed into a handsome lady of threeandtwenty  it would be beneath the dignity of his station to soil his hands in such a conflict as my father has suggested she said at last  i wonder would it be beneath the dignity of his courage mused the same caustic friend but surely not for nothing could be beneath that  madame exclaimed suzanne her cheeks reddening for as of old and like her father she was quickly moved to anger will it please you to remember that m dombreval is my affianced husband  true confessed the lady no whit abashed but had i not been told so i had accounted him your rejected suitor who brokenhearted gives no thought either to his own life or to yours  in a pet mademoiselle gave her shoulder to the speaker and turned away in spite of the words with which she had defended him suzanne was disappointed in her betrothed and yet in a way she understood his bearing to be the natural fruit of that indomitable pride of which she had observed the outward signs and for which indeed as much as for the beauty of his person she had consented to become his wife after all it was the outward man she knew the marriage had been arranged and this was but their third meeting whilst never for an instant had they been alone together by her mother she had been educated up to the idea that it was eminently desirable she should become the vicomtesse dombreval at first she had endured dismay at the fact that she had never beheld the vicomte and because she imagined that he would be most probably some elderly roue as did so often fall to the lot of maidens in her station but upon finding him so very handsome to behold so very noble of bearing so lofty and disdainful that as he walked he seemed to spurn the very earth she fell enamoured of him out of very relief as well as because he was the most superb specimen of the other sex that it had ever been hers to observe  and now that she had caught a glimpse of the soul that dwelt beneath that mass of outward perfections it had cost her a pang of disappointment and the poisonous reflection cast upon his courage by that sardonic lady with whom she had talked was having its effect  but the time was too full of other trouble to permit her to indulge her thoughts overlong upon such a matter a volley of musketry from below came to warn them of the happenings there the air was charged with the hideous howls of the besieging mob and presently there was a cry from one of the ladies as a sudden glare of light crimsoned the windowpanes  what is that asked madame de bellecour of her husband  they have fired the stables he answered through set teeth i suppose they need light to guide them in their hells work  he strode to the glass doors opening to the balcony the same balcony from which four years ago his guests had watched the flogging of la boulayeand opening them he passed out his appearance was greeted by a storm of execration a sudden shot rang out and the bullet striking the wall immediately above him brought down a shower of plaster on his head it had been fired by a demoniac who sat astride the great gates waving his discharged carbine and yelling such ordures of speech as it had never been the most noble marquiss lot to have stood listening to bellecour never flinched as calmly as if nothing had happened he leant over the parapet and called to his men below  hold there of what are you dreaming slumberers shoot me that fellow down  their guns had been discharged but one of them who had now completed his reloading levelled the carbine and fired the figure on the gates seemed to leap up from his sitting posture and then with a scream he went over back to his friends without  the fired stables were burning gaily by now and the cheeriest bonfire man could have desired on a dark night and in the courtyard it was become as light as day  the marquis on the balcony was taking stock of his defences and making rapid calculations in his mind he saw no reason why so well protected by those stout oaken gates they should notif they were but resoluteeventually beat back the mob and then even as his courage was rising at the thought a deafening explosion seemed to shake the entire chateau and the gatestheir sole buckler upon whose shelter he had been so confidently buildingcrashed open half blown away by the gunpowder keg that had been fired against it  he had a fleeting glimpse of a stream of black fiends pouring through the dark gap and dashing with deafening yells into the crimson light of the courtyard he saw his little handful of servants retreat precipitately within the chateau he heard the clang of the doors that were swung to just as the foremost of the rabble reached the thresholdwith all this clearly stamped upon his mind he turned and springing into the salon he drew his sword  to the stairs messieurs he cried to the stairs  and to the stairs they went the extremity was now too great for argument they dared not so much as look at their womenfolk lest they should be unmanned by the sight of those huddled creaturestheir finery but serving to render them the more pitiable in their sickly affright in a body the whole thirty of them swept from the room and with bellecour at their head and ombreval somewhere in the rearmost rank they made their way to the great staircase  here armed with their swords and a brace of pistols to each man whilst for a few the marquis had even found carbines they waited with faces set and lips tight pressed for the end that they knew approached  nor was their waiting long as the peasants had blown down the gates so now did they blow down the doors of the chateau and in the explosion three of bellecours servantswho had stood too nearwere killed over the threshold they swarmed into the dark gulf of the great hall to the foot of the staircase but here they were at a disadvantage the light of the burning stables shining through the open doorway revealed them to the defenders whilst they themselves looked up into the dark there was a sudden cracking of pistols and a few louder reports from the guns and the mob fled screaming back into the yard leaving a score of dead and wounded on the polished floor of the hall  old m des cadoux laughed in the dark as with his sword hanging from his wrist he tapped his snuffbox  ma foi said he to his neighbour they are discovering that it is not to be the triumphal march they had expected a pinch of rappee stanislas  but the respite was brief in a moment they saw the glare increase at the door and presently a halfdozen of the rabble entered with torches followed by some scores of their comrades they paused at sight of that company ranged upon the stairs as well they might for a more incongruous sight could scarcely be imagined across the bodies of the slain and revealed by the lifting powder smoke stood that little band of thirty men a blaze of gay colours a sheen of silken hose their wigs curled and powdered their costly ruffles scintillant with jewels calm and supercilious mocking to a man there was a momentary gasp of awe and then the spell was broken by the aristocrats themselves a pistol spoke and a volley followed in the hall some stumbled forward some hurtled backward and some sank down in nerveless heaps but those that remained did not again retreat reinforced by others that crowded in behind they charged boldly up the stairs headed by a ragged red capped giant named souvestrea man whom the marquis had once irreparably wronged  the sight of him was a revelation to bellecour this assault was souvestres work the fellow had been inciting the people of bellecour for the past twelve months long indeed before the outbreak of the revolution proper and at last he had roused them to the pitch of accompanying him upon his errand of tardy but relentless vengeance  with a growl the marquis raised his pistol but souvestre saw the movement and with a laugh he did the like simultaneously there were two reports and bellecours arm fell shattered to his side souvestre continued to advance his smoking pistol in one hand and brandishing a huge sabre with the other behind him howling and roaring like the beasts of prey they were become surged the tenantry of bellecour to pay the longstanding debt of hate to their seigneur  here said des cadoux with a grimace endeth the chapter of our lives i wonder do they keep rappee in heaven he snapped down the lid of his gold snuffboxthat faithful companion and consoler of so many yearsand cast it viciously at the head of one of the oncoming peasants then tossing back the lace from his wrist he brought his sword into guard and turned aside a murderous stroke which an assailant aimed at him  animal he snapped viciously as he set to work it is the first time that my chaste blade has been crossed with such dirty steel as yours i hope for the honour of cadoux that it may not be quite the last  up and ever up swept that murderous tide the half of those that had held the stairs lay weltering upon them as if in a last attempt to barricade with their bodies what they could no longer defend with their hands a bare halfscore remained standing and amongst these that gallant old cadoux who had by now accounted for a halfdozen sansculottes and was hence in high glee a man rejuvenesced his sallies grew livelier and more barbed as the deathtide rose higher about him his one regret was that he had been so hasty in casting his snuff box from him for he was missing its familiar stimulus at his side the marquis was fighting desperately fencing with his left arm and in the hot excitement seeming oblivious of the pain his broken right must be occasioning  it is ended old friend he groaned at last to des cadoux i am losing strength and i shall be done for in a moment the women he almost sobbed mon dieu the women  des cadoux felt his old eyes grow moist and the odd fierce mirth that seemed to have hitherto infected him went out like a candle that is snuffed but suddenly before he could make any answer a new and unexpected sound which dominated the din of combat and seemed to cause allassailants and defenders aliketo pause that they might listen was wafted to their ears  it was the roll of the drum not the mere thudding that had beaten the step for the mob but the steady and vigorous tattoo of many sticks upon many skins  what is it who comes were the questions that men asked one another as both aristocrats and sansculottes paused in their bloody labours it was close at hand so close at hand that they could discern the tramp of marching feet in the infernal din of that fight upon the stairs they had not caught the sound of this approach until now that the newcomerswhoever they might bewere at the very gates of bellecour  from the mob in the yard there came a sudden outcry men sprang to the door of the chateau and shouted to those within  aux armes was the cry a nous d nous  and in response to it the assailants turned tail and dashed down the stairs overleaping the dead bodies that were piled upon them and many a man slipping in that shambles and ending the descent on his back out into the courtyard they swept leaving that handful of gentlemen their fine clothes disordered splashed with blood and grimed with powder to question one another touching this portent this miracle that seemed wrought by heaven for their salvation     chapter vi the citizen commissioner   it was after all no miracle unless the very timely arrival upon the scene of a regiment of the line might be accepted in the light of heavendirected as a matter of fact a rumour of the assault that was to be made that night upon the chateau de bellecour had travelled as far as amiens and there that evening it had reached the ears of a certain commissioner of the national convention who was accompanying this regiment to the army of dumouriez then in belgium  now it so happened that this commissioner had meditated making a descent upon the chateau on his own account and he was not minded that any peasantry should forestall or baulk him in the business which he proposed to carry out there accordingly he issued certain orders to the commandant from which it resulted that a company two hundred strong was immediately despatched to bellecour to either defend or rescue it from the mob and thereafter to await the arrival of the commissioner himself  this was the company that had reached bellecour in the eleventh hour to claim the attention of the assailants but the peasants as we have seen were by no means disposed to submit to interference and this they signified by the menacing front they showed the military abandoning their attack upon the chateau until they should be clear concerning the intentions of the newcomers of these intentions the captain did not leave them long in doubt a brisk word of command brought his men into a bristling line of attack which in itself should have proved sufficient to ensure the peasantrys respect  citizens cried the officer stepping forward in the name of the french republic i charge you to withdraw and to leave us unhampered in the business we are here to discharge  citizencaptain answered the giant souvestre constituting himself the spokesman of his fellows we demand to know by what right you interfere with honest patriots of france in the act of ridding it of some of the aristocratic vermin that yet lingers on its soil  the officer stared at his interlocutor amazed by the tone of the man as much as by the sudden growls that chorused it but nowise intimidated by either the one or the other  i proclaimed my right when i issued my charge in the name of the republic he answered shortly  we are the republic souvestre retorted with a wave of the hand towards the ferocious crowd of men and women behind him we are the nationthe sacred people of france in our own name citizensoldier we charge you to withdraw and leave us undisturbed  here lay the basis of an argument into which however the captain being neither politician nor dialectician was not minded to be drawn he shrugged his shoulders and turned to his men  present arms was the answer he delivered in a voice of supreme unconcern  citizencaptain this is an outrage screamed a voice in the mob if blood is shed upon your own head be it  will you withdraw inquired the captain coldly  to me my children cried souvestre brandishing his sabre and seeking to encourage his followers down with these traitors who dishonour the uniform of france death to the bluecoats  he leapt forward towards the military and with a sudden roar his followers a full hundred strong sprang after him to the charge  fire commanded the captain and from the front line of his company fifty sheets of flame flashed from fifty carbines  the mob paused for a second it wavered then before the smoke had lifted it broke and shrieking in terror it fled for cover leaving the valorous souvestre alone to revile them for a swarm of cowardly rats  the captain put his hands to his sides and laughed till the tears coursed down his cheeks checking his mirth at last he called to souvestre who was retreating in disgust and anger  hi my friend the patriot are you still of the same mind or will you withdraw your people  we will not withdraw answered the giant sullenly you dare not fire upon free citizens of the french republic  dare i not do you delude yourself with that nor think that because this time i fired over your heads i dare not fire into your ranks i give you my word that if i have to command my men to fire a second time it shall not be mere makebelieve and i also give you my word that if at the end of a minute i have not your reply and you are not moving out of thisevery rogue of you shall have a very bitter knowledge of how much i dare  souvestre was headstrong and angry but what can one man however headstrong and however angry do against two hundred when his own followers refuse to support him the valour of the peasants was distinctly of that quality whose better part is discretion the thunder of that fusillade had been enough to shatter their nerve and to souvestres exhortations that they should become martyrs in the noble cause of the people against tyranny in whatsoever guise it came they answered with the unanswerable logic of caution  the end was that a very few moments later saw them in full retreat leaving the military in sole and undisputed possession of bellecour  the officers first thought was for the blazing stables and he at once ordered a detachment of his company to set about quenching the fire a matter in which they succeeded after some two hours of arduous labour  meanwhile leaving the main body bivouacked in the courtyard he entered the chateau with a score of men and came upon the ten gentlemen still standing in the shambles that the grand staircase presented with the marquis de bellecour the captain had a brief and not over courteous interview he informed the nobleman that he was acting under the orders of a commissioner who had heard at amiens that evening of the attack that was to be made upon bellecour not unnaturally the marquis was mistrustful of the ends which that commissioner whoever he might be looked to serve by so unusual an act far better did it sort with the methods of the national convention and its members to leave the butchering of aristocrats to take its course he sought information at the captains hands but the officer was reticent to the point of curtness and so their anxiety but little relieved since it might seem that they had but escaped from scylla to be engulfed in charbydis the aristocrats at bellecour spent the night in odious suspense those that were tending the wounded had perhaps the best of it since thus their minds were occupied and saved the torture of speculation  the proportion of slain was mercifully small of twenty that had fallen it was found that but six were dead the others being more or less severely hurt conspicuous among the men that remained and perhaps the bravest of them all was old des cadoux he had recovered his snuffbox than which there seemed to be nothing of greater importance in the world and he moved from group to group with here a jest and there a word of encouragement as seemed best suited to those he addressed of the women mademoiselle de bellecour and her sharp tongued mother showed certainly the most undaunted fronts  suzanne had not seen her betrothed since the fight upon the stairs but she was told that he was unhurt and that he was tending a cousin of his who had been severely wounded in the head  it was an hour or so after sunrise when he sought her out and they stood in conversation togethera very jaded pairlooking down from one of the windows upon the stalwart bluecoats that were bivouacked in the quadrangle  suddenly on the still morning air came the sound of hoofbeats and as they looked they espied a man in a cocked hat and an ample black cloak riding briskly up the avenue  see exclaimed ombreval yonder at last comes the great man we are awaitingthe commissioner of that rabble they call the national convention now we shall know what fate is reserved for us  but what can they do she asked  it is the fashion to send people of our station to paris he replied to make a mock of us with an affair they call a trial before they murder us  she sighed  perhaps this gentleman is more merciful was the hope she expressed  merciful he mocked ma foi a ravenous tiger may be merciful before one of these had your father been wise he had ordered the few of us that remained to charge those soldiers when they entered and to have met our end upon their bayonets that would have been a merciful fate compared with the mercy of this socalled commissioner is likely to extend us  it seemed to be his way to find fault and that warp in his character rendered him now as heroicin wordsas he had been erstwhile scornful  suzanne shuddered brave girl though she was  unless you can conceive thoughts of a pleasanter complexion she said i should prefer your silence m dombreval  he laughed in his disdainful wayfor he disdained all things excepting his own person and safetybut before he could make any answer they were joined by the marquis and his son  in the courtyard the horseman was now dismounting and a moment or two later they heard the fall of feet upon the stairs a soldier threw open the door and holding it announced  the citizendeputy la boulaye commissioner of the national convention to the army of general dumouriez  this mocked ombreval to whom the name meant nothing is the representative of a government of strict equality and he is announced with as much pomp as was ever an ambassador of his murdered majestys  then a something out of the common in the attitude of his companions arrested his attention mademoiselle was staring with eyes full of the most ineffable amazement her lips parted and her cheeks whiter than the sleepless night had painted them the marquis was scowling in a surprise that seemed no whit less than his daughters his head thrust forward and his jaw fallen the vicomte too though in a milder degree offered a countenance that was eloquent with bewilderment from this silent group ombreval turned his tired eyes to the door and took stock of the two men that had entered one of these was captain juste the officer in command of the military the other was a tall man with a pale face an aquiline nose a firm jaw and eyes that were very sterneither of habit or because they now rested upon the man who four years ago had used him so cruelly  he stood a moment in the doorway as if enjoying the amazement which had been sown by his coming there was no mistaking him it was the same la boulaye of four years ago and yet it was not quite the same the face had lost its boyishness and the strenuous life he had lived had scored it with lines that gave him the semblance of a greater age than was his the old poetic melancholy that had dwelt in the secretarys countenance was now changed to strength and firmness although little known as yet to the world at large the great ones of the revolution held him in high esteem and looked upon him as a power to be reckoned with in the near future of robespierrewho it was said had discovered him and brought him to parishe was the protege and more than friend a protection and friendship this which in 93 made any man almost omnipotent in france  he was dressed in a black ridingsuit relieved only by the white neckcloth and the tricolour sash of office about his waist he removed his cocked hat beneath which the hair was tied in a club with the same scrupulous care as of old  slowly he advanced into the salon and his sombre eyes passed from the marquis to mademoiselle as they rested upon her some of the sternness seemed to fade from their glance he found in her a change almost as great as that which she had found in him the lighthearted laughing girl of nineteen who had scorned his proffered love when he had wooed her that april morning to such disastrous purpose was now ripened into a stately woman of threeandtwenty he had thought his boyish passion dead and buried and often in the years that were gone had he smiled softly to himself at the memory of his ardour as we smile at the memory of our youthful follies yet now upon beholding her again so wondrously transformed so tall and straight and so superbly beautiful he experienced an odd thrill and a weakening of the stern purpose that had brought him to bellecour  then his glance moved on a moment it rested on the supercilious highbred countenance of the vicomte dombreval standing with so proprietary an air beside her then it passed to the kindly old face of des cadoux and he recalled how this gentleman had sought to stay the flogging of him an instant it hovered on the marquis whohaggard of face and with his arm in a slingwas observing him with an expression in which scorn and wonder were striving for the mastery it seemed to shun the gaze of the palefaced vicomte whose tutor he had been in the old days of his secretaryship and full and stern it returned at last to settle upon the marquis  citizen bellecour he said and his voice like his face seemed to have changed since last the marquis had heard it and to have grown more deep and metallic you may marvel now that you behold the commissioner who sent a company of soldiers to rescue you and your chateau from the hands of the mob last night what purpose i sought to serve by extending to you a protection which none of your order merits and you least of any in my eyes  the times may have wrought sad and overwhelming changes answered the marquis with cold contempt but it has not yet so utterly abased us that we bring ourselves to speculate upon the purposes of the rabble  a faint crimson flush crept into carons sallow cheeks  indeed i see how little you have changed he answered bitterly you are of those that will not learn citizen the fault lies here he added tapping his head and it will remain until we remove the ones with the other but now for the business that brings me he proceeded more briskly four years ago citizen bellecour you laid your whip across my face in the woods out yonder and when i spoke of seeking satisfaction action you threatened me with your grooms i will not speak of your other brutalities on that same day i will confine myself to that first affront  be brief sir cried the marquis offensively since you have the force to compel us to listen to you let me beg that you will at least display the generosity of detaining us no longer than you need  i will be as brief as it lies within the possibility of words answered caron coldly i am come citizen bellecour to demand of you today the satisfaction which four years ago you refused me  of me cried the marquis  through the person of your son the vicomte as i asked for it four years ago said caron you are am old man citizen and i do not fight old men  i am yet young enough to cut you into ribbons you dog if i were minded to dishonour myself by meeting you and turning to ombreval for sympathy he vented a low laugh of contemptuous wonder  insolence sneered ombreval sympathetically whilst mademoiselle stood looking on with cheeks that were growing paler for that this event would end badly for either her father or her brother she never doubted  citizen bellecour said caron still very coldly you have heard what i propose as have you also citizenvicomte  for myself began the youth i am  silence armand his father commanded laying a hand upon his sleeve understand me citizendeputy or citizencommissioner or citizenblackguard or whatever you call your vile self you are come on a fruitless journey to bellecour neither i nor my son is so lost to the duty which we owe our rank as to so much as dream of acceding to your preposterous request i think sir that you had been better advised to have left the mob to its work last night if you but restrained it for this purpose  is that your last word asked la boulaye still calmly weathering that storm of insults  my very last sir  there are more ways than one of taking satisfaction for that affront citizen bellecour rejoined la boulaye and if the course which i now pursue should prove more distasteful to you than that which i last suggested the blame of it must rest with you he turned to the bluecoat at the door citizensoldier my whip  there was a sudden movement among the aristocratsa horrified recoilingand even bellecour was shaken out of his splendid arrogance  insolent cur exclaimed ombreval with withering scorn to what lengths is presumption driving you  to the length of a horsewhip answered la boulaye pleasantly  he received the whip from the hands of the soldier and he now advanced towards bellecour unwinding the lash as he came ombreval barred his way with an oath  by heaven you shall not he cried  shall not echoed la boulaye his lips curling you had best stand asideyou that are steeped in musk and fierceness and before the stern and threatening contempt of la boulayes glance the young nobleman fell back but his place was taken by the vicomte de bellecour who advanced to confront caron  monsieur la boulaye he announced i am ready and willing to meet you and considering the grim alternative with which the republicans had threatened him the old marquis had not the courage to interfere again  ah it was an exclamation of satisfaction from the commissioner i imagined that you would change your minds i shall await you citizen in the garden in five minutes time  i shall not keep you waiting monsieur was the vicomtes answer  very formally la boulaye bowed and left the room accompanied by the officer and followed by the soldier  mon dieu gasped the marquise fanning herself as the door closed after the republicans open me a window or i shall stifle how the place reeks with them i am a calm woman messieurs but on my honour had he addressed any of you by his odious title of citizen again i swear that i had struck him with my own hands  there were some that laughed but mademoiselle was not of those  her eyes travelled to her brothers pale face and weakly frame and her glance was such a glance as we bend upon the beloved dead for in him she saw one who was going inevitably to his death     chapter vii la boulaye discharges a debt   along the northern side of the chateau ran a terrace bordered by a red sandstone balustrade and below this the italian garden so called perhaps in consequence of the oddly clipped boxtrees its only feature that suggested italy at the far end of this garden there was a strip of even turf that might have been designed for a fencing ground and which caron knew of old thither he led captain juste and there in the pale sunshine of that february morning they awaited the arrival of the vicomte and his sponsor  but the minutes went by and still they waitedfive ten fifteen minutes elapsed yet no one came juste was on the point of returning within to seek the reason of this delay when steps sounded on the terrace above but they were accompanied by the rustle of a gown and presently it was mademoiselle who appeared before them the two men eyed her with astonishment which in the case of la boulaye was tempered by another feeling  monsieur la boulaye said she her glance wandering towards the captain may i speak with you alone  outwardly impassive the commissioner bowed  your servant citoyenne said he removing his cocked hat juste will you give us leave  you will find me on the terrace when you want me citizendeputy answered the officer and saluting he departed  for a moment or two after he was gone suzanne and caron stood confronting each other in silence she seemed smitten with a sudden awkwardness and she looked away from him what time he waited hat in hand the chill morning breeze faintly stirring a loose strand of his black hair  monsieur she faltered at last i am come to intercede  at that a faint smile hovered a second on the republicans thin lips  and is the noblesse of france fallen so low that it sends its women to intercede for the lives of its men but perhaps he added cynically it had not far to fall  her cheeks reddened his insult to her class acted upon her as a spur and overcame the irresoluteness that seemed to have beset her  to insult the fallen sir is worthy of the new regime whose representative you are enfine we must take it i suppose as we take everything else in these disordered timeswith a bent head and a meek submission  from the little that i have seen citoyenne he answered very coldly roused in his turn it rather seems that you take things on your knees and with appeals for mercy  monsieur she cried and her eyes now met his in fearless anger if you persist in these gratuitous insults i shall leave you  he laughed in rude amusement and put on his hat the spell that for a moment her beauty had cast over him when first she had appeared had been attenuating it now broke suddenly and as he covered himself his whole manner changed  is this interview of my seeking he asked it is your brother i am awaiting name of a name citoyenne do you think my patience inexhaustible the cidevant vicomte promised to attend me here it was the boast of your order that whatever sins you might be guilty of you never broke your word have you lost even that virtue which served you as a cloak for untold vices and is your brother fled into the woods whilst you his sister come here to intercede with me for his wretched life pah in the old days you aroused my hatred by your tyrannies and your injustices today you weary and disgust me by your ineffable cowardices from that gentleman in paris who now calls himself orleansegalite downwards  monsieur she began but he was not yet done his cheeks were flushed with a reflection of the heart within  citoyenne i have a debt to discharge and i will discharge it in full intercessions are vain with me i cannot forget send me your brother within ten minutes to meet me here man to man and he shall haveall of you shall havethe chance that lies in such an encounter but woe unto every man at bellecour if he should fail me citoyenne you know my mind  but she overlooked the note of dismissal in his voice  you speak of a debt that you must discharge said she with no whit less heat than he had exhibited you refer to the debt of vengeance which you look to discharge by murdering that boy my brother but do you not owe me a debt also  you he questioned my faith unless it be a debt of scorn i know of none  aye she returned wistfully you are like the rest you have a long memory for injuries but a short one for benefits had it not been for me monsieur you would not be here now to demand this that you call satisfaction have you forgotten how i  no he broke in i well remember how you sought to stay them when they were flogging me in the yard there but you came too late you might have come before for from the balcony above you had been watching my torture but you waited overlong i was cast out for dead  she flashed him a searching glance as though she sought to read his thoughts and to ascertain whether he indeed believed what he was saying  cast out for dead she echoed and by whose contrivance by mine m la boulaye when they were cutting you down they discovered that you were not dead and but that i bribed the men to keep it secret and carry you to duhamels house they had certainly informed my father and you would have been finished off  his eyes opened wide now and into them there came a troubled lookthe look of one who is endeavouring to grasp an elusive recollection  ma foi he muttered it seems to come to me as if i had heard something of the sort in a dream it was he paused and his brows were knit a moment then he looked up suddenly and gradually his face cleared why yesi have it he exclaimed it was in duhamels house while i was lying half unconscious on the couch i heard one of the men telling duhamel that you had paid them to carry me there and to keep a secret  and you had forgotten that she asked with the faintest note of contempt  not forgotten he answered for it was never really there to be remembered that i had heard such words had more than once occurred to me but i have always looked upon it as the recollection of something that i had dreamt i had never looked upon it as a thing that had had a real happening  how then did you explain your escape  i always imagined that i had been assumed dead  there was a brief spell of silence then  and now that you know monsieur  she left the question unfinished and held out her hands to him in a gesture of supplication his face paled slightly and overclouded her influence against which so long he had steeled himself reinforced by the debt in which she had shown him that he stood towards her was prevailing with him despite himself stirred suddenly out of the coldness that he had hitherto assumed he caught the outstretched hands and drew her a step nearer that was his undoing strong man though he unquestionably was like many another strong man his strength seemed to fall from him at a womans touch he had led so austere and stern a life during the past four years of women he had but had the most passing of glances and intercourse with none save an old female who acted as his housekeeper in paris and here was a woman who was not only beautiful but the woman who years ago had embodied all his notions of what was most perfect in womanhood the woman who ever since and despite all that was past had reigned in his heart and mind almost in spite of himself almost unknown to him  the touch of her hand now the closeness of her presence the faint perfume that reached him from her and that was to him as a symbol of her inherent sweetness the large blue eyes meeting his in expectation and the imploring halfpout of her lips were all seductions against which he had not been human had he prevailed  very white in the intensity of the longquiescent passion she had resuscitated he cried  mademoiselle what shall i say to you  the four years that were gone seemed suddenly to have slipped away it was as if they stood again by the brook in the park on that april morn when first he had dared to word his presumptuous love even the vocabulary of the republic was forgotten and the interdicted title of mademoiselle fell naturally from his lips  say that you can be generous she implored him softly say that you prefer the debt you owe to the injury you received  you do not know the sacrifice you ask he exclaimed still fighting with himself i have waited four years for this and now  he is my brother she whispered in so wonderful a tone that words which of themselves may have seemed no argument at all became the crowning argument of her intercession  soit he consented for your sake mademoiselle and in payment of the debt i owe you i will go as i came i shall not see the citizenmarquis again but do you tell him from me that if he sets any value on his life he had best shake the dust of france from his feet too long already has he tarried and at any moment those may arrive who will make him emigrate not only out of france but out of the world altogether besides the peasantry that has risen once may rise again and i shall not be here to protect him from its violence tell him he had best depart at once  monsieur i am gratefulvery very deeply grateful i can say no more may heaven reward you i shall pray the good god to watch over you always adieu monsieur  he stood looking at her a moment still retaining his hold of her hands  adieu mademoiselle he said at last then very slowlyas if so that realising his intent she might frustrate it were she so mindedhe raised her right hand it was not withdrawn and so he bent low and pressed his lips upon it  god guard you mademoiselle he said at last and if they were strange words for a republican and a deputy it must be remembered that his bearing during the past few moments had been singularly unlike a republicans  he released her hand and stepping back doffed his hat with a final inclination of the head she turned and walked away in the direction of the terrace  at a distance la boulaye followed so lost in thought that he did not observe captain juste until the fellows voice broke upon his ear  you have been long enough citizendeputy was the soldiers greeting i take it there is to be no duel  i make you my compliments upon the acuteness of your perception answered la boulaye tartly you are right there is to be no encounter  justes air was slightly mocking and words of not overdelicate banter rose to his lips to be instantly quelled by la boulaye  let your drums beat a rally citizencaptain he commanded briskly we leave bellecour in ten minutes  and indeed in less than that time the bluecoats were swinging briskly down the avenue in the rear rode la boulaye his cloak wrapped about him his square chin buried in his neckcloth and his mind deep in meditation  from a window of the chateau the lady who was the cause of the young revolutionists mental absorption watched the departing soldiers on either side of her stood ombreval and her father  my faith little one said bellecour goodhumouredly i wonder what magic you have exercised to rid us of that infernal company  women have sometimes a power of which men know nothing was her cryptic answer  ombreval turned to her with a scowl of sudden suspicion  i trust mademoiselle that you did not he stopped short his thoughts were of a quality that defied polite utterance  that i did not what monsieur she asked  i trust you remembered that you are to become the vicomtesse dombreval he answered constructing his sentence differently  monsieur exclaimed bellecour angrily  i was chiefly mindful of the fact that i had my brothers life to save said the girl very coldly her eye resting upon her betrothed in a glance of so much contempt that it forced him into an abashed silence  in her mind she was contrasting this supercilious vacillating weakling with the stern strong man who lode yonder a sigh fluttered across her lips had things but been different had ombreval been the revolutionist and la boulaye the vicomte how much better pleased might she not have been but since it was not so why sigh it was not as if she had loved this la boulaye how was that possible was he not of the canaille basely born and a revolutionistthe enemy of her orderin addition it were a madness to even dream of the possibility of such a thing for suzanne de bellecour came of too proud a stock and knew too well the respect that was due to it     chapter viii the invalids at boisvert   there had been friction between the national convention and general dumouriez who though a fine soldier was a remarkably indifferent republican the convention had unjustly ordered the arrest of his commissariat officers petitjean and malus and in other ways irritated a man whose patience was never of the longest  on the eve however of war with holland the great ones in paris had suddenly perceived their error and had soughtdespite the many enemies from marat downwards that dumouriez counted among their numbersto conciliate a general whose services they found that they could not dispense with this conciliation was the business upon which the deputy la boulaye had been despatched to antwerp and as an ambassador he proved signally successful as much by virtue of the excellent terms he was empowered to offer as in consequence of the sympathy and diplomacy he displayed in offering them  the great republican general started upon his campaign in the low countries as fully satisfied as under the circumstances he could hope to be malus and petitjean were not only enlarged but reinstated he was promised abundant supplies of all descriptions and he was assured that the republic approved and endorsed his plan of campaign  la boulaye his mission satisfactorily discharged turned homewards once more and with an escort of six men and a corporal he swiftly retraced his steps through that blackened warravaged country they had slept a night at mons and they were within a short three leagues of french soil when they chanced to ride towards noon into the little hamlet of boisvert probably they would have gone straight through without drawing rein but that as they passed the auberge de laigle la boulaye espied upon the green fronting the wayside hostelry a company of a halfdozen soldiers playing at bowls with cannonballs  the sight brought caron to a sudden halt and he sat his horse observing them and wondering how it chanced that these men should find themselves so far from the army three of them showed signs of having been recently wounded one carried his arm in a sling another limped painfully and by the aid of a stick whilst the head of the third was swathed in bandages but most remarkable were they by virtue of their clothes one fellowhe of the bandaged headwore a coat of yellow brocaded silk which in spite of a rent in the shoulder and sundry stains of wine and oil was unmistakably of a comparative newness beneath this appeared the nankeens and black leggings of a soldier another covered his greasy locks with a threecornered hat richly laced in gold a third flaunted under his ragged blue coat a goldbroidered waistcoat and a brussels cravat a valuable ring flashed from the grimy finger of a fourth who instead of the military white nankeens wore a pair of black silk breeches there was onehe of the injured armresplendent in a redingote of crimson velvet whilst he of the limp supported himself upon a goldheaded cane of ebony which was in ludicrous discord with the tattered blue coat the phrygian cap and the toes that peeped through his broken boots  they paused in their game to inspect in their turn the newcomers and to la boulaye it seemed that their glances were not free from uneasiness  a picturesque company on my life he mused aloud then beckoned the one in the crimson coat  hola citizen he called to him  the fellow hesitated a moment then shuffled forward with a sullen air and stood by carons stirrup  in gods name what are you and who are you the deputy demanded  we are invalided soldiers from the army of dumouriez the man answered him  but what are you doing here at boisvert  we are in hospital citizen  yonder asked la boulaye derisively pointing with his whip to the eagle inn  the fellow nodded  yes citizen yonder he answered curtly  la boulaye looked surprised then his eyes strayed to the others on the green  but you are not all invalids he questioned  many of us are convalescent  convalescent but those three braves yonder are something more than convalescent they are as well as i am why do they not rejoin the troops  the fellow looked up with a scowl  we take our orders from our officer he answered sourly  ah quoth the deputy there is someone in charge here then who may it be  captain charlot the fellow answered with an impudent air which clearly seemed to ask what have you to say to that  captain charlot echoed la boulaye in astonishment for the name was that of the sometime peasant of bellecour who had since risen in life and who as an officer had in a few months acquired a brilliant fame for deeds of daring charlot tardivet he inquired  is there any other captain charlot in the army of the republic the fellow asked insolently  is he invalided too inquired caron without heeding the soldiers offensiveness of manner  he was severely wounded at jemappes was the answer  at jemappes but voyons my friend jemappes was fought three months ago  why so all the world knows what then the general sent captain charlot here to rest and be cured giving him charge of the invalided soldiers who came with him and of others who were already here  and of these cried la boulaye his amazement growing have none returned to dumouriez  have i not said that we are invalids  caron eyed him with cold contempt  how many of you are there he asked and for all that the man began to mislike this questioning he had not the hardihood to refuse an answer to the stern tones of that stern man on horseback  some fifty or thereabouts  la boulaye said nothing for a moment then touching the fellows sleeve with his whip  how came you into this masquerade he inquired  ma foi answered the man shrugging his shoulders we were in rags the commissariat was demoralised and supplies were not forthcoming we had to take what we could find or else go naked  and where did you find these things  diable will your questions never come to an end citizen would you not be better advised in putting them to the captain himself  why so i will where is he  in the distance a cloud of dust might be perceived above the long white road the soldier espied it as la boulaye put his question  i am much at fault if he does not come yonder and he pointed to the dustcloud  i think said la boulaye turning to his men that we will drink a cup of wine at the eagle inn  mean though the place was it was equipped with a stableyard to which admittance was gained by a portecochere on the right wheeling his horse la boulaye without another word to the soldier he had been questioning rode through it followed by his escort  the hostess who came forward to receive them was a tall bony woman of very swarthy complexion with beady eyes and teeth prominent as a rats but if illfavoured she seemed at least wellintentioned in addition to which the tricolour scarf of office round la boulayes waist was a thing that commanded respect and servility however much it might be the insignia of a government of liberty equality and fraternity  she bade the ostler care for their horses and she brought them her best wine seeking under an assumed geniality to conceal the unrest born of her speculations as to what might happen did captain charlot return ere the deputy departed  charlot did return scarce were they seated at their wine when the confused sounds that from the distance had been swelling took more definite shape the hostess looked uneasy as la boulaye rose and went to the door of the inn down the road marched now a numerous company from whichto judge by their odd appearancethe players at bowls had been drawn they numbered close upon threescore and in the centre of them came a great lumbering vehicle which puzzled la boulaye he drew away from the door and posted himself at the window so that unobserved he might ascertain what was toward into the courtyard came that company pelemele an odd mixture of rags and gauds yet a very lusty party vigorous of limb and loud of voice with them came the coach and there was such a press about the gates that la boulaye looked to see some of them crushed to death but with a few shouts and oaths and threats at one another they got through in safety and the unwieldy carriage was brought to a standstill  they were clamouring about its doors and to la boulaye it seemed that they were on the point of quarrelling among themselves some wanting to enter the coach and others seeking to restrain them when through the portecochere rode charlot tardivet himself  he barked out a sharp word of command and they grew silent and still testifying to a discipline which said much for the strength of character of their captain he was strangely altered was this tardivet and his appearance now was worthy of his followers under a gaudilylaced threecornered hat his hair hung dishevelled and unkempt like wisps of straw he wore a coat of flowered black silk with a heavy gold edging and a very bright plumcoloured waistcoat showed above the broad tricolour scarf that sashed his middle his breeches were white or had been white in origin and disappeared into a pair of very lustrous lacquered boots that rose high above his knees a cavalry sabre of ordinary dimensions hung from a military belt and a pistolbutt peeping from his sash completed the astonishing motley of his appearance for the rest he was the same tall and wellknit fellow but there was more strength in his square chin more intelligence in the keen blue eyes and alas more coarseness in the mouth which bristled with a reddish beard of some days growth  la boulaye watched him with interest he had become intimate with him in the old days in paris whither tardivet had gone and where fired by the wrongs he had suffered he had been one of the apostles of the revolution when the frontiers of france had been in danger tardivet had taken up arms and by the lustre which he had shed upon the name of captain charlotas he was come to be called throughout the armyhe had eclipsed the fame of citizen tardivet the erstwhile prophet of liberty great changes these in the estate of one who had been a simple peasant but then the times were times of great changes was not santerre the brewer become a great general and was not robespierre the obscure lawyer of arras by way of becoming a dictator was it therefore wonderful that charlot should have passed from peasant to preacher from preacher to soldier and from soldier towhat  a shrewd suspicion was being borne in upon la boulayes mind as he stood by that window his men behind him watching also with no less intentness and some uneasiness for themselvesfor they misliked the look of the company  in five seconds charlot had restored order in the human chaos without in five minutes there were but ten men left in the yard the others were gone at charlots biddinga bidding couched in words that went to confirm la boulayes suspicions  you will get back to your posts at once he had said because we have made one rich capture is no reason why you should neglect the opportunities of making others no less rich you moulinet with twenty men shall patrol the road to charleroi and get as near france as possible you boligny station yourself in the neighbourhood of conde with ten men and guard the road from valenciennes you aigreville spread your twenty men from conde to tournay and watch the frontiers closely make an inspection of any captures you may take and waste no time in bringing hither worthless ones now go i will see that each mans share of this is assured him march  there were some shouts of vive la republique some of vive le captaine charlot and so they poured out of the yard and left him to give a few hurried directions to the ten men that remained  sad invalids these as i live exclaimed la boulaye over his shoulder to his followers ha there is my friend of the red redingote  the fellow with the bandaged head had approached charlot and was tugging at his sleeve  let be you greasy rascal the captain snapped at him to add what do you say a deputy where the fellow pointed with his thumb in the direction of the hostelry  sacred name of a name growled charlot and turning suddenly from the men to whom he had been issuing directions he sprang up the steps and entered the inn as he crossed the threshold of the common room he was confronted by the tall figure of la boulaye  i make you my compliments charlot was carons greeting upon the vigorous health that appears to prevail in your hospital  tardivet stood a moment within the doorway staring at the deputy then his brow cleared and with a laugh at once of welcome and amusement he strode forward and put out his hand  my good caron he cried to meet you at boisvert is a pleasure i had not looked for  are you so very sure asked la boulaye sardonically as he took the outstretched hand that it is a pleasure  how could it be else old friend by st guillotine he added clapping the deputy on the back you shall come to my room and we will broach a bottle of green seal  in some measure of wonder la boulaye permitted himself to be led up the crazy stairs to a most untidy room above which evidently did duty as the captains parlour a heavy brass lamp hanging from the ceiling a few untrustworthy chairs and a deal table stained and unclean were the only articles of furniture but in almost every corner there were untidy heaps of garments of all sorts and conditions strewn about the floor were other articles of apparel a few weapons a saddle and three or four boots here an empty bottle lying on its side yonder a couple of full ones by the hearth an odd book or two and an infinity of playing cards cast there much as a sower scatters his seeds upon the ground  there may be a hundred ways of apprehending the character of a man but none perhaps is more reliable than the appearance of his dwelling and no discerning person that stepped into captain tardivets parlour could long remain in doubt of its inhabitants pursuits and habits  when dame capoulade had withdrawn after bringing them their wine and casting a few logs upon the fire la boulaye turned his back to the hearth and confronted his host  why are you not with the army charlot he asked in a tone which made the question sound like a demand  have they not told you rejoined the other airily engrossed in filling the glasses  i understand you were sent here to recover from a wound you received three months ago at jemappes and to take charge of other invalided soldiers but seemingly your invalids do not number more than a halfdozen out of the fifty or sixty men that are with you how is it then that you do not return with these to dumouriez  because i can serve france better here answered charlot and at the same time enrich myself and my followers  in short returned la boulaye coldly because you have degenerated from a soldier into a brigand  charlot looked up and for just a second his glance was not without uneasiness then he laughed he unbuckled his sword and tossed it into a corner throwing his hat after it  it was ever your way to take extreme views caron he observed with a certain whimsical regret of tone that no doubt is what has made a statesman of you you had chosen more wisely had you elected to serve the republic with your sword instead come my friend and he pointed to the wine let us pledge the nation  la boulaye shrugged his shoulders slightly and sighed in the end he came forward and took the wine  long live the republic was charlots toast and with a slight inclination of the head la boulaye drained his glass  it is likely to live without you charlot unless you mend your conduct  diable snapped the captain a trifle peevishly can you not understand that in my own way i am serving my country you have called me a brigand but you might say the same of general dumouriez himself how many cities has he not sacked  that is the way of war  and so is this he makes war upon the enemies of france that dwell in cities whilst i in a smaller way make war upon those that travel in coaches i confine myself to emigresthese damned aristocrats whom it is every good frenchmans duty to aid in stamping out over the frontiers they come with their jewels their plate and their moneychests to whom belongs this wealth to france too long already have they withheld from the sons of the soil that which belongs equally to them and now they have the effrontery to attempt to carry these riches out of the country would any true republican dare to reproach me for what i do i am but seizing that which belongs to france and here dividing it among the good patriots that are with me the soldiers that have bled for france  a specious argument sneered la boulaye  specious enough to satisfy the convention itself if ever i should be called to task answered charlot with heat do you propose to draw the attention of the executive to my doings  la boulayes grey eyes regarded him steadily for a moment  know you of any reason why i should not he asked  yes caron i do was the ready answer i am well aware of the extent of your power with the mountain in paris i can see that it might go hard with me if you were minded that it should and you were able to seize me on the other hand that such arguments that i have advanced to you would be acceptable to the government i do not doubt but whilst they would approve of this that you call brigandage i also do not doubt that they would claim that the prizes i have seized are by right the property of the convention and they might compel me to surrender them thus they would pass from my hands into those of some statesmanbrigand who under the plea of seizing these treasures for the coffers of the nation would transfer them to his own would you rather help such an one to profit than me caron have you so far forgotten how we suffered togetheralmost in the selfsame causeat bellecour in the old days have you forgotten the friendship that linked us later in paris when the revolution was in its dawn have you forgotten what i have endured at the hands of this infernal class that you can feel no sympathy for me caron it is a measure of revenge and as there is a heaven a very mild one me they robbed of more than life them i deprive but of their jewels and their plate turning them destitute upon the world bethink you of my girlwife caron he added furiously and of how she died of grief and shame a short three months after our hideous nuptials god in heaven when the memory of it returns to me i marvel at my own forbearance i marvel that i do not take every man and woman of them that fall into my hands and flog them to death as they would have flogged you when you soughtalas to so little purposeto intervene on my behalf  he grew silent and thoughtful and the expression of his face was not nice at last have i given you reason enough he asked why you should not seek to thwart me  why yes answered la boulaye more than was necessary i am desolated that i should have brought you to reopen a sorrow that i thought was healed  so it is caron how it is i do not know perhaps it is my nature perhaps it is that in youth sorrow is seldom longenduring perhaps it is the strenuous life i have lived and the changes that have been wrought in mefor after all there is a little in this captain tardivet that is like the peasant poor marie took to husband four years ago i am no longer the same man and among the other things that i have put from me are the sorrows that were of the old charlot but some memories cannot altogether die and if today i no longer mourn that poor child yet the knowledge of the debt that lies twixt the noblesse of france and me is ever present and i neglect no opportunity of discharging a part of it but enough of that caron tell me of yourself it is a full twelvemonth since last we met and in that time from what i have heard you have done much and gone far tell me of it caron  they drew their chairs to the hearth and they sat talking so long that the early february twilight came down upon them while they were still at their reminiscences la boulaye had intended reaching valenciennes that night but rather than journey forward in the dark he now proposed to lie at boisvert a resolution in which he did not lack for encouragement from charlot     chapter ix the captives   amid the sordid surroundings of charlots private quarters the captain and the deputy supped that evening the supper sorted well with the housea greasy illcooked meal that proved little inviting to the somewhat fastidious la boulaye but the wine plundered no doubt in common with the goblets out of which they drank itwas more than good and whilst la boulaye showed his appreciation of it charlot abused it like a soldier they sat facing each other across the little deal table whose stains were now hidden by a cloth and to light them they had four tapers set in silver candlesticks of magnificent workmanship and most wondrous weight which tardivet informed his guest had been the property of a cidevant prince of the blood  as the night wore on captain charlot grew boisterous and more confidential he came at length to speak of the last capture they had made  i have taken prizes caron said he which a king might not despise but today he raised his eyes to the ceiling and wagged his head  well quoth la boulaye what about today  i have made a capture worth more than all the others put together it was an indifferentlooking berline and my men were within an ace of allowing it to pass but i have a nose mon cherand he tapped the organ with ludicrous significanceand bon dieu what affair i can smell an aristocrat a league off down upon that coach i swooped like a hawk upon a sparrow within it sat two women thickly veiled and i give you my word that in a sense i pitied them for not a doubt of it but they were in the act of congratulating themselves upon their escape from france but sentiment may become fatal if permitted to interfere with enterprise stifling my regrets i desired them to alight and they being wise obeyed me without demur i allowed them to retain their veils i sought the sight of things other than womens faces and a brief survey of the coach showed me where to bestow my attention i lifted the back seat it came up like the lid of the chest it was and beneath it i discovered enough gold and silver plate to outweigh in value almost everything that i had ever taken but that was by no means all under the front seat there was a chest of goldlouis dors they were some two or three thousand at leastand besides that a little ironbound box of gems which in itself was worth more than all the rest of the contents of that treasurecasket of a coach i tell you caron i dropped the lid of that seat in some haste for i was not minded that my men should become as wise as i i stepped down and bade the women reenter and hither under strong escort i have brought them  and these treasures asked la boulaye  they are still in the coach below with the women i have told these that they shall spend the night there tomorrow i shall see to them and give them their libertywhich is a more generous proceeding than might befall them at the hands of another when they are gone comes the division of the spoil he closed one eye slowly in a very ponderous wink to my men i shall relegate the gold and silver plate as well as the money for myself i shall only retain the little ironbound box my followers will account me more than generous and themselves more than satisfied as for me la boulayeby st guillotine i am tempted to emigrate also and set up as an aristocrat myself in prussia or england for in that little box there is something more than a fortune i asked you today whether you were minded to lay information against me in paris my faith i am little concerned whether you do or not for i think that before you can reach paris captain charlot tardivet will be no more than a name in the republican army abroad i shall call myself charlot du tardivet and i shall sleep in fine linen and live on truffles and champagne caron your health  he drained his glass and laughed softly to himself as he set it down  do you trust your men asked la boulaye  eh trust them name of a name they know me i have placed the ten most faithful ones on guard they answer to the rest of us with their necks for the safety of their charge come hither caron  he rose somewhat unsteadily and lurched across to the window la boulaye followed him and gazing out under his indication he beheld the coach by the blaze of a fire which the men had lighted to keep them from freezing at their post  does that look secure  why yessecure enough but if those fellows were to take it into their heads that it would be more profitable to share the prize among ten than among sixty  secreanom swore charlot impatiently you do my wits poor credit for what do you take me have i gone through so much think you without learning how little men are to be trusted faugh look at the portecochere the gates are closedaye and locked mon cher and the keys are here in my pocket do you imagine they are to be broken through without arousing anyone and then the horses they are in the stables over there and again the keys are in my pocket so that you see i do not leave everything to the honesty of my ten most faithful ones  you have learned wisdom not a doubt of it laughed the deputy  in a hard school caron answered the captain soberly aye name of a name in a monstrous hard school  he turned from the window and the light of the tapers falling on his face showed it heavily scored with lines of pain testifying to the ugly memories which the deputys light words had evoked then suddenly he laughed halfbitterly half humourously  la la said he the things past charlot tardivet the bridegroom of bellecour and captain charlot of dumouriez army are different menvery different  he strode back to the table filled his goblet and gulped down the wine then he crossed to the fire and stood with his back to la boulaye for a spell when next he faced his companion all signs of emotion had cleared from his countenance it was again the callous reckless face of captain charlot rendered a trifle more reckless and a trifle more callous by the wineflush on his cheeks and the wineglitter in his eye  caron said he with a halfsmile shall we have these ladies in to supper  god forbid ejaculated la boulaye  nay but i will the other insisted and he moved across to the window  as he passed him la boulaye laid a detaining hand upon his arm  not that charlot he begged impressively his dark face very set plunder them turn them destitute upon the world if you will but remember at least that they are women  charlot laughed in his face  it is something to remember is it not they remembered it of our women these aristocrats  there was so much ugly truth in the captains words and such a suggestion of just if bitter retribution in his mental attitude that la boulaye released his arm at a loss for further arguments wherewith to curb him  paydi charlot continued i have a mind for a frolic does not justice give me the right to claim that these aristocrats shall amuse me  with an oath he turned abruptly and pulled the casement open  guyot he called and a voice from below made answer to him  you will make my compliments to the citoyennes in the coach guyot and tell them that the citizencaptain tardivet requests the honour of their company to supper  then he went to the door and calling dame capoulade he bade her set two fresh covers in which he was expeditiously obeyed la boulaye stood by the fire his pale face impassive now and almost indifferent charlot returned to the window to learn from guyot that the citoyennes thanked the citizencaptain but that they were tired and sought to be excused asking nothing better than to be allowed to remain at peace in their carriage  sacred name of a name he croaked a trifle thickly for the wine he had taken was mastering him more and more are they defying us since they will not accept an invitation compel them to obey a command bring them up at once guyot  at once captain was the answer and guyot went about the business  charlot closed the window and approached the table  they are coquettish these scented dames he mocked as he poured himself out some wine you are not drinking caron  it is perhaps wise that one of us should remain sober answered the deputy quietly for in spite of a certain sympathy with the feelings by which charlot was actuated he was in dead antipathy to this baiting of women that seemed toward  charlot made no answer he drained his goblet and set it down with a bang then he flung himself into a chair and stretching out his long booted legs he began to hum the refrain of the marseillaise thus a few moments went by then there came a sound of steps upon the creaking stairs and the gruff voice of the soldier urging the ladies to ascend more speedily  at last the door opened and two women entered followed by guyot charlot lurched to his feet  you have come mesdames said he forgetting the mode of address prescribed by the convention and clumsily essaying to make a leg be welcome guyot go to the devil  for a moment or two after the soldiers departure the women remained in the shadow then at the captains invitation which they dared not disobey they came forward into the halo of candlelight simultaneously la boulaye caught his breath and took a step forward then he drew back again until his shoulders touched the overmantel and there he remained staring at the newcomers who as yet did not appear to have observed him  they wore no headgear and their scarfs were thrown back upon their shoulders revealing to the stricken gaze of la boulaye the countenances of the marquise de bellecour and her daughter  and now as they advanced into the light charlot recognised them too in the act of offering a chair he stood arrested his eyes devouring first one then the other of then with a glance that seemed to have grown oddly sobered the flush died from his face and his lips twitched like those of a man who seeks to control his emotions then slowly the colour crept back into his cheeks a curl of mockery appeared on the coarse mouth and the eyes beamed evilly  they tense silence was broken by the bang with which he dropped the chair he had half raised as he leaned forward now la boulaye read in his face the thought that had leapt into the captains mind and had it been a question of any woman other than zuzanne de bellecour the deputy might have indulged in the consideration of what a wonderful retribution was there here into the hands of the man whose bride the marquis de bellecour had torn from him were now delivered by a wonderful chance the wife and daughter of that same bellecour and at boisvert this briganding captain was as much tonight the lord of life and death and all besides as had been the marquis of bellecour of old but he pondered not these things for all that the stern irony of the coincidence did not escape him that evil look in charlots eyes that sinister smile on charlots lips more than suggested what manner of vengeance the captain would exactand that for the time was matter enough to absorb the deputys whole attention  and the women did not see him they were too much engrossed in the figure fronting them and agonisedly with cheeks white and bosoms heaving they waited in their dread suspense at last drawing himself to the full of his stalwart height the captain laughed grimly and spoke  mesdames said he his very tone an insult in its brutal derision we republicans have abolished god and until tonight i have held the republic right arguing that if a god there was his leanings must be aristocratic since he never seemed to concern himself with the misfortunes of the lowlyborn but tonight mesdames i know that the republic is at fault there is a goda god of justice and retribution who has delivered you of all people in the world into my hands look on me well cidevant marquise de bellecour and you mademoiselle de bellecour look in my face and see if you know me again not you you never heeded me as you rode by in those proud days but heard you ever tell of one charlot tardivet a base vassal whose wife your husband madame and your father mademoiselle took from him on his bridal morn heard you ever tell of that poor girlone marie tardivetwho died of grief as a consequence of that brutality but no such matters were too trivial for your notice if you saw them or for your memory if you ever heard tell of them what was the life of a peasant more than that of any other animal of the land that the concern of it should perturb the sereneness of your aristocratic being mesdames that charlot tardivet am i that marie tardivet was my wife i knew not whom you were when i bade you sup at my table but now that i know itwhat do you look for at my hands  it was the marquise who answered him she was deathly pale and her words came breathlessly for all that their import was very bold  we look for the recollection that we are women and unless you are as cowardly as  citoyenne he broke in harshly answering her as he had answered la boulaye was my wife less a woman think you pah there is yet another here who was wronged he announced and he waved his hand in the direction of la boulaye who stood stiff and pale by the hearth  the women turned and at sight of the deputy a cry escaped suzanne it was a cry of hope for here was one who would surely lend them aid it was a fact she thought upon which the captain had not counted but la boulaye stood straight and cold and not by so much as an inclination of the head did he acknowledge that grim introduction charlot mistaking mademoiselles exclamation laughed softly  well may you cry out citoyenne said he for him i see you recognise he is the man who sought to rescue my wife from the clutches of your lordly and most noble father for his pains he was flogged until they believed him dead is it not very fitting that he should be with me now to receive you  but he at least is in my debt cried mademoiselle now making a step forward and sustained by an excitement born of hope whatever may be my fathers sins m la boulaye at least will not seek to visit them upon the daughter for he owes his life to me and he will not forget the debt  charlots brows were suddenly knit with vexation he halfturned to la boulaye as if to speak but ere he could utter a word  the debt has been paid citoyenne said caron impassively  before that cold answer so coldly delivered mademoiselle recoiled  paid she echoed mechanically  aye paid he rejoined you claimed your brothers life in payment and i gave it to you do you not think that we are quits besides he ended suddenly captain tardivet is the master here address your appeals to him citoyenne  with terror written on her face she turned from him to meet the flushed countenance of charlot who with arms akimbo and his head on one side was regarding her at once with mockery and satisfaction  what do you intend by us monsieur she questioned in a choking voice  he smiled inscrutably  allay your fears citoyenne you will find me very gentle  i knew you would prove generous she cried  but yes citoyenne he rejoined in the tones we employ to those who fear unreasonably i shall prove generous as generous asas was my lord your father  la boulaye trembled but his face remained calmly expressionless as he watched that grim scene  monsieur suzanne cried out in horror  you will not dare you scum blazed the marchioness  charlot shrugged his shoulders and laughed whereupon madame de bellecour seemed to become a being transformed her ample flesh which but a moment back had quivered in fear quivered now more violently still in anger the colour flowed back into her cheeks until they flamed an angry crimson and her vituperations rang in so loud and fierce a voice that at last putting his hands to his ears charlot crossed to the door  silence he roared at her so savagely that her spirit forsook her on the instant i will put an end to this he swore as he opened the door hold there is guyot below  here captain came a voice  charlot retraced his steps leaving the door wide his eyes dwelling upon suzanne until she shrank under its gaze as she might have done from the touch of some unclean thing she drew near to her mother in whom the brief paroxysm of rage was now succeeded by a no less violent paroxysm of weeping on the stairs sounded guyots ascending steps  mother whispered suzanne setting her arms about her in a vain attempt to comfort then she heard charlots voice curtly bidding guyot to reconduct the marquise to her carriage  madame de bellecour heard it also and roused herself once more  i will not go she stormed anger flashing again from the tearladen eyes i will not leave my daughter  charlot shrugged his shoulders callously  take her away guyot he said shortly and the sturdy soldier obeyed him with a roughness that took no account of either birth or sex  when the marquises last scream had died away in the distance charlot turned once more to suzanne and it seemed that he sought to compose his features into an expression of gentleness beyond their rugged limitations but the glance of his blue eyes was kind and mistaking the purport of that kindness mademoiselle began an appeal to his better feelings  straight and tall pale and delicate she stood her beauty rendered perhaps the more appealing by virtue of the fear reflected on her countenance her blue eyes were veiled behind their long black lashes her lips were tremulous and her hands clasped and unclasped as she now made her prayer to the republican but in the hardened heart of charlot no breath of pity stirred he beheld her beauty and he bethought him of his wrongs for the rest perhaps had she been less comely he had been less vengeful  and yonder by the hearth stood la boulaye like a statue unmoved and immovable the captain was speaking to her gently and soothingly but her thoughts became more taken with the silence of la boulaye than with the speech of charlot even in that parlous moment she had leisure to despise herself for having onceon the day on which in answer to her intercessions he had spared her brothers lifeentertained a kindly almost wistful thought concerning this man whom she now deemed a dastard     chapter x the baiser lamourette   presently charlot turned to la boulaye and for all that he uttered no word his glance left nothing to be said in response to it caron stirred at last and came leisurely over to the table  a mouthful of wine and im gone charlot said he in level colourless tones as taking up a flagon he filled himself a goblet  fill for me too cried the captain aye and for the citoyenne here come my girl a cup of wine will refresh you  but suzanne shrank from the invitation as much as from the tenor of it and the epithet he had applied to her observing this he laughed softly  oh as you will but the wine is goodfrom cellar of a cidevant duke my service to you citoyenne he pledged her and raising his cup he poured the wine down a throat that was parched by the much that he had drunk already but ere the goblet was halfempty a sharp sudden cry from la boulaye came to interrupt his quaffing he glanced round and at what he saw he spilled the wine down his waistcoat then let the cup fall to the ground as with an oath he flung himself upon the girl  she had approached the table whilst both men were drinking and quietly possessed herself of a knife and but that it was too blunt to do the service to which she put it charlots intervention would have come too late as it was he caught her wrist in time and in a rage he tore the weapon from her fingers and flung it far across the room  so pretty lady he gasped now gripping both her wrists so we are suicidally inclined are we we would cheat captain charlot would we fi donc he continued with horrid playfulness to shed a blood so blue upon a floor so unclean name of a name of a name  accounting herself baffled at every point this girl who had hitherto borne herself so stoutly as to have stoically sought death as a last means of escape began to weep softly whereupon  nay nay littlewoman murmured the captain in such accents as are employed to a petted child and instinctively in his intent to soothe he drew her nearer and now the close contact thrilled him her beauty and some subtle perfume that reached him from her played havoc with his senses nearer he drew her in silence his face white and clammy and his hot wine laden breath coming quicker every second and unresisting she submitted for she was beyond resistance now beyond tears even from between wet lashes her great eyes gazed into his with a look of deadly piteous affright her lips were parted her cheeks ashen and her mind was dimly striving to formulate a prayer to the holy mother the natural protectress of all imperilled virgins  nearer she felt herself drawn to her tormentor in whose thoughts there dwelt now little recollection of the vengeful character of his purpose for a second her wrists were released then she felt his arms going round her as the coils of a snake go round its prey with a sudden reassertion of self with a panting gasp of horror she tore herself free an oath broke from him as he sprang after her then the unexpected happened above his head something bright flashed up then down there was a dull crack and the captain stopped short in his rush his hands were jerked to the height of his breast and like a poleaxed beast he dropped and lay prone at her feet  across his fallen body she beheld la boulaye standing impassively the ghost of a smile on his thin lips and in his hand one of the heavy silver candlesticks from the table  whilst a man might count a dozen they stood so with no word spoken then  it was a cowardly blow citoyenne said the deputy in accents of regret but what choice had i he set down the candlestick and kneeling beside charlot he felt for the captains heart the door citoyenne he muttered lock it  mechanically and without uttering a word she hastened to do his bidding as the key grated in the lock he rose  it has only stunned him he announced now to prepare an explanation for it  he drew a chair under the old brass lamp that hung from the ceiling he mounted the chair and with both hands he seized the chain immediately above the lamp drawing himself up he swung there for just a second then the hook gave way and amid a shower of plaster la boulaye halftumbled to the ground  there said he as he dropped the lamp with its chain and hook upon the floor by charlot it may not be as convincing as we might wish but i think that it will prove convincing enough to the dull wits of the landlady and of such of charlots followers as may enter here i am afraid he deplored that it will be some time before he recovers he was so far gone in wine that it needed little weight to fell him  her glance met his once more and she took a step towards him with hands outstretched  monsieur monsieur she cried if you but knew how in my thoughts i wronged you a little while ago  you had all reason to he answered taking her hands and there came the least softening of his stern countenance it grieved me to add to your affliction but had i permitted him to do so much as suspect that i was anything but your implacable enemy i had no chance of saving you he would have dismissed me and i must have obeyed or been compelled for he is master here and has men enough to enforce what he desires  and now she would have thanked him for having saved her but he cut her short almost roughly  you owe me no thanks he said i have but done for you what my manhood must have bidden me do for any woman similarly situated for tonight i have saved you citoyenne i shall make an effort to smuggle you and your mother out of boisvert before morning but after that you must help yourselves  you will do this she cried her eyes glistening  i will attempt it  by what means monsieur caron  i do not yet know i must consider in the meantime you had best return to your coach later tonight i shall have you and your mother brought to me and i will endeavour to so arrange matters that you shall not again return to your carriage  not return to it she exclaimed but are we then to leave it here  i am afraid there is no help for that  but monsieur you do not know there is a treasure in that carriage all that we have is packed in it and if we go without it we go destitute  better perhaps to go destitute than not to go at all mademoiselle i am afraid there is no choice for you  his manner was a trifle impatient it irritated him that in such a moment she should give so much thought to her valuables but in reality she was thinking of them inasmuch as they concerned her mother who was below and her father and brother who awaited them in prussia whither they had separately emigrated the impatience in his tone stung her into a feeling of resentment that for the moment seemed to blot out the much that she owed him a reproachful word was trembling on her lips when suddenly he put out his hand  hist he whispered the concentrated look of one who listens stamped upon his face his sharp ears had detected some sound whichperhaps through her preoccupationshe had not noticed he stepped quickly to the captains side and taking up the lamp by its chain he leapt into the air like a clown and came down on his heels with a thud that shook the chamber simultaneously he dropped the lamp with a clatter and sent a shout reechoing through the house  the girl stared at him with parted lips and the least look of fear in her eyes was he gone clean mad of a sudden  but now the sound which had warned him of someones approach reached her ears as well there were steps on the stairs which at that alarming noise were instantly quickened yet ere they had reached the top la boulaye was at the door vociferating wildly  into the room came the hostess breathless and grinning with anxiety and behind her came guyot who startled by the din had hastened up to inquire into its cause  at sight of the captain stretched upon the floor there was a scream from mother capoulade and an oath from the soldier  mon dieu what has happened she cried hurrying forward  miserable exclaimed la boulaye with wellfeigned anger it seems that your wretched hovel is tumbling to pieces and that men are not safe beneath its roof and he indicated the broken plaster and the fallen lamp  how did it happen citoyennedeputy asked guyot for all that he drew the only possible inference from what he saw  can you not see how it happened returned la boulaye impatiently as for you wretched woman you will suffer for it i promise you the nation is likely to demand a high price for captain charlots injuries  but bon dieu how am i to blame wailed the frightened woman  to blame echoed la boulaye in a furious voice are you not to blame that you let rooms in a crazy hovel let them to emigres as much as you will but if you let them to good patriots and thereby endanger their lives you must take the consequences and the consequences in this case are likely to be severe malheureuse  he turned now to guyot who was kneeling by the captain and looking to his hurt  here guyot he commanded sharply reconduct the citoyenne to her coach i will perhaps see her again later when the captain shall have recovered consciousness you citoyenne capoulade assist me to carry him to bed  each obeyed him guyot readily as became a soldier and the hostess trembling with the dread which la boulayes words had instilled into her they got charlot to bed and when a halfhour or so later he recovered consciousness it was to find guyot watching at his bedside bewildered he demanded an explanation of his present position and of the pain in his head which brought him the memory of a sudden and unaccountable blow he had received which was the last thing that he remembered guyot who had never for a moment entertained a doubt of the genuineness of the miseenscene la boulaye had prepared answered him with the explanation of how he had been struck by the falling lamp whereupon charlot fell to cursing lamps and crumblings with horrid volubility that done he would have risen but that la boulaye entering at that moment insisted that he should remain abed  are you mad the deputy expostulated or is it that you do not appreciate the nature of your hurt diable i have known a man die through insisting to be about with a cracked skull that was as nothing to yours  name of a name gasped charlot who in such matters was profoundly ignorant and correspondingly credulous is it so serious  not serious if you lie still and sleep you will probably be quite well by tomorrow but if you move tonight the consequences may well be fatal  but i cannot sleep at this hour the captain complained i am very wakeful  we will try to find you a sleeping potion then said la boulaye i hope the hosteen may have something that will answer the purpose meanwhile guyot do not allow the captain to talk if you would have him well tomorrow remember that it is of the first importance that he should have utter rest tonight  with that he went in quest of dame capoulade to ascertain whether she possessed any potion that would induce sleep he told her that the captain was seriously injured and that unless he slept he might die and quickened by the terror of what might befall her in such a case the woman presently produced a small phial full of a brown viscous fluid what it might be he had no notion being all unversed in the mysteries of the pharmacopoeia but she told him that it had belonged to her now defunct husband who had always said that ten drops of it would make a man sleep the clock round  he experimented on the captain with ten drops and within a quarter of an hour of taking the draught of red wine in which it was administered charlots deep breathing proclaimed him fast asleep  that done la boulaye sent guyot below to his post once more and returning to the room in which they had supped he paced up and down for a full hour revolving in his mind the matter of saving mademoiselle and her mother at last towards ten oclock he opened the casement and calling down to guyot as charlot had done he bade him bring the women up again now guyot knew of the high position which caron occupied in the convention and he had seen the intimate relations in which he stood to tardivet so that unhesitatingly he now obeyed him  la boulaye closed the window and crossed slowly to the fire he stirred the burning logs with his boot then stood there waiting presently the stairs creaked next the door opened and guyot ushered in mademoiselle  the elder citoyenne refuses to come citizendeputy said the soldier they both insisted that it was not necessary and that the citoyenne here would answer your questions  almost on the point of commanding the soldier to return for the marquise caron caught the girls eye and her glance was so significant that he thought it best to hear first what motives she had for thus disobeying him  very well he said shortly you may go below guyot but hold yourself in readiness lest i should have need of you  the soldier saluted and disappeared scarce was he gone when mademoiselle came hurrying forward  monsieur caron she cried heaven is surely befriending us the soldiers are drinking themselves out of their wits they will be keeping a slack watch presently  he looked at her for a moment fathoming the purport of what she said  but he demanded at last why did not the marquise obey my summons and accompany you  she was afraid to leave the coach monsieur moreover she agreed with me that it would not be necessary  not necessary he echoed but it is necessary when last you were here i told you i did not intend you should return to the coach this is my plan citoyenne i shall keep guyot waiting below while you and your mother are fortifying yourselves by supper here then i shall dismiss him with a recommendation that he keep a close watch upon the carriage and the information that you will not be returning to it tonight a halfhour later or so when things are quiet i shall find a way out for you by the back after which the rest must remain in your hands more i cannot do  you can she cried you can  if you will enlighten me said he with the faintest touch of irony  she looked at his stern sardonic face and solemn grey eyes and for a moment it almost seemed to her that she hated him more than anybody in the world he was so passionless so master of himself and he addressed her in a tone which whilst it suggested that he accounted himself most fully her equal made her feel that he was really her better by much if one of these two was an aristocrat surely that one was the citizendeputy la boulaye  if you had but the will you would do it monsieur she answered him it is not mine to enlighten you i know not how  i have the very best will in the world citoyenne said he of that i think that i am giving proof  aye the will to do nothing that will shame your manhood she rejoined that is all you think of it was because your manhood bade you that you came to my rescueso you said when you declined my thanks it is this manhood of yours i make no doubt that is now prevailing upon you to deliver two unprotected women out of the hands of these brigands  in heavens name citoyenne quoth the astonished deputy out of what sentiment would you have me act and indeed so that i save you how can it concern you by what sentiment i am prompted  she paused a moment before replying her eyes were downcast and some of the colour faded from her cheeks she came a step nearer which brought her very close to him  monsieur she faltered very shyly in the old days at bellecour you would have served me out of other sentiments  he started now in spite of himself and eyed her with a sudden gleam of hope or triumph or mistrust or perhaps of all three then his glance fell and his voice was wistful  but the old days are dead mademoiselle  the days yes she answered taking courage from his tone but love monsieur is everlastingit never dies they say  and now it was la boulaye who drew closer and this man who had so rigidly schooled himself out of all emotions felt his breath quickening and his pulses throbbing faster and faster to him it seemed that she was right and that love never diedfor the love for her which he believed he had throttled out of existence long ago seemed of a sudden to take life as vigorously as ever and then it was as if some breeze out of the past bore to his nostrils the smell of the violets and of the moist earth of that april morning when she had repulsed him in the woods of bellecour his emotion died down he drew back and stood rigid before her  and if it were to live citoyenne he saidthe resumption of the republican form of address showed that he had stepped back into the spirit as well as in the flesh what manner of fool were i to again submit it to the lash of scorn it earned when first it was discovered  but that belonged to the old days she cried and it is dead with the old days  it is vain to go back citoyenne he cut in and his voice rang harsh with determination  she bit her lip under cover of her bent head if she had hated him before how much more did she not hate him now and but a moment back it had seemed to her that she had loved him she had held out her hands to him and he had scorned them in her eagerness she had been unmaidenly and all that she had earned had been humiliation she quivered with shame and anger and sinking into the nearest chair she burst into a passion of tears  thus by accident did she stumble upon the very weapon wherewith to make an utter rout of all carons resolutions for knowing nothing of the fountain from which those tears were springing and deeming them the expression of a grief pure and unalloyedsaving perhaps by a worthy penitencehe stepped swiftly to her side  mademoiselle he murmured and his tone was as gentle and beseeching as it had lately been imperious nay mademoiselle i implore you  but her tears continued and her sobs shook the slender frame as if to shatter it he dropped upon his knees scarcely knowing what he did he set his arm about her waist in a caress of protection  a long curl of her black unpowdered hair lay against his cheek  mademoiselle he murmured and she took comfort at the soothing tone  from it she judged him malleable now that had been so stern and unyielding before she raised her eyes and through her tears she turned their heavenly blue full upon the grey depths of his  you will not believe me monsieur she complained softly you will not believe that i can have changed with the times that i see things differently now if you were to come to me again as in the woods at bellecour she paused abruptly her cheeks flamed scarlet and she covered them with her hands  suzanne he cried seeking to draw those hands away is it true this you care beloved  she uncovered her face at last again their eyes met  i was right she whispered love never dies you see  and you will marry me suzanne he asked incredulously  she inclined her head smiling through her tears and he would have caught her to him but that she rose of a sudden  hist she cried raising her finger someone is coming  he listened holding his breath but no sound stirred he went to the door and peered out all was still but the interruption served to impress him with the fact that time was speeding and that all unsuspicious though guyot might be as yet it was more than possible that his suspicions would be aroused if she remained there much longer  he mentioned this and he was beginning to refer to his plan for their escape when she thrust it aside insisting that they must depart in their coach so that their treasure might also be saved  be reasonable suzanne he cried it is impossible  a cloud of vexation swept across her averted face  nay surely not impossible she answered listen caron there are two treasures in that coach one is in money and in gold and silver plate the other is in gems and amounts to thrice the value of the rest this latter is my dowry it is a fortune with which we can quit france and betake ourselves wherever our fancy leads us would you ask me to abandon that and come to you penniless compelled thereby to live in perpetual terror in a country where at any moment an enemy might cast at me the word aristocrate and thereby ruin me  there was no cupidity in la boulayes nature and even the prospect of an independent fortune would have weighed little with him had it not been backed by the other argument she employed touching the terror that would be ever with her did they dwell in france  he stood deep in thought his hand to his brow thrusting back the long black hair from his white forehead what time she recapitulated her argument  but how he exclaimed in exasperation tell me how  that is for you to discover caron  he thrust his hands deep into his pockets and set himself to pace the chamber and now his fingers came in contact with something foreign idly he drew it forth and it proved to be the phial mother capoulade had given him and from which he had poured the ten drops for the captains sleeping potion his eyes brightened with inspiration here was a tool whose possibilities were vast then his brows were knit again  wait he said slowly let me think     chapter xi the escape   resting his elbow on the table and with his hand to his brow caron sat deep in thought his forefinger and thumb pressed against his closed eyelids from beyond the board mademoiselle watched him anxiously and waited at last he looked up  i think i have it he announced rising you say that the men are drinking heavily that should materially assist us  she asked him what plan he had conceived but he urged that time pressed she should know presently meanwhile she had best return immediately to her carriage he went to the door to call guyot but she stayed him  no no monsieur she exclaimed i will not pass through the commonroom again in that fellows company they are all in there carousing andand i dare not  as if to confirm her words now that he held the door open he caught some sounds of mirth and the drone of voices from below  come with me then said he taking up one of the candles i will escort you  together they descended the narrow staircase la boulaye going first to guide her since two might not go abreast at the foot there was a door which he opened and then at the end of a short passagein which the drone of voices sounded very loud and in particular one cracked voice that was raised in songthey gained the door of the commonroom as la boulaye pushed it open they came upon a scene of bacchanalian revelry on a chair that had been set upon the table they beheld mother capoulade enthroned like a goddess of liberty and wearing a phrygian cap on her dishevelled locks her yellow cheeks were flushed and her eyes watery whilst hers was the crazy voice that sang  around the table in every conceivable attitude of abandonment sat captain charlots guardevery man of the tenand with them the six men and the corporal of la boulayes escort all more or less in a condition of drunkenness  le jour de gloire est arrive sang the croaking voice of dame capoulade and there it stopped abruptly upon catching sight of la boulaye and his companion in the doorway mademoiselle shivered out of loathing but la boulaye felt his pulses quickened with hope for surely all this was calculated to assist him in his purpose  at the abrupt interruption of the landladys version of the marseillaise the men swung round and upon seeing the deputy they sought in ludicrous haste to repair the disorder of their appearance  so thundered caron this is the watch you keep this is how you are to be trusted and you guyot he continued pointing his finger at the man did i not bid you await my orders is this how you wait you see that i am compelled to reconduct the citoyenne myself for i might have called you in vain all night  guyot came forward sheepishly and a trifle unsteady in his gait  i did not hear you call citizen he muttered  it had been a miracle if you had with this din answered la boulaye here take the citoyenne back to her carriage  obediently guyot led the citoyenne across the room and out into the courtyard and the men restrained by la boulayes severe presence dared scarcely so much as raise their eyes to her as she passed out  and now to your posts was carons stern command by my soul if you were men of mine i would have you flogged for this out with you and he pointed imperiously to the door  it is a bitter night citizen grumbled one of them  do you call yourself soldiers and does a touch of frost make cowards of you outside you old wives at once ill see you at your post before i go to bed  and with that he set himself to drive them out and they went until none but his own halfdozen remained these he bade dispose themselves about the hearth in which they very readily obeyed him  on a sidetable stood a huge steaming can which had attracted la boulayes attention from the moment that he had entered the room he went to peer into this and found it full almost to the brim of mulled red wine  with his back to those in the room so as to screen his actions he had uncorked the phial as he was approaching the can now as he made pretence first to peer into it and then to smell its contents he surreptitiously emptied the potion into it wondering vaguely to himself whether the men would ever wake again if they had drunk it slipping the phial into his sash he turned to mother capoulade who had descended from the table and stood looking very foolish  what is this he demanded angrily  it was a last cup of wine for the men she faltered the night is bitterly cold citizen she added by way of excusing herself  bah snarled caron and for a moment he stood there as if deliberating i am minded to empty it into the kennel he announced  citizen cried the woman in alarm it is good wine and i have spiced it  well he relented they may have it but see that it is the last tonight  and with that he strode across the room and with a surly goodnight to his men he mounted the stairs once more  he waited perhaps ten minutes in the chamber above then he went to the casement and softly opened the window it was as he expected with the exception of the coach standing in the middle of the yard and just discernible by the glow of the smouldering fire they had built there but allowed to burn low the place was untenanted believing him to have retired for the night the men were back again in the more congenial atmosphere of the hostelry drinking themselves no doubt into a stupor with that last can of drugged wine he sat down to quietly mature his plans and to think out every detail of what he was about to do at the end of a halfhour silence reigning throughout the house he rose he crept softly into charlots chamber and possessed himself of the captains outer garments these he carried back to the sittingroom and extracted from the coat pocket two huge keys tied together with a piece of string he never doubted that they were the keys he sought one opening the stable door and the other the gates of the portecochere  he replaced the garments and then to make doubly sure he waited yetin a fever of impatienceanother halfhour by his watch  it wanted a few minutes to midnight when taking up his cloak and a lantern he had lighted he went below once more in the commonroom he found precisely the scene he had expected both charlots men and his own followers lay about the floor in all conceivable manner of attitudes their senses locked deep in the drunken stupor that possessed them two or three had remained seated and had fallen across the table when overcome of these was mother capoulade whose head lay sideways on her curled arms and from whose throat there issued a resonant and melodious snore most of the faces that la boulaye could see were horribly livid and bedewed with sweat and again it came into his mind to wonder whether he had overdone things and they would wake no more on the other hand an even greater fear beset him that the drug might have been insufficient by way of testing it he caught one fellow who lay across his path a violent kick in the side the man grunted in his sleep and stirred slightly to relapse almost at once into his helpless attitude and to resume his regular breathing which the blow had interrupted  la boulaye smiled his satisfaction and without further hesitancy passed out into the yard he had yet a good deal to say to mademoiselle but he could not bring himself to speak to her before her mother particularly as he realised how much the marquise might be opposed to him he opened the carriage door  mademoiselle he called softly will you do me the favour to alight for an instant i must speak to you  can you not say what you have to say where you are came the marquises voice  no madame answered la boulaye coldly i cannot  oh it is madame and mademoiselle now eh what have you done to the man child to have earned us so much deference  may i remind mademoiselle put in la boulaye firmly that time presses and that there is much to be done  i am here monsieur she answered as without more ado and heedless of her mothers fresh remarks she stepped from the carriage  la boulaye proffered his wrist to assist her to alight then reclosed the door and led her slowly towards the stable  where are the soldiers she whispered  every soul in the inn is asleep he answered i have drugged them all from the captain down to the hostess the only one left is the ostler who is sleeping in one of the outhouses here him you must take with you not only because it is not possible to drug him as well but also because the blame of your escape must rest on someone and it may as well rest on him as another  but why not on you she asked  because i must remain  ah it was no more than a breath of interrogation and her face was turned towards him as she awaited an explanation  i have given it much thought suzanne and unless someone remains to cover as it were your retreat i am afraid that your flight might be vain and that you would run an overwhelming risk of recapture you must remember the resourcefulness of this fellow tardivet and his power in the country here if he were to awake to the discovery that i had duped him he would be up and after us and i make little doubt that it would not be long ere he found the scent and ran us to earth tomorrow i shall discover your flight and the villainy of the ostler and i shall so organise the pursuit that you shall not be overtaken  there was a moments pause during which la boulaye seemed to expect some question but none came so he proceeded  your original intention was to make for prussia where you say that your father and your brother are awaiting you  yes monsieur beyond the moselleat treves  you must alter your plans said he shortly your mother no doubt will insist upon repairing thither and i will see that the road is left open for her escape at soignies you suzanne can hire yourself a berline that will take you back to france  back to france she echoed  yes back to france that is the unlikeliest road on which to think of pursuing you and thus you will baffle charlot let your mother proceed on her journey to prussia but tell her to avoid charleroi and to go round by liege thus only can she hope to escape tardivets men that are patrolling the road from france as for you suzanne you had best go north as far as oudenarde so as to circumvent the captains brigands on that side then make straight for roubaix and await me at the hotel des cloches  but monsieur i shudder at the very thought of reentering france  as mademoiselle de bellecour a proscribed aristocrat that is every reason for your fears but i have given the matter thought and i can promise you that as the citoyenne la boulaye wife of the citizendeputy caron la boulaye you will be as safe as i should be myself if you are questioned and in response you will find nothing but eagerness to serve you on every hand  she spoke now of the difficulties her mother would make but he dismissed the matter by reminding her that her mother could not detain her by force again she alluded to her dowry but that also he dismissed bidding her leave it behind her family would need the money to be realised by the jewels as for herself he assured her that as his wife she would not want and showed her how idle was her dread of living in france  and now mademoiselle he said more briskly let us see to this ostler  he opened the door of the outhouse and uncovering his lantern he raised it above his head its yellow light revealed to them a sleeper on the straw in a corner la boulaye entered and stirred the man with his foot  the fellow sat up blinking stupidly and dragging odd wisps of straw from his grey hair  whats amiss he grunted  as briefly as might be la boulaye informed him that he was to receive a matter of five hundred francs if he would journey into prussia with the cidevant marquise de bellecour  five hundred francs it was a vast sum the tenth of which had never been his at any one time of his wretched life for five hundred francs he would have journeyed into hades and la boulaye found him willing enough to go to prussia and had no need to resort to the more forcible measures he had come prepared to employ  accompanied by the ostler they now passed to the stables and when la boulaye had unlocked the door and cut the bonds that pinioned the marquiss coachman they got the horses and together they harnessed them as quietly as might be  then working with infinite precaution and as little sound as possible they brought them out into the yard and set them in the shafts of the carriage the rest was easy work and a quarter of an hour later the heavy vehicle rumbled through the portecochere and started on its way to soignies  la boulaye dropped the keys into a bucket and went within in the commonroom nothing had changed and the men lay about precisely as he had left them reassured he went above and took a peep at the captain whom he found snoring lustily  satisfied that all was well caron passed quietly to his own chamber and with an elation of soul such as had never been his since boyhood he fell asleep amid visions of suzanne and the new life he was to enter upon in her sweet company     chapter xii the awakening   la boulaye awakened betimes next morning it may be that the matter on his mind and the business that was toward aroused him certainly it was none of the sounds that are common to an inn at early morn for the place was as silent as a tomb  some seconds he remained on his back staring at the whitewashed ceiling and listening to the patter of the rain against his window then as his mind gathered up the threads of recollection he leapt from his bed and made haste to assume a garment or two  he stood a moment at his casement looking out into the empty courtyard from a leaden sky the rain was descending in sheets and the gargoyle at the end of the eaves overhead was discharging a steady column of water into the yard caron shivered with the cold of that gloomy february morning and turned away from the window a few moments later he was in tardivets bedchamber vigorously shaking the sleeping captain  up charlot awake he roared in the mans ear  what oclock he asked with a yawn then a sudden groan escaped him and he put his hand to his head thousand devils he swore what a headache  but la boulaye was not there on any mission of sympathy nor did he waste words in conveying his news  the coach is gone he announced emphatically  coach what coach asked the captain knitting his brows  what coach echoed la boulaye testily how many coaches were there why the bellecour coach the coach with the treasure  at that charlot grew very wideawake he forgot his headache and his interest in the time of day  gone he bellowed how gone pardieu it is not possible  look for yourself was la boulayes answer as he waved his hand in the direction of the window i dont know what manner of watch your men can have kept that such a thing should have come about probably knowing you ill abed they abused the occasion by getting drunk and probably they are still sleeping it off the place is silent enough  but tardivet scarcely heard him from his window he was staring into the yard below too thunderstruck by its emptiness to even have recourse to profanity stable door and portecochere alike stood open he turned suddenly and made for his coat seizing it he thrust his hand in one pocket after another at last  treachery he cried and letting the garment fall to the ground he turned upon la boulaye a face so transfigured by anger that it looked little like the usually goodhumoured countenance of captain tardivet my keys have been stolen by st guillotine ill have the thief hanged  did anybody know that the keys were in your pocket asked the ingenuous caron  i told you last night  yes yes i remember that but did anybody else know  the ostler knew he saw me lock the doors  why then let us find the ostler urged caron put on some clothes and we will go below  mechanically charlot obeyed him and as he did so he gave his feelings vent at last from between set teeth came now a flow of oaths and imprecations as steady as the flow of water from the gargoyle overhead  at last they hastened down the stairs together and in the commonroom they found the sleeping company much as la boulaye had left it the night before in an access of rage at what he saw and at the ample evidences of the debauch that had reduced them to this condition charlot began by kicking the chair from under mother capoulade the noise of her fall and the scream with which she awoke served to arouse one or two others who lifted their heads to gaze stupidly about them  but charlot was busy stirring the other slumberers he had found a whip and with this he was now laying vigorously about him  up you swine he blazed at them afoot you drunken scum  his whip cracked and his imprecations rang high and lurid and la boulaye assisted him in his labours with kicks and cuffs and a tongue no less vituperative  at last they were on their feeta pale bewildered shamefaced companyreceiving from the infuriated charlot the news that whilst they had indulged themselves in their drunken slumbers their prisoners had escaped and carried off the treasure with them the news was received with a groan of dismay and several turned to the door to ascertain for themselves whether it was indeed exact the dreary emptiness of the rainwashed yard afforded them more than ample confirmation  where is your pig of an ostler mother capoulade demanded the angry captain  quivering with terror she answered him that the rascal should be in the shed by the stables where it was his wont to sleep out into the rain despite the scantiness of his attire went charlot followed closely by la boulaye and one or two stragglers the shed proved empty as caron could have told himand so too did the stables here at the spot where madame de bellecours coachman had been left bound the captain turned to la boulaye and those others that had followed him  it is the ostlers work he announced there was knavery and treachery writ large upon his ugly face i always felt it and this business proves how correct were my instincts the rogue was bribed when he discovered how things were with you you greasy sots but you la boulaye he cried suddenly were you drunk too  not i answered the deputy  then name of a name how came that lumbering coach to leave the yard without awakening you  you ask me to explain too much was la boulayes cool evasion i have always accounted myself a light sleeper and i could not have believed that such a thing could really have taken place without disturbing me but the fact remains that the coach has gone and i think that instead of standing here in idle speculation as to how it went you might find more profitable employment in considering how it is to brought back again it cannot have gone very far  if any ray of suspicion had begun to glimmer in charlots brain that suggestion of la boulayes was enough to utterly extinguish it  they returned indoors and without more ado tardivet set himself to plan the pursuit he knew he announced that prussia was their destination he had discovered it at the time of their capture from certain papers that he had found in a portmanteau of the marquises he discussed the matter with la boulaye and it was now that caron had occasion to congratulate himself upon his wisdom in having elected to remain behind  the captain proposed to recall the fifty men that were watching the roads from france and to spread them along the river sambre as far as liege to seek information of the way taken by the fugitives as soon as any one of the parties struck the trail it was to send word to the others and start immediately in pursuit  now had charlot been permitted to spread such a net as this the marquise must inevitably fall into it and caron had pledged his word that she should have an open road to prussia with a map spread upon the table he now expounded to the captain how little necessity there was for so elaborate a scheme the nearest way to prussia was by charleroi dinant and rochefort into luxembourg andhe contendedit was not only unlikely but incredible that the marquise should choose any but the shortest road to carry her out of belgium seeing the dangers that must beset her until the frontiers of luxembourg were passed  and so argued la boulaye why waste time in recalling your men think of the captives you might miss by such an act it were infinitely better advised to assume that the fugitives have taken the charleroidinant road and to despatch at once say halfadozen men in pursuit  tardivet pondered the matter for some moments  yom are right he agreed at last if they have resolved to continue their journey a halfdozen men should suffice to recapture them i will despatch these at once  la boulaye looked up at that  if they have resolved to continue their journey he echoed what else should they have resolved  tardivet stroked his reddish hair and smiled astutely  in organising a pursuit said he the wise pursuer will always put himself in the place of the fugitives and seek to reason as they would probably reason now what more likely than that these ladies or their coachman or that rascally ostler should have thought of doubling back into france they might naturally argue that we should never think of pursuing them in that direction similarly placed that is how i should reason and that is the course i should adopt making for prussia through lorraine perhaps i do their intelligences too much honouryet to me it seems such an obvious course  la boulaye grew cold with apprehension yet impassively he asked  but what of your men who are guarding the frontiers  pooh a detour might circumvent them the marquise might go as far north as roubaix or comines or as fair south as rocroy or even charlemont name of a name but it is more than likely he exclaimed with sudden conviction what do you say caron  that you rave answered la boulaye coldly  well we shall see i will despatch a message to my men bidding them spread themselves as far north as comiines and as far south as charlemont should the fugitives have made such a detour as i suggested there will be ample time to take them  la boulaye still contemned the notion with a fine show of indifference but tardivet held to his purpose and presently despatched the messengers as he had proposed at that caron felt his pulses quickening with anxiety for mademoiselle these astute measures must inevitably result im her capturefor was it not at roubaix that he had bidden her await him there was but one thing to be done to ride out himself to meet her along the road from soignies to oudenarde and to escort her into france she should go ostensibly as his prisoner and he was confident that not all the brigands of captain tardivet would suffice to take her from him  accordingly he announced his intention of resuming his interrupted journey and ordered his men to saddle and make ready meanwhile having taken measures to recapture the marquise should she have doubled back into france charlot was now organising an expedition to scour the road to prussia against the possibility of her having adhered to her original intention of journeying that way thus he was determined to take no risks and leave her no loophole of escape  tardivet would have set himself at the head of the six horsemen of this expedition but that la boulaye interfered and this time to some purpose he assured the captain that he was still far from recovered and that to spend a day in the saddle might have the gravest of consequences for him  if the occasion demanded it he concluded i should myself urge you to chance the matter of your health but the occasion does not the business is of the simplest and your men can do as much without you as they could with you  tardivet permitted himself to be persuaded and caron had again good cause to congratulate himself that he had remained behind to influence him he opined that the men failing to pick up the trail at charleroi would probably go on as far as dinant before abandoning the chase then they would return to boisvert to announce their failure and by that time it would be too late to reorganise the pursuit on the other hand had tardivet accompanied them upon failing to find any trace of the marquise at charleroi la boulaye could imagine him pushing north along the sambre and pressing the peasantry into his service to form an impassable cordon  and so having won his way in this at least and seen the six men set out under the command of tardivets trusted guyot caron took his leave of the captain he was on the very point of setting out when a courier dashed up to the door of the eagle and called for a cup of wine as it was brought him he asked the hostess whether the citizendeputy la boulaye commissioner to the army of dumouriez had passed that way upon being informed that the deputy was even then within the inn the courier got down from his horse and demanded to be taken to him  the hostess led him into the commonroom and pointed out the deputy the courier heaved a sigh of relief and removing his sodden cloak he bade the landlady get it dried and prepare him as stout a meal as her hostelry afforded  name of a name he swore as he pitched his dripping hat into a corner but it is good to find you at last citizendeputy i had expected to meet you at valenciennes but as you were not there and as my letters were urgent i have been compelled to ride for the past six hours through that infernal deluge enfin here you are and here is my letterfrom the citizendeputy maximilien robespierreand here ill rest me for the next six hours  bidding the fellow by all means rest and refresh himself la boulaye broke the seal and read the following    dear caron    my courier should deliver you this letter as you are on the point   of reentering france on your return from the mission which you   have discharged with so much glory to yourself and credit to me   who recommended you for the task  i make you my compliments on   the tact and adroitness you have employed to bring this stubborn   dumouriez into some semblance of sympathy with the convention   and now my friend i have another task for you which you can   discharge on your homeward journey  you will make a slight detour   passing into artois and riding to the chateau dombreval which is   situated some four miles south of arras  here i wish you not only   to possess yourself of the person of the cidevant vicomte   dombreval bringing him to paris as your prisoner but further   to make a very searching investigation of that aristocrats papers   securing any documents that you may consider of a nature   treasonable to the french republic one and indivisible  the letter ended with the usual greetings and robespierres signature  la boulaye swore softly to himself as he folded the epistle  it seems he muttered to charlot that i am to turn catchpoll in the service of the republic  to a true servant of the nation put in the courier who had overheard him all tasks that may tend to the advancement of the republic should be eagerly undertaken diable have not i ridden in the rain these six hours past  la boulaye paid no heed to him he was too inured to this sort of insolence since the new rule had levelled all men but charlot turned slowly to regard the fellow  he was a tall man of rather slender stature but indifferently dressed in garments that were splashed from head to foot with mud and from which a steam was beginning to rise as he stood now with his back to the fire charlot eyed him so narrowly that the fellow shifted his position and dropped his glance in some discomfort his speech though rough of purport had not been ungentle of delivery but his face was dirtythe sure sign of an ardent patriothis hair hung untidy about his face and he wore that latest abomination of the ultrarevolutionist a dense black beard and moustache  my friend said charlot although we are ready to acknowledge you our equal we should like you to understand that we do not take lessons in duty even from our equals bear you that in mind if you seek to have a peaceful time while you are here for it so happens that i am quartered at this inn and have a more important way with me than this goodnatured deputy here  the fellow darted charlot a malevolent glance  you talk of equality and you outrage equality in a breath he growled i half suspect you of being a turncoat aristocrat and he spat ostentatiously on the ground  suspect what you will but voice no suspicions here else youll become acquainted with the mighty short methods of charlot tardivet and as for aristocrats my friend there are none so rabid as the newlyconverted i wonder how long it is since you became a patriot  before the fellow could make any answer the corporal in command of la boulayes escort entered to inform caron that the men were in the saddle  at that the deputy hurriedly took his leave of tardivet and wrapping his heavy cloak tightly about him he marched out into the rain and mounted  a few moments later they clattered briskly out of boisvert the thick grey mud flying from their horses hoofs as they went and took the road to france for a couple of miles they rode steadily along under the unceasing rain and in the teeth of that bleak february wind then at a crossroad la boulaye unexpectedly called a halt  my friends he said to his escort we have yet a little business to discharge in belgium before we cross the frontier  with that he announced his intention of going north and so briskly did he cause them to ride that by noona short three hours after quitting boisvertthey had covered a distance of twentyfive miles and brought up their steaming horses before the hotel de flandres at leuze  at this the only posthouse in the place la boulaye made inquiries as to whether any carriage had arrived from soignies that morning to receive a negative answer this nowise surprised him for he hardly thought that mademoiselle could have had time to come so far she must however be drawing nearer and he determined to ride on to meet her from leuze to soignies is a distance of some eight or nine leagues by a road which may roughly be said to be the basis of a triangle having its apex at boisvert  after his men had hurriedly refreshed themselves la boulaye ordered them to horse again and they now cantered out along this road to soignes but as mile after mile was covered without their coming upon any sign of such a carriage as mademoiselle should be travelling in la boulaye almost unconsciously quickened the pace until in the end they found themselves careering along as fast as their jaded horses would bear them and speculating mightily upon the deputys odd behaviour  soignies itself was reached towards four oclock and still they had not met her whom la boulaye expected here in a state of some wonder and even of some anxiety caron made straight for the auberge des postes bidding his men dismount and see to themselves and their beasts he went in quest of the host and having found him bombarded him with questions  in reply he elicited the information that at noon that day a carriage such as he described had reached soignies in a very sorry condition one of the wheels had come off on the road and although the marquises men had contrived to replace it and to rudely secure it by an improvised pin they had been compelled to proceed at a walk for some fifteen miles of the journey which accounted for the lateness of their arrival at soignies they had remained at the auberge des postes until the wheel had been properly mended and it was not more than an hour since they had resumed their journey along the road to liege  but did both the citoyennes depart cried la boulaye in amazement and upon receiving an affirmative reply it at once entered his mind that the marquise must have influenced her daughter to that endperhaps even employed force  did there appear to be any signs of disagreement between them was his next question  no citizen i observed nothing they seemed in perfect accord  the younger one did not by any chance inquire of you whether it would be possible to hire a berline asked caron desperately  no the landlord answered him with wondering eyes she appeared as anxious as her mother for the repairing of the coach in which they came that they might again depart in it  la boulaye stood a moment in thought his brows drawn together his breathing seeming suspended for into his soul a suspicion had of a sudden been thrusta hideous suspicion abruptly he drew himself up to the full of his active figure and threw back his head his resolve taken  can i have fresh horses at once he inquired i need eight  the landlord thoughtfully scratched his head  you can have two at once and the other six in a halfhour  very well he answered saddle me one at once and have the other seven ready for my men as soon as possible  and whilst the host sent the ostler to execute the order caron called for a cup of wine and a crust of bread munching his crust he entered the commonroom where his men were at table with a steaming ragout before them  garin he said to the corporal in a halfhour the landlord will be able to provide you with fresh horses you will set out at once to follow me along the road to liege i am starting immediately  garin with the easy familiarity of the republican soldier bade him take some thought of his exhausted condition and snatch at least the halfhours rest that was to be theirs but la boulaye was out of the room before he had finished a couple of minutes later they heard a clatter of departing hoofs and la boulaye was gone along the road too liege in pursuit of the ladies of bellecour     chapter xiii the road to liege   of what are you thinking little fool asked the marquise peevishly her fat face puckered into a hundred wrinkles of illhumour  of nothing in particular madame the girl answered patiently  the marquise sniffed contemptuously and glanced through the window of the coach upon the dreary rain sodden landscape  do you call the sometime secretary citizencutthroat la boulaye nothing in particular she asked ma foi i wonder that you do not die of selfcontempt after what passed between you at boisvert  madame i was not thinking of him said suzanne  more shame to you then was the sour retort for the marquise was bent upon disagreeing with her have you a conscience suzanne that you could have played such a delilah part and never give a thought to the man you have tricked  you will make me regret that i told you of it said the girl quietly  you are ready enough to regret anything but the act itself perhaps youll be regretting that you did not take a berline at soignies as you promised the citizenscoundrel that you would and set out to join him  it is hardly generous to taunt me so madame i do very bitterly regret what has taken place but you might do me the justice to remember that what i did i did as much for others as for myself as much indeed for you as for myself  for me echoed the marquise shrilly tiens that is droll now for me was it for me that you made love to the citizenblackguard are you so dead to shame that you dare remind me of it  mademoiselle sighed and seemed to shrink back into the shadows of the carriage her face was very pale and her eyes looked sorely troubled  it is something that to my dying day i shall regret she murmured it was vile it was unworthy yet if i had not used the only weapon to my hand she ceased the marquise caught the sound of a sob  what are you weeping for little fool she cried  as much as anything for what he must think of me when he realises how shamefully i have used him  and does it matter what the canaille thinks shall it matter what the citizenassassin thinks  a little madame she sighed he will despise me as i deserve i almost wish that i could undo it and go back to that little room at boisvert the prisoner of that fearful man tardivet or else that again she paused and the marquise turned towards her with a gasp  or else that what she demanded ma foi it only remains that you should wish you had kept your promise to this scum  i almost wish it madame i pledged my word to him  you talk as if you were a man said her mother as if your word was a thing that bound you it is a womans prerogative to change her mind as for this republican scum  you shall not call him that was the rejoinder sharply delivered for suzanne was roused at last he is twenty times more noble and brave than any gentleman that i have ever met we owe our liberty to him at this moment and sufficiently have i wronged him by my actions  fool what are you saying cried the enraged marquise he more noble and brave than any gentleman that you ever met hethis kennelbred citizenruffian of a revolutionist are you mad girl or the marquise paused a moment and took a deep breath that was as a gasp of sudden understanding is it that you are in love with this wretch  madame the exclamation was laden with blended wonder dignity and horror  well demanded madame de bellecour severely answer me suzanne are you in love with this la boulaye  is there the need to answer quoth the girl scornfully surely you forget that i am mademoiselle de bellecour daughter of the marquise de bellecour and that this man is of the canaille else you had never asked the question  with an expression of satisfaction the marquise was sinking back in the carriage when of a sudden she sat bolt upright  someone is riding very desperately she cried a note of alarm ringing in her voice  above the thud of the coachhorses hoofs and the rumble of their vehicle sounded now the clatter of someone galloping madly in their wake mademoiselle looked from the window into the gathering dusk  it will be some courier madame she answered calmly none other would ride at such a pace  i shall know no rest until we are safely in a christian country again the marquise complained  the hoofbeats grew nearer and the dark figure of a horseman dashed suddenly past the window simultaneously a loud harsh command to halt rang out upon the evening air  the marquise clutched at her daughters arm with one hand whilst with the other she crossed herself as though their assailant were some emissary of the powers of evil  mother in heaven deliver us she gasped turning suddenly devout  mon dieu cried mademoiselle who had recognised the voice that was now haranguing the men on the boxtheir driver and the ostler of the eagle inn it is la boulaye himself  la boulaye echoed the marquise then in a frenzy of terror there are the pistols there suzanne she cried you can shoot kill him kill him  the girls lips came tightly together until her mouth seemed no more than a straight line her cheeks grew white as death but her eyes were brave and resolute she put forth her hand and seized one of the pistols as the carriage with a final jolt came to a standstill  an instant later the door was dragged open and la boulaye stood bowing in the rain with mock ceremoniousness and a very contemptuous smile on his stern mouth he had dismounted and flung the reins of his horse over the bough of a tree by the roadside the marquise shuddered at sight of him and sought to shrink farther back into the cushions of the carriage  citoyenne he was saying very bitterly when i made my compact with you yesternight i did not reckon upon being compelled to ride after you in this fashion i have some knowledge of the ways of your people of their full words and empty deeds but you i was fool enough to trust by experience we learn i must ask you to alight citoyenne  to what purpose monsieur she asked in a voice which she strove to render cold and steady  to the purpose that your part of the bargain be carried out your mother and your treasure were to find their way into prussia upon condition that you return with me to france  it was a bargain of coercion monsieur she answered attempting to brazen it out i was a woman in a desperate situation  surely your memory is at fault citoyenne he answered with a politeness that was in itself a mockery  your situation was so little desperate that i had offered to effect the rescue both of your mother and yourself without asking any guerdon your miserable treasure alone it was that had to be sacrificed you will recall that the bargain was of your own proposing  there was a pause during which he stood waiting for her reply her blue eyes made an attempt to meet his steady gaze but failed her bosom rose and fell in the intensity of her agitation  i was a woman distraught monsieur surely you will not hold me to words uttered in an hour of madness it was a bargain i had no right to make for i am no longer free to dispose of myself i am betrothed to the vicomte anatole dombreval the contract has already been signed and the vicomte will be meeting us at treves  it was as if she had struck him and amazement left him silent a moment in a dim subconscious way he seemed to notice that the name she mentioned was that of the man he was bidden to arrest then with an oath  i care naught for that he cried as god lives you shall fulfil your word to me  monsieur i refuse she answered with finality let me request you to close the door and suffer us to proceed  your mother and your treasure may proceedit was thus we bargained but you shall come with me i will be no girls dupe no womans fool citoyenne  when he said that he uttered the full truth there was no love in his voice or in his heart at that moment than desire of her nothing was further from his mind it was his pride that was up in arms his wounded dignity that cried out to him to avenge himself upon her and to punish her for having no miserably duped him that she was unwilling to go with him only served to increase his purpose of taking her since the more unwilling she was the more would she be punished  citoyenne i am waiting for you to alight he said peremptorily  monsieur i am very well as i am she answered him and leaning slightly from the coachdrive on blaise she commanded  but la boulaye cocked a pistol  drive so much as a yard he threatened and ill drive you to the devil then turning once more to suzanne never in my life citoyenne have i employed force to a woman he said i trust that you will not put me to the pain of commencing now  stand back monsieur was her imperious answer but heedless he advanced and thrusting his head under the lintel of the carriage door he leaned forward to seize her then before he could so much as conjecture what she was about her hand went up grasping a heavy horsepistol by the barrel and she brought the butt of it down with a deadly precision between his brows  he reeled backwards threw up his arms and measured his length in the thick grey mud of the road  her eyes had followed him with a look of horror and until she saw him lying still on his back did she seem to realise what she had done  my dear brave girl murmured her mothers voice but she never heard it with a sob she relaxed her grasp of the pistol and let it fall from the carriage  shall i drive on mademoiselle inquired blaise from the box  but without answering him she had stepped down into the mud and was standing bareheaded in the rain beside the body of caron  silently she stooped and groped for his heart it was beating vigorously enough she thought she stooped lower and taking him under the arms she half bore half dragged him to the side of the road as if the thin bare hedge were capable of affording him shelter there she stood a moment looking down at him then with a sob she suddenly stooped and careless of the eyes observing her she kissed him full upon the mouth  a second later she fled like a frightened thing back to the carriage and closing the door she called in a strangled voice too drive on  she paid little heed to the praise that was being bestowed upon her by her motherwho had seen nothing of the kiss but she lay back in her corner of the coach and now her lashes were wet at the thought of caron lying out there in the road now her cheeks grew red with shame at the thought that she the noblyborn mademoiselle de bellecour should have allowed even pity to have so far overcome her as to have caused her to touch with her lips the lips of a lowbred revolutionist     chapter xiv the courier   it was well for la boulaye that he had tethered his horse to a tree before approaching the coach that solitary beast standing by the roadside in the deepening gloom attracted the attention of his followers whena halfhour or so laterthey rode that way making for liege as la boulaye had bidden them  at their approach the animal neighed and garin hearing the sound reined in and peered forward into the gloom to descry the horses head and back outlined above the blur of the hedge his men halted behind him whilst he approached the riderless beast and madeas well as he could in the darknessan examination of the saddle one holster he found empty at which he concluded that the rider whoever he had been had met with trouble from the other he drew a heavy pistol which however gave him no clue  get down he ordered his men and search the roads hereabouts ill wager a horse to a horseshoe that you will find a body somewhere  he was obeyed and presently a cry from one of the searchers announced a discovery it was succeeded by another exclamation  sacre nom swore the trooper it is the citizendeputy  in an instant garin had leapt to the ground and with the others crowding about him their bridles over their arms and their horses in a bunch behind them he was bending under the dripping hedge to examine the body that lay supine in the sodden road a vigorous oath escaped him when he assured himself that it was indeed la boulaye  is he dead cried the men in chorus  nonot dead grumbled the corporal but there is a lump on his brow the size of an egg and god knows how long he has been lying here in this bed of mud  they had no restoratives and the only thing was to convey him to the nearest habitation and demand shelter they held a short council on the matter and in the end garin bade four of them take him up and carry him in a cloak some two miles back they had passed a house and thither the corporal now bade them retrace their steps they made an odd procession first went two mounted troopers leading the horses of the others then the four on foot carrying the deputy in a cloak and lastly garin riding in the rear  in this manner they went back along the dark road and for close upon a halfhourfor their progress was slowthey trudged along in silence at last there was a short exclamation from one of the riders as half a mile away an illuminated window beamed invitingly encouraged by it they quickened their steps a little but almost at the same time la boulaye stirred on the cloak and the men who carried him heard him speak at first it was an incoherent mutter then his words came more distinctly  hold where are you carrying me who the devil are you  it was garins voice that came instantly to reassure him caron essayed to sit up but finding it impracticable he shortly bade his men set him down they halted garin dismounted and came to the deputys side and it was found that his condition was none so grave after all for he was able to stand unaided when however he attempted to walk he reeled and would of a certainty have fallen but that garin put out his arm to support him  steady there citizen the corporal admonished him  get my horse he commanded briefly  but name of a name you are not fit to ride garin protested  la boulaye however would listen to no reason with the recovery of his faculties came the consideration of how miserably suzanne had duped him and of how she had dealt with him when he had overtaken her he burned now to be avenged and at all costs he would ride after and recapture her he announced therefore to the corporal that they must push on to liege garin gasped at his obstinacy and would have sought to have dissuaded him but that la boulaye turned on him with a fierceness that silenced his expostulations  it was left to nature to enforce what garin could not achieve when la boulaye came to attempt to mount he found it impossible he was stiff and numb from his long exposure in the rain and when he moved with any vigour his head swam dizzily and throbbed with pain  at last he was forced to realisewith inward girdingthat he must relinquish his determination and he acknowledged himself ready to take the corporals advice and make for the house whose lighted window shone like a beacon in the darkness that had descended he even allowed them to prevail upon him to lie down in the cloak again and thus they carried him the remainder of the way in his heart he still bore the hope that short rest restoratives and fresh clothes would fit him for the pursuit once more and that if he set out within the next few hours he might yet come up with mademoiselle before she had passed beyond his reach should the morning still find him unequal to the task of going after her he would despatch garin and his men  at last they reached the cottageit was little moreand garin rapped on the door with his whip it was opened by a woman who told them in answer to the corporals request for shelter that her husband was from home and that she had no accommodation for them it would seem that the woman had housed soldiers of the republic before and that her experiences had not been of a nature calculated to encourage her in the practice but la boulaye now staggered forward and promised her generous payment if she would receive them  payment she cried in worthless assignats that nobody will take from me i know the ways of you  not in assignats la boulaye promised her but in coin  and having mollified her somewhat with that assurance he proceeded to urge her to admit them yonder was a shed where the horses could be stabled for the night but still the woman demurred  i lack the room she said with some firmness  but at least put in garin you could house the citizen here he has been hurt and he is scarcely able to stand come woman if you will consent to that we others can lie with the horses in the shed  this in the end they gained by renewed promises of good payment she brewed a broth for them and for la boulaye she found a suit of her absent husbands clothes whilst his own wet garments were spread to dry before the fire some brandy too she found and brought him and the draught did much to restore him  when they had supped garin and the troopers withdrew to the outhouse leaving la boulaye in sole possession of the cottage hearth and there in a suit of the absent farmers grey homespun his legs encased in coarse woollen stockings and sabots upon his feet sat the young deputy alone with his unpleasant thoughts the woman had brought him a pipe and although the habit was foreign to him as a rule he had lighted it and found the smoking somewhat soothing ruefully he passed his hand across his bandaged brow and in pondering over all that had taken place since yesternight at boisvert his cheeks grew flushed at once with anger and with shame  to have been so duped  and nowhis mind growing clearer as he recovered in vigourit occurred to him that by tomorrow it would be too late to give pursuit once she crossed the sambre at liege or elsewhere who could tell him by what road she would elect to continue her journey he had not sufficient men at his disposal to send out parties along each of the possible roads that her ultimate destination was treves he knew but once there she was beyond his reach at safety from the talons of the french republic  he sat on and thought what time his brows came closer together and his teeth fastened viciously upon the stem of the pipe by the table sat the woman knitting industriously and ever and anon glancing inquiry at her stern thoughtful guest and the click of her needles was the only sound that disturbed the stillness of the room outside the wind was wailing like the damned and the rain which had recommenced with new vigour rattled noisily upon the panes  suddenly above the din of the elements a shout sounded in the night the deputy raised his head and glanced towards the woman a moment later they heard the gate creak and steps upon the path that led to the cottage door  your husband inquired la boulaye  no monsieur he has gone to liege and will not return until tomorrow i do not know who it can be  there was alarm on her face which la boulaye now set himself to allay  at least you are well protected citoyenne my men are close at hand and we can summon them if there be the need  reassured she rose and at the same moment a knock sounded on the door she went to open it and from his seat by the hearth la boulaye heard a gentle mincing voice that was oddly familiar to him  madame it said we are two poor lost wayfarers and we crave shelter for the night we will pay you handsomely  i am desolated that i have no room messieur she answered with courteous firmness  pardi interpolated another voice we need no room a bundle of straw and a corner is all we seek of your charity madame is this a night on which to leave a dog out of doors  a light of recollection leaped suddenly to la boulayes eyes and with a sudden gasp he stooped to the hearth  but i cannot messieurs the woman was saying when the second voice interrupted her  i see your husband by the fire madame let us hear what he has to say  the woman coloured to the roots of her hair she stepped back a pace and was about to answer them when chancing to glance in la boulayes direction she paused he had risen and was standing with his back to the fire there was a black smudge across his face which seemed to act as a mask and his dark eyes glowed with an intensity of meaning which arrested her attention and silenced the answer which was rising to her lips  in the brief pause the newcomers had crossed the threshold and stood within the rustic chamber the first of these was he whose gentle voice la boulaye had recognisedold m des cadoux the friend of the marquis de bellecour his companion to the deputys vast surprise was none other than the bearded courier who had that morning delivered him at boisvert the letter from robespierre what did these two together and upon such manifest terms of equality that it should be his business to discover  come in messieurs he bade them assuming the role of host we are unused to strangers and mathilde there is timid of robbers draw near the fire and dry yourselves we will do the best we can for you we are poor people messieurs very poor  i have already said that we will pay you handsomely my friend quoth des cadoux coming forward with his companion do your best for us and you shall not regret it have you aught to eat in the house  the woman was standing by the wall her face expressing bewilderment and suspicion suspicious she was yet that glance of la boulayes had ruled her strangely and she was content to now await developments  we will see what we can do answered la boulaye as he made room for them by the hearth come mathilde let us try what the larder will yield  i am afraid that madame still mistrusts us deplored des cadoux  la boulaye laughed for answer as he gently but firmly drew her towards the door leading to the interior of the house he held it for her to pass what time his eyes were set in an intent but puzzled glance upon the courier there was something about the man that was not wholly strange to la boulaye that morning when he had spoken in the gruff accents of one of the rabble no suspicion had entered the deputys mind that he was other than he seemed for all that he now recalled how tardivet had found the fellows patriotism a little too patriotic now that he spoke in the voice that was naturally usual to him it seemed to la boulaye that it contained a note that he had heard before  still puzzled he passed out of the room to be questioned sharply by the woman of the house touching his motives for passing himself off as her husband and inviting the newcomers to enter  i promise you their stay will be a very brief one he answered i have suspicions to verify the ends to serve as you shall see will you do me the favour to go out by the back and call my men tell the corporal to make his way to the front of the house and to hold himself in readiness to enter the moment i call him  what are you about to do she asked and the face as he saw it by the light of the candle she held wore an expression of sullen disapproval  he reassured her that there would be no bloodshed and suggested that the men were dangerous characters whom it might be ill for her to entertain and so at last he won his way and she went to do his errand whilst he reentered the kitchen  he found des cadoux by the fire intent upon drying as much of himself as possible the younger man had seized upon the bottle of brandy that had been left on the table and was in the act of filling himself a second glass nothing could be further from the mind of either than a suspicion of the identity of this rusticallyclad and grimyfaced fellow  mathilde will be here in a moment said caron deferentially she is seeking something for you  had he told them precisely what she was seeking they had been possibly less at ease  let her hasten cried the courier for i am famished  have patience anatole murmured the evergentle cadoux the good woman did not expect us  anatole the name buzzed through carons brain to whom did it belong he knew of someone who bore it yet question himself though he might he could at the moment find no answer and then the courier created a diversion by addressing him  fill yourself a glass mon bonhomme said he i have a toast for you  for me monsieur cried la boulaye with surprised humility it were too great an honour  do as you are bidden man returned this very peremptory courier there now let us see how your favour runs cry long live the king  holding the brandyglass which the man had forced upon him la boulaye eyed him whimsically for a second  there is no toast i would more gladly drink said he at last if i considered it availing butalasyou propose it overlate  diable what may you mean  why that since the king is dead it shall profit us little to cry long live the king  the king monsieur never dies said cadoux sententiously  since you put it so monsieur answered la boulaye as if convinced ill honour the toast and with the cry they asked of him he drained his glass  and so my honest fellow said des cadoux producing his eternal snuffbox it seems that you are a royalist we did but test you with that toast my friend  what should a poor fellow know of politics messieurs he deprecated these are odd times i doubt me the world has never seen their like no man may safely know his neighbour now you sir he pursued turning to the younger man you have the air of a sansculotte yet from your speech you seem an honest enough gentleman  the fellow laughed with unction  the air of a sansculotte he cried my faith yes so much so that this morning i imposed myself as a courier from paris upon no less an astute sleuthhound of the convention than the citizendeputy la boulaye  is it possible cried caron his eyes opening wide in wonder but how monsieurs for surely a courier must bear letters and  so did i so did i my friend the other interrupted with vain glory i knocked a patriotic courier over the head to obtain them he was genuine that other courier and i passed myself out of france with his papers  monsieur is amusing himself at the expense of my credulity la boulaye complained  my good man i am telling you facts the other insisted  but how could such a thing be accomplished asked caron seating himself at the table and resting his chin upon his hand his gaze so full of admiration as to seem awestruck  how i will tell you i am from artois  youll be repeating that charming story once too often des cadoux cautioned him  pish you timorous one he laughed and resumed his tale i am from artois then i have some property there and it lately came to my ears that this assembly of curs they call the convention had determined to make an end of me but before they could carry out their design those sons of dogs my tenants incited by the choice examples set them by other tenantry made a descent on my chateau one night and did themselves the pleasure of burning it to the ground by a miracle i escaped with my life and lay hidden for three weeks in the house of an old peasant who had remained faithful in that time i let my beard grow and trained my hair into a patriotic unkemptness then in filthy garments like any true republican i set out to cross the frontier as i approached it i was filled with fears that i might not win across and then in the moment of my doubtings i came upon that most opportune of couriers i had the notion to change places with him and i did he was the bearer of a letter to the deputy la boulaye of whom you may have heard and this letter i opened to discover that it charged him to effect my arrest  if la boulaye was startled his face never betrayed it not by so much as the quiver of an eyelid he sat on his jaw in his palm his eyes admiringly bent upon the speaker  you may judge of my honesty and of how fully sensible i was of the trust i had undertaken when i tell you that with my own hand i delivered the letter this morning to that animal la boulaye at boisvert he seemed to swell with pride in his achievement diable he continued mine was a fine piece of acting i would you could have seen me play the part of the patriot think of the irony of it i won out of france with the very papers ordering my arrest ma foi you should have seen me befool that dirt of a deputy it was a performance worthy of talma himself and he looked from cadoux to la boulaye for applause  i doubt not said the deputy coldly it must have been worth witnessing but does it not seem a pity to spoil everything and to neutralise so wonderful an achievement for the mere sake of boasting of it to a poor ignorant peasant monsieur le vicomte anatole dombreval  with a sudden cry the pseudo courier leapt to his feet whilst des cadoux turned on the stool he occupied to stare alarmedly at the speaker  name of god who are you demanded ombreval advancing a step  with his sleeve la boulaye rubbed part of the disfiguring smear from his face as he stood up and made answer coolly  i am that dirt of a deputy whom you befooled at boisvert then raising his voice garin he shouted and immediately the door opened and the soldiers filed in  ombreval stood like a statue thunderstruck with amazement at this most unlookedfor turning of the tables his face ashen his weak mouth fallen open and his eyes fearful  des cadoux who had also risen seemed to take in the situation at a glance like a wellbred gamester who knows how to lose with a good grace the old gentleman laughed drily to himself as he tapped his snuffbox  we are delightfully taken cher vicomte he murmured applying the tobacco to his nostril as he spoke its odds you wont be able to repeat that pretty story to any more of your friends i warned you that you inclined to relate it too often  with a sudden oath ombrevalmoved to valour by the blind rage that possessed himsprang at la boulaye but as suddenly garin caught his arms from behind and held him fast  remove them both la boulaye commanded place them in safety for the night and see that they do not escape you garin as you value your neck  des coudax shut his snuffbox with a snap  for my part i am ready monsieuryour pardoncitizen he said and i shall give you no trouble but since i am not i take it included in the orders you have received i have a proposal to make which may prove mutually convenient  pray make it citizen said la boulaye  it occurs to me that it may occasion you some measure of annoyance to carry me all the way to parisand certainly for my part i should much prefer not to undertake the journey for one thing it will be fatiguing for another i have no desire to look upon the next world through the little window of the guillotine i wish then to propose citizen pursued the old nobleman nonchalantly dusting some fragments of tobacco from his cravat that you deal with me out of hand  how citizen inquired la boulaye  why your men i take it are tolerable marksmen i think that it might prove more convenient to both of us if you were to have me shot as soon as there is light enough  la boulayes eyes rested in almost imperceptible kindness upon des cadoux here at least was an aristocrat with a spirit to be admired and emulated  you are choosing the lesser of two evils citizen said the deputy  precisely answered des cadoux  but possibly citizen it may be yours to avoid both you shall hear from me in the morning i beg that you will sleep tranquilly in the meantime garin remove the prisoners     chapter xv la boulaye baits his hook   for fully an hour after their prisoners had been removed la boulaye paced the narrow limits of the kitchen with face inscrutable and busy mind he recalled what suzanne had said touching her betrothal to ombreval whom she looked to meet at treves this miserable individual then was the man for whose sake she had duped him but ombreval at least was in carons power and it came to him now that by virtue of that circumstance he might devise a way to bring her back without the need to go after her he would send her wordaye and proofthat he had taken him captive and it should be hers to choose whether she would come to his rescue and humble herself to save him or leave him to his fate in that hour it seemed all one to la boulaye which course she followed since by either he reasoned she must be brought to suffer that he loved her was with him now a matter that had sunk into comparative insignificance the sentiment that ruled his mind was anger with its natural concomitantthe desire to punish  and when morning came the deputys view of the situation was still unchanged he was astir at an early hour and without so much as waiting to break his fast he bade garin bring in the prisoners their appearance was in each case typical ombreval was sullen and his dress untidy even when allowance had been made for the inherent untidiness of the republican disguise which he had adopted to so little purpose des cadoux looked well and fresh after his rest and gave the deputy an airy good morning as he entered he had been at some pains too with his toilet and although his hair was slightly disarranged and most of the powder was gone from the right side suggesting that he had lain on it his appearance in the main was creditably elegant  citizen ombreval said la boulaye in that stern emotionless voice that was becoming characteristic of him since you have acquainted yourself with the contents of the letter you stole from the man you murdered you cannot be in doubt as to my intentions concerning you  the vicomte reddened with anger  for your intentions i care nothing he answered hotlyrendered very brave by passionbut i will have you consider your words do you say that i stole and murdered you forget m le republican that i am a gentlemen  meaning of course that the class that so described itself could do these things with impunity without having them called by their proper names is it not so but you also forget that the republic has abolished gentlemen and with them their disgraceful privileges  canaille growled the vicomte his eyes ablaze with wrath  citizenaristocrat consider your words la boulaye had stepped close up to him and his voice throbbed with a sudden anger no whit less compelling than ombrevals fool let me hear that word again applied either to me or to any of my followers and ill have you beaten like a dog  and as the lesser ever does give way before the greater so now did the anger that had sustained ombreval go down and vanish before the overwhelming passion of la boulaye he grew pale to the lips at the deputys threat and his eyes cravenly avoided the steady gaze of his captor  you deserve little consideration at my hands citizen said la boulaye more quietly and yet i have a mind to give you a lesson in generosity we start for paris in halfanhour if anywhere you should have friends expecting you whom you might wish to apprise of your position you may spend the halfhour that is left in writing to them i will see that your letter reaches its destination  ombrevals pallor seemed to intensify his eyes looked troubled as they were raised to la boulayes then they fell again and there was a pause at last  i shall be glad to avail myself of your offer he said in a voice that for meekness was ludicrously at variance with his late utterances  then pray do so at once and la boulaye took down an inkhorn a quill and a sheaf of paper from the mantelshelf behind him these he placed on the table and setting a chair he signed to the aristocrat to be seated  and now citizen cadoux said la boulaye turning to the old nobleman i shall be glad if you will honour me by sharing my breakfast while citizen ombreval is at his writing  des cadoux looked up in some surprise  you are too good monsieur said he inclining his head but afterwards  i have decided said la boulaye with the ghost of a smile to deal with your case myself citizen  the old dandy took a deep breath but the glance of his blue eyes was steadfast and his lips smiled as he made answer  again you are too good i feared that you would carry me to paris and at my age the journey is a tiresome one i am grateful and meanwhilewhy since you are so good as to invite me let us breakfast by all means  they sat down at a small table in the embrasure of the window and their hostess placed before them a boiled fowl a dish of eggs a stew of herbs and a flask of red wine all of which la boulaye had bidden her prepare  why it is a feast declared des cadoux in excellent humour and for all that he was under the impression that he was to die in halfanhour he ate with the heartiest goodwill chatting pleasantly the while with the republicanthe first republican with whom it had ever been his aristocratic lot to sit at table and what time the meal proceeded ombrevalwith two soldiers standing behind his chairpenned his letter to mademoiselle de bellecour  had la boulayeinspired by the desire to avenge himself for the treachery of which he had been the victimdictated that epistle t could not have been indicted in a manner better suited to his ends it was a maudlin piteous letter in which rather than making his farewells the vicomte besought the aid of suzanne he was he wrote in the hands of men who might be bribed and since she was richfor he knew of the treasure with which she had escapedhe based his hopes upon her employing a portion of her riches to obtaining his enlargement she he continued was his only hope and for the sake of their love for the sake of their common nobility he besought her not to fail him now carried away by the piteousness of his entreaties the tears welled up to his eyes and trickled down his cheeks one or two of them finding their way to the paper thus smearing it with an appeal more piteous still if possible than that of his maudlin words  at last the letter was ended he sealed it with a wafer and wrote the superscription  to mademoiselle de bellecour at the hotel des trois rois treves  he announced the completion of his task and la boulaye bade him go join des cadoux at the next table and take some food before setting out whilst the deputy himself now sat down to write  citoyenne he wrote the man to whom you are betrothed for whose sake you stooped to treachery and attempted murder is in my hands thus has heaven set it in my power to punish you if the knowledge that he travels to the guillotine is likely to prove a punishment if you would rescue him come to me in paris and conditionally i may give you his life  that he thought should humble her he folded his letter round ombrevals and having sealed the package he addressed it as ombreval had addressed his own missive  garin he commanded briefly remove the citizen ombreval  when he had been obeyed and garin had conducted the vicomte from the room la boulaye turned again to des cadoux they were alone saving the two soldiers guarding the door  the old man rose and making the sign of the cross he stepped forward calm and intrepid of bearing  monsieur he announced to la boulaye who was eyeing him with the faintest tinge of surprise i am quite ready  have you always been so devout citizen inquired the deputy  alas no monsieur but there comes a time in the life of every man when for a few moments at least he is prone to grow mindful of the lessons learnt in childhood  the surprise increased in la boulayes countenance at last he shrugged his shoulders after the manner of one who abandons a problem that has grown too knotty  citizen des cadoux said he i have deliberated that since i have received no orders from paris concerning you and also since i am not by profession a catchpoll there is no reason whatever why i should carry you to paris in fact citizen i know of no reason why i should interfere with your freedom at all on the contrary when i recall the kindness you sought to do me that day years ago at bellecour i find every reason why i should further your escape from the revolutionary tribunal a horse citizen stands ready saddled for you and you are free to depart with the one condition however that you will consent to become my courier for once and carry a letter for mea matter which should occasion you i think no deviation from your journey  the old dandy in whose intrepid spirit the death which he had believed imminent had occasioned no trembling turned pale as la boulaye ceased his blue eyes were lifted almost timidly to the deputys face and his lip quivered  you are not going to have me shot then he faltered  shot echoed la boulaye and then he remembered the precise words of the request which des cadoux had preferred the night before but which at the time he had treated lightly ma foi you do not flatter me he cried am i a murderer then come come citizen here is the letter that you are to carry it is addressed to mademoiselle de bellecour at treves and encloses ombrevals farewell epistle to that lady  but gladly monsieur exclaimed des cadoux  and then as if to cover his sudden access of emotion of which he was most heartily ashamed he fumbled for his snuffbox and having found it he took an enormous pinch  they parted on the very best of terms did these twothe aristocrat and the revolutionaryactuated by a mutual esteem tempered in each case with gratitude  when at last des cadoux had taken a sympathetic leave of ombreval and departed caron ordered the vicomte to be brought before him again and at the same time bade his men make ready for the road  citizen said la boulaye we start for paris at once if you will pass me your word of honour to attempt no escape you shall travel with us in complete freedom and with all dignity  ombreval looked at him with insolent surprise his weak supercilious mouth growing more supercilious even than its wont he had recovered a good deal of his spirit by now  pass you my word of honour he echoed mon dieu my good fellow a word of honour is a bond between gentlemen i think too well of mine to pass it to the first greasy rascal of the republic that asks it of me  la boulaye eyed him a second with a glance before which the aristocrat grew pale and already regretted him of his words the veins in the deputys temples were swollen  i warned you said he in a dull voice then to the soldiers standing on either side of ombrevaltake him out he said mount him on horseback let him ride with his hands pinioned behind his back and his feet lashed together under the horses belly attend to it  monsieur cried the young man in an appealing voice i will give you my word of honour not to escape i will  take him out la boulaye repeated with a dull bark of contempt you had your chance citizenaristocrat  ombreval set his teeth and clenched his hands  canaille he snarled in his fury  hold caron called after the departing men  they obeyed and now this wretched vicomte of such unstable spirit dropped all his anger again as suddenly as he had caught it up fear paled his cheek and palsied his limbs once more for la boulayes expression was very terrible  you know what i said that i would have done to you if you used that word again la boulaye questioned him coldly  ii was beside myself monsieur the other gasped in the intensity of his fear and at the sight of his pitiable condition the anger fell away from la boulaye and he smiled scornfully  my faith he sneered you are hot one moment and cold the next citizen i am afraid that you are no better than a vulgar coward take him away he ended waving his hand towards the door and as he watched them leading him out he reflected bitterly that this was the man to whom suzanne was betrothedthe man whom not a doubt of it she loved since for him she had stooped so low this miserable craven she preferred to him because the man so ignoble of nature was noble by the accident of birth     part iii the everlasting rule     love rules the court the camp the grove    and men below and saints above    for love is heaven and heaven is love     the lay of the last minstrel     chapter xvi cecile deshaix in his lodgings at the corner of the ruest honore and the rue de la republiquelately changed in the allencompassing metamorphosis from rue royale sat the deputy caron la boulaye at his writingtable  there was a flush on his face and a sparkle in the eyes that looked pensively before him what time he gnawed the feathered end of his quill in his ears still rang the acclamations that had greeted his brilliant speech in the assembly that day he was of the party of the mountainas was but natural in a protege of the seagreen robespierrea party more famed for its directness of purpose than elegance of expression and in its ranks there was room and to spare for such orators as he the season was march of 93a season marked by the deadly feud raging twixt the girondins and the mountain and in that battle of tongues la boulaye was covering himself with glory and doing credit to his patron the incorruptible he was of a rhetoric not inferior to vergniaudsthat most eloquent girondonand of a quickness of wit and honesty of aim unrivalled in the whole body of the convention and with these gifts he harassed to no little purpose those smoothtongued legislators of the gironde whom dumouriez called the jesuits of the revolution his popularity with the men of the mountain and with the masses of paris was growing daily and the crushing reply he had that day delivered to the charges preferred by vergniaud was likely to increase his fame  well therefore might he sit with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes chewing the butt of his pen and smiling to himself at the memory of the enthusiasm of which he had been the centre a halfhour ago here indeed was something that a man might live for something that a man might take pride in and something that might console a man for a womans treachery what indeed could womans love give him that might compare with this was it not more glorious far to make himself the admired the revered the very idol of those stern men than the beloved of a simpering girl the latter any coxcomb with a wellcut coat might encompass but the former achievement was a mans work  and yet for all that he reasoned thus speciously and philosophically there was a moment when his brow grew clouded and his eyes lost their sparkle he was thinking of that night in the inn at boisvert when he had knelt beside her and she had lied to him he was thinking of the happiness that for a few brief hours had been his until he discovered how basely she had deceived him and for all the fullflavour of his present elation it seemed to him that in that other happiness which he now affected to despise by contrast there had dwelt a greater a more contenting sweetness  would she come to paris he had asked himself that question every day of the twenty that were spent since his return and in the meantime the vicomte dombreval lay in the prison of the luxembourg awaiting trial that he had not yet been arraigned he had to thank the efforts of la boulaye the young deputy had informed robespierre that for reasons of his own he wished the cidevant vicomte to be kept in prison some little time and the incorruptible peering at him over his hornrimmed spectacles had shrugged his shoulders and answered  but certainly cher caron since it is your wish he will be safe in the luxembourg  he had pressed his protege for a reason but la boulaye had evaded the question promising to enlighten him later  since then caron had waited and now it was more than time that mademoiselle made some sign or was it that neither ombrevals craven entreaties nor his own short message had affected her was she wholly heartless and likely to prove as faithless to the vicomte in his hour of need as she had proved to him  with a toss of the head he dismissed her from his thoughts and dipping his quill he began to write  from the street came the dull roll of beaten drums and the rhythmical fall of marching feet but the sound was too common in revolutionary paris to arrest attention and he wrote on heeding it as little as he did the gruff voice of a pastrycook crying his wares the shriller call of a milkman or the occasional rumblings of passing vehicles but of a sudden one of those rumblings ceased abruptly at his door he heard the rattle of hoofs and the grind of the wheel against the pavement and looking up he glanced across at the ormolu timepiece on his overmantel it was not yet four oclock  wondering whether the visitor might be for him or for the tenant of the floor above he sat listening until his door opened and his officialthe euphemism of servant in the revolutionary lexiconcame to announce that a woman was below asking to see him  now for all that he believed himself to have become above emotions where mademoiselle de bellecour was concerned he felt his pulses quicken at the very thought that this might be she at last  what manner of woman brutus he asked  a pretty woman citizen answered brutus with a grin it is the citoyenne deshaix  la boulaye made an impatient gesture  fool why did you not say so he cried sharply  fool you did not ask me answered the servant with that touching fraternal frankness adopted by all true patriots he was a thin undersized man of perhaps thirty years of age and dressed in black with a decencyunder la boulayes suasionthat was rather at variance with his extreme democracy his real name was ferdinand but following a fashion prevailing among the ultrarepublicans he had renamed himself after the famous roman patriot  la boulaye toyed a moment with his pen a frown darkening his brow then  admit her he sighed wearily  and presently she came a pretty woman as brutus had declared very fair and with the innocent eyes of a baby she was small of stature and by the egregious height of her plumecrowned headdress it would seem as if she sought by art to add to the inches she had received from nature for the rest she wore a pink petticoat very extravagantly beflounced and a pink corsage cut extravagantly low in one hand she carried a fanhardly as a weapon against heat seeing that the winter was not yet outin the other a huge bunch of early roses  te voile was her greeting merrilyroguishlydelivered and if the revolution had done nothing else for her it had at least enabled her to address la boulaye by the thou of intimacy which the new vocabulary prescribed  la boulaye rose laid aside his pen and politely if coolly returned her greeting and set a chair for her  you are said he a very harbinger of spring citoyenne with your flowers and your ravishing toilette  ah i please you then for once said she without the least embarrassment tell mehow do you find me and laughing she turned about that he might admire her from all points of view  he looked at her gravely for a moment so gravely that the laughter began to fade from her eyes  i find you charming citoyenne he answered at last you remind me of diana  compliments quoth she her eyebrows going up and her eyes beaming with surprise and delight compliments from la boulaye but surely it is the end of the world tell me mon ami she begged greedily angling for more in what do i remind you of the sylvan goddess  in the scantiness of your raiment citoyenne he answered acidly it sorts better with arcadia than with paris  her eyebrows came down her cheeks flushed with resentment and discomfiture to cover this she flung her roses among the papers of his writingtable and dropping into a chair she fanned herself vigorously  citoyenne you relieve my anxieties said he i feared that you stood in danger of freezing  to freeze is no more than one might expect in your company she answered stifling her anger  he made no reply he moved to the window and stood drumming absently on the panes he was inured to these invasions on the part of cecile deshaix and to the bold unwomanly advances that repelled him today his patience with her was even shorter than its wont haply because when his official had announced a woman he had for a moment permitted himself to think that it might be suzanne the silence grew awkward and at last he broke it  the citizen robespierre is well he asked without turning  yes said she and for all that there was chagrin to spare in the glance with which she admired the back of his straight and shapely figure she contrived to render her voice airily indifferent we were at the play last night  ah he murmured politely and was talma in veine  more brilliant than ever answered she  he is a great actor citoyenne  a shade of annoyance crossed her face  why do you always address me as citoyenne she asked with some testiness  he turned at last and looked at her a moment  we live in a censorious world citoyenne he answered gravely  she tossed her head with an exclamation of impatience  we live in a free world citizen freedom is our motto is it for nothing that we are republicans  freedom of action begets freedom of words said he and freedom of words leads to freedom of criticismand that is a thing to which no wise woman will expose herself no matter under what regime we live you would be welladvised citoyenne in thinking of that when you come here  but you never come to us caron she returned in a voice of mild complaint you have not been once to duplays since your return from belgium and you seem different too since your journey to the army she rose now and approached him what is it cher caron she asked her voice a very caress of seductiveness her eyes looking up into his is something troubling you  troubling me he echoed musingly no but then i am a busy man citoyenne  a wave of red seemed to sweep across her face and her heel beat the parquet floor  if you call me citoyenne again i shall strike you she threatened him  he looked down at her and she had the feeling that behind the inscrutable mask of his countenance he was laughing at her  it would sort well with your audacity he made answer coolly  she felt in that moment that she hated him and it was a miracle that she did not do as she had threatened for with all her meek looks she owned a very fiercest of tempers she drew back a pace or two and her glance fell  i shall not trouble you in future she vowed i shall not come here again  he bowed slightly  i applaud the wisdom of your resolvecitcecile the world as i have said is censorious  she looked at him a second then she laughed but it was laughter of the lips only the eyes looked steely as daggers and as capable of mischief  adieu citizen la boulaye she murmured mockingly  au revoir citoyenne deshaix he replied urbanely  ough she gasped and with that sudden exclamation of pentup wrath she whisked about and went rustling to the door  citoyenne he called after her you are forgetting your flowers  she halted and seemed for a second to hesitate looking at him oddly then she came back to the table and took up her roses again she looked at him and let the bouquet fall back among the papers  i brought them for you caron she said and ill leave them with you we can at least be friends can we not  friends but were we ever aught else he asked  alas no she said to herself whilst aloud she murmured i thought that you would like them your room has such a gloomy sombre air and a few roses seem to diffuse some of the sunshine on which they have been nurtured  you are too good cecile he answered and for all his coldness he was touched a little by this thoughtfulness  she looked up at the altered tone and the expression of her face seemed to soften but before she could make answer there was a rap at the door it opened and brutus stood in the doorway  citizen he announced in his sour tones there is another woman below asking to see you  la boulaye started as again his thoughts flew to suzanne and a dull flush crept into his pale cheeks and mounted to his brow ceciles eyes were upon him her glance hardening as she observed these signs bitter enough had it been to endure his coldness whilst she had imagined that it sprang from the austerity of his nature and the absorption of his soul in matters political but now that it seemed she might have cause to temper her bitterness with jealousy her soul was turned to gall  what manner of woman brutus he asked after a seconds pause  tall pale straight black hair black eyes silk gownand savours the aristocrat a league off answered brutus  your official seems gifted with a very comprehensive eye said cecile tartly  but la boulaye paid no heed to her the flush deepened on his face then faded again and he grew oddly pale his officials inventory of her characteristics fitted mademoiselle de bellecour in every detail  admit her brutus he commanded and his voice had a husky sound then turning to cecile you will give me leave he said cloaking rude dismissal in its politest form  assuredly she answered bitterly making shift to go your visitor is no doubt political she halfasked halfasserted  but he made no answer as he held the door for her and bowed low as she passed out with a white face and lips tightly compressed she went and halfway on the stairs she met a handsome woman tall and of queenly bearing who ascended her toilette lacked the elaborateness of ceciles but she carried it with an air which not all the modistes of france could have succeeded in imparting to the citoyenne deshaix  so dead was robespierres niece to every sense of fitness that having drawn aside to let the woman pass she stood gazing after her until she disappeared round the angle of the landing then in a fury she swept from the house and into her waiting coach and as she drove back to duplays in the rue st honore she was weeping bitterly in her jealous rage     chapter xvii la boulayes promise   la boulaye remained a moment by the door after ceciles departure then he moved away towards his desk striving to master the tumultuous throbbing of his pulses his eye alighted on ceciles roses and scarce knowing why he did it he picked them up and flung them behind a bookcase it was but done when again the door opened and his official ushered in mademoiselle de bellecour  oddly enough at sight of her la boulaye grew master of himself he received her with a polite and very formal bowa trifle overgraceful for a patriot  so citoyenne said he and so cold was his voice that it seemed even tinged with mockery you are come at last  i could not come before monsieur she answered trembling they would not let me then after a seconds pause am i too late monsieur she asked  no he answered her the cidevant vicomte dombreval still lies awaiting trial will you not be seated  i do not look to remain long  as you please citoyenne i have delayed ombrevals trial thinking that if not my letter why then his might bring you sooner or later to his rescue it may interest you to hear he continued with an unmistakable note of irony that that brave but hapless gentleman is much fretted at his incarceration  a shadow crossed her face which remained otherwise calm and composed the beautiful intrepid face that had more than once been la boulayes undoing  i am glad that you have waited monsieur in so doing you need have no doubts concerning me m dombreval is my betrothed and the troth i plighted him binds me in honour to succour him now  la boulaye looked steadily at her for a moment  upon my soul he said at last a note of ineffable sarcasm vibrating in his voice i shall never cease to admire the effrontery of your class and the coolness with which in despite of dishonourable action you make highsounding talk of honour and the things to which it binds you i have a dim recollection citoyenne of something uncommonly like your troth which you plighted me one night at boisvert but so little did that promise bind you that when i sought to enforce your fulfilment of it you broke my head and left me to die in the road  his words shook her out of her calm her bosom rose and fell her eyes seemed to grow haggard and her hands were clasped convulsively  monsieur she answered when i gave you my promise that night i had every intention of keeping it i swear it as heaven is my witness  your actions more than proved it he said dryly  be generous monsieur she begged it was my mother prevailed upon me to alter my determination she urged that i should be dishonoured if i did not  that word again he cried what part it plays in the life of the noblesse all that it suits you to do you do because honour bids you all to which you have bound yourselves but which is distasteful you discover that honour forbids and that you would be dishonoured did you persist but i am interrupting you citoyenne did your mother advance any arguments  the strongest argument of all lay here in my heart monsieur she answered him roused and hardened by his scorn you must see that it had become with me a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils upon reflection i discovered that i was bound to two men and it behoved me to keep the more binding of my pledges  which you discovered to be your word to ombreval he said and his voice grew unconsciously softer for he began to realise the quandary in which she had found herself  she inclined her head assentingly  to him i had given the earlier promise and then again he was of my own class whilst you  spare me citoyenne he cried i know what you would say i am of the rabble and of little more account in a matter of honour than a beast of the field it is thus that you reason and yet mon dieu i had thought that ere now such notions had died out with you and that stupid enough though your class has proved itself it would at least have displayed the intelligence to perceive that its day is ended its sun set he turned and paced the apartment as he spoke the lilies of france have been shorn from their stems they have withered by the roadside and they have been trampled into the dust by the men of the new regime and yet it seems that you others of the noblesse have not learnt your lesson you have not yet discovered that here in france the man who was born a tiller of the soil is still a man and by his manhood the equal of a king who after all can be no more than a man and is sometimes less enfin he ended brusquely this is not the national assembly and i talk to ears untutored in such things let us deal rather with the business upon which you are come  she eyed him out of a pale face with eyes that seemed fascinated that short burst of the fiery eloquence that had made him famous revealed him to her in a new light the light of a strength and capacity above and beyond that which already she had perceived was his  will you believe monsieur that it cost me many tears to use you as i did if you but knew and there she paused abruptly she had all but told him of the kiss that she had left upon his unconscious lips that evening on the road to liege mon dieu how i hated myself and she shuddered as she spoke  he observed all this and with a brusqueness that was partly assumed he hastened to her rescue  what is done is done citoyenne come let us leave reminiscences you are here to atone i take it  at that she started his words reminded her of those of his letter  monsieur la boulaye  if it is all one to you citoyenne i should prefer that you call me citizen  citizen then she amended i have brought with me the gems which i told you would constitute my dowry in his letter to me the vicomte suggested that she paused  that some republican blackguard might be bribed he concluded very gently  his gentleness deceived her she imagined that it meant that he might not be unwilling to accept such a bribe and thereupon she set herself to plead with him he listened dispassionately his hands behind his back his eyes bent upon her yet betraying nothing of his thoughts at last she brought her prayer for ombrevals life to an end and produced a small leather bag which she set upon the table beseeching him to satisfy himself as to the value of the contents  now at last he stirred his face grew crimson to the roots of his hair and his eyes seemed of a sudden to take fire he seized that little bag and held it in his hand  and so mademoiselle de bellecour said he in a concentrated voice you have learnt so little of me that you bring me a bribe of gems am i a helot that you should offer to buy my very soul do you think my honour is so cheap a thing that you can have it for the matter of some bits of glass or do you imagine that we of the new regime because we do not mouth the word at every turn have no such thing as honour for shame he paused his wrath boiling over as he sought words in which to give it utterance and then words failing him to express the half of what was in him he lifted the bag high above his head and hurled it at her feet with a force that sent half the glittering contents rolling about the parquet floor citoyenne your journey has been in vain i will not treat with you another instant  she recoiled before his wrath a white and frightened thing that but an instant back had been so calm and selfpossessed she gave no thought to the flashing jewels scattered about the floor through all the fear that now possessed her rose the consideration of this manthis man whom she had almost confessed halfshamedly to herself that she loved that night on the liege road this man who at every turn amazed her and filled her with a new sense of his strength and dignity  then bethinking her of ombreval and of her mission she took her courage in both hands and advancing a step she cast herself upon her knees before caron  monsieur forgive me she besought him i meant you no insult how could i when my every wish is to propitiate you bethink you monsieur i have journeyed all the way from prussia to save that man because my honbecause he is my betrothed remember monsieur you held out to me the promise in your letter that if i came you would treat with me and that i might buy his life from you  why so i did he answered touched by her humiliation and her tears but you went too fast in your conclusions  forgive me that see i am on my knees to you am i not humbled enough have i not suffered enough for the wrong i may have done you  it would take the sufferings of a generation to atone for the wrongs i have endured at the hands of your family citoyenne  i will do what you will monsieur bethink you that i am pleading for the life of the man i am to marry  he looked down upon her now in an emotion that in its way was as powerful as her own yet his voice was hard and sternly governed as he now asked her  is that an argument mademoiselle is it an argument likely to prevail with the man who for his twiceconfessed love of you has suffered sore trials  he felt that in a way she had conquered him his career which but that day had seemed allsufficing to him was now fallen into the limbo of disregard the one thing whose possession would render his life a happy one whose absence would leave him now a lasting unhappiness knelt here at his feet forgotten were the wrongs he had suffered forgotten the purpose to humble and to punish everything was forgotten and silenced by the compelling voice of his blood which cried out that he loved her he stooped to her and caught her wrists in a grip that made her wince his voice grew tense  if you would bribe me to save his life suzanne there is but one price that you can pay  and that she gasped her eyes looking up with a scared expression into his masterful face  yourself he whispered with an ardour that almost amounted to fierceness  she gazed a second at him in growing alarm then she dragged her hands from his grasp and covering her face she fell asobbing  do not misunderstand me he cried as he stood erect over her if you would have ombreval saved and sent out of france you must become my wife  your wife she echoed pausing in her weeping and for a moment an odd happiness seemed to fill her but as suddenly as it had arisen did she stifle it was she not the noble daughter of the noble marquis de bellecour and was not this a lowly born member of a rabble government there could be no such mating a shudder ran through her i cannot monsieur i cannot she sobbed  he looked at her a moment with a glance that was almost of surprise then with a slight compression of the lips and the faintest raising of the shoulders he turned from her and strode over to the window there was a considerable concourse of people on their way to the place de la republique for the hour of the tumbrils was at hand  a halfdozen of those unsexed viragos produced by the revolution in filthy garments red bonnets and streaming hair were marching by to the raucous chorus of the ca ira  he turned from the sight in disgust and again faced his visitor  citoyenne he said in a composed voice i am afraid that your journey has been in vain  she rose now from her knees and advanced towards him  monsieur you will not be so cruel as to send me away emptyhanded she cried scarce knowing what she was saying  but he looked at her gravely and without any sign of melting  on what he asked do you base any claim upon me  on what she echoed and her glance was troubled with perplexity then of a sudden it cleared on the love that you have confessed for me she cried  he laughed a short laughhalf amazement half scorn  mon dieu he exclaimed tossing his arms to heaven a fine claim that as i live a fine argument by which to induce me to place another man in your arms i am to do it because i love you  they gazed at each other now she with a glance of strained anxiety he with the same look of halfcontemptuous wonder and then a creaking rumble from below attracted his attention and he looked round he moved forward and threw the window wide letting in with the march air an odd medley of sounds to which the rolling of drums afforded a most congruous accompaniment  look citoyenne he said and he pointed out the first tumbril which was coming round the corner of the rue st honore  she approached with some shrinking begotten by a suspicion of what she was desired to see  in the street below among a vociferating crowd of all sorts and conditions the black deathcart moved on its way to the guillotine it was preceded by a company of national guards and followed by the drummers and another company on foot within the fatal vehicle travelled three men and two women accompanied by a constitutional priestone of those renegades who had taken the oath imposed by the convention the two women sat motionless more like statues than living beings their faces livid and horribly expressionless so numbed were their intelligences by fear of the men one stood calm and dignified another knelt at his prayers and was subject therefore to the greater portion of the gibes the mob was offering these poor victims the third a very elegant gentleman in a green coat and buckskin breeches leant nonchalantly upon the rail of the tumbril and exchanged gibes with the people all five of them were in the prime of life and by their toilettes and the air that clung to them belonged unmistakably to the noblesse  one glance did mademoiselle bestow upon that tragic spectacle then with a shudder she drew back her face going deathly white  why did you bid me look she moaned  that for yourself you might see he answered pitilessly the road by which your lover is to journey  mon dieu she cried wringing her hands it is horrible oh you are not men you revolutionists you are beasts of prey tigers in human semblance  he shrugged his shoulders  great injustices beget great reactions great wrongs can only be balanced by great wrongs for centuries the power has lain with the aristocrats and they have most foully abused it for centuries the people of france have writhed beneath the armed heel of the nobility and their blood unjustly and wantonly shed has saturated the soil until from that seed has sprung this overwhelming retribution nownow when it is too lateyou are repenting now when at last some twentyfive million frenchmen have risen with weapons in their hands to purge the nation of you we are no worse than were you indeed not so bad it is only that we do in a little whileand therefore while it lasts in greater quantitywhat you have been doing through countless generations  spare me these arguments monsieur she cried recovering her spirit the whys and wherefores of it are nothing to me i see what you are doing and that is enough but and her voice grew gentle and pleading her hands were held out to him you are good at heart monsieur you are generous and you can be noble you will give me the life that i have come to beg of you the life you promised me  yes but upon terms mademoiselle and those terms you have heard  she looked a moment into that calm set face into the dark grey eyes that looked so solemn and betrayed so little of what was passing within  and you say that you love me she cried  helas he sighed it is a weakness i cannot conquer  look well down into your heart m la boulaye she answered him and you will find how egregious is your error you do not love me you love yourself and only yourself if you loved me you would not seek to have me when i am unwilling above all things you would desire my happinessit is ever so when we truly loveand you would seek to promote it if indeed you loved me you would grant my prayer and not torture me as you are doing but since you only love yourself you minister only to yourself and seek to win me by force since you desire me  she ceased and her eyes fell before his glance which remained riveted upon her face immovable he stood a moment or two then he turned from her with a little sigh and leaning his elbow upon the windowsill he gazed down into the crowds surging about the second tumbril but although he saw much there that was calculated to compel attention he heeded nothing his thoughts were very busy and he was doing what mademoiselle had bidden him he was looking into himself and from that questioning he gathered not only that he loved her but that he loved her so well and so truly thatin spite even of all that was passedhe must do her will and deliver up to her the man she loved  his resolve was but half taken when he heard her stirring in the room behind him he turned sharply to find that she had gained the door  mademoiselle he called after her she stopped and as she turned he observed that her lashes were wet but in her heart there arose now a fresh hope awakened by the name by which he had recalled her whither are you going he asked  away monsieur she answered i was realising that my journey had indeed been in vain  he looked at her a second in silence then stepping forward  mademoiselle he said very quietly your arguments have prevailed and it shall be as you desire the cidevant vicomte dombreval shall go free  her face seemed to grow of a sudden paler and for an instant she stood still as if robbed of understanding then she came forward with hands outheld  said i not that you were good and generous said i not that you could be noble monsieur she cried as she caught his resisting hand and sought to carry it to her lips god will bless you monsieur  he drew his hand away but without roughness let us say no more mademoiselle he begged  but i will she answered him i am not without heart monsieur and now that you have given me this proof of the deep quality of your love i she paused as if at a loss for words  well mademoiselle he urged her  i have it in my heart to wish thatthat it were otherwise she said her cheeks reddening under his gaze if it were not that i account myself in honour bound to wed m le vicomte  stop he interrupted her he had caught at last the drift of what she was saying there is no need for any comedy suzanne enough of that had we at boisvert  it is not comedy she cried with heat it was not altogether comedy at boisvert  true he said wilfully misunderstanding her that he might the more easily dismiss the subject it went nearer to being tragedy then abruptly he asked her  where are you residing  she paused before replying she still wanted to protest that some affection for him dwelt in her heart although curbed to a greater extent even than she was aware by the difference in their stations and checked by her plighted word to ombreval at last abandoning a purpose which his countenance told her would be futile  i am staying with my old nurse at choisy she answered him henriette godelliere is her name she is well known in the village and seems in good favour with the patriots so that i account myself safe i am believed to be her niece from the country  hum he snorted the citoyenne godellieres niece from the country in silks  that is what someone questioned and she answered that it was a gown plundered from the wardrobe of some emigrated aristocrats  have a care suzanne said he the times are dangerous and it is a matter of a week ago since a man was lanterne for no other reason than because he was wearing gloves which was deemed an aristocratic habit come mademoiselle let us gather up your gems you were going without them some moments ago  and down upon his knees he went and taking up the little bag which had been left where he had flung it he set himself to restore the jewels to it she came to his assistance in spite of his protestations and so within a moment or two the task was completed and the little treasure was packed away in the bosom of her gown  tomorrow he said as he took his leave of her at the door i shall hope to bring the cidevant vicomte to choisy and i will see that he is equipped with a laissezpasser that will carry both of you safely out of france  she was beginning to thank him all over again but he cut her short and so they parted  long after she was gone did he sit at his writingtable his head in his hands and his eyes staring straight before him his face looked grey and haggard the lines that seared it were lines of pain  they say he murmured once thinking aloud as men sometimes will in moments of great stress that a good action brings its own reward perhaps my action is not a good one after all and that is why i suffer  and burying his head in his arms he remained thus with his sorrow until his official entered to inquire if he desired lights     chapter xviii the incorruptible   it was towards noon of the following day when caron la boulaye presented himself at the house of duplay the cabinetmaker in the rue st honore and asked of the elderly female who admitted him if he might see the citizendeputy robespierre  a berline stood at the door the postillion at the horses heads and about it there was some bustle as if in preparation of a departure but la boulaye paid no heed to it as he entered the house  he was immediately conducted upstairs to the incorruptibles apartmentfor he was too well known to so much as need announcing in answer to the womans knock a gentle almost plaintive voice from within bade them enter and thus was caron ushered into the humble dwelling of the humble and ineffectivelooking individual whose power already transcended that of any other man in france and who was destined to become still more before his ephemeral star went out  into that unpretentious and rather closesmelling roomfor it was bedchamber as well as diningroom and studystepped la boulaye unhesitatingly with the air of a man who is intimate with his surroundings and assured of his welcome in them in the righthand corner stood the bed on which the clothes were still tumbled in the centre of the chamber was a table all littered with the disorder of a meal partaken on the left by the window sat robespierre at his writingtable and from the overmantel at the back of the room a marble counterpart of robespierres own head and shoulders looked down upon the newcomer there were a few pictures on the whitewashed walls and a few objects of art about the chamber but in the main it had a comfortless air which may in part have resulted from the fact that no fire had been lighted  the great man tossed aside his pen and rose as the door closed after the entering visitor pushing his hornrimmed spectacles up on to his forehead he stretched out his hand to la boulaye  it is you caron he murmured in that plaintive voice of his it was a voice that sorted well with the humane man who had resigned a judgeship at arras sooner than pass a deathsentence but hardly so well with him who as public prosecutor in paris had brought some hundreds of heads to the sawdust i have been desiring to congratulate you upon your victory of yesterday he continued even as i have been congratulating myself upon the fact that it was i who found you and gave you to the nation i feared that i might not see you ere i left  you are leaving paris asked la boulaye without heeding the compliments in the earlier part of the others speech  for a few days business of the nation my friend but youlet us talk of you do you know that i am proud of you cher caron your eloquence turned danton green with jealousy and as for poor vergniaud it extinguished him utterly ma foi if you continue as you have begun the day may not be far distant when you will become the patron and i the protege and his weak eyes beamed pleasantly from out of that unhealthy pale face  outwardly he had changed little since his first coming to paris to represent the third estate of artoise saving his cheeks were grown more hollow upon his dress he still bestowed the same unpretentious care that had always characterised it which in one of the most prominent patriots of the mountain amounted almost to foppishness blue coat white waistcoat silk hose and shoes buckled with silver gave him an elegant exterior that must have earned him many a covert sneer from his colleagues his sloping forehead was crowned by a periwig sedulously curled and powderedfor all that with the noblesse this was already a discarded fashion  la boulaye replied to his patrons compliments with the best grace he could command considering how full of another matter was his mind  i may congratulate myself maximilien he added upon my good fortune in coming before you took your departure i have a request to prefer a favour to ask  tut who talks of favours not you caron i hope you have but to name what you desire and so that it lies within my power to accord it the thing is yours  there is a prisoner in the luxembourg in whom i am interested i seek his enlargement  but is that all cried the little man and without more ado he turned to his writingtable and drew a printed form from among the chaos of documents his name he asked indifferently as he dipped his quill in the inkhorn and scratched his signature at the foot of it  an aristocrat said caron with some slight hesitancy  eh and the arched brows drew together for an instant but no matter there are enough and to spare even for fouquiertinvillles voracious appetite his name  the cidevant vicomte antole dombreval  quica the question rang sharp as a pistolshot sounding the more fearful by virtue of the contrast with the gentle tones in which robespierre had spoken hitherto the little mans face grew evil dombreval he cried but what is this man to you it is by your favour alone that i have let him live so long but now he stopped short what is your interest in this man he demanded and the question was so fiercely put as to suggest that it would be well for la boulaye that he should prove that interest slight indeed  but whatever feelings may have been swaying caron at the moment fear was not one of them  my interest in him is sufficiently great to cause me to seek his freedom at your hands he answered with composure  robespierre eyed him narrowly for a moment peering at him over his spectacles which he had drawn down on to his tiptilted nose then the fierceness died out of his mien and manner as suddenly as it had sprung up he became once more the weaklooking ineffectual man that had first greeted la boulaye urbane and quiet but coldcold as ice  i am desolated my dear caron but you have asked me for the one man in the prisons of france whose life i cannot yield you he is from artois and there is an old score twixt him and me twixt his family and mine they were the grands seigneurs of the land on which we were born these ombrevals and i could tell you of wrongs committed by them which would make you shudder in horror this one shall atone in the small measure we can enforce from him it was to this end that i ordered you to effect his capture have patience dear caron and forgive me that i cannot grant your request as i have said i am desolated that it should be so ask me if you will the life of any otheror any dozen othersand they are yours but ombreval must die  caron stood a moment in silent dismay here was an obstacle upon which he had not counted when he had passed his word to suzanne to effect the release of her betrothed at all costs he must gain it he told himself and to that end he now set himself to plead advancing as his only argumentbut advancing it with a fervour that added to its weightthat he stood pledged to save the cidevant vicomte robespierre looked up at him with a shade of polite regret upon his cadaverous face and with polite regret he deplored that caron should have so bound himself  so absorbed were they the one in pleading the other in resisting that neither noticed the opening of the door nor yet the girl who stood observing them from the threshold  if this man dies cried la boulaye at last i am dishonoured  it is regrettable returned robespierre that you should have pledged your word in the matter you will confess caron that it was a little precipitate enfin he ended crumpling the document he had signed and tossing it under the table you must extricate yourself as best you can i am sorry but i cannot give him to you  carons face was very white and his hands were clenched convulsively it is questionable whether in that moment he had not flung himself upon the incorruptible and enforced that which hitherto he had only besought but that in that instant the girl stepped into the room  and is it really you caron came the melodious voice of cecile  la boulaye started round to confront her and stifled a curse at the untimely interruption which robespierre was blessing as most timely  it isit is citoyenne he answered shortly to add more shortly still i am here on business with the citizen your uncle  but before the girl could so much as appreciate the rebuke he levelled at her intrusion her uncle had come to the rescue  the business however is at an end take charge of this good caron cecile whilst i make ready for my journey  thus sore at heart and chagrined beyond words la boulaye was forced to realise his defeat and to leave the presence of the incorruptible but with cecile he went no farther than the landing  if you will excuse me citoyenne he said abstractedly i will take my leave of you  but i shall not excuse you caron she said refusing to see his abstraction you will stay to dinner  i am sorry beyond measure but  you shall stay she interrupted come caron it is months since you were with us we will make a little fete in honour of your yesterdays triumph she promised him sidling up to him with a bewitching glance of blue eyes and the most distracting toss of golden curls upon an ivory neck  but to such seductions caron proved as impervious as might a man of stone he excused himself with cold politeness the nations business was awaiting him he might not stay  the nations business may await you a little longer she declared taking hold of his arm with both hands and had she left it at that it is possible that she had won her way with him but most indiscreetly she added  come caron you shall tell me who was your yesterdays visitor do you know that the sight of her made me jealous was it not foolish in me  and now from cold politeness la boulaye passed to hot impoliteness roughly he shook her detaining hands from him and with hardly so much as a word of farewell he passed down the stairs leaving her white with passion at the slight he had thereby put upon her  the beauty seemed to pass out of her face much as the meekness was wont to pass out of her uncles when he was roused her blue eyes grew steely and cruel as she looked after him  wait caron she muttered to herself i will cry quits with you and then with a sob of anger she turned and mounted the stairs to her apartments     chapter xix the theft   la boulaye sat once more in the rue nationale and with his head in his hands his elbows supported by the writingtable he stared before him his face drawn with the pain and anger of the defeat he had sustained where no defeat had been expected  he had been so assured that he had but to ask for ombrevals life and it would be accorded him he had promised suzanne with such confidenceboasting almostthat he could do this and to do it he had pledged his word and now for very shame he could not go to her and tell her that despite his fine promises despite his bold bargaining he was as powerless to liberate ombreval as was she herself  and with reflection he came to see that even did he bear her such a tale she would not believe it the infinite assurance of his power implicit in everything that he had said to her must now arise in her memory and give the lie to his present confession of powerlessness she would not believe him and disbelieving him she would seek a motive for the words that she would deem untrue and that motive she would not find far to seek she would account his present attitude the consummation of a miserable subterfuge by which he sought to win her confidence and esteem she wouldshe mustbelieve that he had but made a semblance of befriending her so disinterestedly only that he might enlist her kindness and regard and turn them presently to his own purposes she would infer that he had posed as unselfishas selfsacrificing almostonly that he might win her esteem and that by telling her now that robespierre was inflexible in his resolve to send ombreval to the guillotine he sought to retain that esteem whilst doing nothing for it that he had ever intended to save ombreval she would not credit she would think it all a cunning scheme to win his own ends and now he bethought him of the grief that would beset her upon learning that her journey had indeed been fruitless he smote the table a blow with his clenched hand and cursed the whole republic from robespierre down to the meanest sansculotte that brayed the ca ira in the streets of paris  he had pledged his word and for all that he belonged to the class whose right to honour was denied by the aristocrats his word he had never yet broken that circumstanceas personified by maximilien robespierreshould break it for him now was matter enough to enrage him for than this never had there been an occasion on which such a breach could have been less endurable  he rose to his feet and set himself to pace the chamber driven to action of body by the agonised activity of his mind from the street rose the cry of the pastrycook going his daily rounds as it had risen yesterday he remembered when suzanne had been with him and now of a sudden he stood still his lips were compressed his brows drawn together in a forbidding scowl and his eyes narrowed until they seemed almost closed then with his clenched right hand he smote the open palm of the other his resolve was taken by fair means or foul with robespierres sanction or without it he would keep his word after not only the hope but the assurance he had given suzanne that her betrothed should go free he could do no less than accomplish the vicomtes enlargement by whatever means should present themselves  and now to seek a way he recalled the free pardon to which robespierre had gone the length of appending his signature he remembered that it had not been destroyed robespierre had crumpled it in his hand and tossed it aside and by now robespierre would have departed and it should not be difficult for himthe protege and intimate of robespierreto gain access to the incorruptibles room  if only he could find that document and fill in the name of ombreval the thing would be as good as done true he would require the signatures of three other deputies but one of these he could supply himself and another two were easily to be requisitioned seeing that already it bore robespierres  and then as suddenly as the idea of the means had come to him came now the spectre of the consequences to affright him how would it fare with him on robespierres return how angered would not robespierre be upon discovering that his wishes had been set at naught his very measures contravenedand this by fraud and than robespierres anger there were few things more terrible in 93 it was an anger that shore away heads as recklessly as wayside flowers are flicked from their stems by the idlers cane  for a second it daunted him if he did this thing he must seek refuge in flight he must leave france abandon the career which was so full of promise for him and wander abroad a penniless fortunehunter well might the prospect give him pause well might it cause him to survey that pale sardonic countenance that eyed him gloomily from the mirror above his mantel shelf and ask it mockingly if it thought that suzanne de bellecouror indeed any woman livingwere worthy of so great a sacrifice  what had she done for him that he should cast away everything for her sake once she had told him that she loved him only to betray him was that a woman for whom a man should wanton his fortunes and then he smiled derisively mocking his reflections in the mirror even as he mocked himself  poor fool he muttered it is not for the sake of what you are to her were it for that alone you would not stir a finger to gratify her wishes it is for the sake of what she is to you caron  he turned from the mirror his resolve now firm and going to the door he called his official briefly he instructed brutus touching the packing of a valise which he would probably need that night  you are going a journey citizen inquired brutus to which la boulaye returned a short answer in the affirmative do i accompany you inquired the official to which la boulaye shook his head  at that brutus who for all his insolence of manner was very devotedly attached to his employer broke into remonstrances impertinent of diction but affectionate of tenor he protested that la boulaye had left him behind and lonely during his mission to the army in belgium and he vowed that he would not be left behind again  well well we shall see brutus answered the deputy laying his hand upon the fellows shoulder but i am afraid that this time i am going farther than you would care to come  the mans ferrety eyes were raised of a sudden to la boulayes face in a very searching glance carons tone had been laden with insinuation  you are running way cried the official  sh my good brutus what folly why should i run awayand from whom pray  i know not that but you are i heard it in your voice and you do not trust me citizen la boulaye the fellow added in a stricken voice i have served you faithfully these two years and yet you have not learnt to trust me  i do i do my friend you go too fast with your conclusions now see to my valise and on my return perhaps ill tell you where i am going and put your fidelity to the test  and you will take me with you  why yes la boulaye promised him unless you should prefer to remain in paris  with that he got away and leaving the house he walked briskly up the street round the corner and on until he stood once more before duplays  has the citizen robespierre departed yet he inquired of the woman who answered his peremptory knock  he has been gone this hour citizen la boulaye she answered he started almost immediately after you left him  diable grumbled caron with wellfeigned annoyance quel contretemps i have left a most important document in his room and of course it will be locked  but the citoyenne cecile has the key answered the woman eager to oblige him  why yesnaturally now that is fortunate will you do me the favour to procure the key from he citoyenne for a few moments telling her of course that it is i who need it  but certainly montez citoyen and with a wave of the hand towards the stairs she went before him  he followed leisurely and by the time he had reached robespierres door her voice floated down to him from above calling the incorruptibles niece next he heard ceciles voice replying and then a whispered conference on the landing overhead to the accompaniment of the occasional tinkle of a bunch of keys  presently the domestic returned and unlocking the door she held it open for la boulaye to pass from her attitude it seemed to caron as if she were intentionedprobably she had been instructedto remain there while he obtained what he sought now he had no mind that she should see him making his quest among the wasted papers on the floor and so  i shall not be more than a few minutes he announced quietly i will call you when i am ready to depart  thus uncompromisingly dismissed she did not venture to remain and passing in la boulaye closed the door as great as had been his deliberation hitherto was now the feverish haste with which he crossed to the spot where he had seen the document flung he caught up a crumpled sheet and opened it out it was not the thing he sought he cast it aside and took up another with no better luck to crumple discarded papers seemed the habit of the incorruptible for there was a very litter of them on the ground one after another did caron investigate without success he was on his knees now and his exploration had carried him as far as the table another moment and he was grovelling under it still at his search which with each fresh disappointment grow more feverish  yonderby the leg of the incorruptibles chairhe espied the ball of paper and to reach it he stretched to his full length lying prone beneath a table in an attitude scarce becoming a deputy of the french republic but it was worth the effort and the disregard of dignity for when presently on his knees he smoothed out that document he discovered it to be the one he sought the order upon the gaolers of the luxembourg to set at liberty a person or persons whose names were to be filled in signed by maximilien robespierre  he rose absorbed in his successful find and he pursued upon the table the process of smoothing the creases as much as possible from that priceless document that done he took up a pen and attached his own signature alongside of robespierres then into the blank space above he filled the name of anatole dombreval cidevant vicomte dombreval he dropped the pen and took up the sandbox he sprinkled the writing creased the paper and dusted the sand back into the receptacle and then of a sudden his blood seemed to freeze and beads of cold sweat stood out upon his brow there had been the very slightest stir behind him and with it had come a warm breath upon his bowed neck someone was looking over his shoulder an instant he remained in that bowed attitude with head halfraised then suddenly straightening himself he swung round and came face to face with cecile deshaix  confronting each other and very close they now stood and each was breathing with more than normal quickness her cheeks were white her nostrils dilated and quivering her blue eyes baleful and cruel whilst her lips wore never so faint a smile for a second la boulaye looked the very picture of foolishness and alarm then it seemed as if he drew a curtain and his face assumed the expressionless mask that was habitual to it in moments of great tension instinctively he put behind him his hands which held the paper ceciles lips took on an added curl of scorn as she observed the act  you thief she said very low but very fiercely that was the paper that you left behind you was it  the paper that i have is certainly the paper that i left behind he answered serenely for he had himself well in hand by now and as for dubbing me a thief so readilyhe paused and shrugged his shouldersyou are a woman he concluded with an air suggesting that that fact was a conclusion to all things  fool she blazed do you think to overcome me by quibbles do you think to dupe me with words and shrugs  my dear cecile he begged halfwhimsically may i implore you to use some restraint inured as i am to the unbounded licence of your tongue and to the abandon that seems so inherent in you let me assure you that  ah you can say cecile now she cried leaving the remainder of his speech unheeded now that you need me now that you want me to be a party to your treacherous designs against my uncle oh you can say cecile and dear cecile instead of your everlasting citoyenne  it seems i am doomed to be always misunderstood by you he laughed and at the sound she started as if he had struck her  had she but looked in his eyes she had seen no laughter there she might have realised that murder rather than mirth was in his soulfor at all costs he was determined to hold the paper he had been at such pains to get  i understand you well enough she cried hotly her cheeks flaming red of a sudden i understand you you thief you trickster do you think that i heard nothing of what passed this morning between my uncle and you do you think i do not know whose name you have written on that paper answer me she commanded him  since you know so much what need for any questions quoth he coolly transferring the coveted paper to his pocket as he spoke and since we are so far agreed that i am not contradicting anything you saynor indeed intend toperhaps you will see the convenience of ending an interview that promises to be fruitless my dear cecile i am very grateful to you for the key of this room i beg that you will make my compliments to the citizen your uncle upon his return and inform him of how thoroughly you ministered to my wants  with that and a superb air of insouciance he made shift to go but fronting him she barred his way  give me that paper sclerat she demanded imperiously you shall not go until you surrender it give it to me or i will call duplay  you may call the devil for aught i care you little fool he answered her very pleasantly do you think duplay will be mad enough to lay hands upon a deputy of the convention in the discharge of the affairs of the nation  it is a lie  why of course it is he admitted sweetly but duplay will not be aware of that  i shall tell him  tut he wont believe you ill threaten him with the guillotine if he does and i should think that duplay has sufficient dread of the national barber not to risk having his toilet performed by him now be reasonable and let me pass  enraged beyond measure by his persiflage and very manifest contempt of her she sprang suddenly upon him and caught at the lapels of his redingote  give me that paper she screamed exerting her entire strength in a vain effort to boldly shake him  coldly he eyed this goldenhaired virago now and looked in vain for some trace of her wonted beauty in the stormy distortion of her face  you grow tiresome with your repetitions he answered her impatiently as snatching at her wrists he made her release her hold let me go and with that he flung her roughly from him  a second she staggered then recovering her balance and without an instants hesitation she sped to the door imagining her intent to be to lock him in la boulaye sprang after her but it seemed that his mind had been more swift to fasten upon the wiser course than had hers instead she snatched the key and closed the door on the inside she wasted a moment fumbling at the lock and even as he caught her by the waist the key slipped in and before he dragged her back she had contrived to turn it and now held it in her hand he laughed a trifle angrily as she twisted out of his grasp and stood panting before him  you shall not leave this room with that paper she gasped her anger ever swelling and now rendering her speech almost incoherent  he set his arms akimbo and surveyed her whimsically  my dear cecile quoth he if you will take no thought for my convenience i beg that at least you will take some for your good name thousand devils woman will you have it said in paris that you were found locked in a room with me what will your uncleyour virtuous prudish incorruptible unclesay when he learns of it if he does not demand a heavy price from you for so dishonouring him he is not the man i deem him now be sensible child and open that door while there is yet time and before anybody discovers us in this most compromising situation  he struck the tone most likely to win him obedience and that he had judged astutely her face showed him in the place of the anger that had distorted it there came now into that countenance a look of surprise and fear she saw herself baffled at every point she had threatened him with duplaythe only man availableand he had shown her how futile it must prove to summon him and now she had locked herself in with him thinking to sit there until he should do her will and he showed her the danger to herself therein which had escaped her notice  there was a settle close behind her and on to this she sank and bending her head she opened the floodgates of her passionate little soul and let the rage that had so long possessed her dissolve in tears at sight of that sudden change of front la boulaye stamped his foot he appreciated the fact that she was about to fight him with weapons that on a previous occasionwhen however it is true they were wielded by anotherhad accomplished his undoing  and for all that he steeled his heart and evoked the memory of suzanne to strengthen him in his purpose he approached her with a kindly exterior he sat him down beside her he encompassed her waist with his arm and drawing her to him he set himself to soothe her as one soothes a wilful child had he then recalled what her attitude had been towards him in the past he had thought twice before adopting such a course but in his mind there was no sentiment that was not brotherly and far from his wishes was it to invest his action with any other than a fraternal kindness  but she feeling that caressing arm about her and fired by it in her hapless passion for this man was quick to misinterpret him and to translate his attitude into one of a kindness far beyond his dreams she nestled closer to him at his bidding her weeping died down and ceased  there cecile you will give me the key now he begged  she glanced up at him shyly through wet lashesas peeps the sun through april clouds  there is nothing i will not do for you caron she murmured see i will even help you to play the traitor on my uncle for you love me a little cher caron is it not so  he felt himself grow cold from head to foot and he grew sick at the thought that by the indiscretion of his clumsy sympathy he had brought this down upon his luckless head mechanically his arm relaxed the hold of her waist and fell away instinctively she apprehended that all was not as she had thought she turned on the seat to face him squarely and caught something of the dismay in his glance of the loathing almost for what is more loathsome to a man than to be wooed by a woman he desires not gradually inch by inch she drew away from him ever facing him and her eyes ever on his as if fascinated by the horror of what she saw thus until the extremity of the settle permitted her to go no farther she started then her glance flickered down and she gave a sudden gasp of passion simultaneously the key rang on the boards at carons feet angrily flung there by cecile  go she exclaimed in a suffocating voice and never let me see your face again  for a second or two he sat quite still his eyes observing her with a look of ineffable pity which might have increased her disorder had she perceived it then slowly he stooped and took up the key  he rose from the settle and without a wordfor words he realised could do no more than heighten the tragic banality of the situationhe went to the door unlocked it and passed out  huddled in her corner sat cecile listening until his steps had died away on the stairs then she cast herself prone upon the settle and in a frenzy of sobs and tears she vented some of the rage and shame that were distracting her     chapter xx the gratitude of ombreval   what la boulaye may have lacked in knowledge of womans ways he made up for by his knowledge of cecile and from this he apprehended that there was no time to be lost if he would carry out his purpose touching her dismissal of him he permitted himself no illusions he rated it at its true value he saw in it no sign of relenting of generosity but only a desire to put an end to the shame which his presence was occasioning her  he could imagine the lengths to which the thirst of vengeance would urge a scorned woman and of all women he felt that cecile scorned was the most to be feared she would not sit with folded hands once she overcame the first tempestuous outburst of her passion she would be up and doing straining every sense to outwit and thwart him in his project whose scope she must have more than guessed  reasoning thus he clearly saw not only that every moment was of value but that flight was the only thing remaining him if he would save himself as well as ombreval and so he hired him a cabriolet and drove in all haste to the house of billaud varennes the deputy from whom he sought to obtain one of the two signatures still needed by his order of release he was disappointed at learning that varennes was not at homethough had he been able to peep an hour or so into the future he would have offered up thanks to heaven for that same deputys absence his insistent and impatient questions elicited the information that probably verennes would be found at fevriers and so to fevriers famous restaurant in the old palais royal went la boulaye and there he had the good fortune to find not only billaud varennes but also the deputy carnot nor did fortune end her favours there she was smiling now upon caron as was proved by the fact that neither to varennes nor carnot did the name of ombreval mean anything robespierres subscription of the document was accepted by each as affording him a sufficient warrant to append his own signature and although carnot asked a question or two it was done in an idle humour and he paid little attention to such replies as caron made him  within five minutes of entering the restaurant la boulaye was in the street again driving by way of the pont neuf to the luxembourg  at the prison he encountered not the slightest difficulty he was known personally to the officer of whom he demanded the person of the cidevant vicomte and his order of release was too correct to give rise to any hesitation on the part of the man to whom it was submitted he was left waiting a few moments in a chamber that did duty as a guardroom and presently the vicomte looking pale and trembling with excitement at his sudden release stood before him  you he muttered upon beholding la boulaye but the republican received him very coldly and hurried him out of the prison with scant ceremony  the officer attended the deputy to the door of his cabriolet and in his hearing caron bade the coachman drive to the porte st martin this however was no more than a subterfuge to which he was resorting with a view to baffling the later possibility of their being traced ombreval naturally enough plied him with questions as they went to which la boulaye returned such curt answers that in the end discouraged and offended the nobleman became silent  arrived at the porte st martin they alighted and la boulaye dismissed the carriage on foot he now led his companion as far as the church of st nicholas des champs where he hired a second cabriolet bidding the man drive him to the quai de la greve having reached the riverside they once more took a short walk crossing by the pont au change and thence making their way towards notre dame in the neighbourhood of which la boulaye ushered the vicomte into a third carriage and thinking that by now they had done all that was needed to efface their tracks he ordered the man to proceed as quickly as possible to choisy  they arrived at that little village on the seine an hour or so later and having rid themselves of their conveyance caron inquired and discovered the way to the house of citoyenne godelliere  mademoiselle was within and at sound of carons voice questioning the erstwhile servant who had befriended her she made haste to show herself and at a word from her henriette admitted the two men and ushered them into a modest parlour where she left them with mademoiselle  la boulaye was the first to speak  i trust that i have not kept you waiting overlong citoyenne he said by way of saying something  monsieur she answered him with a look that was full of gratitude and kindliness you have behaved nobly and to my dying day i shall remember it  this la boulaye deprecated by a gesture but uttered no word as the vicomte now stepped forward and bore suzannes hand to his lips  mademoiselle said he monsieur la boulaye here was very reticent touching the manner in which my release has been gained but i never doubted that i owed it to your good efforts and that you had adopted the course suggested to you by my letter and bought me from the republic  la boulaye flushed slightly as much at the contemptuous tone as at the words in which ombreval referred to the republic  it is not to me but to our good friend m la boulaye that you should address your thanks monsieur  ah vraiment exclaimed the vicomte turning a supercilious eye upon the deputy for with his freedom he seemed to have recovered his old habits  i have not sold you to the citoyenne said la boulaye the words being drawn from him by the others manner i am making her a present of youa sort of wedding gift and his lips smiled for all that his eyes remained hard  ombreval made him no answer but stood looking from the deputy to suzanne in some hesitation the expressions which his very lofty dignity prompted his sense of fitnessfeeble though it wasforbade him and so there followed a pause which however was but brief for la boulaye had yet something to say  it had just come to him with a dismaying force that in the haste of his escape from paris with the vicomte he had forgotten to return to his lodging for a passport that he was fortunately possessed of it was a laissezpasser signed and left in blank with which he had been equippedagainst the possibility of the need for it arisingwhen he had started upon the conventions errand to the army of dumouriez whilst on his way to robespierres house to secure the order of release he had bethought him of filling in that passport for three persons and thus since to remain must entail his ruin and destruction make his escape from france with mademoiselle and the vicomte it was his only chance then in the hurry of the succeeding incidents the excitement that had attended them and the imperative need for haste in getting the vicomte to choisy he had put the intended return to his lodging from his mindoverlooking until now the fact that not only must he go back for the valise which he had bidden brutus pack but also for that far more precious passport  it now became necessary to explain the circumstances to his companions and in explaining them the whole affair from robespierres refusal to grant him the life of the vicomte down to the means to which he had had recourse could not be kept from transpiring as she listened suzannes expression changed into one of ineffable wonder  and you have done this for me she cried when at last he paused you have ruined your career and endangered your life  la boulaye shrugged his shoulders  i spoke overconfidently when i said that i could obtain you the vicomtes pardon there proved to be a factor on which i had not counted nevertheless what i had promised i must fulfil i was by honour bound to leave nothing undone that might result in the vicomtes enlargement  ornbreval laughed softly but with consummate amusement  a sansculotte with a sense of honour is such an anomaly he began when mademoiselle interposed a note of anger sounding in her voice  m dombreval means to pay you a compliment she informed la boulaye but he has such an odd way of choosing his expressions that i feared you might misunderstand him  la boulaye signified his indifference by a smile  i am afraid the cidevant vicomte has not yet learnt his lesson said he or else he is like the sinner who upon recovering health forgot the penitence that had come to him in the days of sickness but we have other matters to deal with citoyenne and in particular the matter of the passport fool that i am he cried bitterly  i must return to paris at once he announced briskly there is no help for it we will hope that as yet the way is open to me and that i shall be permitted to go and to return unmolested in such a case the rest is easyexcept that you will have to suffer my company as far as the frontier  it was mademoiselle who accompanied him to the door  monsieur she said in a voice that shook with the sincere intensity of her feelings think me not ungrateful that i have said so little but your act has overwhelmed me it is so truly noble that to offer you thanks that are but words seems tome little short of a banality  tut he laughed i have not yet done half it will be time to thank me when we are out of france  and you speak so lightly of leaving france she cried but what is to become of you what of your career  other careers are possible in other countries he answered with a lightness he did not feel who knows perhaps the english or the prussians might be amenable to a change of government i shall seek to induce one or the other of them to became a republic and then i shall become once more a legislator  with that and vowing that every moment he remained their chances of leaving france grew more slender he took his leave of her expressing the hope that he might be back within a couple of hours mademoiselle watched him to the garden gate then closing the door she returned within  she discovered her betrothedhe whom la boulaye had called her loverstanding with his back to the fire his hands clasped behind him the very picture of surliness he made none of the advances that one might look for in a man placed as he was at that moment he greeted her instead with a complaint  will you permit me mademoiselle to say that in this matter you have hardly chosen the wiser course  in what matter quoth she at a loss to understand him  in the matter of my release i advised you in my letter to purchase my freedom had you done so we should now be in a position to start for the frontierfor you would have made a passport a part of your bargain instead of this not only are we obliged to run the risk of waiting but even if this fellow should return we shall be affronted by his company for some days to come and the vicomte sniffed the air in token of disgust  suzanne looked at him in an amazement that left her speechless for a moment at last  and this is your gratitude she demanded this is all that you have to say in thanks for the discomfort and danger that i have suffered on your behalf your tone is oddly changed since you wrote me that piteous pitiable letter from belgium m le vicomte  he reddened slightly  i am afraid that i have been clumsy in my expressions he apologised but never doubt my gratitude mademoiselle i am more grateful to you than words can tell you have done your duty to me as few women could  the word duty offended her yet she let it pass in his monstrous vanity it was often hopeless to make him appreciate the importance of anything or anybody outside of himself of this the present occasion was an instance  you must forgive me my seeming thanklessness mademoiselle he pursued it was the company of that sansculotte rascal that soured me i had enough of him a month ago when he brought me to paris it offended me to have him stand here again in the same room with me and insolently refer to his pledged word as though he were a gentleman born  to whom do you refer quoth she  ma foi how many of them are there why to this fellow la boulaye  so it seemed and yet i could not believe it of you do you not realise that your ingratitude approaches the base  he vouchsafed her a long cold stare of amazement  mordieu he ejaculated at last i am afraid that your reason has been affected by your troubles you seem mademoiselle to be unmindful of the station into which you have had the honour to be born  if your bearing is to be accepted as a sign that you remember it i will pray god that i may indeed forget itcompletely and for all time  and then the door opened to admit the good henriette who came to announce that she had contrived a hasty meal and that it was served and awaiting them  diable he laughed those are the first words of true wit that i have heard these many days i swear he added with a pleasantness that was oddly at variance with his sullen humour of a moment back that i have not tasted human food these four weeks and as for my appetiteit is capable of consuming the whole patrimony of st peter lead the way my good henriette come mademoiselle     chapter xxi the arrest   facts proved how correct had been la boulayes anticipations of the course that cecile would adopt within a halfhour of his having quitted the house of billaud varennes she presented herself there and demanded to see the deputy upon being told that he was absent she determined to await his return  and so for the matter of an hour she remained in the room where the porter had offered her accommodation fretting at the delay and only restrained from repairing to some other member of the convention by the expectation that the next moment would see varennes arrive arrive he did at last when her patience was all but exhausted and excitedly she told her tale of what had taken place varennes listened gravely and crossquestioned her in his unbelieffor it seemed indeed monstrous that a man of la boulayes position should ruin so promising a future as was his by an act for which varennes could not so much as divine a motive but her story hung together so faithfully and was so far borne out by the fact that varennes himself had indeed signed such a document as she described that in the end the deputy determined to take some steps to neutralise the harm that might have been done  dismissing the girl with the assurance that the matter should have his attention he began by despatching a courier to robespierre at chartreswhere he knew the incorruptible to be that done he resorted to measures for la boulayes detention but this proved a grave matter what if after all that halfhysterical girls story should be inaccurate in what case would he find himself if acting upon it in the meantime he should order carons arrest the person of a deputy was not one to be so lightly treated and he might find himself constrained to answer a serious charge in consequence thus partly actuated by patriotism and the fear of robespierre and partly restrained by patriotism and the fear of la boulaye he decided upon a middle course that of simply detaining la boulaye at his lodging until robespierre should either return or send an answer to his message thus whilst leaving him perfect freedom of movement within his own apartments he would yet ensure against his escape so that should robespierre demand him he could without difficulty be produced  to this end he repaired with a souslieutenant and six men to la boulayes house in the rue nationale intending to station the soldiers there with orders not to allow the deputy to go out and to detain and question all who sought admittance to him he nourished the hope that the cidevant vicomte might still be with la boulaye at the rue nationale however he was to discover that neither deputy nor aristocrat was to be found brutus informed him that he was expecting the citizen la boulaye but beyond that he would say nothing and he wisely determined to hold his peace touching the valise that he had been ordered to pack and the fact that he knew the deputy meditated leaving paris brutus had learnt the value of silence especially when those who sought information were members of the convention  alarmed at this further corroboration of ceciles story of treachery varennes left the military at carons house with orders not to allow the deputy to again depart if in the meantime he should happen to return whilst to every barrier of paris he sent instructions to have la boulaye detained if he should present himself by these measures he hoped still to be able to provide against the possibility of carons seeking to leave paris  but caron had been gone over an hour and as a matter of fact he was back again in paris within a very little time of these orders having been issued at the barriere denfer although recognised he was not molested since the orders only and distinctly concerned his departure and nowise his arrival  thus not until he had reached his lodgings did he realise that all was not as he had hoped and even then it was only within doors that he made the discovery when he found himself suddenly confronted by the souslieutenant who was idling in the passage the officer saluted him respectfully and no less respectfully though firmly informed him that by order of the citizendeputy billaud varennes he must ask him to confine himself to his own apartments until further orders  but why citizenofficer la boulaye demanded striving to exclude from his voice any shade of the chagrin that was besetting him what do these orders mean  the officer was courtesy personified but explanations he had none to give for the excellent reason he urged that he was possessed of none he was a soldier and he had received orders which he must obey without questioning either their wisdom or their justice appreciating the futility of bearing himself otherwise since his retreat was already blocked by a couple of gendarmes caron submitted to the inevitable  he mounted leisurely to his study and the ruin that stared him in the eyes was enough to have daunted the boldest of men yet to do him justice he was more concerned at the moment with the consequences this turn of affairs might have for mademoiselle than with his own impending downfall that he had cecile to thank for his apprehension he never doubted yet it was a reflection that he readily dismissed from his mind in such a pass as he now found himself none but a weakling could waste time and energy in bewailing the circumstances that had conspired to it in a man of la boulayes calibre and mettle it was more befitting to seek a means to neutralise as much as possible the evil done  he called brutus and crossquestioned him regarding the attitude and behaviour of the soldiery since their coming he learnt that nothing had been touched by them and that they were acting with the utmost discreetness taking scrupulous care not to exceed the orders they had received which amounted to detaining la boulaye and nothing more  you think then that you might come and go unmolested he asked  i think that i might certainly go but whether they would permit me to return once i had left i cannot say so that they will let you pass out that is all that signifies at the moment said caron should they question you you can tell them that you are going to dine and to fetch me my dinner from berthons as a matter of fact i shall want you to go to choisy with a letter which you must see does not fall into the hands of any of these people of the convention  give me the letter citizen and trust me to do the rest answered the faithful brutus  la boulaye searched a drawer of his writingtable for the blank passport he required having found it he hesitated for a moment how to fill it in at last he decided and set down three namespierre francois and julie michael players going to strasbourgto which he added descriptions of himself the vicomte and mademoiselle he reasoned that in case it should ultimately prove impossible for him to accompany them the passport thus indited would still do duty for the other two they could easily advance some excuse why the third person mentioned was not accompanying them from this it will be seen that la boulaye was far from having abandoned hope of effecting his escape either by his own resourcefulness or by the favour of robespierre himself whose kindness for him after all was a factor worth reckoning upon  to mademoiselle he now wrote as follows    i am sending you the laissezpasser filled in for the three of   us  i am unfortunately unable to bring it myself as my   abstraction of the order of release has already been discovered   and i am being detained pending the arrival of robespierre  but   i am at my own lodging and i have every hope that either by   the use of my own wit or else by the favour of my friend   robespierre i shall shortly be able to join you  i would   therefore ask you to wait a few days  but should i presently   send you word not to do so any longer or should you hear of   events which will render it impossible for me to accompany you   you can then set out with ombreval travelling under the guise   described in the passport and informing any questioners that   the other person mentioned has been forced by ill health to   interrupt his journey  as i have said i have every hope of   winning through my present difficulties but should i fail to   do so my most earnest prayer will be that you may make your   way out of france in safety and that lasting happiness may be   your lot in whatever country you may elect to settle  you may   trust the bearer implicitly patriotic though he may appear  he subscribed the letter with his initials and having enclosed the passport and sealed the package he gave it to brutus with the most minute instructions touching its delivery  these instructions brutus carried out with speed and fidelity he was allowed to quit the house without so much as a question which left his plan for readmittance the greater likelihood of succeeding in something less than an hourfor he hired himself a horse at the nearest posthousehe had delivered his letter to mademoiselle at choisy  its contents sowed in her heart the very deepest consternationa consternation very fully shared by the vicomte  tenez he exclaimed when he had read it perhaps now you will admit the justice of my plaint that you did not make a simple purchase of my liberty as i counselled you instead of entering into this idiotic compact with that sansculotte  she looked at him a moment in silence she was suffering as it was at the very thought that la boulayes life might be in danger in consequence of what he had done for her with reluctance had she accepted the sacrifice of his career which he had made to serve her now that it became the question of a sacrifice of life as well she was dismayed all the wrongs that she and hers had done that man seemed to rise up and reproach her now and so when presently she answered the vicomte it was no more than natural that she should answer him impatiently  i thought monsieur that we had already discussed and settled that  settled it he echoed with a sneer it seems none so easy to settle do you think that words will settle it  by no means she answered her voice quivering it seems as if a mans life will be required for that  he shrugged his shoulders and his face put on a look of annoyance  i hope mademoiselle that you are not proposing to introduce sentimentality i think you would be better advised to leave that vulgarity to the vulgar  i do not propose to pursue the discussion at all monsieur was her chilly answer  the way of woman he reflected aloud let her find that she is being worsted in argument and she calmly tells you that she has no mind to pursue it but mademoiselle will you tell me at least what you intend  what do i intend she questioned what choice have we  whenever we are asked to follow a given course we have always the choice between two alternatives he theorised we can comply or not comply  in the present instance i am afraid your rule is inapplicable there is no room for any alternative we can do nothing but wait  she looked at him impatiently and wearily she sank on to a chair  monsieur she said as calmly as might be i am almost distracted by my thoughts as it is i dont know whether you are seeking to complete the rout of my senses let me beg of you at least not to deal in riddles with me the time is illchosen tell me bluntly what is in your mind if indeed anything  he turned from her peevishly and crossed to the window the twilight was descending and the little garden was looking grey in the now pallid light her seeming obtuseness was irritating him  surely mademoiselle he exclaimed at last it is not necessary that i should tell you what other course is open to us it is a matter for our choice whether we depart at once we have a passport andand enfin every hour that we remain here our danger is increased and our chances of escape are lessened  ah she breathed the syllable contemptuously and what of la boulaye  pooh he says himself that he is in no great danger he is among his fellows leave him to extricate himself after all it is his fault that we are here why should we endanger our necks by waiting his convenience  but surely you forget what he has done for us you are forgetting that he has rescued you from the guillotine dragged you out of the very jaws of death do you think that to forsake him now would be a fair an honest return  but name of a name rasped the vicomte does he not say that he is far from despairing his position is not half so dangerous as ours if we are taken there will be an end of us with him matters are far from being so bad he is one of the rabble himself and the rabble will look after its own  she rose impatiently  monsieur i am afraid the subject is not one that we may profitably discuss i shall obey the voice of my conscience in the matter and i shall wait until we hear again from la boulaye that is the message i am about to return him by his servant  the vicomte watched her fling out of the room and his weak face was now white with anger he rapped out an oath as he turned to the window again  mad he muttered throughset teeth mad as a sunstruck dog the troubles she has lately seen have turned her headnever a difficult matter with a woman she talks as if she had been reading rousseau on the right of man to propose to endanger our lives for the sake of that scum la boulaye ciel it passes belief  but it was in vain that he was sullen and resentful suzannes mind entertained no doubt of what she should do and she had her way in the matter sending back brutus with the message that she would wait until la boulaye communicated with her again  that night caron slept tranquilly he had matured a plan of escape which he intended to carry out upon the morrow and with confident hope to cradle him he had fallen asleep  but the morrowearly in the forenoonbrought a factor with which he had not reckoned in the person of the incorruptible himself robespierre had returned in hot haste to paris upon receiving varennes message and he repaired straight to the house of la boulaye  caron was in his dressinggown when robespierre was ushered into his study and the sight of that greenish complexion and the small eyes looking very angry and menacing caused the song that the young man had been humming to fade on his lips  you maximilien he exclaimed  your cordial welcome flatters me sneered the incorruptible coming forward then with a sudden change of voice what is that they tell me you have done miserable he growled  it would have been a madness on carons part to have increased an anger that was already mounting to very passionate heights contritely therefore and humbly he acknowledged his fault and cast himself upon the mercy of robespierre  but the incorruptible was not so easily to be shaken  traitor that you are he inveighed do you imagine that because it is yours to make high sounding speeches in the convention you are to conspire with impunity against the nation your loyalty it seems is no more than a matter of words and they that would keep their heads on their shoulders in france today will find the need for more than words as their claim to be let live if you would save your miserable neck tell me what you have done with this damned aristocrat  he is gone answered la boulaye quietly  dont prevaricate caron dont seek to befool me citizendeputy you have him in hiding somewhere you can have supplied him with no papers and a man may not travel out of france without them in these times tell mewhere is he  gone repeated la boulaye i have set him free and he has availed himself of it to place himself beyond your reach more than that i cannot tell you  can you not snarled robespierre showing his teeth of what are you dreaming fool do you think that i will so easily see myself cheated of this dog did i not tell you that rather would i grant you the lives of a dozen aristocrats than that of this single one do you think then that i am so lightly to be baulked name of god who are you la boulaye what are you that you dare thwart me in this he looked at the young mans impassive face to curb his anger come caron he added in a wheedling tone tell me what you have done with him  i have already told you answered the other quietly  as swift and suddenly as it changed before did robespierres humour change again upon receiving that reply with a snort of anger he strode to the door and threw it open  citizenlieutenant he called in a rasping voice  here citizen came a voice from below  give yourself the trouble of coming up with a couple of men now citizen la boulaye he said more composedly as he turned once more to the young man since you will not learn reason you may mount the guillotine in his place  caron paled slightly as he inclined his head in silent submission at that moment the officer entered with his men at his heels  arrest me that traitor maximilien commanded pointing a shaking finger at caron to the luxembourg with him  if you will wait while i change my dressinggown for a coat citizenofficer said la boulaye composedly i shall be grateful then turning to his official brutus he called attend me  he had an opportunity while brutus was helping him into his coat to whisper in the fellows ear  let her know  more he dared not say but to his astute official that was enough and with a sorrowful face he delivered to suzanne a few hours later the news of la boulayes definite arrest and removal to the luxembourg  at brutuss description of the scene there had been twixt robespierre and caron she sighed heavily and her lashes grew wet  poor faithful la boulaye she murmured god aid him now  she bore the news to dombreval and upon hearing it he tossed aside the book that had been engrossing him and looked up a sudden light of relief spreading on his weak face  it is the end said he as though no happier consummation could have attended matters and we have no more to wait for shall we set out today he asked and urged the wisdom of making haste  i hope and i pray god that it may not be the end as you so fondly deem it monsieur she answered him but whether it is the end or not i am resolved to wait until there is no room for any hope  as you will he sighed wearily the issue of it all will probably be the loss of our heads but even that might be more easily accomplished than to impart reason to a woman  or unselfishness it seems to a man she returned as she swept angrily from the room     chapter xxii the tribunal   at the bar of the revolutionary tribunal stood deputy caron la boulaye upon his trial for treason to the nation and contravention of the ends of justice fouquiertinvillle the sleuthhound attorneygeneral advanced his charges and detailed the nature of the young revolutionists crime but there was in fouquiertinvillles prosecution a lack of virulence for once just as among la boulayes fellows sitting in judgment there was a certain uneasiness for the revolution was still young and it had not yet developed that saturnian habit of devouring its own children which was later to become one of its main features  the matter of la boulayes crime however was but too clear and despite the hesitancy on the part of the jury despite the unwonted tameness of tinvillles invective the tribunals course was welldefined and admitted of not the slightest doubt and so the production of evidence being dispensed with by carons ready concurrence and acknowledgment of the offence the president was on the point of formally asking the jury for their finding when suddenly there happened a commotion and a small man in a blue coat and blackrimmed spectacles rose at tinvillles side and began an impassioned speech for the defence  this man was robespierre and the revolutionists sitting there listened to him in mute wonder for they recalled that it was upon the incorruptibles own charge their brotherdeputy had been arrested ardently did maximilien pour out his eloquence enumerating the many virtues of the accused and dwelling at length upon his vast services to the republic his hitherto unfaltering fidelity to the nation and the peoples cause and lastly deploring that in a moment of weakness he should have committed the indiscretion which had brought him where he stood and against this thing of which he was now accused robespierre bade the deputies of the jury balance the young mans past and the much that he had done for the revolution and to offer him in consideration of all that a chance of making atonement and regaining the position of trust and of brotherly affection which for a moment he had forfeited  the court was stirred by the address they knew the young sansculottes worth and they were reluctant to pass sentence upon him and to send him to the death designed for aristocrats and traitors and so they readily pronounced themselves willing to extend him the most generous measure of mercy to open their arms and once more to clasp to their hearts the brother who had strayed and to reinstate him in their confidence and their councils they pressed robespierre to name the act of atonement by which he proposed la boulaye should recover his prestige and robespierre in answer cried  let him repair the evil he has done let him neutralise the treachery into which a moment of human weakness betrayed him let him return to us the aristocrat he has attempted to save and we will forget his indiscretion and receive him back amongst us with open arms as was the prodigal son received  there was a salvo of applause men rose to their feet excitedly and with arms outstretched in carons direction they vociferously implored him to listen to reason as uttered by the incorruptible to repent him and to atone while there was yet time they loved him they swore in voices of thunder each seeking to be heard above his neighbours din and it would break their hearts to find him guilty yet find him guilty they must unless he chose the course which this good patriot maximilien pointed out to him  la boulaye stood pale but composed his lips compressed his keen eyes alert inwardly he was moved by this demonstration of goodwill this very storm of fraternity but his purpose remained adamant and when at last the presidents bell had tinkled his noisy judges into silence his voice rose clear and steady as he thanked them for leaning to clemency on his behalf  helas he ended words cannot tell you how deeply i deplore that it is a clemency of which i may not avail myself what i have done i may not undo and so citizens whilst i would still retain your love and your sympathy you must suffer me to let justice take its course to delay would be but to waste your time the nations time  but this is rank defiance roared tinvillle roused at last into some semblance of his habitual bloodthirstiness he whose heart can be so insensible to our affections merits no clemency at this bar  and so the president turned with a shrug to his colleagues and the verdict was taken the finding was guilty and the president was on the point of passing sentence when again robespierre sprang to his feet the incorruptibles complexion looked sicklier than its wont for mortification had turned him green outright a gust of passion swept through his soul such as would have made another man call for the death of this defiant youth who had withstood his entreaties but such was robespierres wonderful command of self such was his power of making his inclinations subservient to the ends he had in view that he had but risen to voice a fresh appeal  he demanded that the sentence should be passed with the reservation that the accused should have twentyfour hours for reflection should he at the end of that time be disposed to tell them where the cidevant vicomte dombreval was to be found let them reconsider his case on the other hand should he still continue obdurate by the noon of tomorrow then let the sentence be consummated  there was some demur but robespierre swept it fiercely aside with patriotic arguments la boulaye was a stout servant of the nation whom it must profit france to let live that he might serve her ombreval was a base aristocrat whose death all true republicans should aim at encompassing and so he won the day in the end and when the sentence of death was passed it was passed with the reservation that should the prisoner upon reflection be inclined to show himself more loyal to france and the interests of the republic by telling them how ornbreval might be recaptured he would find them still inclined to mercy and forgiveness allowing his eyes to stray round the court at that moment la boulaye started at sight of an unexpected face it was mademoiselle de bellecour deathly pale and with the strained piteous look that haunts the eyes of the mad he shivered at the thought of the peril to herself in coming into that assembly then recovering himself he turned to his judges  citizenpresident citizens all i thank you but i should be unappreciative of your kindness did i permit you to entertain false hopes my purpose is unalterable  take him away the president commanded impatiently and as they removed him mademoiselle crept from the court weeping softly in her poignant grief and realising that not so much for the presidents ear as for her own had la boulaye uttered those words they were meant to fortify her and to give her courage with the assurance that ombreval would not be betrayed to give her courage her lip was twisted into an oddly bitter smile at the reflection as she stepped into her cabriolet and bade the driver return to choisy caron was doing this for her he was casting away his young vigorous life with all its wealth of promise to the end that her betrothedthe man whom he believed she lovedmight be spared the greatness the nobility of the sacrifice overwhelmed her she remembered the thoughts that in the past she had entertained concerning this young revolutionist never yet had she been able to regard him as belonging to the same order of beings as herselfnot even when she had kissed his unconscious lips that evening on the ridge road an immeasurable gulf had seemed to yawn between themthe gulf between her nobility and his base origin and now as her carriage trundled out of paris and took the dusty high road she shuddered and her cheeks burned with shame at the memory of the wrong that by such thoughts she had done him was she indeed the nobler by accident of birth perhaps but by nature proper he was assuredly the noblest man that ever woman bore  in the place de la revolution a gruesome engine they called the guillotine was levelling all things and fast establishing the reign of absolute equality but with all the swift mowing of its bloody scythe not half so fast did it level men as mademoiselle de bellecours thoughts were doing that afternoon  so marked was the disorder in her countenance when she reached choisy that even unobservant ombreval whom continuous years of selfcomplacency had rendered singularly obtusecould not help but notice it andfearing no doubt that this agitation might in some way concern himselfhe even went the length of questioning her his voice sounding the note of his alarm  it is nothing she answered in a dejected voice at least nothing that need cause you uneasiness they have sentenced la boulaye to death she announced a spasm crossing her averted face  he took a deep breath of relief  god knows theyve sentenced innocent men enough it is high time they began upon one another it augurs wellextremely well  they were alone in henriettes kitchen the faithful woman was at market mademoiselle was warming herself before the fire ombreval stood by the window he had spent the time of her absence in the care of his clothes and he had contrived to dress himself with some semblance of his oldtime elegance which enhanced his good looks and highborn air  you seem to utterly forget monsieur the nature of the charge upon which he has been arraigned she said in a tired voice  why no he answered and he smiled airily he was sufficiently a fool to be lured by the brightest eyes in france into a service for their mistress my faith hes not the first by many a thousand whom a womans soft glances have undone  the degree in which you profit by the service he is doing those bright eyes appears singularly beneath the dignity of your notice  what a jester you are becoming ma mie he laughed and at the sound she shuddered again and drew mechanically nearer to the fire as though her shuddering was the result of cold  it is yet possible that he may not die she said almost as if speaking to herself they have offered him his liberty and his reinstatement evenupon conditions  how interesting he murmured nonchalantly they have an odd way of dispensing justice  the conditions imposed are that he shall amend the wrong he has done and deliver up to the convention the person of one cidevant vicomte dombreval  my god  it was a gasp of sudden dismay that broke from the young nobleman the colour swept out of his face and his eyes dilated with horror watching him suzanne observed the sudden change and took a fierce joy in having produced it  it interests you more closely now monsieur she asked  suzanne he cried coming a step nearer and speaking eagerly he knows my whereabouts he brought me here himself are you mad girl that you can sit there so composedly and tell me this  what else would you have me do she inquired  do why leave choisy at once come be stirring in gods name girl bethink you that we have not a moment to lose i know these republicans and how far they are to be trusted this fellow would betray me to save his skin with as little compunction as  you fool she broke in an undercurrent of fierce indignation vibrating through her scorn what are you saying he would betray you he she tossed her arms to heaven and burst into a laugh of infinite derision have no fear of that m le vicomte for you are dealing with a nature of a nobility that you cannot so much as surmise if he were minded to betray you why did he not do so today when they offered him his liberty in exchange for information that would lead to your recapture  but although he may have refused today returned the vicomte frenziedly he may think better of it tomorrowperhaps even tonight ciel think of the risk we run already it may be too late oh why he demanded reproachfully why didnt you listen to me when days ago i counselled flight  because it neither was nor is my intention to fly  what he cried and his jaw fallen and his eyes wide he regarded her then suddenly he caught her by the arm and shook her roughly are you mad he cried in a frenzy of anger and fear am i to die like a dog that a scum of a republican may save his miserable neck is this canaille of a revolutionist to betray me to his rabble tribunal  already have i told you that you need fear no betrayal  need i not he sneered ma foi but i know these ruffians there is not an ounce of honour in the whole national convention  fool she blazed rising and confronting him with an anger before which he recoiled appalled do you dare to stand there and prate of honouryou do you forget why he stood his trial do you forget why he is dying and can you not see the vile thing that you are doing in arguing flight that you talk of honour thus and deny his claim to it mon dieu your effrontery stifles me la boulaye was right when he said that with us honour is but a wordjust so much wind and nothing more  he stared at her in uncomprehending wonder he drew away another step he accounted her mad and that he might humour her he put by his own fears for the momenta wonderful unselfishness this in the most noblyborn vicomte dombreval  my poor suzanne he murmured our trouble has demoralised your understanding you take a false view of things you do not apprehend the situation  in gods name be silent she gasped  but the time is not one for silence he returned  so i had thought quoth she yet since you can be silent and furtive in other matters i beg that you will be silent in this also you talk in vain monsieur in any case for i am not minded to leave choisy if you urge me further i shall burn our passport  and with that she left him to seek the solitude of her own room in a passion of tears she flung herself upon the little bed and there she lay a prey to such an anguish as had never touched her life before  and now in that hour of her grief it came to heras the sun pierces the mistthat she loved la boulaye that she had loved him indeed since that night at boisvert although she had stifled the very thought and hidden it even from herself as being unworthy in one of her station to love a man so lowlyborn as caron but now on the eve of his death the truth would no longer be denied it cried perchance the louder by virtue of the pusillanimity of the craven below stairs in whose place caron was to die but anyhow it cried so loudly that it overbore the stern voice of the blood that had hitherto urged her to exclude the sentiment from her heart no account now did she take of any difference in station be she nobler a thousand times be he simpler a thousand times the fact remained that she was a woman he a man and beyond that she did not seek to go  low indeed were the lilies of france when a daughter of the race of their upholders heeded them so little and the caste they symbolised  henriette came to her that afternoon and all ignorant of the sources of her grief she essayed to soothe and comfort her in which at last she succeeded  in the evening ombreval sent word that he wished to speak to herand that his need was urgent but she returned him the answer that she would see him in the morning she was indisposed that evening she added in apology  and in the morning they met as she had promised him both pale although from different causes and both showing signs of having slept but little they broke their fast together and in silence which at last he ended by asking her whether the night had brought her reflection and whether such reflection had made her appreciate their position and the need to set out at once  it needed no reflection to make me realise our position better than i did yesterday she answered i had hoped that it would have brought you to a different frame of mind but i am afraid that it has not done so  i fail to see what change my frame of mind admits of he answered testily  have you thought she asked at last and her voice was cold and concentrated that this man is giving his life for you  i have feared he answered with incredible callousness that to save his craven skin he might elect to do differently at the last moment  she looked at him in a mighty wonder her dark eyes open to their widest and looking black by the extreme dilation of the pupils so vast was her amazement at this unbounded egotism that it almost overruled her disgust  you cast epithets about you and bestow titles with a magnificent unconsciousness of how well they might fit you  ah for example  in calling this man a craven you take no thought for the cowardice that actuates you into hiding while he dies for you  cowardice he ejaculated then a flush spread on his face ma foi mademoiselle said he in a quivering voice your words betray thoughts that would be scarcely becoming in the vicomtesse dombreval  that monsieur is a point that need give you little thought i am not likely to become the vicomtesse  he bestowed her a look of mingling wonder and anger had he indeed heard her aright did her words imply that she disdained the honour  surely he gasped voicing those doubts of his you do not mean that you would violate your betrothal contract you do not  i mean monsieur she cut in that i will give myself to no man i do not love  your immodesty said he falls in nothing short of the extraordinary frame of mind that you appear to be developing in connection with other matters we shall have you beating a drum and screeching the ca ira in the streets of paris presently like mademoiselle de mericourt  she rose from the table her face very white her hand pressing upon her corsage a moment she looked at him then  do not let us talk of ourselves she exclaimed at last there is a man in the conciergerie who dies at noon unless you are forthcoming before then to save him he himself will not betray you because heno matter why he will not tell me monsieur how do you who account yourself a man of honour above everything intend to deal with this situation  he shrugged his shoulders  once he is dead and done withprovided that he does not first betray mei trust that no longer having this subject to harp upon you will consent to avail yourself of our passport and accompany me out of france  honour does not for instance suggest to you that you should repair to the conciergerie and take the place that belongs to you and which another is filling  a sudden light of comprehension swept now into his face  at last i understand what has been in your mind since yesterday what has made you so odd in your words and manner you have thought that it was perhaps my duty as a man of honour to go and effect the rescue of this fellow but my dear child bethink you of what he is and of what i am were he a gentlemanmy equalmy course would stand clearly defined i should not have hesitated a moment but this canaille ma foi let me beg of you to come to your senses the very thought is unworthy in you  i understand you she answered him very coldly you use a cowards arguments and you have the effrontery to consider yourself a man of honoura nobleman i no longer marvel that there is a revolution in france  she stood surveying him for a moment then she quietly left the room he stared after her  woman woman he sighed as he set down his napkin and rose in his turn  his humour was one of pitying patience for a girl that had not the wit to see that to ask himthe most noble dombrevalto die that la boulaye might live was very much like asking him to sacrifice his life to save a dogs     chapter xxiii the conciergerie   it wanted but a few minutes to noon as the condemned of the day were being brought out of the conciergerie to take their places in the waiting tumbrils fourteen they numbered and there was a woman amongst them as composed as any of the men she descended the prison steps in nonchalant conversation with a witty young man of some thirty years of age who had been one of the ornaments of the prerevolutionary salons had the pair been on the point of mounting a wedding coach they could not have shown themselves in better spirits  aristocrats too were the remaining twelve with one exception and if they had not known how to live at least they could set a very splendid example of how to die they came mostly in pairs and the majority of them emulating the first couple and treating the whole matter as a pleasantry that rather bored them by the element of coarseness introduced by the mob one or two were pale and their eyes wore a furtive frightened look but they valiantly fought down their fears and for all that the hearts within them may have been sick with horror they contrived to twist a smile on to their pale lips they did not lack for stout patterns of high bearing and in addition they had their own arrogant pridethe pride that had brought them at last to this passto sustain them in their extremity noblesse les obligeait the rabble the canaille of the new regime might do what they would with their bodies but their spirits they could not break nor overcome their indomitable pride by the brave manner of their death it remained for them to make amends for the atrocious manner of their lives and such a glamour did they shed upon themselves by the same brave manner that it compelled sympathy and admiration of those that beheld them and made upon humanity an impression deep enough to erase the former impression left by their misdeeds  like heroes like sainted martyrs they died these men who through generation after generation had ground and crushed the people neath the iron heel of tyranny and oppression until the people had of a sudden risen and reversed the position going to excesses in their latelyawakened wrath that were begotten of the excesses which for centuries they had endured  last of this gallant and spruce company for every man had donned his best and dressed himself with the utmost care came caron la boulaye he walked alone for although their comrade in death he was their comrade in nothing else their heads might lie together in the sawdust of sansons basket but while they lived no contact would they permit themselves of body or of soul with this sansculotte had they known why he died perhaps they had shown him fellowship but in their nescience of the facts it would need more than death to melt them into a kindness to a member of the convention for death was the only thing they had in common and death as we have seen had not conquered them  as he was about to pass out a gaoler suddenly thrust forward a hand to detain him and almost simultaneously the door which had swung to behind the last of his deathfellows reopened to admit the dapper figure of the incorruptible  he eyed caron narrowly as he advanced into the hall and at the composure evident in the young mans bearing his glance seemed to kindle with admiration for all that his lips remained cruel in their tightened curves  caron gave him goodday with a friendly smile and before robespierre could utter a word the young man was expressing his polite regrets at having baulked him as he had done  i had a great object to serve maximilien he concluded and my only regret is that it should have run counter to your wishes i owe you so mucheverything in factthat i am filled with shame at the thought of how ill a return i am making you my only hope is that by my death you will consider that i have sufficiently atoned for my ingratitude  fool croaked robespierre you are sacrificing yourself for some chimaera and the life you are saving is that of a very worthless and vicious individual of your ingratitude to me we will not speak but even now in the eleventh hour i would have you bethink you of yourself  he held out his hands to him and entreaty was stamped upon robespierres countenance to a degree which perhaps no man had yet seen bethink you cher caron he began again but the young man shook his head  my friend my best of friends he exclaimed i beg that you will not make it harder for me i am resolved and your entreaties do but heighten my pain of thwarting yourthe only pain that in this supreme hour i am experiencing it is not a difficult thing to die maximilien were i to live i must henceforth lead a life of unsatisfied desire i must even hanker and sigh after a something that is unattainable i die and all this is extinguished with me at the very prospect my desires fade immeasurably let me go in peace and with your forgiveness  robespierre eyed him a moment or two in astonishment then he made an abrupt gesture of impatience  fool that you are it is suicide you are committing and for what for a dream a shadow is this like a man caron is thiswill you be still you animal he barked at a gaoler who had once before touched him upon the arm do you not see that i am occupied  but the man leant forward and said some words hurriedly into robespierres ear which cast the petulance out of his face and mind and caused him of a sudden to become very attentive  ah he said at last then with a sudden briskness let the citizen la boulaye not go forth until i return he bade the gaoler and to caron he said you will have the goodness to await my return  with that he turned and stepped briskly across the hall and through the door which the gaoler all equality notwithstanding hastened to open for him with as much servility as ever the haughtiest aristocrat had compelled  saving that single gaoler la boulaye was alone in the spacious hall of the conciergerie from without they heard the wild clamouring and cairaing of the mob chafing at this fresh delay which was as a prolongation of his deathagony la boulaye was pacing to and fro the ring of his footsteps on the stone floor yielding a hollow sepulchral echo  is he never returning he cried at last and as if in answer to his question the drums suddenly began to roll and the vociferations of the rabble swelled in volume and grew shriller what is that he inquired  the gaoler on whose dirty face some measure of surprise was manifested approached the little grating that overlooked the yard and peered out  sacrenom he swore the tumbrils are moving they have left you behind citizen  but la boulaye gathered no encouragement such as the gaoler thought he might from that contingency he but imagined that it was robespierres wish to put him back for another day in the hope that he might still loosen his tongue an oath of vexation broke from him and he stamped his foot impatiently upon the floor  then the door opened suddenly and robespierre held it whilst into the room came a woman closely veiled whose tall and shapely figure caused the young deputys breath to flutter the incorruptible followed her and turning to the gaoler  leave us he commanded briskly  and presently when those three stood alone the woman raised her veil and disclosed the face he had expectedthe beautiful face of suzanne de bellecour but alas woefully pale and anguished of expression she advanced a step towards caron and then stood still encountering his steadfast wonderstruck gaze and seeming to falter with a sob at last she turned to maximilien who had remained a pace or two behind  tell him monsieur she begged  robespierre started out of his apparent abstraction he peered at her with his shortsighted eyes and from her to caron then he came forward a step and cleared his throat rather as a trick of oratory than to relieve any huskiness  to put it briefly my clear caron said he the citoyenne here has manifested a greater solicitude for your life than you did yourself and she has done me the twofold service of setting it in my power to punish an enemy and to preserve a friend from a death that was very imminent in the eleventh hour she came to me to make terms for your pardon she proposed to deliver up to me the person of the cidevant vicomte dombreval provided that i should grant you an unconditional pardon you can imagine my good caron with what eagerness i agreed to her proposal and with what pleasure i now announce to you that you are free  free gasped la boulaye his eyes travelling fearfully from robespierre to mademoiselle and remaining riveted upon the latter as though he were attempting to penetrate into the secrets of her very soul  practically free answered the incorruptible you may leave the conciergerie when you please thought i shall ask you to remain at your lodging in the rue nationale until this ombreval is actually taken once he has been brought to paris i shall send you your papers that you may leave france for much though i shall regret your absence i think that it will be wiser for you to make your fortune elsewhere after what has passed  la boulaye took a step in suzannes direction  you have done this he cried in a quivering voice you have betrayed the man to whom you were betrothed  do not use that word monsieur she cried with a shudder my action cannot be ranked among betrayals he would have let you go to the guillotine in his stead he had not the virtue to come forward for all that he knew that you must die if he did not on the contrary such a condition of things afforded him amusement matter to scorn and insult you with he would have complacently allowed a dozen men to have gone to the guillotine that his own worthless life might have been spared  but he was your betrothed la boulaye protested  true she made answer but i had to choose between the man it had been arranged i should marry and the man i loved a flush crimsoned her cheek and her voice sank almost to a whisper and to save the man i love i have delivered up ombreval  suzanne  the name burst from his lips in a shout of wonder and of joy ineffable in a stride he seemed to cover the distance between them and he caught her to him as the door slammed on the discreetly departing robespierre
