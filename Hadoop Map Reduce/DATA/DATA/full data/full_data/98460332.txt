98460332	six months at the cape letters to his friend periwinkle by rm ballantyne    robert michael ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894  he was educated at the edinburgh academy and in 1841 he became a clerk with the hudson bay company working at the red river settlement in northen canada until 1847 arriving back in edinburgh in 1848  the letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters  three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade the young fur traders ungava the hudson bay company and were based on his experiences with the hbc  in this period he also wrote the coral island and martin rattler both of these taking place in places never visited by ballantyne  having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about  with these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers  he researched the cornish mines the london fire brigade the postal service the railways the laying down of submarine telegraph cables the construction of lighthouses the lightship service the lifeboat service south africa norway the north sea fishing fleet ballooning deepsea diving algiers and many more experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time and he lived as they lived  he was a very truetolife author depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail  his young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen sometimes four in a year all very good reading  the rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life but the quality never failed  he published over ninety books under his own name and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym comus  for todays taste his books are perhaps a little too religious and what we would nowadays call pi  in part that was the way people wrote in those days but more important was the fact that in his days at the red river settlement in the wilds of canada he had been a little dissolute and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave as he felt he had been  some of his books were quite short little over 100 pages  these books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents having less pocketmoney  these books are particularly wellwritten and researched because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money  they were published as six series three books in each series  one of these series is on the coast which includes saved by the lifeboat  recreated as an etext by nick hodson october 1998 reviewed february 2003    six months at the cape letters to his friend periwimkle by rm ballantyne    letter one  a life on the ocean wave  south africa  dear periwinklesince that memorable not to say miserable day when you and i parted at saint katherines docks see note 1 with the rain streaming from our respective nosesrendering tears superfluous if not impossibleand the noise of preparation for departure damaging the fervour of our farewellsince that day i have ploughed with my adventurous keel upwards of six thousand miles of the main and now write to you from the wild karroo of southern africa  the karroo is not an animal  it is a spotat present a lovely spot  i am surrounded byby nature and all her southern abundance  mimosa trees prickly pears and aloes remind me that i am not in england ostriches stalking on the plains tell that i am in africa  it is not much above thirty years since the last lion was shot in this region see note 2 and the kloofs or gorges of the blue mountains that bound the horizon are at the present hour full of capetigers wild deer of different sorts baboons monkeys andbut hold  i must not forestall  let me begin at the beginning  the adventurous keel above referred to was not as you know my own private property  i shared it with some two hundred or so of human beings and a large assortment of the lower animals  its name was the windsor castleone of a magnificent line of ocean steamers belonging to an enterprising british firm  there is something appallingly disagreeable in leavetaking  i do not refer now to the sentiment but to the manner of it  neither do i hint my dear fellow at your manner of leavetaking  your abrupt well old boy bon voyage goodbye bless you followed by your prompt retirement from the scene was perfect in its way and left nothing to be desired but leavetakings in generalhow different  have you never stood on a railway platform to watch the starting of an express  of course you have and you have seen the moist faces of those two young sisters who had come to see off that dear old aunt who had been more than a mother to them since that day long ago when they were left orphans and who was leaving them for a few months for the first time for many years and you have observed how after kissing and weeping on her for the fiftieth time they were forcibly separated by the exasperated guard and the old lady was firmly yet gently thrust into her carriage and the door savagely locked with one hand while the silver whistle was viciously clapt to the lips with the other and the last goooodbyedarling was drowned by a shriek and puff and clank as the train rolled off  youve seen it all have you not over and over again in every degree and modification  no doubt you have and as it is with parting humanity at railway stations so is it at steamboat wharves  there are differences however  after you had left i stood and sympathised with those around me and observed that there is usually more emotion on a wharf than on a platformnaturally enough as in the case of long sea voyages partings it may be presumed are for longer periods and dangers are supposed to be greater and more numerous than in land journeysthough this is open to question  the waiting process too is prolonged  even after the warning bell had sent nonvoyagers ashore they had to stand for a considerable time in the rain while we cast off our moorings or went through some of those incomprehensible processes by which a leviathan steamer is moved out of dock  after having made a first false move which separated us about three yards from the wharfinducing the wearied friends on shore to brighten up and smile and kiss hands and wave kerchiefs with that energy of decision which usually marks a really final farewellour steamer remained in that position for full half an hour during which period we gazed from the bulwarks and our friends gazed from under their dripping umbrellas across the now impassable gulf in mute resignation  at that moment a great blessing befell us  a boy let his cap drop from the wharf into the water  it was an insignificant matter in itself but it acted like the little safetyvalve which prevents the bursting of a highpressure engine  voyagers and friends no longer looked at each other like melancholy imbeciles  a gleam of intense interest suffused every visage intelligence sparkled in every eye as we turned and concentrated our attention on that cap  the unexpressed blessing of the whole company ashore and afloat descended on the uncovered head of that boy who all unconscious of the great end he was fulfilling made frantic and futile efforts with a long piece of stick to recover his lost property  but we did at last get under weigh and then there were some touches of real pathos  i felt no disposition to note the humorous elements around when i saw that overgrown lad of apparently eighteen summers press to the side and wave his thin hands in adieu to an elderly lady on shore while tears that he could not and evidently did not care to restrain ran down his hollow cheeks  he had no friend on board and was being sent to the cape for the benefit of his health  so too was another young mansomewhere between twenty and thirty yearswhose high colour brilliant eye and feeble step told their own tale  but this man was not friendless  his young wife was there and supported him with tender solicitude towards a seat  these two were in the aftercabin  among the steerage passengers the fell disease was represented in the person of a little boy  too late was written on the countenances of at least two of thesethe married man and the little boy  as to the healthy passengers what shall i say of them  need i tell you that every species of humanity was represented  there were tall men and short men as well as men broad and narrow mentally not less than physically  there were ladies pretty and ladies plain as well as grave and gay  fat and funny ones we had also lean ones and sad  the wise and foolish virgins were represented  so too were smokers and drinkers and not a few earnest loving and lovable men and women  a tendency had been gaining on me of late to believe that after passing middlelife a man cannot make new and enthusiastic friendships  never was i more mistaken  it is now my firm conviction that men may and do make friendships of the closest kind up to the end of their career  of course the new friends do not and cannot take the place of the old it seems to me that they serve a higher purpose and by enabling one to realise the difference between the old and the new draw the cords of ancient friendship tighter  at all events you may depend upon it my dear periwinkle that no new friend shall ever tumble you out of the niche which you occupy in my bosom  but be this as it may it is a fact that in my berthwhich held four and was full all the voyagethere was a tall dark powerful middleaged man an englishman born in cape colony see note 3 who had been home for a trip and was on his way out again to his african home on the great karroo  this man raised within me feelings of disgust when i first saw him in the dim light of our berth because he was big and i knew that a big man requires more air to fill his lungs than a little one and there was no superabundant air in our berthquite the reverse  this man occupied the top berth opposite to mine  each morning as i awoke my eyes fell on his beard of irongrey and i gazed at his placid countenance till he awokeor i found his placid countenance gazing at me when i awoke  from gazing to nodding in recognition is an easy step in ordinary circumstances but not when ones head is on ones pillow  we therefore passed at once without the ceremony of nodding into a quiet good morning  although reticent he gradually added a smile to the good morning and i noticed that his smile was a peculiarly pleasant one  steps that succeed the first are generally easy  from disliking this mannot on personal but purely selfish groundsi came to like him then to love him  i have reason to believe that the attachment was mutual  his namewhy should i not state it  i dont think he would objectis hobson  in the bunk below hobson lay a young wesleyan minister  he was a slender young fellowmodest and thoughtful  if hobsons bunk had given way i fear that his modesty and thoughtfulness might have been put to a severe test  i looked down upon this young wesleyan from my materially exalted position but before the voyage was over i learned to look up to him from a spiritually low position  my impression is that he was a meek man  i may be mistaken but of this am i certain that he was one of the gentlest and at the same time one of the most able men in the ship  but to return to my berthwhich by the way i was often loth to do owing to the confined air below and the fresh glorious breezes on deckthe man who slept under me was a young banker a clerk going out to the cape to make his fortune and a fine capablelooking fellow he was inclined rather to be receptive than communicative  he frequently bumped me with his head in getting up i not unfrequently put a foot upon his nose or toes in getting down  what can i say about the sea that has not been said over and over again in days of old  this however is worthy of record that we passed the famous bay of biscay in a deadcalm  we did not lay one single day on that bay of biscay o  the o seems rather awkwardly to imply that i am not stating the exact truth but i assure you that it is a fact  more than this we had not a storm all the way to the cape  it was a pure pleasure excursiona sort of yacht voyagefrom beginning to end very pleasant at the time and delightful now to dwell upon for besides the satisfaction of making a new friend like hobson there were others to whom i was powerfully drawn both by natural sympathy and intellectual bias  there was a wesleyan minister also an englishman born in south africa and of the race of anak with whom and his amiable wife and pretty children i fraternised ardently  my soul was also gladdened by intercourse with a clergyman of the dutchreformed church wellknown in the cape and especially in the transvaalwho with his pleasant wife and daughter was on his way back to south africa after a brief trip to europe  he was argumentative so you know am i  he was also goodtempered therefore we got on well  it would be an endless business to name and describe all the passengers who were personally attractive and who were more or less worthy of description  there were among others a genial and enthusiastic dutchafrican legislator of the cape a broadshouldered but retiring astronomer also a kindly cape merchant and a genial english banker with their respective wives and families  i had the good fortune to sit in the midst of these at meals close to captain hewat who is unquestionably what many of us styled him a trump  he is also a scotchman  there was likewise a diamonddigger and another man who seemed to hate everybody except himself  there were also several sportsmen one of whom a gallant son of mars and an author had traversed the great lone land of british america and had generally it seemed to me done the world with the exception of central africa which he was at last going to add to his list  there were also troops of children who behaved remarkably well considering the trials they had to undergo and numerous nurses some of whom required more attention than all the ladies put together  you will now no doubt expect an account of romantic adventures on the deep and narrow escapes and alarms of fire and men overboard and thrilling narratives  if so your expectations are doomed to disappointment  we fished for no sharks we chased no whales we fell in with no slavers or pirates  nevertheless we saw flying fish and we had concerts and lectures and such delightful perambulations of the decks and such charming impromptu duets and glees and solos on retired parts of the deck in moonlight nights and such earnest discussions and such genial companionship  truly that voyage was one of those brilliant episodes which occur only once in a lifetime and cannot be repeated one of those green spots in memory which methinks will survive when all other earthly things have passed away  i will write no more about it however at present  neither will i proceed in what is usually considered the natural manner with my epistlesnamely step by step  arrivals cities travelling roads inns and all such i will skip and proceed at one bound to that which at the present moment is to me most interesting merely remarking that we reached capetown of which more hereafter in novemberthe south african summerafter a voyage of twentyfive days  i am now sojourning at ebenezerhobsons residence on the karroo    note 1  near the tower of london  the south african traffic is now carried on chiefly through the east india docks poplar from which the union castle liners depart  the mail boats proceed from southampton    note 2  in 1840  see page 83  the author was writing in 1876    note 3  known as the province of the cape of good hope or the cape province since the establishment of the union of south africa in 1910    letter two  hunting springboks on the karroo  to start for the huntingfield at seven in the morning in a carriage and six smacks of royalty and sounds luxurious but in south africa there are drawbacks connected therewith  hobsons farm is as i have said on the karroothose vast plains which at some seasons resemble a sandy desert and at others are covered with rich verdure and gorgeous flowers  they are named after the small succulent karroobush which represents the grass of other plains and is excellent food for cattle sheep and ostriches  these plains embrace a considerable portion of the territory of the cape  the karroo is preeminently lumpy  its roads in most places are merely the result of traffic  they also are lumpy  our carriage was a native cart by which is meant a plain and powerful machine with springs that are too strong readily to yield  five of our team were mules the sixth was a pony  our party at starting numbered five but grew as we progressed  we took with us provisions and fodder for two days  the driving was undertaken by hobsons nephew assisted by his eldest sonsixfoot johnny there was a double necessity for two drivers  to hold the reins of five kicking mules and a prancing pony required both hands as well as all the strength of the cousin though he was a powerful fellow and the management of the whip claimed both arms and all the strength as well as the undivided attention of his assistant  the whip was a salmonrod in appearance without exaggeration  it had a bamboo handle somewhere between twelve and fourteen feet long with a proportionate lash  the operator sometimes found it convenient to stand when he made a cast with his fishingrod weapon  he was an adept with it capable it seemed to me of picking a fly off one of the leaders ears  there was some trouble in keeping our team quiet while rifles ammunition provisions etcetera were being stowed in the cart  at last the cousin gave the word  sixfoot johnny made a cast  the lash grazed the leaders flank with a crack that might have shamed a small revolver  the mules presented first their noses then their heels to the sky the cart leaped from the ground and we were offbumping rattling crashing swinging over the wild karroo followed by some halfdozen horses led by two mounted hottentot attendants  my friend hobson greatly to our grief did not accompany us owing to inflamed eyes but i shared the back seat of the cart with his brother jonathan a tall strapping man of middle age and modest mien who seemed to me the perfect type of a colonial hero  in an hour or so we came to the solitary farm of a mr green who regaled us with a sumptuous breakfast and lent me a spur  i had the liberal offer of two spurs but as in hunting with the rifle it is sometimes advisable to sit on ones right heel and memory during the excitement of the chase is apt to prove faithless i contented myself with one spurfeeling pretty confident that if i persuaded the left side of my horse to go the right side could not well remain behind  mr green joined us  thereafter we came to the residence of a mr priest who also joined us with his son and thus we sped on over the flat sandy plains inhaling the sweet scent of mimosa blossom glowing in the fervid sunshine and picking up comrades here and there until about noon we reached the scene of our intended operations  this was a vast almost level plain named the plaat river flats  it lay between two rivers was eight or ten miles wide and upwards of twenty miles in lengtha mighty ocean as it were of short compact karroo with a boundless horizon like the sea in all directions save one where a great south african mountain range intercepted the view  here and there a few clumps of mimosa bushes rose like islets and lent additional interest to the scene  we outspanned that is we unyoked and offsaddled here for luncheon and found shelter from the sun under a mimosa which was large enough to merit being styled a tree  its thorns were from four to six inches in length  the party had now swelled to fourteenall stout hardy descendants of the english scotch or dutch settlers who had originally peopled the land good rifle shots and splendid horsemen  one of them was conspicuous by his brawny arms which were burnt to a deep brown in consequence of his preferring to hunt and work at all times with shirt sleeves rolled up above the elbows  another struck me as having the broadest pair of shoulders i ever saw in a man of his size  capital water here said green to me on alighting beside the mimosathorn  indeed said i thirsting for some where is it  here come ill show you  he led me to a spot among the bushes where lay a small pond of thin mud the colour of weak tea with milk  there you are said green  i looked at him inquiringly  he looked at me and smiled  i laughed  green grinned and assured me that it was firstrate water  he dipped a cup as he spoke and drank it  so did his comrades with evident satisfaction though the liquid was so opaque that i could not see the bottom of a teacup when it was full  there could be no further doubt on the point  these reckless and jovial south africanseuropean by extraction though they were and without a drop of black blood in their veinshad actually accommodated themselves to circumstances so far as to consider liquid mud good water  more than that i found that most of the party deemed it a sufficient beverage for they were all temperance men if not total abstainers  still further i followed their example drank of that yellow pond and actually enjoyed it  subsequently i made the discovery that there were small animals in it after that i preferred it in the form of tea which was quickly infused by our active hottentots  the discovery above referred to was made when green or brownarms or broadshoulders i forget which was quaffing a cup of the cold element having drained it he spat out the last mouthful and along with it a lively creature like a small shrimp with something like a screwpropeller under its tail  enjoying our tea under the shade of the mimosa we rested for an hour and then saddling our steeds and slinging on rifles and cartridgepouches we mounted and sallied forth upon the plain  a glorious sensation of freedom came over me as i felt my horses springy stepa sensation which brought powerfully back the memory of those days when i first galloped over the american prairies  surely there must be a sympathy a mesmeric influence between a horse and his rider which sends a thrill through each  hobson had lent me his own favourite horse rob roy  he was a charming creature well made active willing and tender in the mouth but best of all he trippled splendidly  trippling is a favourite gait in south africa especially among the dutch farmers  it is something between pacing and ambling a motion so easy that one scarce rises at all from the saddle  we trippled off into the vast plain towards the horizon each horseman diverging a little from his comrades like a fleet of fishingboats putting out to sea most of the party rode without coats for the sky was cloudless and we looked for a broiling day  brownarms i observed had his sleeves rolled up as usual to the shoulder  sixfoot johnny rode a creamcoloured pony which like himself enjoyed itself intensely and seemed ready for anything  each man grasped his rifle by the middle with the right hand and rested the stock on his thigh  being a stranger to the work i had been supplied with a hottentot as well as a horseto guide me and carry my rifle but i scorned to ride without my weapon and did not at first see the necessity of a guide in the circumstances  ultimately i was only too glad to avail myself of his services  the south africans call hottentots boys whatever their age or size may be  my boy was named michael  he was a small wiry man of twenty or thirtymore or lesswith a dirty brown face dirty brown garments and a dirty brown horse  though a bad one to look at it was a marvellous horse to go  michael had a cavernous red mouth and magnificent white teeth  likewise he was gifted with a strong sense of the ludicrous as i have reason to know  we advanced slowly into the plain at first and gradually scattered until some of the party began to look like mere specks in the distance presently i saw two or three of them break into a gallop and observed a few moving spots of white on the horizon  i looked anxiously at my boy he returned the gaze with glittering eyes and said bok  boks are they said i applying my spur and making a leap over an antbear hole  rob roy stretched his legs with a will but a howl from michael caused me to look round  he was trending off in another direction and pointing violently towards something  he spoke nothing but dutch  my acquaintance with that tongue was limited to the single word ja  he was aware of this and his visage became all eyes and mouth in his frantic effort to assure me it would be wise were i to follow his lead  i turned at once and galloped alongside of him in faith  it soon became clear what he aimed at  the horsemen on the far off horizon were driving the springboks towards the stream which bounded one side of the great plain mike was making for the bushes that bordered that stream in the hope of reaching them before the boks should observe us  oh it was a glorious burst that first race over the wild karroo on a spirited steed in the freshness of early morning    with the silent bushboy alone by my side  for he was silent though tremendously excited  his brown rags fluttered in the selfmade breeze and his brown pony scrambled over the ground quite as fast as rob roy  we reached a clump of underwood in time and pulled up panting beside a bush which was high enough to conceal the horses  anxiously we watched here and carefully did i look to my riflea doublebarrelled breechloading soaperhenryto see that it was loaded and cocked and frequently did i take aim at stump and stone to get my hand and eye well in and admiringly with hope in every lineament did michael observe me  see anything of them mike  i asked  i might as well have asked a baboon  mike only grinned but mikes grin once seen was not easily forgotten  suddenly mike caught sight of something and bolted  i followed  at the same moment pop pop went rifles in different parts of the plain we could not see anything distant for the bushes but presently we came to the edge of an open space into which several springboks were trotting with a confusedly surprised air  now sarnows you chance said mike using the only english sentence he possessed and laying hold of the bridle of my horse  i was on the ground and down on one knee in such a hurry that to this day i know not by what process i got off the horse  usually when thus taken by surprise the springboks stop for a moment or two and gaze at the kneeling hunter  this affords a splendid though brief chance to take good aim but the springboks were not inquisitive that day  they did not halt  i had to take a running shot and the ball fell short to my intense mortification  i had sighted for three hundred yards  sighting quickly for five hundred while the frightened animals were scampering wildly away i put a ball in the dust just between the legs of one  the leap which that creature gave was magnificent  much too high to be guessed at with a hope of being believed  the full significance of the animals name was now apparent  charging a breechloader is rapid work but the flock was nine hundred or a thousand yards off before i could again take aim  in despair i fired and sent a bullet into the midst of them but without touching one  i now turned to look at the boy who was sitting on his pony with both eyes nearly shut and a smile so wide that the double row of his teeth were exposed to the very last grinders  but he became extremely grave and sympathetic as i turned towards him and made a remark in dutch which was doubtless equivalent to better luck next time  remounting i rode to the edge of the clump of bushes and found several of my companions some of whom carried the carcasses of springboks at their cruppers  hope revived at once and i set off with them in search of another flock  youve failed i see remarked my friend jonathan hobson in a sympathetic tone  ah what a blessed thing is sympathy  yes said i my shots fell short  dont let that discourage you returned jonathan youre not used to the karroo  distance is very deceptive  sighting ones rifle is the chief difficulty in these regions but youll soon come to it  another flock of springboks was discovered at this moment on a distant knoll towards which we trotted trippled and cantered  we quickly scatteredeach man taking his own course  sixfoot johnny already burdened with a buck went off at reckless speed  he soon came near enough to cause the game to look up inquiringly  this made him draw rein and advance with caution in a sidling and indirect manner  in a few minutes the boks trotted off  we were now within long range and made a dash at racingspeed to head them  the creatures absolutely played with us at first and performed some of their astounding leaps as if for our special amusement  had they set off at full speed at once we should not have had a chance for they are fleeter than horses their manner of leaping is a la indiarubber ball  it is not a bound forwards but a stott straight upwardssix eight or nine feet without apparent effort and displaying at each bound a ridge or fold of pure white hair on their backs which at other times is concealed  we now put on a spurt and the leading men got near enoughbetween two and three hundred yards  they dismounted dropped their bridles and kneeled to take aim  brownarms fired and brought one downso did broadshoulders  sixfoot johnny in his eagerness let the cream pony stumble somehow and went over its headalso over his own and landed on his knees  the bok he was after stopped to gaze at the catastrophe johnny profiting by his position took aim and tumbled it over  mike was by this time leading me towards an animal  we got within three hundred yards when it began to stretch out  further pursuit being useless i pulled up leaped off kneeled fired and missed againthe ball although straight falling short  with wild haste i scrambled on rob roywho by the way stood as still as a stone when left with the bridle thrown over his head and hanging from his nose  the horses were trained to this  loading as i ran we soon came to a bok which had been turned by some of the other hunters  again i raced pulled up leaped off and fired the pop pop was now going on all over the plain and balls were whistling everywhere  again my bok refused to stop to look at meas he ought to have doneand again i missed  michaels eyes were now quite shut and his jaws visible to the wisdom teethsupposing he possessed any  growing reckless under disappointment i now dashed away in pursuit of animals that had been scattered by the fusillade and fired right and left at all ranges between two and ten hundred yards but without any other effect than that of driving up the dust under two or three of them and causing many of their astounding leaps  soon the rest of the party were scattered so far on the plain as to be utterly out of sight and hearing  as far as sensation went my tottie and i were as lonely in that wilderness as was mungo park in days gone by  all this time the sun was blazing in the sky with unclouded and fervent heat  it had been 110 degrees in the shade at ebenezer a day or two before therefore i judged it to have been much the same on this occasion  there was not a breath of wind  everything was tremulous with heat  suddenly i beheld with the deepest interest a magnificent lake with beautiful islets scattered over its crystal breast  often had i read of the mirage of african deserts and much had i thought about it  now for the first time it was before me  never was deception more perfect if i had not known that no such lake existed in the region i should have been almost ready to stake my life on the reality of what i saw no wonder that thirsty travellers in unknown regions should have so often pushed forward in eager pursuit of this beautiful phantom  things are not what they seem truly  this applies to many terrestrial things but to none of them more thoroughly than to the mirage  while i was looking at it the form of the lake altered sufficiently to have dispelled the illusion if i had been labouring under it  in a few minutes it passed away altogether but only to reappear elsewhere  another curious effect and rather absurd mistake resulted from the different densities in the superheated atmosphere which caused this mirage  fancying that i saw two springboks on the horizon i pointed them out to my boy  ja said mike nodding his head and riding towards them at a smart canter  as we advanced i observed that the boks began to grow rather larger than life and that mike slackened his pace and began to grin it turned out that the objects were two carts with white canvas hoods and when we came up to them we found they belonged to a party who had come out to join us but who up to that hour had been unable to discover us in the vast huntingfield  after directing them to our camp we proceeded on our way  that is to say mike did  for myself i was completely lost and if left to myself should have been quite unable to return to camp  while galloping along revelling in the sunshinein the love of which i will not yield to catswe came suddenly on the largest snake i had yet seen  it was i believe a cobra must have been fully six feet long if not more and was gliding with an easy sinuous motion over the plain as fast apparently as a mans ordinary runningpace  i observed that it did not get out of the way of small bushes but went straight through them without the smallest check to its speed  it suddenly dived into a hole and disappeared  it is said that when snakes take to a hole to escape pursuit some of them have a habit of causing their heads to stop abruptly at the entrance and allowing their bodies and tails to flip past like the lash of a whip so that if the pursuer were to thrust in his hand to grasp the tail he would be met by the fangs  as the bite of most south african snakes means death if the part be not cut out or otherwise effectually treated handling them is carefully avoided nevertheless my friend jonathanwhen a younger man let us hopewas in the habit of occasionally catching deadly snakes by the tail swinging them round his head and dashing out their brains on a stone or tree  soon we perceived two of our comrades driving a flock of springboks towards the river  mike at once diverged towards a clump of bushes which it seemed probable they would pass  in ten minutes we were down in a hollow with the horses hid behind a mimosathorn  the boks had not seen us being too much taken up with their pursuers they came straight towards us  now sar whispered mike once again while his eyes glared with glee nows you chance  i went down on one knee carefully sighted the rifle and looked up the foremost bok was within good range  i fired and missed desolation said i cramming in another cartridge while the flock diverged to the left  there was no hope now of anything but a running shot  i aimed carefully  the smoke cleared off the flock dashed on butone bok lay prone upon the earth  bang went my second barrel and another bok leaping into the air fell rose fell again then rose and ran on  mike was now jubilant  the whole internal structure of his mouth was disclosed to view in his satisfaction as he viewed the prostrate animal  i may add that although we did not find the wounded bok that evening we found him next day  with our prize strapped behind mikes saddle we rode in triumph into camp a little before sunset and found most of our companions assembled busy preparing supper and making other arrangements for camping out on the veldtas they call the plain  some had been successful some had failed but a good many springboks had been killed and all were hearty as crickets and hungry as hyenas  to kindle fires boil tea roast venison steaks spread blankets on the ground and otherwise attend to the duties of the bivouac was now the order of the hour  the moon rose while we were thus engaged and mingled her pale light with the ruddy blaze of campfires  we spoke little and ate much  then followed the inevitable pipe and the pleasant chat but we were all too ready for rest to care about keeping it up long  i was constrained to take the bed of honour in the cart  the others stretched their limbs on the karroo and in ten minutes every man was in the land of nod  next day we mounted at daybreak and renewed the hunt but i will say no more about it than that we bagged twentysix springboks amongst us and that sixfoot johnny having killed the greatest number of animals returned home king of the hunt with a scrap of ostrich feather in his cap    letter three  somersetthe british settlersoriginal ownersnative churchgoing  on my way to the karroo i had to pass through somerset east and it so fell out that i fell in with a countryman from edinburgh who chanced to be going to somerset in the same passengercart with myself  his name must have been a novelty once though much of its freshness is worn off nowit was brown  our cart had a hood the roads were very bad and the behaviour of that hood was stupendous  its attachment to the cart was so to speak partial therefore it possessed a semiindependent motion which was perplexing  you could not count on its actions  a sudden lurch of the cart to right or left did of course carry the hood with it and counting on that you laid your sudden plans to avoid collision but the elasticity of the hood enabled it to give you a slap on the face before obeying its proper impulse  so too it would come down on your head unexpectedly or without the slightest provocation would hit you on the neck behind  i learned with painful certainty in that cart that i had a small to my back  it seemed to me that it grew large before the journey was over  brown was an intelligent mannot an unusual state of things with the browns  he had two pretty daughters with him aged eight and twelve respectively  we got on well together and crossed the zuurberg range in company on the last day of the year  it was over passes in this range that the settlers of 1820 went in long trains of cape wagons with wives and little ones and household goods and civilised implements of husbandry and weapons of defence with high hopes and strong courage and with their lives in their hands to subdue the wilderness  it was from these heights that they looked over the beautiful and bushclad plains of albany which lay before them as the lot of their inheritance  the breaking up and scattering of the various parties was most eloquently and graphically told by the reverend hh dugmore in a lecture delivered at grahamstown on the occasion of the british settlers jubilee in may 1870fifty years after the arrival of the fathers  see note 1 i quote one passage which gives a good idea of the manner in which the land was taken up  and now the sundays river is crossed and the terrible old ado hill is climbed and quaggas flat is passed and the bushmans river heights are scaled  the points of divergence are reached and the long column breaks into divisions  baillies party made their way to the mouth of the fish river where it was said the head had been allowed to choose a territory and where he hoped to realise imaginations of commercial wealth by founding a seaport town  and the duke of newcastles proteges from nottingham took possession of the beautiful vale of clumber naming it in honour of their noble patron  and wilsons party settled between the plains of waayplaats and the kowie bush right across the path of the elephants some of which they tried to shoot with fowlingpieces  and seftons party founded the village of salem the religious importance of which to the early progress of the settlement is not to be estimated by its present size and population these four were the large parties  the smaller ones filled up the intervening spaces between them  behind the thicketclad sandhills of the kowie and green fountain and extending over the low plains beyond bathurst were the locations of cocks thornhills ostlers smiths and richardsons parties  skirting the wooded kloofs from bathurst towards the banks of the klienemonden were ranged the parties of james and hyman  it was the latter who gravely announced to captain trapps the bathurst magistrate the discovery of precious stones on his location and which the angry gentleman jealous of the reserved rights of government found on further inquiry were only precious big ones the rich valley of lushington afforded a restingplace to dyasons party  holders people called their location new bristol which never however acquired any resemblance to old bristol  passing on towards the front there were mounceys party hayhursts party bradshaws party southeys party stretching along the edge of the wide plains of the round hill and drinking their western waters  the post of honour and of danger was the line of the kap river  this was occupied by the party of scott below kafir drift and by the irish party above it  the forlorn hope of the entire settlement was mahonys party at the clay pits who had to bear the first brunt of every kafir depredation in the lower albany direction  names thicken as we proceed from waayplaats towards grahamstown  passing greatheads location we come among the men of dalgairns at blauw krantz  then those of liversage about manlys flats  john stanley head of all parties as he styled himself belonged to the same neighbourhood  turveys party were in grobblaars kloof william smiths at stony vale dr clarkes at collingham howards morgans and carlisles bring us by successive steps to the neighbourhood of grahamstown  my reminiscences are those of an albany settler but i do not forget that there was another party who though locally separated from the main body occupied a position the importance of which developed itself in the afterhistory of the settlement  i refer to the scotch party who were located on the baviaans river among mountains and glens that have been rendered classic by the poetry of their leader and historic by the gallant deeds and endurance of his compatriots in the afterstruggles of the frontier  i need make no particular reference however to the early circumstances of that body of men as in pringles african sketches they have a most graphicallywritten history of their own  thus in 1820 was the land overrun and taken possession of by the british settlers  it had once been the land of the hottentots but had never at any time rightfully belonged to the kafirs who after wrongfully entering it and rendering themselves by their thievish disposition and deceit an unbearable nuisance were finally driven out of it in 1819  the idea of government in sending the settlers out to occupy these vacated lands was that a convenient buffer might thus be placed on the frontier of the colony to keep the savages in check  that these settlers and their descendants received many a rude shock and played their part nobly has been proved and is admitted on all hands  that they received less encouragement and help from those who induced them to emigrate than might have been expected is equally certain  brown and i chatted more or less of these things as we toiled up the slopes of the zuurberg where the original settlers had toiled fiftyfive years before us and in the afternoon came to a pretty good inn where a small misfortune befell us  while we were indulging in a cup of tea one of our horses escaped  we had crossed the mountain range by that time and the truant had a fine range of undulating country to scamper over  that animal gave us some trouble for although nearly a dozen men went after him on horseback he kept dodging about actively with many flourishes of heels and tail during the whole afternoon  when one is in no hurry and the weather is fine a delay of this kind is rather pleasant than otherwise  while men and boys were engaged in the fruitless chase i wandered off into the bush in the hope of stumbling on a tortoise or a snake or some other creature that i had previously been accustomed to see in zoological collections but the reptiles kept close and refused to show themselves  i came however on a gigantic beehive at least it resembled one in appearance though the smoke that issued from a hole in its top suggested humanity  there was also a hole in one side partially covered by a rickety door  close beside it stood a little black creature which resembled a fat and hairless monkey  it might have been a baboon  the astonished gaze and grin with which it greeted me warranted such an assumption but when it suddenly turned and bolted through the hole into the beehive i observed that it had no tailnot even a vestige of such a creationand thus discovered that it was a tottie or hottentot boy  the sublime the quaint the miserable the ridiculous and the beautiful were before me in that scene  let me expound these five heads in order  on my left rose the woody slopes and crags of the zuurberg above whose summits the white hills and towers and gorgeous battlements of cloudland rose into the bright blue sky  around me were groups of flowering mimosa bushes with thorns from three to six inches long interspersed with which were curious aloes whose weird leafy tops gave them the aspect of shrubs growing upside down with their roots scrambling aimlessly in the air  in front stood the native hut the wretchedness of whose outside was only equalled by the filth and povertystricken aspect within  near to this were several native children as black as coal as impudentlooking as tomtits and as lively as crickets  beyond all lay the undulating plains studded with flowering shrubs of varied form and hue and bathed in golden sunshine  there is something sad ay and something mysterious to me in the thought that such a lovely land had been until so recently the home of the savage and the scene of his wicked and ruthless deeds  on new years day i dined in a public restaurant in somersetin a strange land with strangers  but the strangers were not shy  neither was i  there were about a dozen of us at table and before dinner was half over we were as sociable as if we had been bosom friends from infancy  we even got to the length of warm discussion and i heard some sentiments expressed regarding natives and native policy with which i could not agree but being ignorant on the subject at the time i stuck to general principles  it seemed to me that some of the speakers must have been born with their brains turned the wrong way  this idea recalls to memory the curious fact that during my first walk in somerset i saw a mounted hottentot policeman wearing his helmet with the fore part to the back because its rear peak was longer and a better sunshade than the front  the same tendency to sacrifice appearance to utility is observable among the malays of capetown who treat their souwesters similarly  my first visit to a native church was on a sundaythe hottest sunday i ever spent  the congregation was entirely black and brown  it also was hot so that the church was by no means cool  whatever depth or want of depth there might have been in the christianity of these people the garb and the bearing of civilisation were very obvious and very pleasant to behold  their behaviour was most orderly and modest though probably many of them had gone there to display their finery  taking my place near the pulpit i saw them to advantage  the church was pretty full  i sat down beside a very stout hottentot girl whose dress of showy chintz was as much a subject of interest to herself as of indifference to the congregation  there were marvellous contrasts and surprising harmonies displayed in that church with not a few discords childlike goodhumour sat on every countenance  when mr green ascended the pulpit eager expectancy gleamed in every jetblack eye  when the psalm was given out the preparatory clearing of throats and consequent opening of thick red lips and revelation of splendid rows of teeth all over the church had quite a lightingup effect on the scene  they sang heartily and well of courseall black people do so i think  just opposite me sat a young man with a countenance so solemn that i felt sure he had made up his mind to be good and get the full benefit of the services  his black cheeks seemed to glisten with earnestness his thick lips pouted with devotional goodwill  i do not write in ridicule but merely endeavour to convey my full meaning  he wore a superfine black dress coat a gaudy vest and buff corduroy trousers so short that they displayed to advantage his enormous bare feet  beside him was an elderly man with tweed trousers a white shirt and brown shooting coat and a face not quite so solemn but very sedate  some of the men had boots some had black silk hats others wideawakeswhich of course they removed on entering  it seemed to me that there was among them every part and variety of costume from morning to evening dress but no individual could boast of being complete in himself  as for the women they were indescribable  some of them wore little more than a blanket others were clothed in the height of european fashionor something like itand all had evidently put on their sundays best  one stout and remarkably healthy young woman appeared in a brilliant skirt and an indescribable hat with ostrich feathers on her woolly head  she sat herself down close beside me and went to sleep at the beginning of the sermonnot out of irreverence i am persuaded but from heat  in this state she continued swaying to and fro to the end of the discourse occasionally drooping as though she meant to make a pillow of my shoulder which she would certainly have done but for a more modestly clad hottentot girl at her other side who evidently scandalised kept poking at her continuously with her elbow  in justice to the congregation i am bound to add that i saw very few sleepers they were most attentive and earnest despite the distracting elements of a humorous kind that obtruded themselves  somerset east is a pretty town on the little fish river at the foot of the boschberg mountains which rise abruptly from the plain  it boasts of banks a newspaper several churches and the gill collegean imposing edifice which was erected by private endowment  in regard to its inhabitants all i can say is that the few members i had the pleasure of meeting there during a three days sojourn were exceedingly hospitable and kind    note 1  this deeply interesting lecture was published in grahamstown as a pamphlet entitled the reminiscences of an albany settler    letter four  adventures with ostriches  ostrichfarming is no childs play  it involves risk in more ways than one and sometimes taxes both the courage and strength of the farmer  in ordinary circumstances the ostrich is a mild inoffensive creature indeed the female is always so but when a male ostrich is what i may style nestingwhen enclosed in a large field or paddock he guards his wives and his eggsno lion of the desert no tiger of the jungle or kloof is more ferocious or more savagely bent on the death of any or all who dare to intrude on his domain  the power of the ostrich too is quite equal to his strength of will he stands from seven to nine feet in height and is very heavy  his tremendous legs are his only weapons and his kick is almost if not quite equal to that of a horse  possessing enormous feet with two toes on each the horny points of which can cut and rip like cold chisels he rushes at an adversary and kicks or hits out straightforward like a prizefighter  no unarmed man on earth could stand long before a furious male ostrich without being killed  but there are one or two weak points about him which abate somewhat the danger of his attack  in the first place his power lies only in his mighty legs the thighs of whichbluegrey and destitute of feathers are like two shoulders of mutton  with his beak he can do nothing and his long neck is so weak that if you can only lay hold of it and pull his head to the ground you are comparatively safe for he cannot kick effectively in that position and devotes all his energies when thus caught to useless attempts to pull his head out of your grasp  but then how are you to get hold of that neckthe root of which stands nearly as high as your own headin the face of two claws that go like batteringrams wrought by lightning  as well might you attempt to lay hold of a prizefighters nose while his active fists are darting out at you  a powerful active man has been known when attacked while unarmed to spring on the bird grasp a wing with one arm and the body with the other and hug it but there is great danger in this method because in the attempt you are pretty sure to receive at least one kick and that if it takes effect will be quite sufficient to put you out of action it also requires much power of endurance for hugging a creature that is strong enough to dance about and lift you off your legs in its wild efforts to get rid of you must be hard work  supposing that you do succeed however in holding on until you work your way along to the neck and get the head into custody then you can without much difficulty choke the bird but a male ostrich costs about 150 pounds and one hesitates to choke 150 pounds even for the sake of ones life especially when the valuable bird belongs to ones friend  another and perhaps the best plan if you are caught unarmed is to lie down  an ostrich cannot kick you when you lie flat on the ground he can only dance on you and although that process is unpleasant it is not necessarily fatal  the ostrich is easily killed by a blow on the neck with a stout stick but this is as objectionable as the choking process on the ground of cost  in short the only legitimate method of meeting a savage papa in his own field is with a strong forked pole eight or nine feet long with which you catch the bird at the root of the neck and thus keeping him at poleslength let him kick and hiss away to his hearts content till he is tired or until assistance comes to you or until you work him near a wall when you may jump over and escape for an ostrich will not jump  often have i gone thus armed with my friend hobson to feed the nesting ostriches  the risk of attack i may mention in passing is not great when two men go together because the bird seems undecided which foe to attack and generally ends by condescending to pick at the mealies indian corn which are thrown down to him  one morning hobson and his eldest son sixfoot johnny and i mounted our steeds and rode away to the field in which one of the male ostriches dwelt with his meek brown wives  the wives are always brown the husbands are jetblack with the exception of those magnificent and pure white feathers in wings and tail which are so much prized and worn by the fair dames of europe  hobson carried a sack of mealies at his saddlebow  there were several male birds on the farm all of which were distinguished by name  there were master and david marais and black jack and blindboy minus one eye and gouws etcetera our visit that morning was to david marais  david was by far the fiercest of the lot but he was excessively fond of mealies and could be attractedthough by no means appeasedby these  johnny said hobson as we cantered along by the side of the little stream which caused a strip of bright fertility to wind like a greensnake over the brown karroo and which was as it were the lifeblood of the farm johnny i want you to go to the nest and count the eggs while i keep david in play  very well father  the order and the quiet acceptance of it did not seem to involve much yet johnny had been ordered on somewhat dangerous service that morning for david marais was intensely watchful as well as savage  several of the other males although capable of giving way to temper were so far amiable that my friend and i had frequently gone into their enclosures with our forked sticks and mealies and had received no worse at their hands than a threatening attitude or a suspicious look which passed away when the food was thrown down but davids temper was such that we never ventured into his paddock contenting ourselves by throwing the mealies over the hedge or wall that bounded the field  this field or enclosure by the way was not a small piece of ground which one could take in at a glance  it was more than a mile in extent undulating in form with a stream bisecting it and mimosa bushes scattered here and there so that from any one point you could not see the entire field or ascertain its exact form or size  sometimes on going into such a field one has to look about for the birdsalso to look out for them as they are prone to sudden assault  but david marais required no looking for  his large eagleeye had detected us from afar and we found him at the nearest extremity of the nearest angle of his grounds ready to give us battle pacing slowly to and fro with that peculiar motion of the wings which indicates suppressed wrath  we rode along close to his hedge a short distance and he marched with us brushing against the hedge and showing an anxious desire to get at us  if there had been a gap in that hedge he would have charged like a thunderbolt but there was no gap and it is a strange fact that an ostrich cannot leapat least he will not  the merest trifle of an obstructiona bit of wall or hedge over which he could step with perfect easeis sufficient to check his advance and keep him in that is if he walks up to it but he is a stupid bird and if he runs up to such an obstruction he may tumble over it gather himself up on the other side and so continue the charge  on reaching a part of the hedge which dipped into a hollow hobson dismounted and opened the sack with the peaceoffering  the bird after breasting up to the hedge and finding it impassable sat down on what may be styled his elbows scraped his wings on the ground and rolled his head and neck about in a fashion that is indescribable  this i was told was his method of rousing himself or of relieving his feelings it looked more like making a fool of himself  a handful of mealies seemed to irritate him at first but by degrees the temptation became too strong  he commenced to pick a few seedsready however on the smallest provocation to forsake them charge up to the hedge and hiss at us  now johnny ill keep him in play said hobson senior  you go round to the nest  keep well down in the hollows else hell be sure to see you  johnny at once rode off  the suspicious david looked after him and showed a tendency to retire in the direction of his nest but hobson raised his forked stick over the hedge and made a demonstration therewith  this was more than enough  inflated with rage david at once accepted the challenge and rushed back to the hedge over which another handful of mealies were thrown at him but mealies had lost much of their power by that time  thus with alternate taunt and temptation was the false attack maintained by the father while the real attack was made by the son at the other extremity of the fortress  i followed the real attack  we did not go direct  the bird would at once have made for its nest had we done so  we rode off in the direction in which we had come until out of sight and then making a long circuit at full gallop came round to the other end of the enclosure from which point the enemy could not be seen  there was a wall to cross then a deep hollow through which the little stream ran then a belt of pretty thick bushes beyond which on the open plain the nest was known to lieif i may call that a nest which is a mere hollow in the sand in which the eggs are laid  here the female sits all day while the male marches about on guard  at night the male sits while the female goes about and feeds  they are most attentive parents and there is a fitness in this arrangement as regards colour for the brown female squatted on the brown karroo is almost invisible in daylight while the black male is equally invisible during the darkness of the night  you mustnt come with me said johnny dismounting it would only increase the chance of my being seen by david  i was detailed therefore to the inglorious duty of holding the horses while my young friend made the assault alone  he leaped the wall descended into the bed of the stream scrambled up the opposite bank crossed the clump of small wood and came out into the open  now a short piece of this openfifty yards or so perhaps was visible from the lower end of the field where hobson and david were still coquetting with each other  johnny tried to skulk over this open ground  he might as well have sought to evade the eyes of argus  the longsighted bird caught the very first glint of his cap  insult and mealies were alike unavailing now  he forsook the sire and made at the son with his great compasslike legs covering the ground in tremendous as well as rapid strides  no racehorse ever cleared the ground like david marais  johnny saw that the game was up  applying his own long legs to the ground with a will he rushed at the nest  the female bounced up ran a few yards and squatted in helpless stupidity  johnny counted the eggs turned and fled  not a moment too soon  indeed he was too late for the ostrich was already close up and johnnys retreat by the way he had come was cut off but he turned at a sharp angle and made for another clump of bushes through which he plunged with a wild hilarious laugh into the safe retreat of the riverbed  david marais could not follow there but he doubtless consoled himself with the reflection that he had gallantly defended his wife and little ones and had beaten the enemy from the field  nothing of all this had i seen for the belt of bushes hid the actors from view but i heard the ringing laugh with rather anxious surprise and saw johnny emerge immediately after from the banks of the stream flushed and panting from his adventure  that i do not exaggerate the power and ferocity of these birds may be gathered from an incident which occurred to hobson himself and which he related on our way home  one morning he rode to the enclosure of the bird named master and entered intending to feed him and his wife with mealies  master must have risen off his wrong side that morning for instead of amiably accepting his breakfast he made a sudden and furious rush at his benefactor  hobsons horse wheeled round and boltedno wonder with the claw of an ostrich acting as a spur on his flank  the horse was so frightened that he fairly ran away  master ran after him and being much fleeter kept on kicking his legs and flanks so that they were soon covered with blood and once he kicked so high as to cut the crupper  the horse became almost mad with terror and quite ungovernable  it was chased round and round the place the walls being too high to leap and the gate having been closed  at last the horse dashed madly into a mimosa bush and stuck fast  the impetuous master followed but before he could back out hobson caught him by the throat in his powerful grasp  he held on until master choked  not wishing to kill the bird he then let go and master dropped like a stone  hobson then galloped to the river but master who recovered immediately came rushing on to renew the attack  hobson however had found shelter and safety behind some bushes in the bed of the stream  not long after our visit to david marais i went with sixfoot johnny to the territory which belonged to blindboy  that sagacious bird was not so blind but that with his one eye he observed us coming and met us more than halfway  knowing him to be comparatively a peaceable bird and being mounted we entered the enclosure and rode towards him  from certain symptoms and rufflings of the feathers and cockings of the tail however my companion knew that blindboy was not as amiable as might have been wished  take care said johnny  why said i  because hes angry  the signs of wrath did not appear to me very obvious but i afterwards came to understand that in an ostrich a small amount of demonstration means an extreme depth of anger  we rode slowly forward  blindboy advanced as slowly with a dangerous motion of the wings  keep on this side of the ditch said johnny  now then wed better be off  before i well understood that it was advisable to get out of the birds way my companion had put spurs to his horse and was off like an arrow or ever i was aware what my horse meant to do i was almost thrown to the ground  he whirled on his hindlegswithout ordersand went off like the wind  nothing but a natural tendency to hold tight with my knees prevented me from being left beside blindboy  we went at racingspeed to the gate and then found on looking back that we might have spared ourselves the rush for blindboy was standing as we left him  the ditch had proved an impassable barrier and he was gazing after us in apparent wonder at our haste  my own wonder at the smart behaviour of my horse was removed when johnny told me that it was the identical steed his father had ridden when attacked as i have described by master  johnny himself was once assaulted trampled on and severely cut about the head by one of these same ostriches and might have been killed if his father had not chanced to be at hand  johnny was younger at the time and in the foolish ardour of youth attempted to rise when knocked down  this gave the ostrich the opportunity of once and again repeating his blows  if the lad had lain still he would have suffered less  i might draw a beautiful moral on submission and humility out of this but wont  strange to say the male ostrich loses nearly all his courage when out of his own proper paddock or domain  this was illustrated to me one morning in the case of gouws  we were walking by the side of his enclosure and he was advancing to meet us in his own warlike style when we observed that the gate was open  before we could get near to close it gouws marched through  if we had entered his grounds an attack would have been highly probable but no sooner did he find himself outside the accustomed wall than the spirit in him changed  he looked confusedly round at the unfamiliar objects then dropped his defiant tail and fled  it cost us the better part of a forenoon with temperature at 105 degrees in the shade before we succeeded in driving that bird back into his own paddock and all that time he was running away from us overwhelmed apparently with fear    letter five  more about ostricheskarroo gardensa ride with bonnysketching under difficultiesanecdotes and incidents  ah those were happy days when with a congenial spirit i drove and galloped over the south african plains  there was not much in the way of thrilling incidents to be sure and nothing whatever of wild adventure but there was novelty in everything and possibilities enough to keep the spirit ever on the alert  we used to ride out sometimes after steenbokssmall brown creatures that made little show when bagged but then there were huge and horrid vultures to remind one of the sandy desert and there were pauws gigantic birds that were splendid eating and the very thought that i trod on land which little more than quarter of a century back had been marked by the print of the royal lion was in itself sufficient to arouse unwonted interest which was increased by the knowledge of the fact that the kloofs or glens and gorges of the blue hills on the horizon were at that time the natural homes of leopards or capetigers and huge baboons  these animals are however extremely wary  the baboons go about in troops and are wont to leave a trusty oldman baboon on guard while the rest go down at early morn to rob the settler of his fruits and vegetables  if the old man happens to see or scent danger he gives a signal and the troop flies helterskelter to the nearest cliffs  they are therefore not easily got at by hunters  as to tigers they go about stealthily like cats  i was told there was not a chance of getting a shot at them unless i went out with dogs and a hunting party for the purpose  as this could not be accomplished at the time i had to content myself with smaller game  bonny one of hobsons younger sons and i went out one day after breakfast to try for a steenbok before dinner  there were plenty of them in the stretches of bushland that dotted the karroo in the immediate neighbourhood of the farmhouse  stretching out at a gallop with that lighthearted cheerfulness which is engendered by bright weather fresh air and a good mount we skirted the river where hreikie nursed her little flock  hreikie was a small hottentot girl as lightly clad as was compatible with propriety  her face was dirty brown her mouth large her nose a shapeless elevation with two holes in the front of it  her head was not covered but merely sprinkled with tight woolly knobs or curls the size of peas  each knob grew apart from its neighbour knob and was surrounded so to speak by bald or desert land  this style of hair was not peculiar to hreikie alone but to the whole hottentot race hreikies family consisted of thirtythree young ostriches which though only a few weeks of age stood i think upwards of two feet high  some of them had been brought out by artificial incubationhad been heated as it were into existence without maternal aid  these birds bonny said had been already purchased for 15 pounds sterling apiece and were deliverable to the purchaser in six months  they were fed and guarded all day and housed each evening with tender solicitude by their hottentot stepmother whom the birds evidently regarded as their own natural parent  we swept on past the garden where on a previous morning bonny and i had killed a deadly greentree snake upwards of five feet long and where on many other mornings he and i with sometimes other members of the family entered into strong temptation among the magnificent fruit we used to overcome the temptation by giving way to it  there were plums peaches figs apples apricots grapes nectarines and other fruits with which the trees were so laden that some of the branches had given way and their luscious loads were lying on the ground  cartloads of these were given away to friends and to any one as there was no market for their disposal  many splendid gardens like this exist on what is sometimes styled the barren karroo but the land is anything but barren  all it requires is a copious supply of water and wherever farmers have taken the trouble to form dams and store the heavy though infrequent rains gardens of the most prolific kind have been the result  the karroobush itself which gives name to these plains is a succulent plant which thrives in the almost waterless soil and forms a rich pasturage for sheep and cattle hobsons gardencopiously watered by streams led out from his large damswas a beautiful shady oasis of green and gold in the midst of what to some eyes might have appeared a desert but which if irrigated properly would become a perfect paradise of fertility  we cantered on over the plain till the garden and the farm looked in the distance like ships at sea and rode among the bushes that crowned a rising ground  we set up some guineafowl and other birds and startled a hare but let them go as our aim was steenboks  the little boks however were not on the knoll that day so away we went again at a gallop until the garden and the farm went down on the horizon  sometimes we kept together and chatted at other times we diverged and skirted small clumps of underwood on opposite sides  at one time while separated from bonny i saw a large stone lying on the ground  as i looked the stone began to crawl  it was a tortoise fully as large as a souptureen  the sight of an animal in its native wilds which you have all your life been accustomed to see in zoological gardens has something peculiar almost absurd in it  as it is with animals so it is with other objects  i remember being impressed with this idea for the first time in the south of france when i beheld a tree covered with lemonsa fruit which up to that period had been connected in my mind with grocers windows and brown sugar  i turned aside and dismounted  the sluggish tortoise stopped recognised in me an enemy and drew in its head and feet  after lifting and looking at him i set him down  then it occurred to me that some one had said a tortoise could carry a man  i stepped upon this ones back forthwith  he lay perfectly still for some time  at last with great caution the head and feet were protruded  another pause as if of meditation then the feet were applied to the ground they pushed and strained until finally the creature advanced about two inches and then stopped  this was not much but it was sufficient to prove his great strength and to convince me that a large tortoise could easily have walked off with a little boy  i found bonny dismounted and waiting  no steenboks today i fear he said  we must have a shot at something bonny said i dismounting and sitting down on an anthill  having been a fair average shot in a rifle corps in scotland i took careful aim at a small bush bent on doing credit to the british volunteers  the result was a bullseye  capital exclaimed bonny if you shoot like that youll kill plenty of boks  half an hour later i was passing round the left of a knoll while bonny took the right  up leaped a steenbok which ran a hundred yards or so and stopped to look at me  i was already off the horse and down in the hythe position  a careful aim was again taken  the result was a miss while the small deer vanished like the smoke of my rifle  so great is the difference between targetpractice and hunting  it was time now to think of returning for dinner  i was thoroughly lost by that time in the vast plainlike a ship at sea without a compass but bonny was as knowing in karroocraft as a kentucky hunter is in woodcraft  he steered as true a course for home as if he had smelt the leg of mutton that was roasting at the fire  probably he didin imagination  soon the two ships reappeared on the horizon our fleet nags quickly transformed them into the garden and the farm and in half an hour we were relating our mild adventure round hobsons hospitable board  im going to visit brother jonathan after dinner will you come said my host  yes with pleasure said i but first while you have your siesta midday nap i will go into the opposite field and make that longtalkedof sketch of your house  very good ill send for you when the cart is ready  there are some ostriches in the field but you dont need to mind them for they are quite young although fullgrown  it is a common custom among south africans to take a nap in the heat of the day during summer  they dine early and the power of the sun at that part of the day renders work almost impossible  i could not at first fall in with this custom therefore while the family retired i took my sketchbook and colours and went off to the field  there was a mound whence i could obtain a good view of the house with its surroundings the cattlekraal or enclosure the course of the little stream with one of the small dams or lakelets and the garden the whole backed by the blue mountain range on the horizon  the sun was blazing fiercely but as before remarked i delight in heat  selecting a stone i sat down opened my book and colourbox and began  to those who dont know it i may say that sketching is a most fascinating and engrossing species of work  i soon forgot where i was forgot hobson forgot time forgot every thing in fact except the glowing face of nature when a sound recalled me  i looked round and observed eight or ten huge ostriches stalking towards me with slow funereal gait  i felt somewhat uneasyfor their youth of which hobson had assured me was in no way indicated by their huge bodies and dreadful legs  however i had taken the precaution to carry my forked stick and drawing it nearer continued at my work with an easier mind if they meant war i knew escape to be hopeless for the nearest wall was a quarter of a mile off  the females halted at a respectful distance but two of the largest black males came stalking close up to me and stood still gazing intently first with one eye then with the other at a distance of about six yards  meanwhile some of the females sat down and one of them put herself in an attitude so absurd that i introduced her into the drawing  presently the largest male advanced a little nearer and kept somewhat behind me this was embarrassing  it occurred to me that in the art of war an attacking party is supposed to have the advantage of one that is assaulted  i therefore rose brought my fork to the charge and went at the bird with a furious roar  it turned and ran a few yards but stopped when i stopped and began to return slowly as before the moment i had sat down  as it drew nearer i observed that it eyed my colourbox curiously  stories about the peculiar taste of these giant birds recurred to me  people say they will eat anything  their digestive powers have passed into a proverb  the day before i had given an ostrich a large apple which it coolly bolted and i could trace the progress of the apple by the lump in its throat as it passed rather slowly down  some onebonny i rather thinkhad told me he had seen an ostrich accept and swallow a bottle of shoeblacking  anything bright is sure to attract the eye of an ostrich and be coveted  i trembled for my colourbox and seizing my fork charged again  about this time bonny himself came to say that the cart was ready  we therefore packed up and came away  the ostriches he said were too young to think of molesting us though he admitted that they would probably have swallowed the colourbox if i had allowed them  they followed us down to the gate and finally saw us safely off their premises  father once had an ostrich said bonny as we walked towards the house that caught a couple of thieves for him  indeed how was that bonny  you are aware that kafirs are terrible thieves he replied  yes ive been given to understand that they have propensities that way  oh but you have no idea how clever they are at it and the totties are just as bad if not worse  on one occasion we had a nest of eggs in the field over there which we had left to be hatched in the natural way by the henostrich  one night it rained very hardso hard that we feared the young ones would be drowned in the nest so brother johnny was sent to look after them  he took two totties with him  it was very dark but he found the nest with the cock bird sitting on it  you know the cock always sits at night  well johnny took him by the nose and pulled him off the nest and gave him to the two totties to hold  it was hard work but they kept his head well down so that he couldnt kick johnny soon bagged all the little ones leaped over the wall and then called out to let go the cock  it was so dark that he couldnt see very well  he could only hear a scuffle and then saw the two men bounding over the wall like indiarubber balls while the cock went bang against it like a batteringram  we got the little ones home all safe but would you believe it these rascally totties had managed to pull out all the best wingfeathers while they were holding the cockeach feather worth perhaps twenty shillings or moreand got clear away with them to the canteen where they can always sell stolen goods  but that is not what i was going to tell you continued bonny  it was about two kafir thieves who were going round the country stealing they came to our place one evening and in the course of their depredations happened to cross one of the fields where a pair of our ostriches had a nest  the cock had not yet commenced his night duty on the nest  he caught sight of the two kafirs and was down on them instantly like lightning  they took refuge in a mimosathorn and there he kept them all night  it was no use their trying to make a bolt for it because twice or three times their speed could not have saved them from the ostrich  there they remained and there father found them next morning when he rode out to feed the birds  the sturdy sons of this karroo farmer had no light duty to perform each day  the farm was twenty miles in length and of variable breadth there were no crops raised on it save the fruit of the splendid garden already mentioned some grapes and a few mealies  the sources of gain were ostriches and their feathers angora goat hair mohair horses sheepwool and cattle looking after which kept father and sons pretty constantly in the saddle  it was a dashing style of life requiring robust health and spirits  i have seen one or both of the boys return of an eveningafter having been up at five or six and out all day scarce able to decide whether to eat or sleep  counting and guarding the flocks formed a part of the duty  one evening the report was brought that a horse and thirteen bucks had disappeared  the kafir thief had driven them off in the direction of somerset  there he had been questioned closely as to where he came from etcetera  his replies not being satisfactory the animals were seized and put in the pound whence they were afterwards reclaimed while the thief escaped being put in the tronk or jail by a sudden dart into the jungle of the boschberg  my friend and i were soon on the road which led to the farm of his brother jonathan  it stood about two miles distant  on our way we had to pass one corner of the private domain of black jack or david marais i forget whichi think it was the former  he was there ready for us and evidently in a rage at the mere possibility of our intrusion for the wings were going like flails and the tail was up  hobson pulled up to look at him for a minute  i got down and went to the wall knowing that it afforded perfect security  black jack came up slowly as if he meant no mischief  i leant over the wall which was breasthigh and poked fun at him  in an instant like a flash of light he came at me i saw his great claw over my head and almost before i could jump back a couple of heavy stones were driven violently off the top of the wall to bolt and jump into the cart was almost an involuntary and instantaneous impulse on my part though there was no need for haste because the furious biped could not leap the wall  yes remarked my friend with a quiet chuckle as we drove along i expected as much  black jack is in a bad humour today  the farm of jonathan lay at the side of the stream which watered that of his brother  it was a pretty place  we drove through the stream to get to the house  on entering we found jonathan standing in his hall besprinkled with his own blood and smiling  he was one of those tall thin powerful sort of men with genial goodhumour wrinkling the corners of their eyes who seem to be ready to smile at everything pleasant or otherwise that befalls them  hallo whats wrong jonathan asked his brother with a touch of tenderness in his tone  nothing particular replied the other ive just had a tussle with one of my birds  he wriggled out of the stick and kicked me  on more particular inquiry we found that jonathan and his sonanother powerful sixfooterhad gone that morning to search for eggs which they felt sure must have been laid somewhere about the enclosed field to keep the male bird in play while the search was being made the father took his forked stick met the cock in single combat clapped the fork on his neck and let him kick away  all might have gone well for the father besides being strong was accustomed to such work but the bird instead of keeping up a straightforward assault as it ought to have done turned its back to its foe wriggled its neck in some inexplicable manner out of the fork and before it could be refixed had given jonathan several tremendous kicks  one of these nearly tore his trousers to pieces and another cut him across the right wrist into the bone  this rendered his right arm powerless for the moment and it might have gone ill with him had not his son who was still in sight observed what had occurred and run back to the rescue  as it was the fathers wrist was severely though i hope not permanently damaged  on a certain occasion three friends visited ebenezer  one of thesewe shall call him squibwas a sporting character and anxious to have a shot at the guineafowl which abounded on the farm  hobson with his usual kindness readily agreed to pilot him and his friends  the ground however said hobson is part of the domain which belongs to one of my ostriches whose temper is uncertain  i dont feel sure of him  perhaps it would be better  oh never mind that interrupted squib were not afraid of ostriches  come along  very well returned the host come along  and along they went to the domain of gouws who was found pacing solemnly inside the wall of his enclosure  his wings were active and his tail was cocked  otherwise he was calm enough to all appearance hobson knew that the bird was in a rage and said so but his friends who were young and reckless insisted on entering the enclosure  they did so and gouws followed them with a stately air but did not attack being no doubt perplexed by numbers  they walked in indian file hobson being the last of the line  i could turn him with a bit of a bush said squib glancing at gouws who was drawing gradually nearer to the party  just cut one for me hobson will you like a good fellow  hobson turned aside and stooped to cut a branch from a mimosa bush  just then the ostrich which had marched ahead of the party turned sharp round and charged  poor squib tripped by good luck and fell as the bird passed over him  it kicked down the other two and sprang on the shoulders of the stooping hobson who fell and gashed his finger as the bird tumbled over him  the whole party rose with marvellous celerity and the sportsmen rushed towards the boundary wall while gouws scrambled on his long legs and ran after them  had the distance been great their chance of escape would have been small  as it was gouws overtook one of the party just as he reached a part of the wall which had been mended with mimosathorn bushes  with one tremendous kick he sent the unfortunate man into the midst of the thorns where he would certainly have given him further punishment had he not been attracted by a yell of alarm from another of the party  poor squib was not fleet of foot or active  he made a clumsy attempt to vault the wall which his companions had already leaped  leaving his thornpierced victim gouws made at squib applied his huge foot to his person with a slap that must have forcibly recalled the days of childhood and sent him over the wall with undignified haste  it is generally believed that squib has not gone guineafowl shooting among ostriches since that day  the profits on ostrich feathers are very considerable  i do not profess to give statistical information in these pages but merely touch lightly on what came under my observation  at one farm which i visited near capetown i was told that the owner had cleared 2500 pounds in one year timid men are sometimes alarmed by depressions in the trade in feathers and some of them have sold off their birds at heavy loss but bold and hopeful men continue to persevere and prosper as such men always will in every trade all the world over  that ostrichfarming has been found worthy of zealous attention is proved by the fact that while in 1865 there were only between eighty and ninety birds in the colony in 1875 there were upwards of 22000  in 1925 there were 239000  some days afterwards i pretty well completed my circle of knowledge on this subject by witnessing the birth of an ostrich  hobson and i rode that day over to a lovely place named glenbonny on the edge of that part of the karroo where the mountainous lands begin it was a charming ride of forty milesthere and backwith a pleasant visit and a rest between  here dwelt relatives of my frienda family named berringtonone daughter of which with wealth of golden hair had been a shipmate on the voyage out  the principal neighbours of this family were tigers and baboons  there was a minor population of deer hyenas hares coneys monkeys and moles but no human beings of any kind  their dwelling was low and flatroofed the walls being coated with mud so that its aspect outside was not imposing but inside we found substantial comfort if not luxury refinement and hospitality this is not an infrequent combination in the outlying districts of the cape where the nature of life and things is such that wealth education and refinement are often found robed in a modest homespun garb and housed in a mere hut  among other objects of interest inside we found ostrichesvery little onesin divers stages of progression  there was one the size of an ordinary fowl which had been in existenceafter egg life i meana few days and swaggered about the premises like an impudent child  there was another babyweak in the understanding physically as well as mentallywhich staggered about in a drunken manner with an insane tendency to use its tail as a support  this creature was kept in existence by having its food forcibly crammed down its throat the amount given each meal being gauged not by appetite but by the tension of its stomach  last and least there was one which had succeeded in bursting out one end of its native egg that morning  its already tremendous toes protruded and were engaged in further efforts to get out when we arrived  while we were at dinner that day the creature effected its liberation and entered on the staggering and stuffing phase of its career  all these birds and many others had been nursed into life through a hotair and warm blanket incubator by the amiable lady of the house and were destined to spend the early part of their lives under the care of some hottentot stepmother    letter six  over the plainslion and tiger reminiscencesfrontier forces and escaped convictsmonkeys and prickly pearsa veteran settlers experiences of kafir warfarestory of the dutch farmers rising in 1815  it was a sad day that on which i left the karroo and bade farewell to ebenezer  i had gone there in absolute ignorance of men and things and had found a hearty welcome in the abode of a warmhearted christian family and a romantic region full to me of new ideas experiences circumstances and sensations  hobson drove me in his cart  our destination was the mountain region of baviaans or baboons river  the first part of our route lay across the karroo and over the mountain range which separated us from the town of somerset east  as we sped along drawn by two powerful horses over the oceanlike plains we were silent at first but gradually the cheering influence of rapid motion and fine weather began to tell  our spirits rose and hobson related numerous anecdotes historical and adventurous from the rich stores of a good memory  about noon we outspanned beside a stream and allowed the horses to have a roll  under the shade of a bush we lay and chatted while our eyes roamed over the rolling plains to the blue mountain range which formed its northern boundary  there said my friend pointing towards the mountains is the spot where one of the last lions was seen in this part of the country  there were plenty of them here once and the last one disappeared in 1840 only thirtysix years ago  he then related the incident connected with the lion referred to  the following is the substance of it  early in the year 1840 a runaway soldier was travelling through that part of the country  he was on his way to graaffreinet in search of work  at that time farmhouses were very few and far between in that region  the wearied soldier came one evening to the house of a boer named smit not many miles from the spot where hobson and i were reposing  smit was a surly fellow and refused shelter to the traveller who was therefore obliged to continue his journey during the night  next day the unfortunate mans mangled body was found not far off a few yards from the foot of a small tree  the traces revealed clearly that he had been killed by a lion whose footprints had been seen and voice heard for some time in the neighbourhood  on the approach of the lion the man had sought refuge in the small tree just mentioned but being little better than a large bush it failed him in the hour of need  even when perched on the highest branch that would bear him he was not beyond the spring of the lion  it had caught him torn him down and devoured his breast and arms after which it left him  this was the last lion in that region that succeeded in taking human life  six months later the last lion of all made his appearance  he was evidently a less ferocious animal and made his final exit in a rather humorous manner  in his prowling about he chanced to find an old dutchman and pounced upon him but the old man had his wits about him at first sight of his enemy he let himself go limp as if dead  lions are particular  they dont like dead meals they prefer to kill their own dinners  after pouncing on his prey the lion put his mouth to the old fellows ear and roared  if he was not deaf for life after that he ought to have been  at all events he was deaf at the time to the remark for he paid no attention to it whatever  then the lion pawed him a little lay down on him rolled him about as a cat plays with a mouse and ultimately couched a few yards off to watch jealously for the slightest sign of life  but the dutchman was a splendid actor  even in breathing he managed to remain motionless and at last the lion sneaked away overwhelmed with disappointment  then the old man slowly lifted his head rose congratulated himself and returned home in a thankful state of mind  although lions had finally taken themselves off and retired to safer and more distant retreats the mountain glens of the neighbourhood were as i have already said still inhabited by leopards of large size and dangerous temper  they are powerful and savage fellows said my friend as he rose to inspan and few men like to face them unless assisted by a party and with good dogs  one friend of mine a doctor used to boast that he could stare a leopard out of countenance  at last one was caught in a trap and the doctor tried the experiment but only got knocked over and his nose scratched for his pains  there was a curious instance once of a fingo going mad in consequence of being bitten by a leopard  the madness took the form of his feigning to be a leopard and there was no doubt as to his insanity for he continually growled and scratched and snapped with his teeth and finished off by jumping through a glass doornow then the carts ready in you go  i jumped in and off we went again over the sweetscented plainnow on a good bit of road now on a bad often forsaking the track altogether and occasionally plunging into holes that knocked our heads against the hood and tried our springs to the uttermost till evening at last found us among the hills where a roughandready inn afforded us shelter for the night  passing through somerset we came to a place named cookhouse drift where there is a bridge over the great fish river  we also met here with seven troopers of the frontier armed and mounted police as tight and serviceable a set of young fellows as one could wish to seeclad in corduroy thoroughgoing roughandready colonial cavalryand welltrained to bush fighting  they were out after seven escaped convicts and had caught one a big kafir who was handcuffed and seemed sulky when i looked at him  at another place where the prickly pear was very prolific and the bush so dense that it formed a pretty safe retreat to escaped convicts as well as baboons and tigers we discovered a band of kafirs celebrating a wedding  the prickly pears which were ripe at this time we found to be very pleasant and refreshing but we had to handle them with care as they were covered with prickles so fine that they pierced the skin and broke off the pear with the least touch  the great evil of prickly pear thorns is that it is almost impossible to extract them and although it can scarcely be said that they cause pain the irritation they produce is great and prolonged  the monkeys know this well  i was greatly amused once while delayed at a roadside inn by the antics of a monkey with a prickly pear  i had fed him with part of one of which he seemed passionately fond  wishing to know whether monkeys as well as men were cautious in handling the fruit i pulled another by means of a couple of sticks  the usual mode of proceeding is to rub the pear on the ground with a bunch of grass and thus remove the prickles when it may be handled with impunity  without doing this however i lifted the pear with my sticks and handed it to jacko  he looked at it earnestly for a few seconds then at me with a round mouth and reproachful eyes as though to say you dont mean that do you  i smiled and nodded  jacko looked again at the pear and put one finger towards it with great caution but drew back and looked up at me again as if to say wont you help me  i smiled again and shook my head whereupon he went to work with the most gingerly and delicate touches as if he were handling redhot iron at last he managed to tear a hole in the skin into which he inserted his black nose and greedily devoured the contents  despite his caution however i noticed that jacko kept scratching his hands pretty steadily for some time afterwards  as we advanced into the hills the roads became unimaginably bad  in one place our track had been carried away by a flood and the bouldercovered bed of the torrent was our only road  at last we got up into the mountain region of glen lynden the place to which the scotch settlers were sent by government in 1820 under the care of thomas pringle the african poet who among other pieces wrote the beautiful poem which begins    afar in the desert i love to ride   with the silent bushboy alone by my side  the descendants of the 1820 men now occupy these valleys  both in physique and character they do credit to their sires  here i met one of the few survivors of the original settlers mr dodds pringle and brother to the poet  this happened about 1876 although upwards of seventy and a large stout man i saw him mount his horse with the activity of a man of thirty  at his house in glen lynedock where i spent a night they showed me an assagai or kafir spear which had been bent into the form of a halfmoon against his mr pringles stomach  it happened thus  he was out fighting with the rest of the farmers in the war of 1851 and one day was attacked by kafirs one of whom flung his assagai at him with tremendous force  mr pringle had just fired his rifle and was reloading when the assagai struck him  it was arrested however in its deadly flight by his belt and bulletpouch  the savage rushed forward intending to finish his adversary by a thrust from a short spear but old pringle guarded the thrust with one hand while with the other he drew a pistol and shot the kafir through the heart  at that moment another savage ran at him but a comrade of pringle suddenly came on the scene and the savage turned to fly  the comrade took aim at him  be cool and take him low said pringle undoing his belt to examine his wound  the comrade fired and the savage fell  are you killed asked the comrade turning to pringle and glancing at the bent assagai  i dont know replied the other with a serious look as he thrust his hand under his waistbelt theres no hole that i can find anyhow  the hand when withdrawn was covered with blood but it was found on examination that the wound was slight thanks to the providential interposition of the thick bulletpouch  the old gentleman is now naturally fond of showing the weapon which had so nearly proved fatal  advancing into the baviaans river district we passed through many places of historic interest and scenery that must have reminded the scottish settlers of the rugged glens to which they had bidden farewell for ever  among other places hobson pointed out a small cavern high up on the cliffs which was the scene of a cruel affray not many years before the arrival of the scotch settlers in the district  as it illustrates the wild frontier life of those times and bears on the subject of the grievances of early colonists i shall relate it  there was a dutch boer a farmer named bezuidenhout who in the year 1815 dwelt in the lonely and wild recesses of the baviaans river district  he seems to have been a passionate headstrong man  the dutch boers were generally honest sterling men though at that time very ignorant being far removed from the means of instruction  but the dutchmen not less than others had wild and foolish men amongst them who were easily misled by unprincipled adventurers  bezuidenhout seems to have been one of these at all events he was savage enough to treat one of his hottentot servants so ill that he was cited to appear before the court of his district and was foolish enough to resist the summons  a messenger was therefore sent to arrest him and as he was known to be a daring character and had threatened to shoot any limb of the law who should dare to approach his residence twenty men of the cape corps under lieutenant rousseau accompanied the messenger  on reaching the mountain home of bezuidenhout they found him prepared he and a powerful halfcaste in his employment were found sheltered behind the high wall of a cattle enclosure well armed  the dutchman called to the soldiers to stop else he would shoot the first man disregarding the threat the lieutenant extended his men in skirmishing order and attacked  bezuidenhout fired happily missed and retreated into his house whence he passed by a backdoor into the thick jungle in rear  they lost him for a time but finally traced him to a steep krantz or precipice up the almost inaccessible face of which he and his follower had taken refuge in a small cavern  the muzzles of their rifles were seen protruding from the entrance  lieutenant rousseau therefore crept up warily until he reached a ledge above the aperture from which point he challenged the farmer to surrender telling him the reason of his being there and assuring him of personal safety  the man replied he would die rather than submit  the lieutenant endeavoured to persuade him to surrender but he was obdurate  night was approaching  the officer was anxious to get his men out of these dark kloofs in daylight  he therefore ordered them to ascend in two bodies  they did so reached the cave and rushed to the entrance from which bezuidenhout fired but without effect the muzzle of his rifle having been thrown up  at the same moment one of the soldiers fired into the cavern and shot the farmer dead on the spot  the servant surrendered and on entering the place it was found that a large quantity of ammunition had been collected there evidently with a view to standing a siege  after the departure of the military the relations and friends of the unfortunate and misguided man assembled to bury him and over his grave they vowed to avenge his death  a brother of bezuidenhout spoke to them and so wrought on their feelings that a great number of the farmers of that and the neighbouring districts ultimately assembled under arms with the avowed intention of ridding themselves altogether of british interference  they went still further and took a step which might have been much more serious  they sent cornelius faber a brotherinlaw of the bezuidenhouts to the kafir chief gaika for the purpose of rousing that savage and his hordes to attack the colony  of course the government was obliged to frustrate such an attempt with all possible speed  troops were immediately sent against the rebels under colonel cuyler  one of the rebel leaders named prinsloo was captured at a critical moment and the main body amounting to between three and four hundred was finally met with  but before proceeding to extremities a fieldcommandant william nel volunteered to go alone among the rebels and reason with them  he did so and was so far successful as to shake the resolution of some for although disaffected many of these men were by no means so foolish as their leaders  indeed many of them had been threatened and coerced into rebellion  seeing the effect of nels remonstrances faber bezuidenhout and other leaders assembled their forces at a place called slachters nek and exacted from them an oath to remain faithful to each other until they had expelled the tyrants from the frontier  next morning colonel cuyler proceeded to attack them  on his approach thirty or more of them threw down their arms in token of surrender the remainder seeing that resistance would be hopeless retired into the fastnesses of baviaans river  there they were followed and surrounded and an attempt was made to bring them to submission but during the night most of them managed to escape by familiar mountain passes  the principal leaders rejecting all terms escaped with their wagons families and goods to the winterberg mountains bordering on kafirland where they hoped to be safe but being followed up hotly by a body of troops under major fraser they were eventually overtaken and surrounded in a deep kloof  here six of them were brought to bay among whom were faber with his wife his sona lad of fourteen yearsand john bezuidenhout  these retiring behind the wagons a skirmish began which was not concluded until one of the soldiers was killed another wounded bezuidenhout shot and faber and his wife and son severely wounded  then the party were taken prisoners  subsequently fifty or sixty of the other rebels were captured and taken to capetown  of these thirtynine of the most culpable were tried on the charge of high treason  six were condemned to death the others after being compelled to witness the execution of their leaders were to undergo various degrees of punishment according to their proved guilt one of the six had the capital sentence commuted to transportation for life and the remaining five ringleaders were executed    letter seven  lionhunting etcetera in the early daysbushmen and their troubles  it is deeply interesting to tread in the footsteps of bold adventurous men and visit the scenes which have been rendered classic by their deeds of heroic daring or of patient endurance  so i found it during my brief sojourn in the regions of baviaans river where upwards of fifty years before my countrymen had faced fought and subdued the savage the wilderness and the wildbeast  the everyday life of the early settlers of this region cannot be better illustrated than by a brief quotation from the diary of one of them    october 1starrival of

newspapers that has reached us  how all the robinsoncrusoe blood in ones veins is stirred by such a diary  truly i sometimes almost regret that i was not born to become a pioneer settler in the african wilds  however it is some comfort to have the privilege of paying a flying visit to these same wilds which in many respects are quite as wild now as they were then  the lions elephants quaggas and some others of the large game it is true have taken themselves off to remoter wilds but the leopards hyenas baboons antelopes still inhabit these kloofs while snakes scorpions and the like are as plentiful as ever  talking of baboons reminds me that these creatures are said to sleep sometimes on a ledge of rock on the face of a precipice for security against lurking foes  i was assured that sometimes a row of them may be seen in such a situation sitting sound asleep with their faces in their hands against the precipice and their tails hanging over the ledge of course i do not vouch for the truth of such reports  i am answerable only for what i profess to have seen  the highest type of monkey suggests the lowest type of man in africa this is the bushman or as the dutch have it bosjesman  he is a branch of the hottentot race and a very miserable stunted branch nevertheless he is very far indeed removed from the baboon  he has no tail for certain at least if he has he conceals it effectually  he wears garments which no monkey does and he speaks which no monkey ever did  no thanks to the white man however if the poor bushman is not a baboon with the spirit of a tiger for he has been most shamefully treated in time past  it is true the bushmen were arrant thieves and committed great havoc among the frontier farmers at various times and it was both natural and right that these farmers should defend their homes and property  but it was neither right nor natural that these unfortunate natives should have been so cruelly dealt with  when the scotch party settled at glen lynden their troubles with wildbeast pilferers were augmented occasionally by the appearance of bosjesmanthieves  in the beginning of october writes mr pringle we were somewhat alarmed by the discovery of a band of predatory bushmen lurking among the rocks and caverns of the wild mountains between us and the valley of the tarka  lieutenant pettingal an officer of engineers who was then in our valley engaged in the government survey of the country discovered this horde in searching for some of his horses that were missing  suspecting from the traces that they had been carried off by bushmen he went out with an armed troop in pursuit and came upon a party of these wild marauders in one of the most savage recesses of the neighbouring mountains  they were at breakfast on a grey horse which they had slaughtered and had steaks roasting on the fire cut out of the flank with the hide still upon them  pettingal enraged by the supposed loss of his best bloodhorse poured in a volley upon them but apparently without effect for they all scrambled off with inconceivable agility among the rocks and bushes  he recovered however some of his own horses and eight belonging to our neighbour which were tied up under an overhanging cliff near the top of a mountain  there were no bushmen running wild among the beautiful hills and valleys of glen lynden when hobson and i entered it but the region was not free as i have related from naked kafirs and it is still noted for its population of hairy baboons    letter eight  rain  rain  rainbaboons riverseahorse kloofwe hunt the hills on horseback in spite of rainfloods and accidentspart from hobson mailcarts and diamonddiggers  rain is a blessed refreshment to the thirsty land it is a lifegiving cordial to the thirsty soul but when rain descends in torrents and without cessation during the greater part of ones brief holiday or at any other very unseasonable period and when one is not thirsty it becomes depressing to say the least  thus was i treated by rain during my week in baviaans river  hobson and i had at last pushed up into the very heart of that wild mountain regionthe allotted home of the scottish settlers of 1820 the scene of many kafir raids and battles  for months before we had lived in perpetual sunshine  hobson had sighed for a drop of rain  sometimes south africans have to sigh for a twelvemonth before relief is sent  even while i write the colony is suffering excessively from drought and many farmers have been ruined on the karroo i had almost come to forget the sensation of being rained upon and an umbrella there would have appeared as great an impropriety as a muslin overcoat in nova zembla  nevertheless no sooner did we arrive at seahorse kloof than the windows of heaven were opened and the rain came down steadily night and day while the sky presented a universal grey that would have done credit to the scottish highlands it was too bad  my main object in penetrating to these rugged wilds was to visit one of the pringles a relative of personal friends on the borders of my own land  finding that mr pringle was absent from home we turned aside to visit a cousin of hobsons a mr john edwards who dwelt in what appeared to me the fagend of the worlda lonely farmhouse at the head of the mountain gorge named seahorse kloof  its a splendid country said hobson with lots of game and edwards is a noted hunter besides being a capital fellow  what more could man desire  we arrived full of hope and spirits received a hearty welcome and awoke next day to find the sky grey as i have said and the rain descending steadily  of course we hoped against hope but as day after day came and went our hopes and spirits sank  then there came a reaction that is not uncommon in the circumstanceswe grew desperate and began to enjoy our misery we got out our rifles took up a sheltered position in the shed of an outhouse and blazed away from dripping morn to pouring eve at empty bottles amongst which we did tremendous execution  of course also we relieved the tedium of enforced indoor life by song and talk but these resources could not make up for lost time and the depth to which i had been sunk was revealed to me by the sudden rebound of joy when after a week of heavy wet there was a break in the universal grey and the sun came feebly out  blessed sun if thou wert to roast me alive methinks i would love thee still  before this happened however we had a few brief intervals of modified dripping  during one of these in which the rain all but ceased for a forenoon i resolved to go out into one of the mountain gorges for a ramble alone  my host lent me his double barrelone barrel being for shot the other rifled  it is loaded said he the right with shot the left with ball  very good said i expect a tiger when i return  my host smiled  leopards were there truly but as he knew and as i have elsewhere mentioned they never show themselves except when driven out of their retreats by dogs  to say truth i only wanted a walk expected to kill a rabbit or a crow and hoped faintly for a buck  none of these things did i see but i found a small coney at which i fired the shot barrel  to my surprise there came no report from the gun merely a feeble spirt  i afterwards learned that one of the boys had loaded it the day before with a miniature charge for small birds hope increased as i pushed further up into the kloof and fancy began to play  although there was no chance of seeing tigers it was something to know that such creatures were really there that i was actually in the native home of wildbeasts  the floor of my hosts parlour was covered with the beautiful spotted skins of animals which had been shot or trapped by himself  one of these measured about nine feet which allowing three for the tail gives a body of six feet long  as the day advanced rain again began to fall but nothing could damp me now  i had almost worked myself into the belief that i was tigerhunting  i advanced with cautious tread looked earnestly into dark caverns and passed under the deep shadow of thick and tangled bushes with feelings of awe  i even indulged my wayward fancy by thinking of gordon cumming and livingstone did my best to mistake gnarled roots for big snakes and red stones for couching leopards  at last while in the sombre twilight of a dense mass of underwood i actually did see a bit of brown hair moving  i threw forward my rifle with a promptitude worthy of hawkeye himself but experienced no shock of excitement for the object was so palpably a small rabbit or coney that imagination sternly refused to deceive me  baboons had been heard barking on the evening of our arrival  i looked out for these but saw none  in short none of the inhabitants of wood glen or mountain save myself were foolish enough to go out in such weather nevertheless i returned to the house happy and ready for supper  on saturday morning the sunshine which i have before mentioned gladdened our eyes and hearts  the weather seemed at last favourable edwards at once ordered out horses and rifles and away we wentfour of usup the mountains after game  it was a new experience in regard to riding  horses i knew were capable of travelling over exceedingly rough roads and trained ones could even ascend staircases but i now learned that horses can climb precipices  never saw anything like it before never even imagined it  our prospects were fair but they were false for ere long the rain began again  however we were reckless by that time and defied it riding up the kloof that i had traversed on foot we sighted bucks but got no shot  gaining the top of the kloof we saw more bucksout of range  we passed over the shoulder of the mountain into another glen and skirted the top of a precipice  while descending some slopes at an angle of i know not what the use of our cruppers became strikingly apparent  i began for the first time in my life to feel anxiety as to the strength of a horses tail  in going up such places the saddle girths were severely tried but the mane kept one from slipping down ones perpendicular animal  coming to a comparatively level stretch we sank into a silently reflective and forgetful mood while the raindrops dribbled down our noses sopped from our mackintoshes to our saddles whence they reascended through the capillary influence of garments to our necks and soon equalised our humidity  look out shouted edwards suddenly  we all obeyed and saw a brown buck labouring up a slope so steep that running was out of the question i stuck my heels into my steed and faced him at the slope  he took it he would have taken the side of a house i think if told to  but he gasped with the frantic nature of his efforts  i felt as if he were leaping up the slope kangaroo fashion on his hindlegs  on reaching the top the antelope was observed disappearing in the distance  it was of no use weeping  rain would have washed the tears away  look out again shouted our host get off  we all obeyed cocked our guns and gazed  a herd of antelopes just visible in the mist  we all fired and missed  very mysterious muttered one of our numberi forget which  we loaded hastily but not quickly  our guns were muzzleloaders and rain does not facilitate loading  in trying to force a bullet down my ramrod slipped and i cut my knuckles severely  youve drawn first blood anyhow savagely muttered one of usi forget who  we mounted again and let me tell you that mounting on a steep hillside in a long wet mackintosh with a big rifle bleeding knuckles and a heavy heart is difficult as well as disagreeable  to increase our enjoyment edwards again shouted get off  we did so with more than military obedience and i saw a buck standing not more than a hundred yards in front of me  i gave him the rifled barrel  he hopped  then the shot barrel  he winced and fled but presently stopped and lay down  edwards ran towards him kneeled fired and broke his leg  between us all we managed to kill him and then turned homewards  the only noteworthy incident that occurred on the way back was the starting of a troop of baboons which went scampering down the cliffs in consternation like balls of brown hair  we also descended some broken ground so steep that it was almost impossible to keep the saddle looking at edwards i observed that the ears of his horse appeared between his feet while its tail waved over his head like a dragoons plume  at last we were compelled to dismount and lead our animals our minds being sometimes divided between the danger of missing our footing in front and being tumbled on by our steeds behind  thus we hunted on the baviaans river mountains in adverse circumstances and returned home moderately pleased though not particularly successful  the rains had by that time flooded the whole country and rendered travelling almost impossible  the river was running wildly past the house and there was no bridge over it  we held a consultation on monday as to our departure  the weather was fine at last but the river flooded  the tortuous nature of its bed necessitated five or six crossings in the course of twelve miles  were they fordable was the question  we shall go and try was hobsons final decision  try is the watchword of all true pioneers  we saddled and set forth  hobson drove the cart with my portmanteau during the first part of the journey i was to accompany edwards on horseback  we had a hottentot servant with us who rode one horse and led another  it was a most enjoyable ride in the bright sunshine that day everything was fresh green and glittering after the longcontinued rain  baboons were seen on the way and shouted at us whether in defiance derision or encouragement is best known to themselves  all the drifts or fords were passed in safety till we came to the last on baviaans river  here the powerful stream rose to our saddles and the opposite bank had been so much washed away that it seemed impossible to get the cart up  ill cross said edwards and if necessary well cut a slope in the bank  in he went floundered through and managed to ascend the opposite bank though not without a severe struggle for besides being high and steep it was very wetcoated in fact with soft mud  the tottie with the led horse followed his master  i followed the tottieclose in his steps so as to get the benefit of his experience either by imitating or avoiding his example  we gained the opposite side  i saw the hottentots horse rise before me as if mounting a staircase  he slipped and floundered on his nose and knees  the led horse disconcerted him  just then my own horse made a bound up the bank and pawed the mud for a moment  slack the reins give him his head shouted edwards  i did so  with a mighty plunge and a groan the sturdy animal bore me to the top of the bank in safety  i turned and saw the totties horse throw up its head and fore legs as if imploringly to the skies and fall backwards  the tottie himself appeared for a moment in the form of a spreadeagle and then horse and man went back with a sounding splash into the river  hobson who had been all the time enjoying the spectacle now crossed with the cart but on taking the bank despite their utmost efforts the powerful pair stuck fast on their knees and noses  meanwhile the hottentot scrambled out with his animals none the worse for the plunge  as the horses could not move the cart an inch in their semiperpendicular position we unharnessed them and the four of us by slow degrees working one wheel at a time zigzagged the cart upward a few feet when horses were once more attached and the crossing was finally accomplished  that evening we came to smiths farm one of the places where the diamondfield coaches stop to change horses  it was beyond the mountains at the commencement of the great rolling plains  here i had arranged to await the arrival of the mailcart and proceed via bedford to grahamstown  and here with deep regret i bade farewell to my friend hobsona truehearted welleducated englishman born in the colony the son of one of the 1820 settlers a brave bold fearless loving man who hunted lions leopards elephants zebras and all the large game of africa in his youth and was out in the wara warm friend a splendid type of those hardy men whose lot it is to subdue the wilderness  there were several hours to pass before the arrival of the mailcart smith and his people were busy and as there were no guests at the time in that lonely roadside inn i had plenty of leisure to bask in the sunshine sketch the cactus bushes that abounded there see note 1 gaze dreamily over the boundless karroo and meditate sadly on friendships and partings  the first thing that struck me on turning from smiths humble abode to ramble on the plains was the presence of a bad smella very bad smell i brought my nose to bear in various directions but could discover no cause  having nothing to do i applied myself with diligence to the investigation all the more earnestly that i found it impossible to get out of the tainted atmosphere  regarding the heavens steadily for it was very calm and making up my mind as to the direction which the little wind that there was came from i followed my nose and was led by it to the decaying carcass of an ox which lay not a hundred yards from smiths door  my opinion of smith was lowered  when i passed to windward of the carcass the bad smell ceased  i mention this not because it is an interesting incident but because it is a feature of south african travel  wherever you go on the karroo there you will find the rotting remains of poor creatures which having died in harness are cast loose for the benefit of the vultures these illlooking and disgusting birds are most useful scavengers  they scent the quarry from afarso far indeed as to be beyond the vision of human eyes  you may gaze round you far and near in the plains and behold no sign of any bird but kill one of your horses and leave it dead on the plain and straightway from various quarters of the heavens you will see little specks which grow and float and circle and grow until they assume the ugly form and huge proportions of unclean vultures which will perch on the carcass and make away with it in a remarkably short space of time  it was only the skin and bones of the ox which rendered themselves obnoxious at smiths  vultures had cleared out of it every morsel of flesh some days before  as i have said there are no roads worthy of the name in many parts of the karroo  those that exist are often in such a dilapidated condition that travellers sometimes find it more pleasant to forsake them and drive over the rugged veldt  this can be easily understood when it is remembered that the roads are traversed by the celebrated cape wagons which are of enormous size and weight requiring from sixteen to twenty oxen to draw them  such vehicles finding a hollow in a road soon make it a deep hole which finally becomes an impassable cavern  in drawing struggling and fighting with these wagons sick and weakly animals constantly succumb are left to die and thus vultures are supplied with a continual feast while carcasses and skulls and bleaching bones are familiar objects by the roadsides on the plains  at last the mailcart arrived and i secured a place  it is usually a small twowheeled vehicle drawn by four horses the driver of which seems to think that every one ought to possess an iron frame as callous as his own  the cart has a species of canvas hood such as i have described in a former letter stretched on a movable frame  it serves the purpose of a monstrous parasol  you get into this cart the team is cleverly started by it may be a smart fellow and driven away with the speed at which mails ought to travel or it is wildly started by a conceited driver who sets out with a plunge and continues his course with a prolonged crash as though the fate of empires reposed in his mailbags  you come to a ditch you go in with a plunge and come out with a jerk  your head hits the back of the hood when you go in your nose hits the back of the driver when you come out a rut in the road causes one wheel to descend suddenly about eighteen inches or an unavoidable lump of that height produces the same effect the hood gives you a deliberate punch on the head  before you have quite recovered it gives you another  a miniature precipice appears this was caused by the latest waterspout choosing to cut the road instead of follow it  the mailcart does not pause  its springs were made apparently to spring  it descends  for one instant you are left in the air the next you resume your seatwith violence  this sort of thing does not last long however for you quickly become wise  you acquire the habit of voluntarily stiffening your backbone at the ditches of yielding to the ruts and of holding on at the precipices still with all your precautions you suffer severely  i have been seriously informed that during some of their plunges on what may be called stormy roads men have been jolted bodily out of mailcarts at the cape and i can easily believe it  the diamondfield mail was full but they kindly made room for me and plastered my portmanteau like an excrescence on the other baggage  the drive to bedford was too short to admit of much familiar intercourse with the diggersif diggers they were  subsequently i met with a successful digger who told me a good deal about the diamondfields  he was a scot who had left a lucrative claim to be managed by a partner while he took a trip to the old country  his account of diamond digging inclined me to think that coalheaving is a much easier occupation and more remunerative on the whole except in the case of lucky diggers  this scot showed me what he called a big diamond and allowed me to make a careful drawing of it  he could not guess at its value  if it had been a pure diamond like the star of south africa it would have been worth many thousands of pounds but it was not pure according to digger parlance it was offcolour and therefore not excessively valuable  still it was a precious gem and would doubtless fetch several hundreds of pounds  of course it was unpolished but even in that state was very beautiful  it weighed seventyeight carats  the star of south africa above referred to was a pure and magnificent gem  it was found by a hottentot named swartzboy sold by him for 400 pounds and disposed of the same day for 12000 poundsso at least runs one account of the matter  late in the evening we reached bedford  as we started next morning at break of day my personal knowledge of that flourishing town is too limited to warrant many remarks thereon  it may be that the vision of ghostly houses passing our cart in the morning mists suggested to my sleepy imagination the idea of a town but i cannot remember that it did  possibly the fact that the population numbered above 1000 may have occurred to my mind but i think not  it is more probable that the mind if it operated at all pictured the population as recumbent and snoring  indeed the only thing that memory will recall when severely taxed in regard to bedford isbed its first syllable    note 1  the author was an artist as well as a writer of merit and exhibited watercolour drawings at the royal scottish academy    letter nine  crossing the great fish rivertravelling at the cape as it is to be grahamstown her early struggles and present prosperity  travelling in south africa is occasionally interrupted by sudden storms of rain which convert dry beds of streams into roaring torrents and perennial rivers into devastating floods  at the great fish river i came on a specimen of the mighty power of water in the ruins of a splendid bridge  the great floods of the previous year had carried onehalf of it away  the other halfdenuded of its flooring and all its woodwork and standing out against the sky a mere skeleton of iron girdersstill connected the left bank of the river with the massive tower of masonry in the middle  from this tower to the other bank was a gulf impassable to horse or cart  the great river itself flows in a deep channel  it was still somewhat flooded from its high banks we saw it roaring more than forty feet beneath the level of the bridge  it was clear to the most ignorant eye that fording the stream was impossible  i looked inquiringly at the driver  youll have to go over on the rope he said with a sardonic smile  the rope said i with an earnest gaze at the impassable gulf  yes the rope  theres a man crossing now  i looked again and observed something like a cobweb on the sky between the central pier and the opposite bank  there was a black spot that resembled a spider moving slowly along the cobweb  it was a fellowman  and the mails and the luggage  i asked  go over same way  the cart and horses  dont go over at all  get fresh ones on other side  there was once a box on the river for hauling them over but its been damaged  the process of crossing was begun at once  the driver and some workmen shouldered the bags and baggage while the passengersof whom there were threefollowed to the central pier  to men with heads liable to giddiness the passage from the bank to the pier would have been trying for the floor having been carried away we had to walk on the open girders looking down past our feet to the torrent as to a miniature niagara  the distance of forty feet seemed changed to four hundred from that position  fortunately none of us were afflicted with giddy heads  the flat space on the towertop gained we found two workmen engaged in tying our baggage to a little platform about four feet square which was suspended by ropes to a couple of little wheels  these wheels travelled on a thick cablethe spider web before referred to  the contrivance was hauled to and fro by a smaller line after the manner of our rocket apparatus for rescuing life at sea and when we passengers afterwards sat down on it with nothing but the tight grip of our hands on an iron bar to save us from falling into the flood below we flattered ourselves that we had attained to something resembling the experience of those who have been saved from shipwreck  many people hold the erroneous doctrine that travellers and traffic create railways whereas all experience goes to prove that railways create travellers and traffic  of course at their first beginnings railways were formed by the few hundreds of travellers who were chiefly traffickers but no sooner were they called into being than they became creativethey turned thousands of stayathomes into travellers they rushed between the great centres of industry sweeping up the people in their train and with a grand contempt of littleness in every form caught up the slowgoing cars and coaches of former days in their huge embrace and whirled them along in company with any number you chose of tons and bales of merchandise they groaned up the acclivities of highland hills and snorted into sequestered glens alluring nay compelling the lonely dwellers to come out and causing hosts of men with rod and gun and hammer and botanical box to go in they scouted the old highroads and went like mighty men of valour straight to the accomplishment of their ends leaping over and diving under each other across everything through anything and sticking at nothing until over lands where fifty years ago only carts and coaches used to creep and poor pedestrians were wont to plod cataracts of travellers now flow almost without intermission night and daythe prince rolling in his royal bedroom from palace to palace the huntsman flying to the field with his groom and horse in a box behind him the artisan travelling in comfort to his daily toil with his tools and a mysterious tin of victuals at his feet thousands on thousands of busy beings hurrying through the land where one or two crawled before shoals of foreigners coming in to get rid of prejudices and add wrinkles to their horns while everything is cheapened and best of all knowledge is increased by this healthythough it may be rather rapidmoving about of men and women  thus railways have created travellers and traffic  but they have done much more they have turned roadside inns into grand hotels they have clambered up on the worlds heights and built palatial abodes on the home of the mountainhare and the eagle where weak and worn invalids may mount without exertion and drink in health and happiness with the freshest air of heaven  the principle cannot be disputed that the creation of railways between great centres of industry has a direct tendency to stimulate that industry and to create other subsidiary industries with their travellers on business and travellers for pleasure  if railways ran over the karroo adventurous capitalists would come from all ends of the earth to see it they would buy land when they found a convenient mode of running their produce to the markets of the large towns and the ports on the coast they would start ostrich farms and breed horses and grow wool and build mighty dams and sink artesian wells as the french have done with some success i believe in algiers  if railways were run up to the diamondfields adventurous diggers would crowd in hundreds to the great pit of kimberley some would succeed those who failed would gravitate into the positions for which they were fitted by nature in a land where the want of labourers is a confessedly perplexing evil  the population would not only be increased by much new blood from without but by that which results from prosperity and wealth within off shoot and as yet unimagined enterprises would probably become numerous additional lines would be pushed on into the gold regions all sorts of precious gems and minerals including black diamonds are known to be abundant in the transvaal andbut why go on  those who agree with me understand these matters so well as to require no urging  as for those who dont agree    the man convinced against his will   is of the same opinion still  what i have written is for the benefit of those who know little or nothing about south africa  i will only add to it my own conviction see note 1 that the day is not far distant when a cape man will breakfast one morning in capetown and dine next day at port elizabeth 510 miles run on to grahamstown 84 miles to sup with a friend there take the early train to graaffreinet 160 miles so as to have time for luncheon and a chat with a friend or relation before the starting of the night train for kimberley 280 miles where he has to assist at the marriage of a sister with a diamonddigger who intends to spend his honeymoon at the cliff hotel amid the romantic scenery of the catberg and finish off with a week or two at snowy retreat a magnificent hotel yet to be on the tiptop of the compassberg mountain  this brings me back to the point at which i divergedthe great fish river which takes its rise in the sneewberg range  what tremendous floods are implied in the carrying away of this bridge what superabundance of water in that socalled land of drought  what opportunities for engineering skill to catch and conserve the water and turn the barren land into fruitful fields  dont you see this periwinkle  if not i will say no more for according to the proverb a nod is as good as a wink to the blind horse  having crossed the bridge in safety we continued our journey in the new vehicle with fresh horses and reached grahamstown at four in the afternoon  between sixty and seventy years is not a great age for a city  indeed as cities go grahamstown may be called quite infantile  nevertheless this youthful city has seen much rough work in its brief career  grahamstown was born in smoke and cradled in wars alarms  it began life in 1812 at which time the thieving and incorrigible kafirs were driven across the great fish riverthen the colonial boundaryby a strong force of british and burgher troops under colonel graham  during these disturbed times it was established as headquarters of the troops which guarded the frontier  when the infant was seven years old its courage and capacity were severely put to the proof  in the year 181819just before the arrival of the british settlersit was deemed necessary to interfere in the concerns of contending kafir chiefs and to punish certain tribes for their continued depredations on the colony  for these ends as well as the recovery of stolen cattle a strong force was sent into kafirland while the troops were absent a body of kafirs assembled in the bush of the great fish river from which they issued to attack grahamstown they were led by a remarkable man named makana  he was also styled the lynx  this kafir although not a chief rose to power by the force of a superior intellect and a strong will  he was wellknown in grahamstown having been in the habit of paying it frequent visits on which occasions he evinced great curiosity on all subjects speculative as well as practical  makana appears to have been an apt scholar  being a man of eloquence as well as originality he soon acquired ascendency over most of the great chiefs of kafirland was almost worshipped by the people who acknowledged him a warriorchief as well as a prophet and collected around him a large body of retainers  it has been thought by some that makana was a noble savage and that although he imposed on the credulity of his countrymen his aim was to raise himself to sovereign power in order to elevate the kafir race nearer to a level with europeans  but whatever be the truth regarding his objects the invasion of kafirland by the white men gave makana an opportunity of which he was not slow to avail himself  his followers had suffered with others from the proceedings of the troops and his soul was fired with a desire to be revenged and drive the white men into the seaa favourite fate in the kafir mind reserved for the entire colonial family  makana was general enough to perceive that nothing effective could be accomplished by the mere marauding habits to which his countrymen were addicted  he had learned that union is strength and making use of his spiritrousing power of eloquence went about endeavouring to concentrate the aims of the savages and to direct their energies  in these efforts he was in some measure successful  he pretended to have received heavenly revelations and to have been sent by the great spirit to avenge their wrongs predicted certain success to the enterprise if his followers only yielded implicit obedience to his commands and thus managed to persuade most of the various clans to unite their forces for a simultaneous attack on the headquarters of the british troops  he told them that he had power to call from their graves the spirits of their ancestors to assist them in the war and confidently affirmed that it was decreed that they were to drive the white men across the zwartkops river into the ocean after which they should sit down and eat honey  early on the morning of the 22nd april 1819 this singular man led his force of 9000 sable warriors towards grahamstown and the affair had been conducted with so great secrecy that the few troops there were almost taken by surprise  enemies in the camp are always to be more dreaded than open foes makana had taken care to provide himself with a spy and informer in the person of klaas nuka the government interpreter to colonel wilshire who was at that time in command of the troops  three days previous to the attack this villainwell aware of makanas approachinformed the colonel that kafirs had been seen in the precisely opposite direction the unsuspecting colonel at once fell into the trap  he detached the light company of the 38th regiment to patrol in the direction pointed out  thus was the garrison of the town which consisted of 450 european soldiers and a small body of mounted hottentots weakened to the extent of 100 men  on that same april morning colonel wilshire was quietly inspecting a detachment of the mounted cape corps when the hottentot captain boezac chief of a band of buffalohunters informed him that he had just received information of makanas advance  the colonel mounted on a fleet charger at once rode off with an escort of ten men to reconnoitre  he came unexpectedly on the enemy in a ravine not far from the town  they were taking a rest before rushing to the assault and so sure were these poor savages of their irresistible power that thousands of their wives and children followed them with their mats pots and cookingjars ready to take possession of the place  colonel wilshire retreated instantly and there was need for haste  the kafirs pursued him so closely that he reached his troops only a few minutes before them  the small band of defenders more than made up for the difference in numbers by the deadly precision of their fire  the kafirs came on in a dense sable mass led by their various chiefs and generalled by the lynx who had impressed his followers with the belief that the muskets of the foe were charged only with hot water  the field pieces of the troops were loaded with shrapnel shells which at the first discharge mowed long lanes in the advancing masses while musketry was discharged with deadly effect  but kafirs are stern and brave warriors  on they came with wild cries sending a shower of short spears assagais before them which however fell short  regardless of the havoc in their ranks they still came on and the foremost men were seen to break short their assagais with the evident intention of using them more effectively as daggers in handtohand conflict  this was deliberately done by makanas orders and showed his wisdom for with the great bodily strength size and agility of the kafirs and their overwhelming numbers the attack if promptly and boldly made at close quarters could not have failed of success  at this moment the hottentot captain boezac created a diversion  he rushed with his band of a hundred and thirty men to meet the foe  these buffalohunters had among them some of the coolest and best marksmen in the country  singling out the boldest of those who advanced and were encouraging their followers in the final charge boezac and his men laid low many of the bravest chiefs and warriors  this gave the kafirs a decided check  the troops cheered and fired with redoubled speed and energy  lieutenant aitcheson of the artillery plied the foe with a withering fire of grapeshot  boezac and his hunters turning their flank pressed them hotly in rear and the hottentot cavalry charged the kafirs recoiled though some of the boldest scorning to give in rushed madly among the soldiers and perished fighting  then a wild panic and a total rout ensued and the great host was scattered like chaff and driven into the ravines  brief though this fight had been the carnage among the kafirs was terrible  one who was an eyewitness of the fight tells us that the bodies of about 2000 kafir warriors strewed the field of battle and that many others perished of their wounds in the rivulet leading down to the cape corps barracks  nuka the faithless interpreter was shot but makana escaped  a few months afterwards however he delivered himself up and the other chiefs sued for peace  with makanas surrender the war of 1819 ended the lynx himself was sent prisoner to robben island  after nearly two years confinement he attempted to escape in a boat with some other prisoners but the boat was upset in the surf on blueberg beach and makana was drowned while his companions escaped  as grahamstown grew in years and size she bore her part well both in the suffering and the action which the colony has been called on to endure and undertake

body i was sorely tempted to do so too long by the kindness of friends and the salubrity of the weather  adieu grahamstown thou art a green spot in memory as well as in reality    note 1  the map of the present railways on page vi will enable the reader to judge how far this has been realised    letter ten  salema peculiar picnicpolo under difficultieslecturing and singingsporting at night  salem is as it should be a peaceful spot  it was not always so there was a time when its inhabitants had to toil so to speak with the spade in one hand and the musket in the other  it lies in a hollow of the great rolling plains and was founded like many of the eastern towns in the memorable 1820 when the british settlers came out and a new era for the colony began  the arrival of the original settlers at salem is thus described by one who was a noted leader in the first days  our dutch wagondriver intimating that we had at length reached our proper location we took our boxes out of the wagon and placed them on the ground  he bade us goeden dag or farewell cracked his long whip and drove away leaving us to our reflections  my wife sat down on one box and i on another  the beautiful blue sky was above us and the green grass beneath our feet  we looked at each other for a few moments indulged in some reflections and perhaps exchanged a few sentences but it was no time for sentiment and hence we were soon engaged in pitching our tent and when that was accomplished we removed into it our trunks and bedding  all the other settlers who arrived with us were similarly engaged and in a comparatively short time the somewhat extensive valley of that part of the assagai bush river which was to be the site of our future village presented a lively and picturesque appearance  soon the spade the plough and the axe began their subduing work  some of the beautiful grassy slopes were turned up  small clearings were made in the bush  frail huts with doors of matting and windows of calico began to arise  lime was found whitewash was applied and the huts began to smile  so did the waters of the stream when partially shorn of the bushmoustache by which from time immemorial they had been partially concealed the first crops were sown and the work of civilisation began  there was a ruinous wattle and daub edifice which had been deserted by a dutch boer before the arrival of the settlers this was converted into a church townhall and hospital  the yell of the kafir and the whizzing assagai afterwards disturbed the peace of salem and at that time the settlers proved that though on peaceful plans intent they could bravely hold their own but it was peaceful enough and beautiful when i first beheld it  at the door of a moderately handsome residencewhich had succeeded the wattleanddaub style of thingi was heartily welcomed by my friend and his amiable spouse  here i had the pleasure of enjoying a south african picnic  a picnic is at all times interesting doubly so when undertaken in peculiar circumstances  one of the peculiarities of this picnic was that the invitation to it was publicly given and embraced the entire population  another peculiarity was that the population almost in its entirety accepted the invitation  but there were still other peculiarities which will appear in the sequel  the morning of the day fixed was bright and beautiful  this indeed was no peculiarity  most of the mornings days and nights in that splendid region were of much the same stamp at that time  the spot fixed on for the scene of the picnic was about six miles from salem where a wild buffalo had been killed the week before  the killing of this buffalo was an event for that wild denizen of the african bush had long ago retired before the rifle of the settler to safer retreats and rarely returned to his old haunts  a band of buffaloes however had apparently taken a fancy to revisit the home of their childhood at this time  there was nothing to prevent them for although the country is settled the original bush is in many places sufficiently extensive and impervious to afford safe shelter to the wildest of animals  at all events a band of buffaloes did come to the neighbourhood of salem and there met with a farmernimrod who picked off one of their number  i turned aside during one of my rides to visit the head and horns which lay near his house  the place of rendezvous for those who dwelt in the village was an open space in front of the church  here at an early hour there assembled numerous equestrians as well as vehicles of varied shape and character i was mounted on a smart brown pony kindly lent by mr shaw teacher of the flourishing school of salem  my friend caldecott bestrode a powerful steed suited to his size  when the gathering had reached considerable proportions we started like an eastern caravan  among the cavaliers there were stalwart men and fair damselsalso little boys and girls prancing in anxiety to get away  there were carts and gigs and buggies or things that bore some resemblance to such vehicles in which were the more sedate ones of the gathering and there were great cape wagons with fifteen or twenty oxen to each containing whole familiesfrom hale old grannies down to grannies weaknesses in the shape of healthy lumps of live lard clad in amazement and bibs  it was a truly grand procession as after toiling up the slope that leads from the valley of salem we debouched upon the wide plain and assumed our relative positionsthat is the riders dashed away at speed the carts and buggies getting up steam pushed on and the oxen trailed along at their unalterable gait so that in a few minutes the dense group spread into a moving mass which gradually drew itself out into an attenuated line whereof the head ultimately became invisible to the tail  my tall host led the way with enthusiastic vigour  he was a hearty earnest man who could turn quickly from the pleasant contemplation of the trivialities of life to the deep and serious consideration of the things that bear on the life to come  one sunday i rode over the plains with him to visit a native church in which it was his duty to conduct worship  the congregation was black and woollyheadedhottentots chiefly i believe though there may have been some kafirs amongst them  there is something very attractive to me in the bright eager childlike look of black men and women  the said look may be the genuine expression of feelingit may be for aught i can tell the result of contrast between the dazzling whites of eyes and teeth with liquidblack pupils and swarthy cheeksbut that does not alter the fact that it is pleasant  the hottentot who translated my friends discourse sentence by sentence was a fine specimeni wont say of his race but of humanity he was full of intelligence and fire caught the preachers meaning instantly riveted with his glittering eye the attention of his audience and rattled out his words with a power that was most impressive and with the interspersion of those indescribable clicks with which the native language abounds  but to return to the picnic  as we advanced groups and couples of cavaliers and carts and wagons joined the line of march from outlying farms so that when we reached the rendezvous we must have formed a body of two hundred strong or more  the spot chosen was the summit of a woody knoll from which we could survey all the country round and look down upon the river with its miles and miles of dense bush in which the buffaloes had vainly fancied themselves free from the danger of human foes  was there plenty of food at that picnic  i should think there was south africans do not live upon air by any meansthough air has a good deal to do with their living  these comely maidens and strapping boys had not been brought up on watergruel  these powerful men and ruddy matrons to say nothing of the aged and the juvenile would not have gone to that knoll on the plain without a prospect of strong meat of some sort  there were pies and joints buns and beef cakes and coffee tea and tongues sugar and sandwiches hams and hampers mounds of mealies oceans of milk and baskets of bread and butter  im not sure whether there were wines or spirits  i culpably forget  probably there were not for good templars are powerful in that region and so is temperance  did we do justice to the viands  didnt we  my notions of human capacity were enlarged that day  so was my own capacityout of sympathy coupled with the ride  but we did not linger over our food seated in groups near the margin of and partly in the bush we refreshed ourselves in comparative silence  then we grew noisy over our milk and tea  some of us even got the length of singing and speechmaking but the younger portion of the band soon lost their appetites and dispersedsome to romp some to ramble others to engage in games  a few of the more reckless among us extemporised a game of polo  most people know though some may not that this is a game played on horseback with a club and balla species of equestrian hockey as it is styled in england shinty in scotland  to be well done it requires good and trained horses a wide expanse of level country and expert riders  our state of preparation for the game may be understood when i say that we had indifferent and untrained horses that the ground was very uneven and covered with huge anthills while the riders were not expertat least not at polo  we got sticks however and went at it  half a dozen men cut and levelled several anthills and marking off a square patch of ground four of usi wont say whowere placed one at each corner while the ball a football was put in the middle of the square  our innocent horses stood quietly there till the signal was given to start  then each cavalier essayed to reach the ball first  the sudden urging of the steeds to instant action seemed to confuse them  they did not spring as they should have done like arrows from bows  one rider wildly kicked with his heels and shook his reins  the horse turned round as if in contempt from the ball  another applied his whip with vehemence but his horse only backed  a third shouted having neither whip nor spur and brought his polostick savagely down on his animals flank but it plunged and reared  the only horse that behaved well was that of a gallant youth who wore spurs  a dig from these sent him into the field  he reached the ball made a glorious blow at it and hit the terrestrial ball by mistake  before the mistake could be rectified three of the other players were up flourishing their long clubs in reckless eagerness the fourth rode into them the horses then lost patience and refused obedience to ordersno wonder for one club aimed at the ball fell on a horses shins while another saluted a horses ear  presently the ball spurted out from the midst of us the horses scattered and one was seen to rise on its hindlegs  immediately thereafter one of the playersi wont say whichwas on the ground and his horse was careering over the plain  regardless of this the other three charged met in the shock of conflict clubs met clubs and ears and shinsbut not the balluntil finally an accidental kick from one of the horses i think sent it towards the boundary at a considerable distance from the players  then it was that the power of spurs became conspicuously apparent while two of the champions backed and reared the gallant youth with the armed heels made a vigorous rush at the ball miraculously hit it and triumphantly won the game  on the whole it was a failure in one sense but a great success in another inasmuch as it afforded immense amusement to the spectators and pleasant excitement as well as exercise to the performers  it must not be supposed however that the energies of the whole picnic were concentrated on polo  the party as i have said had broken up into groups one of which played hideandseek among the bushes on the knoll while another engaged in a game which involved sitting in a circle changing places frequent collisions constant mistakes on the part of the ignorant and shouts of laughter with rectifying advice on the part of the knowing  all this time the sun was glowing as only a south african summer sun can glow in a cloudless sky and it was not until that sun had become red in the face and sunk far down into the west that the panting but far from exhausted revellers saddled up and inspanned and began to quit the scene  then it was as my friend and i stood on the bushtopped knoll that the magnificence of our picnic fully impressed us for as we surveyed the long line of riders and trundling carts and gigs and carriages and heavy cape wagons with their creeping teams winding over the plain the head of the column was seen almost on the horizon before the rearguard had left the scene of our festivities  this was altogether one of the pleasantest days i had spent in the colony the people were so hearty and vigorous so varied in appearance character and age so full of life and fun and goodwill  but it is not always in the sunshine that the good people of salem enjoy themselves  the hunters among them occasionally go out shooting at night with the aid of a dark lantern and the wretched creature which they pursue on such occasions is called a springhare  it seems a mixture of the hare and the kangarooits size and aspect being those of the former animal while its long hindlegs and its action in springing resemble the latter  in running it does not use its fore legs but bounds like the kangaroo  never having engaged in nightsportingsave in dreamsi agreed to accompany two salem nimrods on a hunt after springhares  we went into the fields  that is all i can vouch for  it happened to be so dark that we might as well have been groping about in a coalpit my companions however knew the ground which was fortunate for walking over a rugged surface in the dark is not only confusing but trying to the nerves to say nothing of the temper  i followed faithfully and close to heel like a welltrained dog  this way sir mind the ditch  where ah all riight  the last syllable was shot out of me like a bullet as i plunged into the ditch  the nimrod who carried the lantern opened the slide for a moment revealed the rugged nature of the ground and closed it when i had risen  its better farther on he said encouragingly  is it  ah thats well  we came to a piece of ground which my feet and legs told me was covered with long rough grass and occasional bushes  over this we stumbled and here the rays of the lantern were directed far in advance of us so as to sweep slowly round bringing bushes and grassy tufts and stumps and clods into spectral view for a moment as the focus of light moved on  we never see their bodies said the lanternbearer slowly as he peered earnestly in front we only see the sparkle of one eye when the light falls on it andthenwefireatthere thats one  look dont you see his eye  fire sir fire  i raised my gun and looked eagerly with all my eyes but saw nothing never having been in the habit of firing at nothing i hesitated  ah hes gone  never mind well soon see another  we stumbled on again  the surrounding gloom depressed me but i revived under the influence of one or two false alarms and a severe plunge into a deepish hole  there he is again quite near whispered my lightbearer  aim for the eye whispered the other  the whispering and intense silence that followed coupled with the gloom made me feel guilty  i saw nothing but tried so hard to do so that i persuaded myself that i did and attempted to aim  the sights of the gun are invisible i whispered somewhat testily  without a word the lantern was raised until the light glittered on the barrels  then i saw nothing whatever except the gun  in sheer desperation i pulled the trigger  the tremendous appearance in the dark of the sheet of flame that belched forth and the crash of the report in the silent night gave me quite new ideas as to firearms  youve missed said the lightbearer  as i had fired at nothing i felt inclined to reply that i had notbut refrained  again we stumbled on and i began to grow melancholy when another there he goes brought me to the ready with eager eyes  i saw it clearly enough this time  a diamond was sparkling in the blackness before me  i aimed and fired  there was a squeal and a rush instantly my friends dashed off in wild pursuit and i stood listening not daring to move for fear of ditches  the sounds of leaping stumbling and crashing came to me on the night air for a few minutes then my friends returned with the light and with a poor little springhares lifeless and longhindlegged body  with this trophy i returned home resolved never more to go hunting at night    letter eleven  algoa baykafirs on the coastdifficulties regarding servants  standing on the shores of algoa bay with the liverpool of south africaport elizabethat my back i attempted to realise what must have been the scene in the memorable 1820 when the flourishing city was yet unborn when the whole land was a veritable wilderness and the sands on which the port now stands were covered with the tents of the settlers  some of the surroundings thought i are pretty much as they were in those days  the shipping at anchor in the offing must resemble the shipping that conveyed the emigrants across the seaexcept of course these two giant steamers of the donald currie and the union lines the bright blue sky too and the fiery sun are the same and so are those magnificent rollers which rising one scarce can tell when or where out of a deadcalm sea stand up for a few seconds like liquid walls and then rush up the beach with a magnificent roar  as i gazed the scene was rendered still more real by the approach from seaward of a great surfboat similar to the surfboats that brought the settlers from their respective ships to the shore  such boats are still used at the port to land goodsand also passengers when the breakers are too high to admit of their being landed in small boats at the wooden pier  the surfboats are bulky broad and flat strongly built to stand severe hammering on the sand and comparatively shallow at the stern to admit of their being backed towards the beach or hauled off to sea through the surf by means of a rope over the bow  as the surfboat neared the shore i heard voices behind me and turning round beheld a sight which sent me completely back into the 1820 days  it was a band of gentlemen in blackblack from the crowns of their heads to the soles of their feet with the exception of their lips and teeth and eyes  here was the simon pure in very truth  they were socalled red kafirs because of their habit of painting their bodies and blankets with red ochre  at this time the paint had been washed off and the blankets laid aside  they were quite naked fresh from the lands of their nativity and apparently fit for anything  shade of othelloto say nothing of apollowhat magnificent forms the fellows had and what indescribably hideous faces  they were tall muscular broadshouldered small waisted and ankled roundmuscled blackpolishedin a word elegantly powerful  many of them might have stood as models for hercules  like superfine cloth they were of various shades some were brownblack some almost blueblack and many coalblack  they were coming down to unload the surfboat and seemed full of fun and sly childlike humour as they walked tripped skipped and sidled into the water  at first i was greatly puzzled to account for the fact that all their heads and throats were wrapped up or swathed in dirty cloth  it seemed as if every man of them was under treatment for a bad cold  this i soon found was meant to serve as a protection to their naked skins from the sharp and rugged edges and corners of the casks and cases they had to carry  the labour is rather severe but is well paid so that hundreds of kafirs annually come down from their homes in the wilderness to work for a short time  they do not i believe make a profession of it  fresh relays come every year  each young fellows object is to make enough money to purchase a gun and cattle and a wifeor wives  as these articles cost little in africa a comparatively short attention to business during one season enables a man who left home a beggar to return with his fortune made  he marries sets his wives to hoe the mealies and milk the cows and thereafter takes life easy except when he takes a fancy to hunt elephants or to go to war for pastime  ever after he is a drone in the worlds beehive  having no necessity he need not work and possessing no principle he will not  as the boat came surging in on the foam these manly children waded out to meet her throwing water at each other and skylarking as they went they treated the whole business in fact as a rather good jest and although they toiled like heroes they accompanied their work with such jovial looks and hummed such lilting freeandeasy airs the while that it was difficult to associate their doings with anything like labour  soon the boat grounded and the kafirs crowded round her up to their waists sometimes in the water and sometimes up to the armpits when a bigger wave than usual came roaring in  the boat itself was so large that as they stood beside it their heads barely rose to a level with the gunwale  the boatmen at once began to heave and roll the goods over the side  the kafirs received them on their heads or shoulders according to the shape or size of each packageand they refused nothing  if a bale or a box chanced to be too heavy for one man a comrade lent assistance if it proved still too heavy a third added his head or shoulder and the box or bale was borne off  one fellow like a black hercules put his wrapper on his head and his head under a bale which i thought would crush him down into the surf but he walked ashore with an easy springing motion that showed he possessed more than sufficient power  another man hitting hercules a sounding smack as he went by received a mighty cask on his head that should have cracked itbut it didnt  then i observed the boatmen place on the gunwale an enormous flat box which seemed to me about ten feet square  it was corrugated iron they told me of i forget how many hundredweight  a crowd of kafirs got under it and carried it ashore as easily as if it had been a butterfly  but this was nothing to a box which next made its appearance from the bowels of that capacious boat  it was in the form of a cube and must have measured nine or ten feet in all directions  its contents i never ascertained but the difficulty with which the boatmen got it rested on the side of the boat proved its weight to be worthy of its size  to get it on the shoulders of the kafirs was the next difficulty  it was done by degrees  as the huge case was pushed over the edge kafir after kafir put his head or shoulder to it until there were i think from fifteen to twenty men beneath the weightthen slowly it left the boat and began to move towards the shore  assuredly if four or five of these men had stumbled at the same moment the others would have been crushed to death but not a man stumbled they came ashore with a slow regular almost dancing gait humming a low monotonous chant as if to enable them to step in time and making seriocomic motions with arms and hands until they deposited safely in a cart a weight that might have tested atlas himself  it seemed obvious that these wild men for such they truly were had been gifted with all the powers that most white men lay claim to vigour muscle energy pluck fun humour resolution  only principle is wanted to make them a respectable and useful portion of the human family  like all the rest of us they are keenly alive to the influence of kindness and affection  of course if your kindness forbearance or affection take the form of action which leads them to think that you are afraid of them they will merely esteem you cunning and treat you accordingly but if you convince a kafir or any other savage that you have a disinterested regard for him you are sure to find him grateful more or less  one family with which i dined gave me to understand that this was the result of their own experience  at that very time they had a kafir girl in training as a housemaid  servants let me remark in passing are a cape difficulty  the demand is in excess of the supply and the supply is not altogether what it should be besides being dear and uncomfortably independent  i suppose it was because of this difficulty that the family i dined with had procured a halfwild kafir girl and undertaken her training  her clothes hung upon her in a manner that suggested novelty  she was young very tall black lithe as an eel strong as a horse  she was obviously new to the work and went about it with the air of one who engages in a frolic  but the free air of the wilderness had taught her a freedom of action and stride and a fling of body that it was not easy to restrain within the confined precincts of a diningroom  she moved round the table like a sable pantherready to spring when wanted  she had an openmouthed smile of amused goodwill and an openeyed whatnextonlysayquickandilldoit expression that was impressive  she seized the plates and dishes and bore them off with a giraffelike highstepping action that was quite alarming but she broke or spilt nothing  to say that she flung about would be mild  it would not have been strange i thoughtonly a little extra dash in her jubilant method of proceedingif she had gone headforemost through the diningroom window for the sake of bearing the mutton round by a shorter route to the kitchen  the family expected that this girl would be reduced to moderation and rendered faithfulas she certainly was intelligentby force of kindness in a short time  of course in a country thus circumstanced there are bad servants  the independence of the totties is most amusingto those who do not suffer from it  i was told that servants out there have turned the tables on their employers and instead of bringing characters with them require to know the characters of master and mistress before they will engage it is no uncommon thing for a domestic to come to you and say that she is tired and wants a rest and is going off to see her mother  indeed it is something to her credit if she takes the trouble to tell you sometimes she goes off without warning leaving you to shift for yourself returning perhaps after some days  if you find fault with her too severely on her return she will probably leave you altogether  this naturally tries the temper of highspirited mistressesas does also the incorrigible carelessness of some servants  a gentle lady said to me quietly one day i never keep a servant after slapping her  is it your habit to slap them  i asked with a smile  no she replied with an answering smile but occasionally i am driven to it  when a careless girl who has been frequently cautioned singes ones linen and destroys ones best dress and melts ones teapot by putting it on the redhot stove what can flesh and blood do  i admitted that the supposed circumstances were trying  the last one i sent off continued the lady had done all that  when she filled up her cup of iniquity by melting the teapot i just gave her a good hearty slap on the face  i couldnt help it  of course she left me after that  i did not doubt it for the lady was not only gentle in her manner and pretty to boot but was tall and stout and her fair arm was strong and must have been heavy    letter twelve  port elizabethalgoa baydiamondskafir nobility  port elizabeth may be described as the firstborn city of the eastern province of the cape of good hope  it came into being in 1820  it is now a flourishing seaport full of energetic busy moneymaking men it is the principal seaport of the eastern province and the nearest point on the coast to the diamondfields420 miles from de beers new rush a distance which was traversed in about six days by coaches  among its more useful enterprises it has the honour of having sent out one pioneer of future commercial prosperity in the eastern province for port elizabeth is the startingpoint of one branch of that great railway system which is to revolutionise africa  i do not say south africa but advisedly use the title of wider scope  it is not every day that one can boast of having handled a tumbler full of diamonds  being anxious to see a mass of those precious gems in an uncut condition i appealed to a friend who had come out with me in the windsor castle  he introduced me to a broker who took me into a back office opened a strongbox took out a small packet and untying it poured out a tumblerful of diamonds  they ranged from the size of a pinhead to that of a bean and were varied in shade from pure crystal to strawcolour the broker then opened one or two separate parcels each of which contained a specially large or fine diamond varying in size from a pea to a hazelnut  that one he said may be worth four hundred pounds and this perhaps about five or six hundred  looking at them it was difficult to believe that they were other than paltry pebbles yet these were the things for which men left home and kindred pushed into the wilds of a savage land toiled and moiled in the great pit at kimberley and too often sacrificed health happiness and life itself  judging them from their looks i would not have given sixpence for the entire lotso true is it that we do wrong in judging uncut gems as well as unknown men by the outward appearance  a very striking and rather unfortunate instance of this false style of judgment occurred not many days afterwards in reference to some kafir princes and chiefs it was on the occasion of my quitting port elizabeth for capetown  we were to have started on a saturday afternoon but a gale said no and we left on sunday morning  even then although the gale had abated a surf so magnificent was rolling into algoa bay that no ships boat could approach the jetty  this obliged the passengers to go off to the steamer in a surfboat  of course the boat could not approach nearer the dry sand than fifty yards or so  there she heaved about in oceans of boiling foam while kafirs carried us on board one by one  the kafirs bore the women in their strong arms as children are carried and put them over the gunwale tenderly but the men were made to sit on their shoulders as one sits on horseback and were treated with less ceremony  a giant in ebony carried me off and trotted as he went to the delight of some of his comrades but i was accustomed to riding and patted his black head approvingly  while standing on a commanding point in the stern a fellowpassenger directed attention to a group of kafirs who tried to keep apart from the others and looked dignified  these he told me were a party of native princes chiefs and councillors who had been brought fresh from their wilderness homewith their own consent of courseand were being taken to capetown for the purpose of being impressed with the wealth power grandeur and vast resources of the white man  the other kafirs of whom there was a large gang were common fellows who chanced to be going by the same steamer as navvies to work on the western railways the difference between the navvies and their nobility was not great personally there was scarcely any and the somewhat superior cloth of the robes worn by the latter made no great show  the big boat was hauled off by a rope through the surf the sail set and we were soon alongside the ocean steamer whose iron sides rose above us like a city wall  there was nothing but an iron ladder flat against this wall by which to ascend  the heaving of the surfboat was great it approached the ladder and retreated from it in the most irregularly spasmodic manner  only active men accustomed to such feats could get upon it  kafirs although active as kittens are not accustomed to the sea or to the motion of ships and boats  for them to ascend was a matter of great difficulty for the women and children it was impossible  but the difficulty had been provided for  presently we saw a great cask like an overgrown hogshead swing over the side and descend into the boat  it was caught by our sailors and placed on the sternsheets several tars from the steamer descended to assist  the cask was large enough to hold three or four women besides a child or two  amid much giggling and persuading it was filled a signal given steam applied and the party was whirled aloft with a scream and lowered on the vessels deck in safety  the cask was again sent down  meanwhile some of us had scrambled up the ladder and a few of the kafir navvies followed our example but the most of them required a good deal of encouragement and some strong persuasion while others refused flatly to attempt it  all this time the black aristocrats looked on in grave silence  if i remember rightly there were a young prince an old councillor and two or three chiefs  when those navvies that could be persuaded or kicked up the ladder had been disposed of the sailors turned upon the timid ones and bundled them into the cask neck and crop four and five at a time  there was necessity for speed and sailors are not wont to be delicate when this is the case  at last the aristocracy were approached  whether the sailors knew who they were i cannot tell it is probable that they did not but judged by the outward appearance  they were niggers that was enough for jack  come along old boy said one grasping the old councillor but the councillor held back jack therefore gave him a powerful shove and he went into the cask headforemost  another man had seized the young prince at the same moment  that potentatewho in his own land possessed the power of life and deathturned round with dignity and in doing so afforded an unlooked for opportunity to the sailor who pushed him gently till he tripped against the cask and went in backwards squeezing the old councillor almost flat  thats your sort bill fetch another cried jack as he packed the prince down  one chief was quickwitted enough to submit and stepped in of his own accord  another halfstepped and was halfthrust in  hoist away shouted bill  at that moment a forgotten navvy caught bills eye he seized him by the neck jack helped the man was thrown on the top of all and went up next moment like a spreadeagle cover to the cask  when this lot was lowered four or five of the jacktars on deck who greatly enjoyed the fun turned it suddenly over and thus it was emptied of its human contents  even at that moment of humiliation the savage chiefs were true to themselves  they rose from the deck in dignified silence the prince merely saying sternly to the gentleman who had charge of the party was this what you brought me here for  it is but just to add that the gentleman in charge of these noble visitors did his best to prevent the outrage but it had occurred suddenly in the exuberance of jacks spirits was over in a few seconds and could not be undone  these kafir chiefs were afterwards feasted and feted by the governor and gentry of capetown but i have my doubts whether they will ever forget or forgive the treatment received on that occasion in algoa bay  to correct the false is more difficult than to imbibe the true  did you ever think of that before  all my life have i been under the false impression that the cape of good hope was the most southerly point of africa  it is nothing of the sort  cape agulhas not far distant is the real extremity of south africa  we doubled it on the 3rd of april  oh  bartholomew diaz and vasco da gama what would you say if you knew that we doubled the capethe cape of stormsthe cape of tormentsin calm and sunshine at the rate of thirteen knots or thereabouts without a stitch of canvas with ladies and gentlemen in every attitude of lazy ease upon our deck and troops of children romping round them  how vast the difference between the doublings of the 15th and the 19th centuries  thenthe ships were small wooden tubs now they are huge iron kettles  thena few bold and sometimes turbulent spirits faced the dangers of unknown seas under the leadership of famous and heroic men now hundreds of men and womentimid and brave mixed undistinguishablyare carried in safety and comfort over the wellknown ocean by respectable captains of whom the world knows little or nothing beyond their names  once in a lifetime was the daring feat attempted then  once or twice a week is the trifling trip accomplished now  but enough of moralising  suffice it to say that we doubled the cape without sails without anxiety without care and with no triumph whateverbut not without interest  calm and sunny though it chanced to be we could not look upon that barren mountainous rocky shore without reflecting that it still is not less now than in days of old the stormy cape and that danger as appalling as that of yore may sometimes be encountered while heroism quite as exalted as that of the ancient portuguese navigators is sometimes displayed by modern britons  there is a point not far from cape agulhasbetween it and the cape of good hopenamed point danger where courage of the highest kind once calmly faced and fought with death  on that point in february 1852 the birkenhead was wrecked  it may be truly said that courage conquered on that occasion because the end for which it fought was the deliverance of women and children from death and this end was gained though above 400 of the gallant men who fought the battle perished in the hour of victory  the birkenhead a large iron steamer was engaged in the transport of troops to the frontier where war with the kafirs raged at the time these troops were detachments from several regiments under command of colonel seton of the 74th highlanders  about two oclock in the morning the vessel struck upon a rock near the wellnamed point danger and so tremendous was the shock that her iron plates were driven in as if made of eggshell  the cabin was immediately flooded and it was evident that in a few minutes the vessel would be engulfed among the breakers  none but those who have witnessed similar scenes can imagine the horrors of the situation  it was dark the breakers roared around the rugged and almost inaccessible shores of the cape of storms were on the one hand the ocean on the other men women and children were rushing about the decks in wild terror sharks were known to be in these waters and only two of the ships boats were available for service  in this moment of extremity god put it into the hearts of both officers and men to act with unexampled courage and wisdom  to save all was manifestly out of the question  when people are in such circumstances it is too often every man for himself the strong push aside the weak fight for the boats overcrowd and swamp them and thus few if any are left to tell the tale  but it was not so with the heroes of the birkenhead  at the word of command from colonel seton the soldiers drew up on the reeling deck as if on parade and obeyed his orders with steady calm unflinching bravery  if there were any selfish spirits on board they were overawed by the heroism of the soldiers  the colonel directed that the women and children and the sick should be put into the boats  this was quickly done and these were all saved without a single exceptionto the number of two hundred souls  but while this was being accomplished the vessel was breaking up and the fact that the men would be soon left to struggle in the waves was apparent to all yet the noble officer continued to give his orders and the not less noble men continued to obey and saw the boats depart without a murmur  they were young soldiers too who had never been under fire and this action was the first and last that they and their leader were destined to fight  the vessel suddenly parted amidships and though a few saved themselves by swimming and on floating pieces of wreck the greater number perishedno fewer than 357 officers and soldiersamong whom was the coloneland sixty seamen going down with the ship  it was a sad but splendid specimen of cool selfsacrificing courage and of the power of discipline in moments of tremendous trial    letter thirteen  the cape doctorthe capetown minemules literature and customsofficials  it is pretty generally known that there is a tablecloth at capetown its proper restingplace is table mountain  when the flat top of that celebrated hill is clear i write of the summer season the thirty thousand inhabitants of capetown may go forth in comfort if they can stand the blazing sunshine but as surely as that pure white cloudthe tableclothrests on the summit of table mountain so surely does the gale known as the southeaster come down like a wolf on the fold  the southeaster is a sneezer and a frequent visitor at the cape in summer  where it comes from no one can tell where it goes to is best known to itself what it does in passing is painfully obvious to all fresh from the antarctic seas it swoops down on the southern shores of africa and sweeps over the land as if in search of a worthy foe  it apparently finds one in table mountain which being 3582 feet high craggy and precipitous meets the enemy with frowning front and hurls him back discomfitedbut not defeated  rallying on the instant the southeaster rushes up over its cloudcapped head and round its rugged sides and down its dizzy slopes and falls with a shriek of fiendish fury on the doomed city  oceans of sand and dust are caught up by it whirled round as if in mad ecstasy and dashed against the faces of the inhabitantswho tightly shut their mouths and eyes as they stoop to resist the onset  then the southeaster yells while it sweeps dust small stones twigs leaves and stray miscellanies right over signal hill into the south atlantic  this is bad enough but it is a mere skirmishonly the advance guard of the enemy  supposing this attack to have been commenced in the morning the remainder of the day is marked by a series of violent assaults with brief intervals of repose  in rapid succession the southeaster brings up its battalions and hurls them on the mountain  it leaps over the moat and ramparts of the castle with fury roars down the cannons throats shrieks out at the touchholes and lashes about the town right and left assaulting and violating for the southeaster respects neither person nor place  it rattles roofs and windows and all but overturns steeples and chimneys it wellnigh blows the shops inside out and fills them with dust it storms the barracks and maltreats the soldiers it compels the shutting up of sunumbrellas or reverses and blows them to ribbons it removes hats and bonnets by the score and sweeps up small pebbles in its mad career so that one feels as if being painfully pelted with buckshot it causes the shipping to strain fearfully at its cables and churns the waters of table bay into a seething mass of snow and indigo  all this time the sun shines intensely in a cloudless sky and beautifies the cloth which floats on table mountain undulating on its surface or pouring over its edge like a niagara of wool to be warmed into invisibility before tumbling halfway down the mighty precipice that backs the town  although i have compared the southeaster to an enemy he is in reality a friend  the inhabitants call him the cape doctor because in the general clearance he sweeps away bad smells the natural result of bad drainage  but the southeaster was not blowing when i arrived at the ancient capital of south africa  the cloth was drawn the crags of the mountain the white buildings and green groves of the town and suburbs were unsullied by mist or dust as we steamed into the bay and the rugged outlines of the hills of the interior were distinctly visible through the warm haze  the suburbs of the city are exceedingly beautiful and here many of the principal inhabitants have built elegant mansions to which they retire after the business of each day to escape the heat dust and smells of the town  a short line of railroad runs to these verdant spots at one side while a tramway extends on the other  in another direction the railway runs by stellenbosch and the paarl to wellington and worcester  it may surprise some people to be told that there is a minea rich and prolific mineat capetown  nevertheless such is undoubtedly the case  this mine is more extensive and valuable than any of the diamond or gold mines of the orange river or the transvaal  indeed it is one of the most extensive mines in the world  it is as already said exceedingly prolific and is marked by one grand peculiarity namely that among those who devote themselves to the working of it there are no disappointed or unsuccessful diggers  another peculiarity is that very little capital is required to work it  the digger is not obliged to purchase claims for it is almost if not altogether free  the only capital that must be sunk in it is time and of that even one hour a day will suffice to bring up vast stores of wealth from its unfathomable depths while the labour bestowed tends to rest rather than to weary the body at the same time that it enlarges the mind and invigorates the soul  still another peculiarity of this mine is that its products are various and innumerable  you must go to australia or to california for gold to golconda or kimberley for diamonds to mexico or spain for silver to cornwall for copper tin and lead and to sweden for iron but in this mine you will find the various metals and gems in neighbouring pockets and nuggets and seams and beds  here you may gather the golden opinions of the ancients in close proximity to those of the moderns here you will find pearls of thought sparkling gems of imagery broad seams of satire and silvery streams of sentiment with wealth of wisdom and of wit  hard ironfisted facts also and funny mercurial fancies are to be found here in abundance and there are tons of tin in the form of rubbish which is usually left at a pits mouth and brings little or no tin to those who brought it to light while there are voluminous layers of literary lead whose weight and dulness render the working of them tediousbut this need not and does not dishearten the digger for in all mines the poor and worthless material is ever in excess of that which is valuable and miserable indeed must be the spirit of him who should refuse to manipulate the dirt because the large nuggets and gems are few and far between  throughout all the cuttings flow glittering brooks of knowledge and also many crystal rivulets drawn from the pure waters of the river of life  the mine of which i write is the public library of capetown  and let it not be supposed that i exaggerate or overestimate this mine it unquestionably takes rank as one of the noted libraries of the world and south africa has reason to be proud of and grateful to the men who by their enlightened schemes and liberality were the means of creating what is at once a mine and a monument to the cape  but capetown boasts of many other institutions which are well worthy of notice  it isand has been since its foundation by van riebeek in 1652the seat of governments  see note 1 it is also the seat of the supreme court and of the university of the cape of good hope  it possesses a firstrate south african museum two cathedrals many churches a castle fort barracks and other buildings too numerous to mention  also a splendid breakwater patent slip and docks  from the sublime to the ridiculous is wellknown to be but a step  from mines of knowledge to matteroffact mules may seem a rather long step if it is the blame of my taking it must rest on the force of association  from the library you can walk in a few minutes to the docks and docks has brought me to mules  i saw a shipload of mules there and it was a sight not to be forgotten  have you ever seen a fair standup fight between men and mules  it is not easy to say which of the two combatants is the more mulish  i went one day to the docks and chanced to witness a conflict  they were discharging the mulesthe men werefrom the hold of the small vessel which had brought them over sea from south america  victory or death was undoubtedly the motto of each  of course man prevailed because of superior powernot obstinacy  many days ay weeks had these mules spent on the heaving deep no doubt they had all been seasick certainly they had been half killed but when i went down into the hold of that ship where there must have been at least fifty animals the hundred ears of all of them lay quite flat pinned to their necks as a desperate pirate might nail his colours to the mast while deep unutterable hate and dogged resolution gleamed from every eye  they were ranged along the sides of the ship in two rows  the rows had been full all the voyage but when i saw them half the animals had been got on shore so that there was plenty of room for the remnant to career about and kick defiance at their human persecutors  what charmed me most was not the triumph of intelligence over brute force but the application of brute force on both sides with just sufficient mechanical addition on the part of the men to render their power irresistible  when i entered the hold the stench of which was almost overpowering i could see nothing in the dim light but i could hear the wild clattering of hoofs on wooden floors the little shrieks of irrepressible fury and the deep firmly uttered commandsuch as  now then dick look out  grab im  dig into im  twist is tail  thats it  hup  my eyes soon becoming accustomed to the dim light i saw a trembling mule in the embrace of three men  it trembled with passion only  one had passed a stout sheet under it  next moment there was an order to hoist away and the mule went past me with rigid limbs high into the air whence it was lowered i could not see whither and disappeared  meanwhile the three men went viciously at another animal  they were unusually strong men with immense chests and brawny arms bared to the shoulders  they panted and perspired freely and had been severely dishevelled by their recent struggles  i saw the dim outline of a mule in the dark recesses of the hold to which he had retired crushing his companions against the bulkheads of the ship  he evidently knew that his hour was come  to this demon dick advanced with a short rope in his hand  the mule eyed him with a gleam of malice  its ears became if possible flatter dick made a loop on the rope and leaning over the breasthigh barricade between him and his adversary made a cast after the manner of south americans but the mule jerked his head aside and the lasso missed him  while dick was preparing for another cast tom came up behind him with a sly motion  the mule observed tom let fly both heels with a tremendous crash on the barrier and bolted to the other end of the ship  there harry met him with a stick and turned him back whence he came  again dick advanced made a successful cast and drew the noose tight for a few moments a perfect shower of kicks was delivered at the barrier and on the sides of the ship but the three men did not wait till the creature was exhausted they had no time for that  two of them hauled the mules head by main force to the edge of the barrier the third leaning far over caught its tail and instantly drew it broadside on it was still some distance from the spot under the hatchway where the band and tackle were to be attached  towards this tom and dick dragged the beast by the head while harry assisted with the tail  no power on earth could have made that mule walk  with its ears back and all its legs planted stiffly forward it was made to slide in the required direction by main force  the place of execution reached dick jammed its head against the barrier tom hauled its tail taut over the same and made fast  there was no intentional cruelty in their actions but difficult work had to be quickly done and they could not afford to be squeamish  obstinate violence had to be overcome by resolute vigour the mule was now helplessly fixed with its tongue hanging out and its eyes protruding  nevertheless in that condition it continued without ceasing to struggle and try to kick and flatten its ears  it was a magnificent exhibition of determination to resist to the very deatha glorious quality when exercised in a good cause thought imy mind reverting to patriots and martyrs  meanwhile harry had passed the broad band under the mule drawn it over its back and attached the big hook to it  the signal was given to the men who managed the tackle on deck and the animal bounded into empty space  it was at that moment i made the discovery that a mules spirit resides in its legs  its last act on earth before leaving was to deliver a concentrated doublekick at the barrier but the instant it found itself in air its flattened ears sprung up with an air of horrified astonishment and all its legs hung straight and rigid the four hoofs coming together as if in abject supplication to any one or anything that could deliver  not the smallest effort did it make not a trace of selfwill did it display while it shot upwards through the hatchway nearly to the yardarm whence it obtained its first birdseye view of capetown docks  for one moment it hung while it was being swung over the quay whither it was lowered and its feet once more came in contact with motherearth  then but not till then did the disease of its limbs depart and the spirit of its ears and heels return  with a bound it sprang into the air but before it had time to think a human enemy caught its rope and drew its head tight to an iron post  another such enemy cast off the broad band and tackle and the creature was suddenly let go free  its final act was to flourish its heels in the air and utter a squeal of rage as it trotted into the midst of a group of its kindred which had already been treated in the same way    a spirited literary commencementthe publication of newspapersunder men of great ability and high principle bade fair to inaugurate an era of progress that might have quickly led the colony to a far greater height of moral mental and by consequence physical prosperity than it has ever yet attained but a long struggle for freedom of the press followed and in 1828 this freedom was secured  the sparkling streams thus set free have flowed and waxed in volume ever since  there is a customhouse at capetown  it is not because of being one of the noteworthy buildings of the port that i mention it but because of its having been to me a personal nuisance on the occasion of my arrival in the colony  a fellowpassenger had informed mewhether rightly or wrongly i knew not and cared notthat watches jewellery and guns were among the taxable articles  knowing that my portmanteau contained no such articles except a brass watchguard i presented myself to the official with an air of conscious innocence  i had hoped that like many such officials in france and elsewhere he would have been content with an assurance that i had nothing to declare and the offer of my keys but i was mistaken  this particular official was perhaps a new broom  it may be that he had caught some smugglers not long before and the excitement had not yet worn off  at all events instead of allowing me to pass he ordered me to open my portmanteau  while i was engaged in doing so he opened my shoulderbag and eyed its contents curiously  they were not numerous  he found nothing contraband and appearing somewhat disappointed applied his nose to it  it has a queer smell he remarked  as the bag had frequently done duty at picnics and been loaded with flasks and sandwiches i was not surprised  besides it occurred to me that no tax was levied on queer smells though such a tax might have been with advantage levied on the town itself  it would certainly have produced an immense revenue  i smiled however in a pleasant manner and said nothing  having shut the bag this official opened the portmanteau and began to examine each article in a way that would have rendered it probable he might have finished sometime within the next twentyfour hours  he slowly turned over my shirts and flannels as if he expected to find mines of jewellery in the folds thereof  suddenly he came on the brass chain and his eye glittered which was more than the chain did  it had to be redeposited with a sigh  i began to grow despairing  presently he took up a book and opened it  was he going to refresh himself with a chapter  his turning over the leaves very slowly gave reason for the suspicion  or did the obtuse creature expect to find watches and gunbarrels between the leaves  at last he shut the book and laying it down proceeded to exhume a morning coat  at this point one of his superiors told him that that was enough to my immense relief and the tooconscientious official allowed me to repack and lockup my property    note 1  the parliament of the union of south africa meets at capetown but pretoria is now the seat of the union government    letter fourteen  stellenbosch etcetera  an agreeable surprise is not only interesting to the recipient but sometimes to his friends  i received one at capetown which is worthy of record on several grounds  for the proper explanation of that surprise i must turn aside for a little  a mission started in the year 1860 for the zambesi where it was met and for a time joined by the great dr livingstone  its leader bishop mackenzie who laid down his life in the cause was a man as well as a missionary  by that i mean that he was manlya quality which is not sufficiently appreciated in some quarters as being a most important element in the missionary character  while on his way up to the selected sphere of labour in central africa the bishop and his party with dr livingstone got into the region of the accursed slavetrade and one day came unexpectedly on a band of slaves  they were chiefly women and children bound together with sticks and chains and herded by a few armed slavedealers who having murdered their male defenders and burned their villages were driving them to the coast for shipment to eastern landslargely it is said to the land of the amiable turk  with characteristic zeal and energy dr livingstone advanced with a few men to set these poor wretches free  the slavecatchers did not await the onset they bravely fired a shot or two and fled  to set the slaves free was naturally a most congenial work for the good bishop who had gone there to free the black man from the slavery of sin  the sticks were cut the bonds were unloosed and the people were told that they were free to go back to their homes  homes  their homes were in ashes and the brave hearts and stout arms that might have reared new homes were cold and powerless in death while armed arab and portuguese bands were prowling about the land gathering together more victims  to send these unfortunates away would have been to insure their death or recapture  there was no alternative left but to keep and guard them  thus the bishop suddenly found himself in possession of a small flock with which to begin his mission  he accepted the charge conducted them to the region where the mission was to be established and finally settled down with them there  some time after this there came a rumour that a large and powerful band of slavers was approaching the settlement with many slaves in possession and with the intention of attacking the tribe among whom the missionaries were located  what was now to be done  to have remained inactive until the slavers marched up to their huts would have been equivalent to suicide  it would have been worse for it would have insured the putting to flight of the few men of the tribewho it seems were not celebrated for courageand the result would have been the overthrow of the mission and the recapture of the women and children who had already been delivered  in these trying circumstances bishop mackenzie and his people came to the conclusion that selfdefence called for vigorous action and with musket and rifle sallied forth to meet the menstealers with the bishop at their head  on reaching the position of the enemy they paused at a distance of above six hundred yards  a group of arab slavers were standing on a hill together  one of the mission party kneeled and with an enfield rifle sent a bullet over their heads  the effect was powerful  the slavers accustomed to the smoothbore musket had thought themselves quite safe at such a distance  they were panicstricken perhaps the unexpected sight of white men aided the effect  at all events when another bullet was dropped into the midst of them they took to flight  the missionaries like good generals seized their opportunity charged home and chased the scoundrels into the woods  thus with little fighting they gained an important victory and became possessed of a second large band of slaveschiefly women and childrenwho had been forsaken by their terrified captors  these the bishop resolved to add to his settlement  indeed as in the previous case he had no alternative  they were at once liberated and conducted to the station and one of the poor black childrena little girl named daumawas carried home by mackenzie on his own shoulders  soon afterwards the mission failed in that quarter  among other misfortunes disease attacked and carried off several of the chief europeans of the party  the earnest enthusiastic bishop himself died there in his masters cause and left his bones in the swamps of the shire river  all this and a great deal more had i read with profound interest many years before my visit to the cape and the whole subject had made a deep impression on my memoryespecially the figure of the gallant bishop returning from his raid on the menstealers with the little wearied dauma on his shoulders  well one day i went to visit the saint georges orphanage for girls in capetown  i was conducted over the dormitories and schools etcetera and at last came to a classroom in which were assembled some hundred or so of black orphansinfants almost most of them and irresistibly comic in their little looks and actions  it was here that i received the agreeable surprise before referred to the teacher of this class was as black as her pupils  she is herself an orphan one of the best girls in our school said miss arthur referring to her  she was saved from the slavers in central africa many years ago  what  i exclaimed the little girl who was saved by the missionaries of the shire river  the same  and who was carried home on the shoulders of bishop mackenzie  yes her name is dauma  i shook hands with dauma immediately and claimed old acquaintance on the spot  chief among the many interesting visits which i paid while at capetown was one to the beautiful towns of stellenbosch and wellington  both are but a short distance from the capital and connected with it by rail the former is one of the oldest towns of the colony  many of the french refugees settled there in 1685  when in 1684 governor van der stell founded the lovely town of stellenbosch and led out the sparkling waters of its river to irrigate trees which afterwards became very giants of the forest little did he or his oppressive and tyrannical son and successor imagine that they had sown the seed of that which was destined to become an academic grove in the pleasant retirement of which lads and men should study the universal laws of matter and of mind  that however which made the deepest impression on me during this visit was the manner in which the work of training the young is conducted everything seemed to be done with an amount of wisdom and vigour which cannot fail to tell most beneficially and extensively on future generations  well do i remember in days gone by how with my juvenile mind addled and my juvenile fingers tingling after an application of the tawse i have stared at my arithmetic book in despairhopelessly ignorant of the meaning of words and terms utterly incapable of comprehending explanatory rules passionately averse to learning in every form and longingly anxious for the period of emancipation to arrive when i should be old and big enough to thrash my master  no such feelings sentiments or difficulties can ever find a place in the breasts of those fortunate pupils whose happy lot has been cast in the seminaries of stellenbosch and wellington  periwinkle my friend farewell
