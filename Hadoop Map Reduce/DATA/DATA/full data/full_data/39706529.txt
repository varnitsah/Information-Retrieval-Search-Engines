       xl a call before the curtain      the survivor    chapter i  the sermon that was never preached  a little party of men and women on bicycles were pushing their machines up the steep ascent which formed the one street of feldwick village it was a sunday morning and the place was curiously empty their little scraps of gay conversation and laughterthey were men and women of the smart worldseemed to strike almost a pagan note in a deep sabbatical stillness they passed the wide open doors of a red brick chapel and several of the worshippers within turned their heads as the last two of the party went by the wheezings of a harmonium ceased and a mans voice came travelling out to them the lady rested her hand upon her hosts arm listen she whispered  her host lord of the manor lord lieutenant of the county and tenth earl of cumberland paused readily enough and leaned his machine against a kerbstone bicycling was by no means a favourite pursuit of his and the morning for the time of year was warm  dear lady he murmured shall we go a little nearer and listen to the words of grace anything for a short rest  she leaned her own bicycle against the wall from where she was she could catch a sideway glimpse of a tall slight figure standing up before the handful of people  i should like to go inside she said indifferently would they think it an intrusion  certainly not he answered with visions of a chair before him as a matter of fact i have a special invitation to become a member of that flocktemporarily at any rate  what do you mean she asked  the land here he answered is not entailed and they are very anxious to buy this little bit and own their chapel i had a letter from a worthy farmer and elder gideon strong on the matter yesterday he wound up by expressing a wish that i might join them in their service one morning this is their service and here we are come  they crossed the street and to the obvious amazement of the little congregation stood in the doorway a gaunt shepherd with weathermarked face and knotted fingers handed them clumsily a couple of chairs some of the small farmers rose and made a clumsy obeisance to their temporal lord gideon strong six feet four with great unbent shoulders and face as hard and rugged as iron frowned them down and showed no signs of noticing his presence elsewhere he would have been one of the first proud man though he was to stand bareheaded before the owner of his farm and half a county but in the house of god humble little building though it was he reckoned all men equal  praying silently before them on the eve of his first sermon a young man was kneeling he had seen nothing of these newcomers but of a sudden as he knelt there his thoughts and sensations in strange confusion himself half in revolt against what lay before him there floated up the little aisle an exquisite perfume of crushed violets and he heard the soft rustling of a gown which was surely worn by none of those who were gathered together to listen to him he opened his eyes involuntarily and met the steady gaze of the lady whose whim it had been to enter the place  he had never seen her before nor any one like her yet he felt that in her presence the task which lay before him had become immeasurably more difficult she was a type to him of all those things the memory of which he had been strenuously trying to put away from him the beautiful the worldly the joyous as he rose slowly to his feet he looked half despairingly around it was a stern religion which they loved this handful of weatherbeaten farmers and their underlings their womenkind were made as unlovely as possible with flat hair sombre and illmade clothes their surroundings were whitewashed and texthung walls and in their hearts was the love for narrow ways he gave out his text slowly and with heavy heart then he paused and glancing once more round the little building met again the soft languid fire of those full dark eyes this time he did not look away he saw a faint interest a slight pity a background of nonchalance his cheeks flushed and the fire of revolt leaped through his veins he shut up the bible and abandoned his carefully prepared discourse in which was a mention of hellfire and many gloomy warnings which would have brought joy to the heart of gideon strong and to each of which he would slowly and approvingly have nodded his head he delivered instead with many pauses but in picturesque and even vivid language a long and close account of the miracle with which his text was concerned in the midst of it there came from outside the tinkling of many bicycle bellsthe rest of the party had returned in search of their host and his companion the earl looked up with alacrity he was nicely rested now and wanted a cigarette  shall we go he whispered  she nodded and rose at the door she turned for a moment and looked backwards the preacher was in the midst of an elaborate and painstaking sifting of evidence as to the season of the year during which this particular miracle might be supposed to have taken place again their eyes met for a moment and she went out into the sunlight with a faint smile upon her lips for she was a woman who loved to feel herself an influence and she was swift to understand to her it was an episode of the mornings ride almost forgotten at dinnertime to him it marked the boundary line between the old things and the new    chapter ii  a strange betrothal  the room had all the chilly discomfort of the farmhouse parlour unused save on state occasionsa funereal gloom which no sunlight could pierce a mustiness which savoured almost of the grave one by one they obeyed the stern forefinger of gideon strong and took their seats on comfortless chairs and the horsehair sofa first came john magee factor and agent to the earl of cumberland a great man in the district deacon of the chapel slow and ponderous in his movements a man of few words but much piety after him with some hesitation as became his lowlier station came william bull six days in the week his masters shepherd and faithful servant but on the seventh an elder of the chapel a person of consequence and dignity then followed joan and cicely strong together sisters in the flesh but as far apart in kin and the spirit as the poles of humanity themselves and lastly douglas guest at the head of his shining mahogany table with a huge bible before him on which rested the knuckle of one clenched hand stood gideon strong the master of feldwick hall farm it was at his bidding that these people had come together they waited now for him to speak his was no common personality neat in his dress precise though local with a curious mixture of dialects in his speech he was feared by every man in feldwick whether he stood over them labouring or prayed amongst them in the little chapel where every sunday he took the principal place he was well setup for all his unusual height and seventy years with a face as hard as the ancient rocks which jutted from the cumberland hillside eyes as keen and grey and merciless as though every scrap of humanity which might ever have lain behind them had long since died out just he reckoned himself and just he may have been but neither man nor woman nor child had ever heard a kindly word fall from his lips children ran indoors as he passed women ceased their gossiping men slunk away from a friendly talk as though ashamed if ever at harvest or christmas time the spirit of good fellowship warmed the hearts of these country folk and loosened their tongues the grim presence of gideon strong was sufficient to check their merriment and send them silently apart he had been known to pray that sinners might meet with the punishment they deserved both in this world and hereafter such was gideon strong  he cleared his throat and spoke addressing the young man who sat on the corner of the horsehair sofa where the shadows of the room were darkest  nephew douglas he said today you ha come to mans estate and i ha summoned those here who will have to do wi your future to hear these few words the charge of you left on my shoulders by your shiftless parents has been a heavy one but today i am quit of it the deacons of feldwick chapel have agreed to appoint you their pastor provided only that they be satisfied wi your discourse on the coming sabbath see to it lad that ee preach the word as these good men and mysen have ever heard it let there be no newfangled ideas in thy teachings and be not vain of thy learning for therein is vanity and trouble dost understand i understand the young man answered slowly and without enthusiasm  learning and godliness are little akin said john magee in his thin treble see to it lad that thou choosest the one which is of most account  ay ay echoed the shepherd thickly ay ay douglas guest answered nothing a sudden light had flashed in his dark eyes and his lips had parted but almost at the same moment gideon strong stretched out his hand  nephew douglas he said i am becoming an old man and today i will release myself from the burden of your affairs once and for all this is the woman my daughter joan whom i have chosen to wife for thee take her hand and let thy word be pledged to her  if silence still reigned in that gloomy apartment it was because there were those present whom surprise had deprived of speech the very image of her father joan looked steadily into her cousins face without tremor or nervousness her features were shapely enough but too large and severe for a woman her wealth of black hair was brushed fiat back from her forehead in uncompromising ugliness her figure was as straight as a dart but without lines or curves her gown of homely stuff and illmade completed her unattractiveness there was neither blush nor tremor nor any sign of softening in her cold eyes then douglas in whom were already sown the seeds of a passionate discontent with the narrowing lines of his unlovely life who on the hillside and in the sweet night solitudes had taken shelley to his heart had lived with keats and had felt his pulses beat thickly to the passionate love music of tennyson stood silent and unresponsive child of charity he might be but the burden of his servitude was fast growing too heavy for him so he stood there whilst the old mans eyes flashed like steel and joans face in her silent anger seemed to grow into the likeness of her fathers  dost hear nephew douglas take her hands in thine and thank thy god who has sent thee a pauper and a youth of illparentage a daughter of mine for wife  then the young man found words though they sounded to him and to the others faint and unimpressive  uncle he said there has been no word of this nor any thought of it between joan and myself i am not old enough to marry nor have i the inclination  terrible was the look flashed down upon him from those relentless eyesfierce too the words of his reply measured and slow although they were  there is no need for words between thee and joan choose between my bidding and the outside o my doors this night and for ever  even then he might have won his freedom like a man but the old dread was too deeply engrafted the chains of servitude which he and the whole neighbourhood wore were too heavy to be thrown lightly aside so he held out his hand and joans fingers passive and cold lay for a moment in his the old man watched without any outward sign of satisfaction  thou ha chosen well nephew douglas he said with marvellous but quite unconscious irony i reckon too that we ha chosen well to elect you our pastor thou wilt have two pounds a week and bailiff morrisons cottage neighbour magee there is a sup o ale and some tea in the kitchen  john magee and william bull betrayed the first signs of real interest they had exhibited in the proceedings one by one they all filed out of the room save douglas guest and joan cicely had flitted away with the first they two were alone he wondered with a grim sense of the humour of the thing whether she was expecting any lovemaking to follow upon so strange an engagement he looked curiously at her there was no change in her face nor any sign of softening  i hope you will believe joan he said taking up a book and looking for his place that i knew nothing of this and that i am not in any way responsible for it  her face seemed to darken as she rose and moved towards the door  i am sure of that she said stiffly i do not blame you                                      up into the purer finer air of the hillsup with a lightening heart though still carrying a bitter burden of despondency night rested upon the hilltops and brooded in the valleys below the shadowy landscape lay like blurred patchworkstill he climbed upwards till feldwick lay silent and sleeping at his feet and a flavour of the sea mingled with the night wind which cooled his cheeks then douglas guest threw himself breathless amongst the bracken and gazed with eager eyes downwards  if she should not come he murmured i must speak to some one or i shall go mad  deeper fell the darkness until the shape of the houses below was lost and only the lights were visible such a tiny little circle they seemed he watched them with swelling heart was this to be the end of his dreams then bailiff morrisons cottage two pounds a week and joan for his wife he who had dreamed of fame of travel in distant countries of passing some day into the elect of those who had written their names large in the book of life his heart swelled in passionate revolt even though he might be a pauper though he owed his learning and the very clothes in which he stood to gideon strong had any man the right to demand so huge a sacrifice he had spoken his mind and his wishes only to be crushed with cold contempt today his answer had been given what was it that gideon strong had said i have fed you and clothed you and taught you i have kept you from beggary and made you what you are now as my right i claim your future thus and thus shall it be i have spoken  he walked restlessly to and fro upon the windy hilltop a sense of freedom possessed him always upon these heights the shackles of gideon strong fell away food and clothing and education these were great things to owe but life was surely a greater and life he owed to no man livingonly to god was it a thing which he dared misusefritter helplessly away in this timeforgotten corner of the earth life surely was a precious loan to be held in trust to be made as full and deep and fruitful a thing as a mans energy and talent could make it to gideon strong he owed much but it was a debt which surely could be paid in other ways than this  he stopped short a light footstep close at hand startled then thrilled him it was cicelyhatless breathless with the climb and very fair to see in the faint halflights for cicely though she was gideon strongs daughter was not of feldwick or feldwick ways nor were her gowns simple though they were fashioned by a village dressmaker she had lived all her life with distant relatives near london douglas had never seen her till two months ago and her coming had been a curious break in the life at the farm  he moved quickly to meet her for a moment their hands met then she drew away  how good of you cicely he cried i felt that i must talk to some one or go mad  she stood for a moment recovering her breathher bosom rising and falling quickly under her dark gown a pink flush in her cheeks her hair fair and inclined to curliness had escaped bounds a little and she brushed it impatiently back  i must only stay for a moment douglas she said gravely let us go down the hill by the beacon we shall be on the way home  they walked side by side in silence neither of them were wholly at their ease a new element had entered into their intercourse the wonderfully free spirit of comradeship which had sprung up between them since her coming and which had been so sweet a thing to him was for the moment at least interrupted  i want you to tell me douglas she said at last exactly how much of a surprise today has been to you  it is easily done he answered last night i went to your father i tried to thank him as well as i was able for all that he has done for me i then told him that with every respect for his wishes i did not feel myself prepared at present to enter the ministry i showed him my diplomas and told him of my degrees i told him what i wishedto become a schoolmaster for a year or two at any rate well he listened to me in fixed silence when i had finished he asked is that all i said yes and he turned his back upon me your future is already provided for douglas he said i will speak to you of it tomorrow then he walked away that is all the warning i had  and what about joan  his face flushed hotly  no word from him nor any hint of such a thing has ever made me think of joan in such a connection i should have been less surprised if the ceiling had fallen in upon us  she looked at him and nodded gravely  well she said our oracle has spoken what are you going to do  i am going to ask for your advice first he said  then you must tell me just how you feel she said  he drew a long breath  there are so many things he said speaking softly and half to himself last week cicely i took a compass and a stick and i walked across the hills to rydal mount where wordsworth lived when i came back i think that i was quite content to spend all my days here it is such a beautiful world some day when you have lived here longer you will know what i meanthe bondage will fall upon you too the mountains with their tops hidden in soft blue mist the winds blowing across the waste places the wild flowers springing up in unexpected corners the little streams tearing down the hillside to flow smoothly like a belt of beautiful ribbon through the pasture land below the love which comes for these things cicely is a strange haunting thing you cannot escape from it it is a sort of bondage the winds seem to tune themselves to your thoughts the sunlight laughs away your depression listen do you hear the sheepbells from behind the hill there isnt that music then the twilight and the darkness if you are on the hilltop they seem to steal down like a world of soothing shadows everything that is dreary and sad seems to die away everywhere is a beautiful effortless peace cicely i came back from that tramp and i felt content with my lot content to live amongst these country folk speak to them simply once a week of the god of mysteries and spend my days wandering about this little corner of the world beautiful  men have lived such lives she said quietly and found happiness  ay but there is the other side he continued quickly sometimes it seems as though the love for these things is a beautiful delusion a maddening unreal thing then i know that my god is not their god that my thoughts would be heresy to them i feel that i want to cast off the strange passionate love for the place which holds me here to go out into the world and hold my place amongst my fellows cicely surely where men do great works where men live and die that is the proper place for man i have no right to fritter away a life in the sensuous delight of moving amongst beautiful places i want to come into touch with my kind to feel the pulse of humanity to drink the whole cup of life with its joys and sorrows contemplation should be the end of lifeits evening not its morning  douglas she cried you are right you know that you have power out into the world and use it oh if i were you if i were a man i would not hesitate for a moment  his hand fell upon her shoulder he pointed downwards  how far am i bound he asked hoarsely to do your fathers bidding  the glow passed from her cheeks she moved imperceptibly away from him  douglas she said it is of that i came to speak to you tonight you know that i have a brother who is eternally banished from home whose life i honestly believe my fathers severity has ruined i saw him in london not long ago and he sent a message to you it is very painful for me to even think of it douglas for i always believed my father to be a just man he has let you believe that you were a pauper my brother told me that it was not truethat there was plenty of money for your education and that there should be some to come to you there i have told you you must go to my father and ask him for the truth  he was silent for a moment it was a strange thing to hear  if this is true he said it is freedom  freedom she repeated and glided away from him whilst he stood there dreaming    chapter iii  the man who was in a hurry  he lay back in a corner seat of the carriage panting whitefaced exhausted his clumsy boots studded with nails were wet and his frayed black trousers were splashed with mud in his eyes was the light of vivid fear his delicate mouth was twitching still with excitement in his ears there rang yet the angry cry of the guard the shouting of porters the excitement of that leap through the hastilyopened carriage door tingled yet in his veins before his eyes there was a mist he was conscious indeed that the carriage which he had marked out as being empty was tenanted by a single person but he had not even glanced across towards the occupied seat what mattered it so long as they were off already the fields seemed flying past the window and the telegraph posts had commenced their frantic race ten twenty forty miles an hour at leastoff on that wonderful run the pride of the directors and the despair of rival companies nothing could stop them now all slower traffic stood aside to let them pass the express with her two great engines vomiting fire and smoke crawling across the map flying across bridges and through tunnels from the heart of the country to the great city gradually and with the exhilaration of their ever increasing speed the courage of the man revived and the blood flowed once more warmly through his veins he lifted his head and looked around him  shock the first came when he realised that he was in a firstclass carriage shock the second when he saw that his solitary companion was a lady he took in the details of her appearance and surroundingswonderful enough to him who had been brought up in a cottage and to whom the ways and resources of luxury were all unknown every seat save the one which he occupied was covered with her belongings on one was a halfopened dressingcase filled with goldtopped bottles and emitting a faint delicate perfume on another was a pile of books and magazines opposite to him a sablelined coat by his side a luncheon basket and long hunting flask then his eyes were caught by an oblong strip of paper pasted across the carriage windowhe read it backwardsengaged what an intrusion he looked towards the woman with stammering words of apology upon his lipsbut the words died away he was tonguetied  he had met the languid gaze of her dark full eyes a little supercilious a little amused faintly curious and his own fell at once before their calm insolence she was handsomely dressed the delicate white hand which held her novel was ablaze with many and wonderful rings she was evidently tall without doubt stately her black hair parted in the middle drooped a little to the side by her ears her complexion delightfully clear was of a curious ivory pallor unassociated with illhealth she regarded him through a pair of ivoryhandled lorgnettes which she carelessly closed as he looked towards her  will you tell me she asked quietly why you have entered my carriage which is engagedand in such an extraordinary manner  he drew a little breath he had never heard a voice like it beforesoft musical and with the slightest suggestion of a foreign accent then he remembered that she was waiting for an answer he began his apology  i am sorryindeed i am very sorry i had no time to look inside and i thought it was an empty carriagea thirdclass one too it was very stupid  you appeared to be she remarked in a hurry  the faint note of humour in her tone passed undetected by him  i wanted to get away he said i had walked fourteen miles and there was no other train i am very sorry to intrude upon you the train was moving when i reached the platform and i jumped  she shrugged her shoulders slightly and raised her book once more but from over its top she found herself watching very soon this strange travelling companion of hers the trousers above his clumsy boots were frayed and muddy his black clothes were shiny and antiquated in cutthese and his oddlyarranged white tie somehow suggested the cleric but when she reached his face her eyes lingered there it puzzled and in a sense attracted her his features were cleanly cut and prominent his complexion was naturally pale but wind and sun had combined to stain his cheeks with a slight healthy tan his eyes were deepset keen and bright the eyes of a visionary perhaps but afire now with the instant excitement of living a strange face for a man of his apparently humble origin whence had he come and where was he going the vision of his face as he had leaped into the carriage floated again before her eyes surely behind him were evil things before himwhat she took up her novel again but laid it down almost immediately you are going she asked to london  to london he repeated dreamily yes  but your luggagewas that left behind  he smiled  i have no luggage he said you are going up for the day only she hazarded  he shook his head there was a note of triumph almost in his tone  i am going for good he said if wishes count for anything i shall never set foot within this county again  there was a story she felt sure connected with this strange fellowpassenger of hers she watched him thoughtfully a human document such as this was worth many novels it was not the first time that he had excited her interest  london she said is a wonderful place for young men  he turned a rapt face towards her the fire seemed leaping out of his eyes  others have found it so he said i go to prove their words  you are a stranger there then  i have never been further south than this in my life he replied i know only the london of de quincey and lamblondon with the halo of romance around it  she sighed gently  you will find it all so different she said you will be bitterly disappointed  he set his lips firmly together  i have no fear he said i shall find it possible to live there at any rate if i stayed where i was i must have gone mad  you are going to friends she asked  he laughed softly  i have not a friend in the world he said in london i do not know a soul what matter there is life to be lived there prizes to be won there is room for every one  she half closed her eyes watching him keenly all the time with an interest which was certainly not diminished  london is a wonderful city she said but she is not always kind to the stranger you have spoken of de quincey who wove fairy fancies about her and lamb who was an affectionate stayathome a born dweller in cities they were dreamers both these men what about chatterton  an unhappy exception he said if only he had lived a few months longer his sorrows would have been over  today she said there are many chattertons who must die before the world will listen to them are you going to take your place amongst them  he smiled confidently  not i he answered i shall work with my hands if men will have none of my brains indeed he continued turning towards her with a swift transfiguring smile i am not a village prodigy going to london with a pocketful of manuscripts dont think that of me i am going to london because i have been stifled and chokedi want room to breathe to see men and women who live oh you dont know the sort of place i have come fromthe brain poison of it the hideous sameness and narrowness of it all  tell me a little she said and why at last you made up your mind to leave it is not so long you know since i saw you in somewhat different guise  a quick shiver seemed to pass through him underneath his tanned skin he was paler and the blood in his veins was cold his eyes fixed upon the flying landscape were set in a fixed unseeing staresurely the fields were peopled with evil memories and faces in the trees were mocking him so he remained for several moments as though in the grip of a nightmare and the lady watched him there was a little tragedy then behind  there was a man once he said who drew a line through his life and said to himself that everything behind it concerned some other personnot him so with me such memories as i have i shall strangle today i commence a new life  she sighed  ones past she said is not always so easily to be disposed of there are ghosts which will haunt us and sometimes the ghosts are living figures  let them come to me he murmured and my fingers shall be upon their throats i want no such legacies  she shook her head slowly  ghosts she said with a faint smile are sometimes very difficult people to deal with    chapter iv  exit mr douglas guest  through the heart of england the express tore onthrough town and country underneath the earth and across high bridges all the while the man and the woman talked to him she was a revelation every moment of his life had been spent in a humdrum seclusionevery moment of hers seemed to have been lived out to its limit in those worlds of which he had barely even dreamed she was older than he had thought herthirty perhaps or thirtyoneand her speech and gestures every now and then had a foreign flavour she talked to him of countries which he had scarcely dared hope to visit and of men and women whose names were as household words she spoke of them with an ease and familiarity which betokened close acquaintancetalking to him with a mixture of kindness and reserve as if he were some strange creature who had had the good fortune to interest her for the moment but from whom at any time she might draw aloof every word she spoke he hung upon he had come out into the world to seek for adventuresnot indeed in the spirit of the modern don quixote tingling only for new sensations to stimulate but with the more robust and breezy spirit of his ancestors seeking for a fuller life and a healthy excitement even at the cost of hard blows and many privations surely this was an auspicious startan adventure this indeed during a momentary silence she looked across at him with genuine curiosity her eyes half closed her brows knitted what enthusiasm she was not a vain woman and she knew that her personality had little if anything to do with the flush upon his cheeks and the bright light in his eyes she herself a much travelled a learned a brilliant even a famous woman had become only lately conscious of a certain jaded weariness in her outlook upon life even the best had begun to pall the sameness of it had commenced its fatal work more than once lately a touch of that heart languor which is the fruit of surfeit had startled her by its numbing and depressing effect here at last was a new typea man with clean pages before himyoung emotional without a doubt intellectual but for his awful clothes he was well enough to look upon he had no affectations his instincts were apparently correct his manners were hoydenish but there was nothing of the clown about him she asked him a direct question concerning himself  tell me she said what you really are a worker a studentor have you a trade  he flushed up to his brows  i was brought up he said in a low tone for the ministry it was no choice of mine i had an uncle and guardian who ruled our household as he ruled everybody and everything with which he came in contact  she was puzzled to her the word sounded political  the ministry  yes you remember when you first saw me it was my first appearance i was to have been chosen pastor of that church  oh  she looked at him now with something like amazement this then accounted for the sombreness of his clothes and his little strip of white tie she had only the vaguest ideas as to the conduct of those various sects to be met with in english villages but she had certainly believed that the post of preacher was filled indifferently by any member of the congregation and she had looked upon his presence in the pulpit on that last sunday as an accident to associate him with such an occupation permanently seemed to her little short of the ridiculous she laughed softly showing for the first time her brilliantly white teeth and his cheeks were stained with scarlet  i do not know why you laugh he said with a note of fierceness in his tone it is the part of my life which is behind me i was brought up to it and traditions are hard to break away from i have been obliged to live in a little village to constrain my life between the narrowest limits to watch ignorance and suffer prejudices as deeply rooted as the hills but all the same it is nothing to laugh at the thing itself is great and good enoughit is the people who are so hopeless no there is nothing to laugh at he cried with a sudden little burst of excitement but may god help the children whose eyes he has opened and who yet have to pass their lives on the smallest treadmill of the world  you she whispered have escaped  i have escaped he murmured with a sudden pallor but not scatheless  there was a silence between them then she recognised that she had made a mistake in questioning him about a past which he had already declared hateful the terror of an hour or more ago was in his face again he was back amongst the shadows whence she had beckoned him she yawned and took up her book  they stopped at a great station but the man was in a brown study and scarcely moved his head an angry guard came hurrying up to the window but a few words from the lady and a stealthily opened purse worked wonders they were left undisturbed and the train glided off she laid down her book and spoke again  do you mind passing me my luncheon basket she said and opening that flask of wine are you not hungry too  he shook his head but when he came to think of it he knew that he was ravenous she passed him sandwiches as a matter of coursesuch sandwiches as he had never eaten beforeand wine which was strange to him and which ran through his veins like warm magic once more the load of evil memories seemed to pass away from him he was not so much at ease eating and drinking with her but she easily acquired her former hold upon him she herself whose appetite was assumed watched him and wondered more and more  suddenly there came an interruption the shrill whistling of the engine the shutting off of steam the violent application of the brake the train came to a standstill the man put down the window and looked out  what is it she asked with admirable nonchalance making no effort to leave her seat  i think that there has been an accident to some one he said i will go and see  she nodded  come back and tell me she said myself i shall not look i am not fond of horrors  she took up her book and he jumped down upon the line and made his way to where a little group of men were standing in a circle some one turned away with white face as he approached and stopped him  dont lookfor gods sake dont look he said its too awful it isnt fit fetch a tarpaulin some one  was he run over some one asked threw himself from that carriage the guard answered moving his head towards a thirdclass compartment of which the door stood open he was dragged half a mile andthere isnt much left of him poor devil he added with a little break in his speech  does any one know who he was the young man asked  no onenor where he got in  no luggage  none  the young man set his teeth and moved towards the carriage his hand stole for a moment to his pocket then he seemed to pick something up from the dusty floor  heres a card he said to the guard on the seat where he was  the man took it and spelt the name out  mr douglas guest he said well we shall know who he was at any rate its lucky you found it sir now well get on if you please  a tarpaulincovered burden was carefully deposited in an empty carriage and the little troop of people melted away she looked up from her book as he entered  well  it was an accident or a suicide he said gravely a man threw himself from an empty carriage in front and was run over it was a horrible affair  do they know who he was she asked  there was a card found near him he answered mr douglas guest that was his name  was it his fancy or did she look at him for a moment more intently during the momentary silence which followed his speech it must have been his fancy yet her next words puzzled him  you have not told me yet she said your own name i should like to know it  he hesitated for a moment his own name a name to be keptto live and die underthe hall mark of his new identity how poor his imagination was never an inspiration and she was watching him there was so much in a name and he must find one swiftly for mr douglas guest was dead  my name is jesson he saiddouglas jesson    chapter v  how the address was lost  and now the end of that journey never altogether forgotten by either of them was close at hand tunnels became more frequent the green fields gave way to an interminable waste of houses the gloom of the autumn afternoon was deepened the speed of the train decreased the heart of douglas jesson beat fast with anticipation for now indeed he was near the end of his journey the beginning of his new life what matter that the outlook from where he sat was dreary enough beyond there was a glow in the sky beyond was an undiscovered world he was young and he came fresh to the fight the woman who watched him wondered  will you tell me she said now that you are in london what will you do you have money perhaps or will you work  money he laughed gaily at first but with a chill shiver immediately afterwards yes he had money for the moment he had forgotten it  i have a small sum he said just sufficient to last me until i begin to earn some  and you will earn moneyhow  with my pen i hope he answered simply i have sent several stories to the ibex one they accepted but it has not appeared yet  to make money by writing in london is very difficult they say she remarked  everything in life is difficult he answered confidently i am prepared for disappointment at first in the end i have no fears  she handed him a card from her dressingcase  will you come and see me she asked  thank you he answered hesitatingly i will come when i have made a start  i know a great many people who are literary including the editor of the ibex she said i think if you came that i could help you  he shook his head  the narrow way for me he answered smiling i am very anxious for success but i want to win it myself  her face was clouded  you are a foolish boy she said believe me that i am offering you the surest path to success london is full of young men with talent and most days they go hungry  he stood up and though she was annoyed the fire in his eyes was good to look upon  i must take my place with them he said whatever my destiny may be i shall find it  the final tunnel and they were gliding into the station alongside the platform a tall footman threw open the door of the carriage and a ladys maid with a jewel case in her hand stared at him with undisguised curiosity the lady bade him goodbye kindly yet with a note of final dismissal in her tone he had occupied her time for an hour or two and saved her from absolute boredom the matter was ended there nevertheless from a quiet corner of the station he watched her stand listlessly on the platform while her things were being collecteda tall distinguished looking figure and very noticeable amongst the motley crowd who were streaming from the train once he fancied that her eyes strayed along the way by which he had left a moment later she was accosted by a man who had just driven into the station she seemed to greet him without enthusiasm he on the other hand was obviously welcoming her warmly he too was tall carefully dressed and well groomed middle aged a type he supposed of the men of her world there was a few minutes conversation then they moved across the platform to the carriage which was drawn up waiting he handed her in lingering hat in hand for a moment as though hoping for an invitation to follow her which however did not come the carriage drove off passing the spot where douglas had lingered and it seemed to him that her eyes gazing languidly out of the window met his and that she started forward in her seat as though to call to him but the carriage received no summons to stop it rolled out of the station and turned westwards douglas turned and followed it on foot                                      he walked at first very much like a man in a dream quite heedless as to direction even without any fixed purpose before him here he was arrived after all at the first stage in his new life he was a free man a living unit in this streaming horde of humanity of his old life the most pleasant memory which survived was the loneliness of the hills and moorland high above his village home here he had spent whole nights with nothing but the wind and the stars and the distant sheep bells to keep him company here he had woven many dreams of this future which lay now actually within his grasp he had stolen up the mountain path whilst the little village lay sleeping and watched the shadows pass across the hills and the darkness steal softly down upon the landscape stretched out like patchwork below then with the night and the absence of all human sounds had come that sweet and mystical sense of loneliness which had so often brought him peace at a time when the smallness of the days events and the tyranny of his home life had filled him with bitterness it was here that courage had come to him to plan out his emancipation here that he had fed his brain with sweet but forbidden fruits something of that delicious loneliness was upon him now he was a wanderer in a new world what matter though the streets were squalid and the men and women against whom he brushed were for the most part poorly dressed and ill looking he was free even his identity was gone douglas guest was dead and with his past douglas jesson had nothing to do  he wandered on asking no questions perfectly content the great city expanded before him streets became wider carriages were more frequent the faces of the people grew more cheerful he laughed softly to himself from sheer lightness of heart from down a side street he came into the strand and here for the first time he noticed that he himself was attracting some attention then he remembered his clothes shabby enough but semiclerical and he walked boldly into a large readymade clothing establishment where everything was marked in plain figures and where layfigures of gentlemen with waxy faces attired in the height of fashion were gazing blandly out into the world from behind a huge plateglass window he bought a plain blue serge suit and begged leave to change in the tryingon room half an hour later he walked out again with his own clothes done up in a bundle feeling that his emancipation was now complete  the lights of waterloo bridge attracted him and he turned down before them from one of the parapets he had his first view of the thames he leaned over gazing with fascinated eyes at the ships below dimly seen now through the gathering darkness at the black waters in which flashed the reflection of the long row of lamps the hugeness of the hotels on the embankment all afire with brilliant illuminations almost took away his breath whilst he lingered there big ben boomed out the hour of six and he realised with beating heart that those must be the houses of parliament across on the other side a cold breeze came up and blew in his face but he scarcely heeded it it was the mother river which flowed beneath himthe greatest of the worlds cities into which he had come a wanderer yet at heart one of her sons now at last he was in touch with his kind oh what a welcome presenthow gladly he realised that henceforth he must date his life from that day he lifted his parcel cautiously to the ledge and waited for a moment there was no one looking now was his time he let it go and heard the muffled splash as it fell upon the water not until it had slipped from his fingers and gone beyond recovery did he realise that the card which she had given him was carefully tucked away in the breast pocket of the coat he knew neither her name nor where to look for her    chapter vi  the young man from the country hears some news  i say mister  douglas started round cramped with his long lingering against the stone wall a girl was standing by his side there were roses in her hat and a suspicion of powder upon her cheeks  were you speaking to me he asked hesitatingly  she laughed shortly  no one else within earshot that i know of she answered i saw you throw that parcel over  i was just wishing he remarked that i could get it back  well you are a mug to chuck it over and then want it back i guess its lost now anyway unless the river police find itand that aint likely is it  i should think not he answered gravely good evening he would have moved away but she stopped him come thats not good enough she said in a harder tone you aint going to bluff me what was in that parcel eh  he looked at her in surprise  i dont quite see how it concerns you anyway he said but i dont know that i mind telling you that it contained a suit of clothes  your own  yes  what have you been up to  i am afraid i dont understand you he said  oh rot people dont sneak their clothes over into the river for nothing what are you going to stand me not to tell that bobby eh  i really dont care whether you do or not he answered i had a reason for wanting to get rid of my clothes but i am afraid you wouldnt understand it  well well try the bobby then she said theres a horrible murder this morning on the placards how do i know that youre not the chap it looks suspicious when you come out in a new suit of clothes and throw the old ones into the river anyway the bobby would want to ask you a few questions about it  well you can try him then douglas answered ill wait here while you fetch him  the girl laughedit was not a pleasant sound  whered you be by the time id brought him id like to know she remarked never mind i see you aint likely to part with a lot stand us a drink and i wont tell a soul  i would rather not thanks douglas said ill give you the money for one  she looked at him angrily  too much of a toff eh no you can keep your money youll come along and have one with me or ill tell the bobby  douglas hesitated he thought for a moment of de quinceys ann wandering out of the mists to cross the bridge with weary footsteps and turned towards the girl with a courtesy which was almost tenderness  i will come with you if you like he said only  the girl laughed hardly  all right well go to the cross the port wines a1 there you a londoner she added as they turned towards the strand  he shook his head  i have never been in london before today he answered  more fool you to come then she said shortly you dont look like a cockney i guess youre a gentleman arent yourun away from home or something  i have come to live in london he said evasively i have always wanted to  she shook her head  youd better have stopped away you are young and you look good youll be neither long ugh here we are  he stepped aside and let her pass in first through the swing doors she led the way into what was called a private bar they sat in cushioned chairs and douglas gave his order mechanically a few feet away with only a slim partition between them was the general room full of men the tinkle of glasses and hum of conversation grew louder and louder it was a cold evening and a busy time douglas sipped his wine in silence the girl opposite was humming a tune and beating time with her foot she was watching him covertly but not unkindly  hell be caught right enough they even know is name serve im right too for it was an orrible murder    douglas guest  douglas started suddenly in his chair a cry upon his lips his eyes almost starting from his head the girls gloved hand was pressed against his mouth and the cry was stifled afterwards he remembered all his life the smell of patchouli or some cheap scent which assailed him at her near presence  hush she whispered dont be a silly fool  he sat back in his chair pale to the lips trembling in every limb the mirrors the rows of glasses the cushioned seats seemed flying round there was a buzzing in his ears again she rose and poured wine down his throat  sit still she said hoarsely youll be all right in a moment  the whole story in disconnected patches came floating in to them he heard it gripping all the while the sides of his chair struggling with a deadly faintness she too listened watching him carefully all the time lest he should call out in their corner they were scarcely to be seen even from the bar and she had moved her seat a little so as to wholly shield him it sounded bad enough an old man over sixty a farmer living in a northern village had been found in his bedroom dead by his side was a rifled cash box there had been the best part of a hundred pounds there all of which was gone there were no signs of any one having broken in but a young man named douglas guest an inmate of the house and a distant relative was missing the thing was clear enough  another voice chimed inits owner possessed a later edition only that night there had been a violent quarrel between the dead man and this douglas guest concerning money guest had been seen to enter the london train secretly at the nearest large station his arrest was only a matter of a few hours the police knew exactly where to put their hands upon him a description followed the girl and her companion exchanged stealthy glances  the buzz of voices continued covering douglas all she could the girl called for more wine the barmaid seeing his pale face nodded across towards him  your friend dont look well she said  had too much yesterday the girl answered promptly he was fairly on the do and he aint strong hell be all right when he gets a drop of this inside him  the barmaid nodded and turned away the girl made him drink and then roused him  can you walk she said shortly were best away from here  he nodded  yes  she rose and paid for the last drinks he followed her out on to the pavement and stood there dazed almost helpless she looked at him critically  come pull yourself together she said youve had a bit of a knock i guess but you dont want to advertise yourself here now listen youd best get some quiet lodging and lie low for a bit i dont know anything and i dont want to know anything but its pretty clear youre keeping out of the way im not going to take you down my way for one thing you aint exactly that sort i should say and for another the coppers are on to us like hot bricks when any ones wanted do you know london at all  i was never here before this evening he answered in a low tone  she looked at him critically  youre a bit of a green un she said bluntly you dont need to go giving yourself away like that you know come along im going to take you out to a quiet part thatll do for you as well as anywhere  he walked by her side passively once he stopped and bought an evening paper and under the next gas lamp he read a certain paragraph through carefully she waited for him without remark he folded the paper up after a minute or two and rejoined her side by side they threaded their way along pall mall across the park and southwards a walk which an hour or two ago would have filled him with wonder and delight he undertook now with purely mechanical movements and unseeing eyes when they reached chelsea she paused  look here she said are you feeling all right now  he nodded  i am quite myself again he said steadily i am much obliged to you for looking after me you are very kind  he drew some gold pieces hesitatingly from his pocket she motioned him to replace them  i dont want any money thanks she said now listen that street there is all lodginghouses go and get a room and lie quiet for a bit theyre used to odd folk down here and you look like a painter or a writer say youre an actor out of a job or anything that comes handy  thank you he said i understand  she turned away  good night then  good night  he heard something that sounded like a sob and the quick rustling of skirts he turned round she was by the cornerout of sight already at the bottom of the street was the glitter of a gas lamp reflected from the walk he walked down and found himself on chelsea embankment he made his way to the wall with the gold which she had refused still in his hand and without hesitation threw the coins far out into the river then he looked around there was not a soul in sight he drew a handful of money from his pocket and flung it awaya little shower of gold flashing brightly in the gaslight for a moment he went through his pockets carefully and found an odd half sovereign and some silver away they went then he moved back to a seat and closed his eyes    chapter vii  a night in helland next day  there are few men douglas had once read who have not spent one night of their lives in hell when morning came he knew that he at least was amongst the majority sleep had never once touched his eyelidshis most blessed respite had been a few moments of deadly stupor when the red fires had ceased to play before his eyes and the old mans upturned face had faded away into the chill mists yet when at last he rose he asked himself with a sudden passionate eagerness whether after all it might not have been a terrible dream he gazed around eagerly looking for a latticed window with dimity curtains a blue papered wall hung with texts and a low beamed ceiling alas before him was a whiteshrouded river around him a wilderness of houses and a long row of faintlyburning lights stretched from where he sat all along the curving embankment he was wearing unfamiliar clothes and a doubledup newspaper was in his pockets it was all true then the flight across the moor the strange ride to town the wild exhilaration of spirits and the dull crushing blow the girl with the rosesah she had been with himhad brought him here he remembered the look in her eyes when she had refused his money at least he had ridded himself of that he tried to stretch himself he was stiff and sore all over his head was throbbing like a steam engine and he sank back upon the seat in the throes of a cold ghastly sickness he remembered then that he had not touched food for hours he remembered too that he had not a penny in the world  for an hour or more he lay there partially unconscious physically he was almost unable to movehis brain however was gradually clearing after all perhaps the boldest course was the safest he would go and say here am i douglas guestwhat do you want with me it is true that i took money from the old man but it was my own as to his death what do i know of that who heard me threaten him who saw me strike him there is no one  he staggered up to his feet the morning had come now and people had begun to stir a few market waggons went rumbling by there were milkcarts in the streets and sleepylooking servants in print dresses were showing their heads above the area steps douglas moved on with unsteady footsteps he passed a policeman who looked at him curiously and of whom he felt more than half inclined to ask the way to the nearest policestation then walked up into the square where before him hung a red lamp from a tall red brick house with barred windows he peered in at the window a fat sergeant was sitting at the table yawning the walls were hung with police bills the room itself was the quintessence of discomfort the place repelled him strongly he did not like the look of the sergeant nor his possible quarters after all why need he hurry the day was young and it was very unlikely that he would be recognised he strolled away with his hands in his pockets lighterhearted with every step which took him away from those barred windows  across the square a fat little man was making strenuous efforts to remove the shutter from in front of his shop he looked round as douglas appeared wiping the perspiration from his forehead and regarded him doubtfully  will yer lend us a hand guvnor he inquired  douglas was willing enough and between them the job was soon finished the little man who was a confectioner explained that he had an assistant who came from a distance and whose laziness was most phenomenal after this morning however his services would be dispensed with for once he had gone a little too far eight oclock and no sign of him it was monstrous the little man produced a few coppers and glanced towards douglas with some hesitation  douglas laughed softly  i dont want any money thanks he said but if i could beg a piece of bread or cake im really hungry  the little man nodded and hastened into the shop douglas followed him  if youd care for a cup of milk he remarked taking a tin from the door handle we can manage it no tea yet im afraid  i should enjoy the milk very much if you can spare it  he made a curious meal a little hysterical but stronger at every mouthful the little man watched him covertly  like a wash he inquired  rather douglas answered after all it was a good start for the day  he walked out of the shop a quarter of an hour later a new man spruce and clean smoking a cigarette and with the terrors of the night far behind him the cold water had been like a sweet keen tonic to him the cobwebs had gone from his brain memory had returned what a fool he had been there was no such person as douglas guest douglas guest was dead what need for him to fear  the greatest desire he had now was for a morning newspaper but though he tried every pocket several times over he was absolutely penniless then he thought of the free librariesa sudden and delightful inspiration a policeman directed him he entered a handsome building and being early had his choice of the great dailies neatly cut and arranged upon rollers for him one by one he read them through with feverish interest and when he set them down he laughed softly to himself there was not one of them which did not chronicle the death of douglas guest on the midland express and refer to him as the person wanted for the feldwick murder so he was safe after all the press had made it clearer than ever douglas guest was dead henceforth he need have no fear  he moved to the tables where the reviews and magazines were and spent a pleasant hour or two amongst them he planned out a new story saw his way to a satirical article upon a popular novel thought of an epigram and walked out into the street a few minutes before one with something of the old exhilaration of spirits dancing through his veins his condition of absolute poverty had not yet lost the flavour of novelty he even laughed as he realised that again he was hungry and must rely upon chance for a meal this time there was no fat confectioner to play the good samaritan but by chance he passed a pawnbrokers shop and with a little cry of triumph he dragged a fat yellowfaced silver watch from his pocket and stepped blithely inside he found it valued at much less than he had expected but he attempted no bargaining he walked out again into the street a man of means there were silver coins in his pocketenough to last him for a couple of days at least it was unexpected fortune  he bought some tobacco and cigarette papers and rolled himself a cigarette then he stepped out in the direction of the strand where he imagined the restaurants mostly lay he passed st jamess palace up st jamess street and into piccadilly for a while he forgot his hunger there was so much that was marvellous so much to admire burlington house was pointed out by a friendly policeman he passed into the courtyard where the pigeons were feeding and looked around him with admiration which was tempered almost with awe on his way out he again addressed the policeman  i want to have some lunch somewhere he said i can only spend about two shillings and i want the best i can get for the money i wonder whether you could direct me  the policeman smiled  theres only one place for you sir he said and its lucky as i can direct you there you go to spargettis in old compton street off soho square ive heard that theres no westend place to touch itand they do you the whole lot for two bob including a quarter flask of wine ive a brotherinlaw as keeps the books there and i have it from him sir that there aint such value for money in the whole country and theres this about it sir he added confidentially you can eat whats set before you it aint like some of these nasty low foreign eatingouses where you darent touch rabbit and the soup dont seem canny theres plenty like that but not spargettis youre all right there sir  douglas went off fortified with many directions and laughing heartily he found spargettis and seated himself at a tiny table in a long low room blue already with cigarette smoke they brought him such a luncheon as he had never eaten before grated macaroni in his soup watercress and oil with his chicken a curious salad and a wonderful cheese around him was the constant hum of gay conversation every one save himself seemed to have friends here and many of them it was indeed a very ordinary place a cosmopolitan eatinghouse good of its sort and with an excellent connection of lighthearted but impecunious foreigners who made up with the lightness of their spirits for the emptiness of their purses to douglas whose whole upbringing and subsequent life had been amongst the dreariest of surroundings there was something about it all peculiarly fascinating the air of pleasant abandonment the subtle aroma of gaiety allied with irresponsibility the strange food and wine well cooked and stimulating delighted him his sole desire now was for a companion if only those menartists he was sure they werewould draw him into their conversation he had plenty to say he was ready to be as merry as any of them a faint sense of loneliness depressed him for a moment as he looked from one to another of the long tables all his life he had been as one removed from his fellows he was weary of it surely it must be nearly at an end now some of the children of the great mother city would hold out their hands to him it was not alms he needed it was a friend  good morning  douglas looked up quickly a newcomer had taken the vacant place at his table    chapter viii  the author of no mans land  douglas returned his greeting cordially his visavis drew the menu towards him and studied it with interest setting it down he screwed a single eyeglass into his eye and beamed over at douglas  is the daily grind o k he inquired suavely  douglas was disconcerted at being unable to answer a question so pleasantly asked  ibeg your pardon he said doubtfully im afraid i dont quite understand  the newcomer waved his hand to some acquaintances and smiled cheerfully  i see youre a stranger here he remarked theres a tabledhote luncheon for the modest sum of eighteenpence which is the cheapest way to feed if its decent sometimes it is sometimes it isnt i thought perhaps you might have sampled it  i believe i have douglas answered i told the waiter to bring me the ordinary lunch and i thought it was very good indeed  then i will risk it henri come here you scamp  he gave a few orders to the waiter who treated him with much respect then he turned again to douglas  you have nearly finished he said please dont hurry i hate to eat alone it is a whim of mine if i eat alone i read and if i read i get dyspepsia try the oat biscuits and the camembert  douglas did as the newcomer had suggested  i am in no hurry he said i have nothing to do nor anywhere to go  lucky man  you speak as though that were unusual douglas laughed but i was just thinking that every one here seems to be in the same state some one once told me that london was a city of sadness who could watch the people here and say so  the newcomer screwed in his eyeglass and looked deliberately round the room  well he said this is a resort of the poor and the poor are seldom sad it is the unfortunate westenders who carry the burdens of wealth and the obligation of position who have earned for us the reproach of dulness here we are on the threshold of bohemia long life and health to it  he drank a glass of chianti with the air of a connoisseur tasting some rare vintage  douglas laughed softly  if the people here are poor he said what about me i pawned my watch because i had had nothing to eat since yesterday  his new friend sighed and stuck his fork into an olive  what affluence he sighed meditatively i have not possessed a watch for a year and ive only ninepence in my pocket they give me tick here foolish spargetti long may their confidence last  a companion in impecuniosity douglas looked at his neat clothes and the flower in his buttonhole and wondered  but you have the means of making money if you care to  have i the eyeglass was carefully removed the small wizened face assumed a lugubrious aspect my friend he said in a measure it is truebut such a small measure a coldblooded and unappreciative editor apprises my services at the miserable sum of three pounds a week i have heard of people who have lived upon that sum but i must confess that i never met one  you are a writer then douglas exclaimed eagerly  i am a sort of hack upon the staff of the ibex they set me down in a corner of the office and throw me scraps of work as you would bones to a dog it is not dignified but one must eat and drinknot to mention smoking permit me bythebye to offer you a cigarette and to recommend the coffee i taught spargetti how to make it myself  douglas was listening with flushed cheeks the ibex what a coincidence  you are really on the staff of the ibex he exclaimed  the other nodded  i hold exactly the position he said that i have described to you my own impression is that without me the ibex would not exist for a month that is where the editor and i differ unfortunately  it seems so odd douglas said some time ago i sent a story to the ibex and it was accepted i have been looking for it to appear every week  the shrewd little eyes twinkled into his  what was the title  no mans land douglas jesson was the name  the newcomer filled douglass glass with chianti from his own modest flask  waiter he said bring more wine my friend douglas jesson we must drink together i remember your story for i put the blue chalk on it myself and took it up to drexley it is a meeting this and we must celebrate your story will probably be used next week  douglass eyes were bright and his cheeks were flushed the flavour of living was sweet upon his palate here he was who only twelve hours ago had gone skulking in the shadows looking out upon life with terrified eyes tempted even to selfdestruction suddenly in touch once more with the things that were dear to him realising for the first time some of the dreams which had filled his brain in those long sleepless nights upon the hilltop he was a wanderer in bohemia welcomed by an older spirit surely fortune had commenced at last to smile upon him  you are on a visit here his new friend asked or have you come to london for good  for good i trust douglas answered smiling for i have burned my boats behind me  my name is rice yours i know already the other said bythebye i noticed that the postmark of your parcel was feldwick in the hills somewhere in cumberland i think have you seen the papers during the last few days  douglass left hand gripped the table and the flush of colour which the wine and excitement had brought into his cheeks faded slowly away the pleasant hum of voices the keen joy of living which a moment before had sent his blood flowing to a new music left him nevertheless he controlled himself and answered steadily  i have had nothing else to do during the last few days but read the papers  you know about the murder then  yes  mr rice was interested he passed his cigarette case across the table and called for kummel  i wonder he said did you know the man guestdouglas guest  douglas shook his head  very slightly he said i lived some distance away and they were not sociable people  murders as a rule rice continued leaning back in his chair do not interest me this one did why i dont know i hate to have reasons for everything but to me there were many interesting points about this one first now  he rattled on until his voice seemed like a far distant echo to douglas who sat with white face and averted eyes struggling hard for composure from the murder he passed on to the tragedy on the railway train  you know he said i cannot help thinking that the police were a little hasty in assuming that the man was douglas guest  an envelope was found upon him and a handkerchief with his initials douglas said looking up besides the card he was known too to have taken that train surely that was evidence enough  it seems so rice answered and yetbut never mind i see that i am boring you we will talk of something else or rather i must talk of nothing else for my time is up he added glancing at the clock when are you going to look up drexley  when is the best time to catch him douglas asked  now as easily as any rice answered come along with me and i will show you the way and arrange that he sees you  douglas stood up and ground his heel into the floor perish those hateful fearsthat fainting sense of terror douglas guest was dead for douglas jesson there was a future never more bright than now  come he said you must drink with me once waiter two more liqueurs  success rice cried lifting his glass to your interview with drexley hes not a bad chap although he has his humours  douglas drained his glass to the dregsbut he drank to a different toast the two men left the place together    chapter ix  the editor of the ibex receives a strange letter  the editor of the ibex sat at a long table in his sanctum paying some perfunctory attentions to a huge pile of letters which had come in by the afternoon mail most of them he threw on one side for his sub a few he opened himself and tossed into a basket for further attention later on it was a task which he never entered upon with much enthusiasm for he was a man who hated detail his room itself disclosed the man it was a triumph of disorder books and magazines were scattered all over the floor the proof sketch of a wonderful poster took up one side of the wall leaning against the others were sketches pictures golf clubs and huge piles of books of reference his table was a bewilderment his mantelpiece a nightmare only before him in a handsome frame of dark wood was the photograph of a woman round which a little space had been cleared there was never so much chaos but that the picture was turned where the light fell best upon it the dirt might lie thick upon every inch in the room but every morning a silk handkerchief carefully removed from the glassmounting every disfiguring speck yet the man himself seemed to have little enough sentiment about him his shoulders were broad and his head massive a shortcut beard concealed his chin but his mouth was of iron and his eyes were hard and keen he was of no more than the average stature by reason of his breadth and girth he seemed even to fall short of it which was not however the case a man not easily led or controlled a man of passions and prejudices emphatically not a man to be trifled with or ignored  in the midst of the pile of letters he came upon one at the sight of which his indifference vanished as though by magic it was a heavy square envelope a coronet upon the flap addressed to david drexley esq in a handwriting distinctly feminine he singled it out from the rest held it for a moment between his thumb and broad forefinger and then turned his chair round abandoning the rest of his correspondence as a matter of infinitesimal consequence a letter from her was by no means an everyday affair for she was a woman of caprices as who should know better than he there were weeks during which it was her pleasure to hold herself aloof from himand otherswhen the servants who denied her shook their heads to all questions and letters met with no response what should he find inside he wondered an invitation or a reproof he had tried so hard to see her lately he was in no hurry to open it he had grown to expect very little from her while it was unopened there was at least the pleasure of expectancy he traced the letters over there was the same curl of the s the same finely formed capitals the same deliberate and firm dash after the address then a thought came to him it was wednesday the night on which she often saw her friends surely this was a summons he might see her within a few hours he tore open the envelope and read  no 20 grosvenor st  wednesday  my friendso often i have bidden you find work for the young people in whom i have interested myself that my present charge upon your goodnature will doubtless seem strange to you yet i am as much in earnest now as then and for the favour of granting what i now ask i shall be equally grateful there is a young man named jesson who has sent you a story and who hopes to secure more work from you it is not my wish that he should have it at present and with regard to the work which you have already accepted please let its production be delayed as long as possible and payment for it made on the smallest possible scale you will wonder at this i know never mind do as i ask and i will explain later  that reminds me that i have seen nothing of you lately this evening i shall be at home from ten to eleven if your engagements permit of your coming to see me i may perhaps be able to take you into my confidence if you should come bring with you the manuscript of this boys story that i may judge for myself if the ibex will be the loser yours most truly  emily de reuss  drexley glanced through the letter rapidly read it again more carefully and then turned with a perplexed face to a little telephone which stood upon his table he summoned his manager an untidylooking person with crumpled hair and inkstained fingers which he seemed perpetually attempting to conceal  mr warmington is that jesson story set up the editor inquired  yes sir i understand that those were your instructions  drexley nodded  well i shall want it kept back for a bit he said you can take another story of about the same length from the accepted chest  the manager stared  weve nothing else as good he remarked you said yourself that jessons story was the best bit of work wed had in for a long time  drexley frowned and turned back to his letters  never mind that he said ive good reasons for what im telling you to do jessons story is not to appear until i give the word  the manager withdrew without a word drexley went on with his correspondence in a few minutes there was another knock at his door he looked up annoyed some one else no doubt to protest against the exclusion of jessons story rice was standing upon the threshold and behind him a younger man tall with clustering hair and brilliant eyes cheeks on which the tan still lingered illclad but personable  ive brought mr jesson in to see you sir rice said breezily i found him at spargettis struck up an acquaintance and brought him along i thought youd like to have a talk with him about some more work  drexley for a moment was as speechless as douglas was nervous rice blandly unconscious of anything unusual wheeled up a chair for the latter and sauntered towards the door  id like to have a word with you before you go jesson he said will you look in at my room  douglas murmured an inarticulate assent and rice departed then he looked up at the man who so far had only bidden him a mechanical good morning and wondered a little at the heavy frown upon his face perhaps his introduction had been a little unceremonious but surely he could not be blamed for that  drexley pulled himself together the thing was awkward but it must be faced  you have come to see us about your story i suppose mr jesson he began a very fair story indeed for a beginner as i suppose you are i am hoping that some day we may be able to make use of it for the ibex  douglas looked up quickly  i understood mr rice that you were using it in the next issue of the magazine he said  the next issue drexley shook his head  i am afraid that is quite out of the question he said you see our arrangements are all made a very long time ahead and we have short stories enough on hand now to last us nearly two years of course if you care to leave yours with us i think i can promise you that it shall appear some time but exactly when i should not care to say it would be quite impossible to fix a date  douglas was bewilderedspeechless he did his best however to remain coherent  mr rice certainly told me he said that it was in type and would appear at once he seemed to think too that if i saw you you might give me some more work i am living in london now and i hoped that it might be possible for me to make some money by my pen  drexley was silent for several moments for the first time in his life he glanced across at the photograph which stood upon his table with something like impatience  i am afraid that i cannot offer you much encouragement he said if ever a market in the world was overcrowded the literary market of today is in that state if you like to leave your story it shall appear some time or otheri cannot promise whenand when we are able to use it we will pay you according to our usual standard more i cannot say at present  douglas rose up with a sense of sick disappointment at his heart but with a firm determination also to carry himself like a man  i am much obliged to you he said i will think the matter over and let you know  drexley watched the struggle he too had been young and he hated himself  you had better leave us your address he said we will let you know then if we see a chance of using more of your work  douglas hesitated  when i have an address he said i will write to you at present i have not made my arrangements in london  drexley let him go despising himself with a vague feeling of irritation too against the beautiful face which smiled at him from his table douglass one idea was to get out of the place he had no wish to see rice or any one but on the landing he came face to face with the latter who had not as yet gone into his room  hullo he exclaimed youre soon off have you finished with the chief already  douglas nodded with tightening lips  he hadnt much to say to me he answered good afternoon  rice let his hand fall upon the others shoulder  i dont understand he said here come into my room for a minute  douglas yielded and rice listened to the description of his interview his little wizened face puckered up with astonishment when he had finished he thrust a box of cigarettes towards his visitor and rose from his chair  here he said just wait here a moment i must have a word with the chief  he turned out he was gone for several minutes when he returned his face was grave and puzzled  jesson he said ill be frank with you either the chiefs gone off his nut or you managed to offend him somehow i cant understand it a bit ill confess im fairly staggered  i hadnt a chance to offend him douglas said he simply sat on me  rice walked up and down the room  i wish youd leave me your address he said id like to look into this a bit  douglas sighed  i can only tell you he said what i told mr drexley at present i havent one good afternoon  rice walked with him to the door  jesson he said i want you to promise me something  well  youre a bit down on your luck if things go badly youll give me a look up i can always raise a bit and i think your words all right i tell you this on my honour only yesterday the chief asked for the proof of your story himself it was down to appear without fail this next week weve very few manuscripts in handnever had fewerand theyve been so short of good fiction whats gone wrong i dont know but you leave it to me and ill find out youll let me hear from you eh  douglas nodded drearily  thanks he said i wont forget  he walked away briskly enough but without any definite idea as to his destination rice returned to his room and smoked a whole cigarette before he touched his work    chapter x  a woman of whims  drexley had found his way to her side at last as usual her rooms were full and tonight of people amongst whom he felt himself to some extent an alien for drexley was not of the fashionable worldnot even of the fashionable literary world at heart he was a bohemian of the old type he loved to spend his days at work and his evenings at a certain wellknown club where evening dress was abhorred and a man might sit if he would in his shirt sleeves illimitable though her tact even emily de reuss the queen of london hostesses never succeeded in making him feel altogether at home in her magnificent rooms tonight he felt more at sea even than usual generally she had bidden him come to her when she entertained the great cosmopolitan world of arttoilers tonight she was at home to another worldthe strictly exclusive world of rank and fashion drexley wandering about seeing never a face he knew felt ill at ease conscious of his own deficiency in dress and deportment in a world where form was the one material thing and a studhole shirt or an illcut waistcoat were easy means of acquiring notoriety he wandered from room to room finding nowhere any one to speak to conscious of a good deal of indifferent scrutiny hating himself for coming hating too the bondage which had made him glad to come then suddenly he came face to face with his hostess and with a few graceful words of apology she had left her escort and taken his arm  i am afraid you are being bored she said quietly i am sorry i only remembered that people were coming tonight janette was out and i had quite forgotten who had had cards i wanted to see you too  i am a little out of place here he answered that is all now that i have seen you you can explain your note and i can go away  she seemed in no hurry  i know she said that you are dying for your smoky little club your scotch whiskey and your pipe never mind it is well for you sometimes to be disciplined  at the present moment he said i long for nothing beyond what i have  she turned to look at him with an amused smile the lights flashed on the diamonds around her throat and the glittering spangles upon her black dress truly a wonderfully beautiful womana divine figure and a dress which scarcely a woman who had looked at it had not envied  you are getting wonderfully apt my grim friend she said at those speeches which once you affected to despise  it was never the speeches i despised he answered bluntly it was the insincerity  and you i suppose are the only sincere man who makes them my friend that little speech errs on the other side does it not  he frowned impatiently  you have many guests he said who will be looking for you let me know why you made me treat that young man so badly and then go away  have you treated him badly then she asked  very i recalled my acceptance of his story and declined to discuss future work with him i have deprived the ibex of a contributor who might possibly have become a very valuable one and i have gone back upon my word i want to know why  i am afraid she said softly that it was for me  for you he answered of course but your letter hinted at an explanation  explanations she yawned are so tedious  tell me at least he said how the poor young idiot offended you  offended me scarcely that  you are not a woman he said to interfere in anything without a cause  i am a woman of whim she said you have told me so many times  you are a very wonderful woman he said softly and you know very well that your will is quite sufficient for me yet you are also a generous woman i have many a time had to stand godfather to your literary foundlings you have never yet exercised the contrary privilege i have done a mean thing and an ungenerous thing and though i would do it again at your bidding again and again i should like an excuseif there is any excuse  i am so sorry she said there will be no excuse for you i too have been mean and ungenerousbut i should be the same again i took some interest in that young man and i offered him my help he coolly declined ittalked of succeeding by his own exertions so priggish you know and i felt bound to let him see that the path to literary fame was not altogether the pleasant highway he seemed to expect  that was all  everything  he wounded your vanity you stoop to retaliate  she beamed upon him  how nice of you to be so candid i value frankness from my friends more than anything in the world  it is the exact truth  it was unworthy of you he said shortly  she shrugged her shoulders  you think much too well of me she said you know i am a woman to the finger tips  i dont call that a womanly action he said  ah that is because you know nothing of women there was a moments silence from a distant room dimly seen through a vista of curved and pillared archways a womans voice came pealing out to them the passionate climax of an italian love song the voice of a prima donna of worldwide fame a storm of applause was echoed through the near rooms a buzz of appreciative criticism followed drexley rose up from the seat where he had been sitting  thank you he said i have learned what i wanted to know i will go now good evening  she stood by his sideas tall as heand looked at him curiously it was as though she were seeking to discover from his face how much his opinion of her had altered but if so she was disappointed his face was inscrutable  you are angry with me  i have no right to be that  annoyed  not with you  after all she said there is no harm done he will come to me and then i shall see that his future is properly shaped if he is what i have an idea that he may be i shall be of far greater help to him than ever you could have been  but drexley was silent he was thinking then of her proteges had they after all been such brilliant successes one or two were doing fairly well from a pecuniary point of viewbut there were others she read his thought and a faint spot of colour burned for a moment on her cheek she was very nearly angry what a bear a brute  i know what you were thinking of she said coldly it is not generous of you i did all i could for poor austin and as for fennelwell he was mad  you are the kind of woman he said looking her suddenly full in the face who deals out kindnesses to men which they would often be much better without you are generous greathearted sympathetic else i would not speak like this to you but you have a devils gift somewhere you make the most unlikely men your slavesand you send them mad with kindness  you are neither fair nor reasonable she answered you talk as though i were circe behind a bar such rubbish  i never insinuated that it was wilful he said sadly i believe in you i know that you are generous onlyyou are very beautiful and at times you are too kind  my hateful sex she exclaimed dolefully why cant men forget it sometimes isnt it a little hard upon me my friend i am you know very rich and i have influence nothing interests me so much as helping on a little young people who have gifts isnt it a little hard that i should i have to abandon what surely isnt a mischievous thing to do because one of the young men has been foolish enough to fancy himself in love with me  they were interrupted she turned to bid him good night  at least she said smiling i will be very careful indeed with this boy  if he comes to you  if he comes she repeated with an odd little smile at the corner of her lips                                      drexley walked through the crowded streets to his club where his appearance in such unwonted garb was hailed with a storm of applause and a good deal of chaff he held his own as usual lighted his pipe and played a game of pool but all the same he was not quite himself there was the old restlessness hot in his blood and a strong sense of dissatisfaction with himself later on rice was brought in by a friend and he drew him on one side  rice he said abruptly about that young fellow you brought to see me today  rice looked his chief full in the face  well he said simply  i dont want to altogether lose sight of him you havent his address by any chance have you  i only wish i had rice answered shortly may be there by now  he pointed out of the window to where the thames black and sullen but lit with a thousand fitful lights flowed sullenly seaward drexley shuddered  dont talk rot rice he said  oh i dont know the younger man answered you gave him a knockdown blow and an unexpected one  i was sorry drexley said awkwardly in the conduct of the magazine i have to sometimes consider other people i am not wholly my own master  rice who knew who the other people were muttered a curse between his teeth drexley turned frowning away  at any rate if you hear anything of him he said let me know  does the countess de reuss intend to be kind to him rice asked  go to the devil drexley answered savagely    chapter xi  douglas guest gets his chance  there followed a time then when the black waters of nethermost london closed over douglass head he struggled and fought to the last gasp but in the end the great stream carried him away on her bosom and with scarcely a sob he watched all those wonderful rosecoloured dreams of his fade away into empty space he was one of the flotsam and jetsam of life no one would have the work of his brains and his unskilled hands failed to earn anything for him save a few dry crusts he had made desperate efforts to win a hearing whilst his few pence lasted and his inkpot was full he wrote several short stories and left them here and there at the offices of various magazines he had no permanent address he would call for the reply he said and so he did till his coat burst at the seams and his boots gave out then he gave it up in despair it was his work that was wrong he told himself what had seemed well enough to him amongst the cumberland hills was crude and amateurish here he was a fool ever to have reckoned himself a writer it was the ibex which had misled him he cursed the ibex its editor and all connected with it that was at the time when he had sunk lowest when it seemed to him who only a few days ago had looked out upon life a marvellous panorama of life and colour and things beautiful that death after all was the one thing to be desired yet he carried himself bravely through those evil days every morning he stripped and swam in the serpentine stiff enough often after a night spent out of doors but ever with that vigorous desire for personal cleanliness which never left him even at the worst as soon as his clothes fell into rags about him he presented the strange appearance of a tramp whose face and hands were spotless and who carried himself even till towards the end with a sort of easy grace as though he were indeed only masquerading but there came a time when the luck of the loafer went against him from morning to night he tramped the streets willing to work even till his back was broken but unable to earn a copper the gnawings of hunger roused something of the wild beast in him a fiercer light burned in his eyes his thin lips curled into hard stern lines he loitered about the strand and the crowds of theatregoers in their evening dresses borne backwards and forwards in cabs and carriages and crowding the pavements also stirred in him a slow passionate anger the bitter inequalities of life its flagrant and rank injustices he seemed for the first time to wholly realise a banquo amongst the gay stream of people who brushed lightly against him every moment he lost for the time that admirable gift of sympathetic interest in his fellows which had once been his chief trait his outlook upon life was changed to the world which had misused him so he showed an altered front he scowled at the men and kept his face turned from the women what had they done these people that they should be welldressed and merry whilst the aching in his bones grew to madness and hunger gnawed at his life strings one night with twitching fingers and face drawn white with pain he turned away from the crowded streets towards westminster sank into a seat and picking up the half of a newspaper read the smug little account of a journalist who had spent a few hours a day perhaps in the slums as he read he laughed softly to himself and then clutching the paper in his hands he walked away to the embankment up northumberland avenue and into the strand after a few inquiries he found the offices of the newspaper and marched boldly inside a vast speculation the enterprise of a millionaire the daily courier though it sold for a halfpenny was housed in a palace in a gothic chamber like the hall of a chapel hung with electric lights and filled with a crowd of workers and loungers douglas stood clutching the fragment of newspaper still in his hand looking around for some one to address himself toa strange figure in his rags wan starving but something of personal distinction still clinging to him a boy looked over a mahogany partition at him and opened a trap window  well he asked sharply do you want papers to sell this is the wrong entrance for that you know  i want to see some one in authority douglas said the subeditor if possible  it was a democratic undertaking this newspaper with its vast circulation and mighty staff and visitors of all sorts daily crossed its threshold yet this mans coat hung about him in tatters and his boots were almost soleless the boy hesitated  what business he asked curtly  i will explain itto himin a moment douglas answered if he is busy one of the staff will do i am in no hurry i can wait  the boy closed the trapdoor and withdrew in a few minutes a young man smartly dressed with sparse moustache and a pincenez came out of a door opposite to douglas  want to see me he inquired tersely im an assistant editor  douglas held out the fragment of paper  ive just read that he said picked it up on a seat  the man glanced at it and nodded  well  its badly done douglas said bluntly the mans only sat down on the outside of the thing and sketched it isnt real it couldnt be no one can write of starvation who merely sees it written in the faces of other people no one can write of the homeless who is playing at vagabondage  the assistant editor looked his visitor up and down and nodded quietly  well  if this sort of thing is likely to interest your readers douglas said give me pen and paper and i will write of the thing as it is i am homeless and i am starving the loneliness that your man writes of so prettily i will set down in black and white man i am starving now and i will write it down so that every one who reads shall understand i have slept under arches and on seats i have lain dreaming with the rain beating in my face and i have seen strange things down in the underneath life where hell is give me a chance and i will set down these things for you as no one has ever set them down before  douglas gave a little lurch swayed and recovered himself with an effort the subeditor looked at him with interest  do you drink he asked quietly  no douglas answered im faint for want of food thats all give me pen and ink and if you can use what i write pay me for it you dont stand to lose anything and imim  the subeditor took a small piece of gold from his pocket and interrupted him  thats all right he said well see what you can do anyway but you must have something to eat first let me give you this on account now go straight away and get a feed and a glass of wine ill have a room ready for you when you get back  douglas drew a little breath his fingers closed upon the piece of gold there was a glare in his eyes which was almost wolfish he had dared to let his thoughts rest for a moment upon food he who was fighting the last grim fight against starvation he spoke in a whisper for his voice was almost gone  how do you know that i shall come back  i am content to risk it the subeditor answered smiling come back in an hours time and ask for mr rawlinson  douglas staggered out speechless there was a sob sticking in his throat and a mist of tears before his eyes    chapter xii  the man who nearly went under  at midnight a man sat writing at a desk in a corner of a great room full of hanging lights a hive of industry all around him was the clicking of typewriters the monotonous dictation of reporters the tinkling of telephone bells when they had set him down here they had asked him whether the noises would disturb him but he had only smiled grimly they brought him pen and paper and a box of cigaretteswhich he ignored then they left him alone and no sound in the great room was more constant than the scratching of his pen across the paper  as the first page fluttered from his fingers he bent for a moment his head and his pen was held in nerveless fingers since he had come to london sanguine buoyant lighthearted this was the first time he had written a line for which he expected payment the irony of it was borne in upon him with swift unresisting agony this was the first fruit of his brain this passionate rending aside of the curtain which hung like a shroud before the grim horrors of that seething lower world of misery in his earlier work there had been a certain delicate fancifulness an airy grace of diction and description a very curious heritage of a man brought up in the narrowest of lines where every influence had been a constraint there was nothing of that in the words which were leaping now hot from his heart yet he knew very well that he was writing as a man inspired  that was his only pause midnight struck one and two oclock but his pen only flew the faster many curious glances were cast upon him the man in rags with the burning eyes who wrote as though possessed by some inexorcisable demon at last rawlinson came softly to his side and took up a handful of the wet sheets he was smoking a cigarette for his own labours were nearly over but as he read it burned out between his fingers he beckoned to another man and silently passed him some of the sheets they drew a little on one side  wonderful the other man whispered in a tone of rare enthusiasm who on earth is he  rawlinson shook his head  no idea he came here like thatnearly fainted before my eyeswanted to write something in austins linelooked as though he could do it too i gave him half a sovereign to get something to eat and told him to come back there hes been ever sincenearly three hours what a study for one of those lurid sketches of forbes as he sits now  i never read anything like it the newcomer said hes a magnificent find how on earth did a man who can do work like that get into such a state  rawlinson shrugged his shoulders  who can tell not drink i should say laziness perhaps or illluck i only know that tonight he has written his way on to the staff of this paper  the other man was watching douglas as though fascinated  he has written his way into greater things he murmured it makes one feel like a hackneyed pennyaliner to read work like that  hes about done up rawlinson said do you think i ought to stop him  not likely if theres such a thing in the world as inspiration hes got it now dont miss a line let him write till he faints but have some one watch him and give him a stiff whiskey and soda directly he stops  i shall stay myself rawlinson said its an off day tomorrow anyhow come and have a drink  from behind and below came the roar of machinery rolls of wet proofs came flooding into the room at every moment now and then a hansom set down a belated reporter who passed swiftly in to his work taking off his coat as he went outside the sparrows began to chirp dawn lightened the sky and strange gleams of light stole into the vast room then suddenly from douglass desk came a sound  rawlinson rushed up too late to save him douglas had swayed for a moment and then fallen over sideways he lay upon the ground a huddled heap white and motionless  they laid him flat upon his back undid his clothing and sent for a doctor a window a few yards away was thrown up and a rush of cold fresh air streamed into the room but for all they could do douglas never moved and his face was like the face of a dead man rawlinson stood up horribly anxious and gave way to the doctor who felt his heart and looked grave for an hour the pendulum swung backwards and forwards between life and death then the doctor stood up with a sigh of relief  hell do now he said but it was a narrow squeak  exhaustion rawlinson asked  starvation the doctor answered grimly the man has been sober all his life and a careful liver or he would be dead now what are you going to do with him itll take him a day or two to pull round  whatever you advise rawlinson answered  has he any money  you can treat him as though he were a millionaire rawlinson answered give him every chance the daily courier pays cheerfully                                      they moved him into the private ward of a great hospital where patients with complicated disorders and bottomless purses were sometimes treated but where never before a man had come suffering from starvation everything that science and careful nursing could do was done for him and in a few days be astonished them all by sitting up in bed suddenly and demanding to know what had happened he listened without emotion he heard the generous message from the daily courier which a month ago would have set every pulse in his body tingling with excitement without comment he grew rapidly stronger but side by side with his physical improvement came a curious mental lassitude a weariness of mind which made him content to lie and watch the housetops and the clouds with never a desire to move nor to step back once more into life the old enthusiasms seemed chilled out of him they showed him his work in print told him that he had stirred millions of his fellowcreatures as nothing of the sort had ever done before that everywhere people were talking of him and his wonderful work he only smiled faintly and looked once more at the clouds they left paper and pens upon his table he looked at them without interest and they remained untouched rawlinson himself called daily to inquire and one day the doctor sent for him  your protege is physically all right now he said he is suffering simply from shock i should say that he had a fearful time struggling before he went down and it will be a matter of time before hes himself again  all right rawlinson said do all you can for him  i was going to suggest the doctor said that one of us puts it delicately to him that hes a considerable expense to you it needs something like that to stir him up he could put on his hat and walk out of the place tomorrow if he liked  not for the world rawlinson answered promptly if he was costing us fifty guineas a week instead of ten we should be perfectly satisfied let him stay till he feels like moving then well send him to the sea if hell go  the doctor laughed  youre great people rawlinson he said not many philanthropists like you  its not philanthropy the subeditor answered if you asked me to put into l s d what those articles were worth to us i couldnt tell you but i can tell you this weve paid thousands down more than once for an advertisement which wasnt worth half so much as those few sheets of manuscript weve an endless purse but theres a short supply of what we want to buyoriginality if we come across it we dont let it go easily i can tell you  so douglas was left undisturbed then one morning he woke up to find his room a bower of roses roses whose perfume and beauty took his breath away the nurse who had tended a prince said she had never seen anything like them before douglas looked at them for a while fascinated stooped down and bathed his face in the blossoms when he spoke there was a change one sense at least was revived in himhis love for things beautiful  where did they come from he asked  the nurse smiled  a lady heft them yesterday she said she drove up and stayed for some time with the doctor i believe that she is coming again today  douglas made no remark only the nurse smiled as she noticed him linger a little over his dressing and look for the first time with interest at the clothes which had been sent in for him towards midday he grew restless early in the afternoon there was a soft tap at the door  may i come in  the nurse opened the door there was a rustle of draperies and to douglas it seemed as though the room was suddenly full of wonderful colour a new life flowed in his veins it was emily de reuss who came towards him with outstretched hands    chapter xiii  the first taste of fame  at first he scarcely recognised her he had seen her last in furs today she seemed like a delicate dream of springtime she wore a white spotless muslin gown whose exquisite simplicity had been the triumph of a french artiste her hat large and drooping was a vision of pink roses and soft creamy lace there was a dainty suggestion of colour about her throatonly the sunlight seemed to discover when she moved the faint glinting green beneath the transparent folds of her gown  she came over to douglas with outstretched hands and he was bewildered for she had not smiled upon him like this once during that long journey to london  so it is i who have had to come to you she exclaimed taking his hands in hers may i sit down and talk for a little while i am so gladevery one is gladthat you are better  he laughed a little oddly  every one why i could count on the fingers of one hand the people with whom i have spoken since i came to london  she nodded  yes she said but today you could not count in an hour the people who know you you are very fortunate you have made a wonderful start you have got over all your difficulties so easily  so easily he smiled again and then shuddered she looked into his face and she too felt like shuddering  you do not know he said no one will ever know what it is liketo go underto be saved as it were by a miracle  you suffered i know she murmured but you gained a wonderful experience  you do not understand he said in a low tone no one will ever understand  you could have saved yourself so much she said regretfully if you had kept your promise to come and see me  i could not he answered i lost your address it went into the thames with an old coat the very night i reached london but for that i should have come and begged from you  you would have made me famous she answered laughing i should have claimed the merit of discovering you  he looked puzzled  of course you know she said how every one has been reading those wonderful articles of yours in the courier you are very fortunate you have made a reputation at one sitting  he shook his head  a fleeting one i am afraid i can understand those articles seeming lifelike you see i wrote them almost literally with my blood it was my last effort i was starving poisoned with horrors sick to death of the brutality of life  things had gone so hardly with you then she murmured  he nodded  from the first i came to london as an adventurer it is true i knew no one and i had no money but the editor of the ibex had written me kindly had accepted a story and asked for more yet when i went to see him he seemed to have forgotten or repented he would not give me a hearing even the story he had accepted he told me he could not use for a long timeand i was relying upon the money for that that was the beginning of my illluck and afterwards it never left me  she sat for a moment with a look in her deep soft eyes which he could not understand afterwards he thought of it and wondered it passed away very soon and she bent towards him with her face full of sympathy  it has left you now she said softly and for ever do you know i have come to take you for a drive the doctor says that it will do you good  with a curious sense of unreality he followed her downstairs and took the vacant seat in the victoria it was all so much like a dream like one of those wonderful visions which had come to him at times in the days of his homeless wanderings surely it was an illusion the luxurious carriage the great horses with their silvermounted harness the servants in their smart liveries and above all this beautiful woman who leaned back at his side watching him often with a sort of gentle curiosity at first he sat still quite dazed his senses a little numbed the feeling of unreality so strong upon him that he was almost tonguetied but presently the life of the streets awakened him it was all so fascinating and alluring they were in a part of london of which he had seen littleand that little from the gutters today in the brilliant sunshine in clothes better than any he had ever worn before and side by side with a woman whom every one seemed honoured to know he looked upon it with different eyes they drove along bond street at a snails pace and stopped for a few minutes at one of the smaller galleries where she took him in to see a wonderful russian picture about which every one was talking fancying that he looked tired she insisted upon tea and they stopped at some curious little rooms and sat together at a tiny table drinking tea with sliced lemons and eating strawberries such as he had never seen before then on again to the park where they pulled up under the trees and she waved constantly away the friends who would have surrounded her carriage one or two would not be denied and to all of them she introduced jessonthe young writerthey had seen that wonderful work of his in the daily courier of course he took no part in any conversation more than he could help leaning back amongst the cushions with the white lace of her parasol close to his cheek watching the faces of the men and women who streamed by and the great banks of rhododendrons dimly seen lower down through the waving green trees the murmur of pleasant conversation fell constantly upon his earssurely that other world was part of an evil dream a relic of his delirium heaven and hell could never exist so close together but byandbye when they drove off she herself brought the truth home to him  do you know she said this afternoon i have had an idea some day i hope so much that it may come true do you mind if i tell it you it concerns yourself  tell me of course he said  you have written so wonderfully of that terrible world beneaththat world whose burden we would all give so much to lighten you have written so vividly that every one knows that you yourself have been there presentlynot now of coursebut some day i would have you write of life as we see it about us todayof the world beautifuland i would have you illustrate it as one who has lived in it drunk of its joys even as one of its happiest children think what a wealth of great experiences must lie between the two extremes it is what you would wish foryou to whom the study of your fellowcreatures is the chosen pursuit of life  he smiled at her thoughtfully  i do not know he replied but i should think very few in this world are ever permitted to pass behind both canopies to me it seems impossible that i should have ceased so suddenly to be a denizen of the one and even more impossible that i should ever have caught a glimpse of the other  you will not always say so she murmured you have everything in your favour nowyouth strength experience and reputation  even then he answered i doubt whether i still possess the capacity for happiness i feel at times as though what had gone before had frozen the blood in my veins  your friends she said must make up to you for the past forgetfulness is sometimes hardly won but it is never an impossibility  my friends my dear lady i do not possess one  she raised her parasol her wonderful eyes sought his her delicatelygloved hand rested for a moment lightly upon his palm  and what am i she asked softly  he was only human and his heart beat the faster for that gentle touch and the gleam in her eyes she was so beautiful so unlike any other woman with whom he had ever spoken  have i any right to call you my friend he faltered  have you any right she answered brightly to call me anything else  i wonder what makes you so kind to me he said  i liked you from the moment you jumped into the railway carriage she replied in those ridiculous clothes and with a face like a ghost then i liked your independence in refusing to come and be helped along and since i have read yourbut we wont talk about that only if you have really no friends let me be your first  no wonder his brain felt a little dizzy they were driving through the great squares now and already he began to wonder with a dull regret how much longer it was to last then at a corner they came face to face with drexley he was walking moodily along but at the sight of them he stopped short upon the pavement emily de reuss bowed and smiled drexley returned the salute with a furious glance at her companion he felt like a man befooled douglas too sat forward in the carriage a bright spot of colour in his cheeks  you know that man he said  she assented quietly  yes i have met him he is the editor of the ibex  douglas remembered the bitterness of that interview and rices amazement but he said nothing he leaned back with half closed eyes after all perhaps it had been for the best yet drexleys black look puzzled him    chapter xiv  a visitor from scotland yard  the carriage pulled up before one of the handsomest houses in london douglas brought back suddenly to the present realised that this wonderful afternoon was at an end the stopping of the carriage seemed to him in a sense symbolical the interlude was over he must go back to his brooding land of negatives  it has been very kind of you to come and see me and to take me out he said  she interrupted the words of farewell which were upon his lips  our little jaunt is not over yet she remarked smiling we are going to have dinner togetheryou and i alone and afterwards i will show you that even a town house can sometimes boast of a pleasant garden you neednt look at your clothes we shall be alone and you will be very welcome as you are  they passed in together and douglas was inclined to wonder more than ever whether this were not a dream only that his imagination could never have revealed anything like this to him outside the hallporters office was a great silver bowl sprinkled all over with the afternoons cards and notes a footman with powdered hair admitted them another moved respectfully before them and threw open the door of the room to which emily de reuss led him he had only a mixed impression of pale and beautiful statuary drooping flowers with strange perfumes and the distant rippling of water then he found himself in a tiny octagonal chamber draped in yellow and whitea womans den cosy dainty cool she made him sit in an easychair which seemed to sink below him almost to the ground and moved herself to a little writingtable  there is just one message i must send she said to a stupid house where i am half expected to dine it will not take me half a minute  he sat still listening mechanically to the sound of her pen scratching across the paper a tiny dachshund jumped into his lap and with a little snort of content curled itself up to sleep he let his hand wander over its sleek satin coatthe touch of anything living seemed to inspire him with a more complete confidence as to the permanent and material nature of his surroundings meanwhile emily de reuss wrote her excuses to a duchessa dinnerparty of three weeks standingknowing all the while that she was guilty of an unpardonable social offence she sealed her letter and touched a bell by her side then she came over to him  now i am free she announced for a whole evening how delightful what shall we do i am ordering dinner at eight would you like to look at my books or play billiards or sit here and talk the garden i am going to leave till afterwards i want you to see it at its best  i should like to see your books he replied  she rose and moved towards the door  i am not certain she said whether you will care for my library you will think it perhaps too modern but there will be books there that you will like i am sure of that  douglas had never seen or dreamed of anything like it the room was ecclesiastical in shape and architecture fluted pillars supported an oakbeamed ceiling and at its upper end was a small organ but it was its colour scheme which was so wonderful the great cases which came out in wings into the room were white everything was whitethe rugs the raised frescoes on the walls the chairs and hangings  she watched his face and assuming an apologetic attitude said it is unusualand untraditional i know but i wanted something different and mine is essentially a modern library in this country there is so much to depress one and ones surroundings after all count for much that is my poetry recess you seem to have found your way there by instinct  i think it is charming he remarked only at first it takes your breath away but what beautiful editions  he hesitated with his hand upon a volume she laughed at him and took it down herself perhaps she knew that her arm was shapely at least she let it remain for a moment stretched out as though to reach the next volume  i always buy editions de luxe when they are to be had she said a beautiful book deserves a beautiful binding and paper i believe in the whole effect it is not fair to ruskin to read him in paper covers and fancy le gallienne in an eighteenpenny series  you have pater he exclaimed and isnt that a volume of de maupassants  his fingers shook with eagerness she put a tiny volume into his hands he shook back the hair from his head and forgot that he had ever been ill that he had ever suffered that he had ever despaired for the love of books was in his blood and his tongue was loosened for the first time in his life he knew the full delight of a sympathetic listener they entered upon a new relationship in those few minutes  the summons for dinner found them still there douglas with a faint flush in his cheeks and brilliant eyes she too imbued with a little of his literary excitement she handed him over to a manservant who offered him dress clothes and waited upon him with the calm dexterous skill of a welltrained valet he laughed softly to himself as he passed down the broad stairs surely he had wandered through dreamland into some corner of the arabian nightselse he had passed from one extreme of life to the other with a strange almost magical celerity  dinner surprised him by being so pleasantly homely a single trim maidservant waited upon them a man at the sideboard opened the wine carved and vanished early in the repast over a great bowl of clustering roses he could see her within a few feet of him plainly dressed in black lace with a band of velvet around her white neck her eyes resting often upon him full of gentle sympathy they talked of the books they had been looking at a conversation all the while without background or foreground only once she lifted her glass which had just been filled and looked across to him  to the citybeautiful she said softly may the day soon come when you shall write of itand forget  he drank the toast fervently but of the future then he found it hard to think the transition to this from his days of misery had been too sudden as yet his sense of proportion had not had time to adjust itself behind him were nameless horrorsthat he had a future at all was a fact which he had only recognised during the last few hours  afterwards they sat in low chairs on a terrace with coffee on a small round table between them a fountain playing beneath beyond the trees of the park the countless lights of the streets and the gleaming fires of innumerable hansoms it was the london of broad streets opulent dignified afire for pleasure women were whirled by brighteyed bejewelled softly clad in white feathers and opera cloaks men hatless immaculate as regards shirtfronts and ties wellgroomed the best of their race wonderful sight for douglas fresh from the farmhouse amongst the hills the scotch college the povertystricken seminary back went his thoughts to that dreary past and though the night was hot he shivered she looked at him curiously  you are cold  he shook his head  i was thinking he answered  she laid her fingers upon his arm a touch so thrilling and yet so delicate  dont you know she said that of all philosophies the essence is to command ones thoughts to brush away the immaterial the unworthy the unhappy try and think that life starts with you from today you are one of those few those very few people douglas jesson who have before them a future try and keep yourself master of it  a servant stepped out on to the balcony and stood respectfully before them she looked up frowning  what is it mason she asked i told you that i was not seeing any one at all tonight  the person madame he answered is from scotland yard and he says that his business is most important he has called twice before he begged me to give you his card and to say that he will wait until you can find it convenient to spare him a few minutes she looked at the card  mr richard grey    from scotland yard  then she rose regretfully  what the man can possibly want with me she said heaven only knows you will smoke a cigarette my friend till i return i shall not be long  he stood up to let her pass untroublednot sorry for a moments solitude it was not until she had gone that a thought flashed into his mind which stopped his heart from beating and brought a deadly faintness upon him    chapter xv  emily de reuss tells a lie  a tall thin man with grave eyes and pale cheeks rose to meet emily de reuss when she entered the sittingroom into which he had been shown she regarded him with faint curiosity she concluded that he had called upon her with reference to one of her servants she had a large household and it was possible that some of the members of it had fallen under police supervision she only regretted that he had not chosen some other evening  the countess de reuss i believe  she assented a nod was quite sufficient  i have been instructed to call and ask you a few questions with reference to your journey from accreton on february 10th last he continued i am sorry to trouble you but from information which we have received it seemed possible that you might be able to help us  she stood quite still not a muscle in her colourless face twitched or moved in any way she showed little of her surprise none of her intense and breathless interest the man looked at her in admiration she was politely interestedalso acquiescent  i remember my journey from accreton perfectly well she said but i cannot see that anything in connection with it can possibly be of interest to scotland yard perhaps you will be a little more explicit  the man bowed  you had a travelling companion we are given to understand a young man who entered your carriage at the last moment he added  i had a travelling companion it is true she admitted slowly it is also true that he entered my carriage at the last moment but how that can possibly concern you i cannot imagine  we should like to know his name the man said  emily de reuss shook her head slowly  i really am afraid she replied that i cannot tell you that  he was a stranger thenyou did not know him before the man asked quickly  on the contrary she answered shaking her head he was an old friend  the mans face fell obviously he was disappointed she toyed with a bracelet for a moment and then yawned  if he was an old friend mr grey said why will you not give me his name  if you will show me a sufficient reason why i should she answered i will not hesitate but you force me to ask you directly what possible concern can it be of yours  your ladyship may remember he said that there was a shocking accident upon the train  she assented with a little shudder  yes i remember that  a man threw himself from the train and was crushed to death his body was quite unrecognisable but from some papers found upon or near him it was concluded that his name was douglas guest  i remember hearing that too she agreed  well there seems to have been plenty of reason for mr douglas guest to have committed suicide as i daresay you know if ever you read the papers  i never by any chance open an english one she said  then you probably didnt hear of a murder in a cumberland village the night before no well there was one and the man who was wanted for it wasmr douglas guest  the man who threw himself from the carriage window  apparently yes we made searching inquiries into the matter and we came to the conclusion that douglas guest was the man and that he had either committed suicide or been killed in trying to jump from the train we were disposed therefore to let the matter drop until a few days ago when we had a visit from a miss strong who proved to be the daughter of the old farmer who was murdered she seemed to have got hold of an idea that douglas guest had by some means foisted his identity on to the dead man and was still alive she absolutely denied that a part of the clothing which was preserved had ever belonged to douglas guest and she worked upon the chief to such an extent that he told me off to see this through  i still do not see she said in what way i am concerned in this  it was your fellowpassenger countess not yourself concerning whom we were curious we hoped that you might be able to give us some information we understood that he joined the train hurriedly if you like i will read you a description of douglas guest  emily de reuss looked him in the face and shrugged her shoulders  my good man she said it is not necessary i am not in the least interested in the young man and when i tell you that i went to the trouble and expense of engaging a compartment you will perhaps understand that i should not for a moment have tolerated any intrusion on the part of a stranger the gentleman who accompanied me to london was one of the house party at maddenham priory and an old friend  the officer closed his notebook with a little sigh and bowed  it only remains for me he said to express to your ladyship my regrets at having troubled you in the matter personally your statement confirms my own view of the case the young lady is excitable and has been deceived  emily de reuss inclined her head and touched the knob of an electric bell at the door the officer turned back  it would perhaps be as well he said if you would favour us with the name of the gentleman who was your companion  she hesitated  i think it quite unnecessary she answered i have certain reasons not perhaps very serious ones but still worth consideration for not publishing it abroad who my companion was it must be sufficient for you that he was one of my fellowguests at maddenham priory and a friend for whom i can vouch  the servant was at the door mr grey bowed  as your ladyship wishes of course he said                                      emily de reuss made no immediate movement to rejoin her guest she was a woman of nerve and courage but this had rather taken her breath away she had had no time for thought she had answered as though by instinct it was only now that she realised what she had done she had lied deliberately had placed herself should the truth ever be known in an utterly false if not a dangerous position for the sake of a boy of whose antecedents she knew nothing and on whom rested at any rate the shadow of a very ugly suspicion she had done this who frankly owned to an absorbing selfishness whose conduct of life ever gravitated from the centre of self after all what folly she had been generous upon impulse how ridiculous  she walked slowly out to where douglas sat waiting she came upon him like a ghost in the dim light and when the soft rustling of her gown announced her presence he started violently and turned a bloodless face with twitching lips and eager eyes to hers the sight of it was a shock to her he had been living in fear thenher falsehoods for his sake had been necessary  has he gone he asked incoherently  yes  was itabout me  yes  youd better tell me he begged  she sat down by his side and glanced around they were alone and out of earshot from the windows  my visitor she said was a detectivefrom scotland yard he came to know if i could give him any information about my fellowpassenger from accreton on february 10th  why why did he want to know  there was a murder he saida cumberland farmer and a young man named douglas guest was missing  douglas guest he said hoarsely was in that train he was killed it was in the papers  so the detective believed she said but a daughter of the murdered man  ah  has taken up the case and positively refused to identify some of the clothing belonging to the dead man there was some talk of a young man who answered to the description of douglas guest having forced himself into my carriage the man came to ask me about this  and you told himwhat  she adjusted a bracelet carefully her beautiful eyes fixed upon his haggard face  i told him a lie she answered i told him that my companion was a fellowguest at the house where i had been staying  a little sob of relief broke in his throat he seized her hand in his and pressed it to his lips it seemed to her that the touch was of fire she looked at him thoughtfully  you are douglas guest then she asked quietly  i am he answered    chapter xvi  joan strong avenger  at an attic window from which stretched a babylonic wilderness of slated roofs and cowled chimney pots two girls were sitting the tan of the wind and the sun was upon their cheeks their clothes lacked the cheap smartness of the londoner they were both in mourning for their father gideon strong  suicide nay ill never believe that it was douglas joan declared firmly nay but i know the lad too well he was ever pining for london for gay places and the stir of life there was evil in his blood it was the books he read and the strange taste he had for solitude what else but hed not the pluck of a rabbit he never killed himselfnot he hes a living man today and as im a living woman ill drop my hand upon his shoulder before long  god forbid it cicely cried fervently please god if it was douglas who sinned so grievously that he may be dead  joan rose slowly to her feet in her sombre garb fashioned with almost pitiless severity her likeness to her father became almost striking there were the same high cheekbones the heavy eyebrows the mouth of iron the blood of many generations of stern yeomen was in her veins  tis well for you cicely she said and her voice metallic enough at all times seemed for the bitterness of it to bite the close air like a rasp tis well enough for you cicely who had but little to do with him but do you forget that i was his affianced wife i have stood up in the meeting house at feldwick and we prayed together for grace the hypocrite the abandoned wastrel that he who might have been the pastor of feldwick ay and have been chosen to serve in the towns even should have wandered so miserably  the younger girl was watching a smokebegrimed sparrow on the sill with eyes at once vacant and tender she was slighter and smaller than her sister of different complexion with soft grey eyes and a broad humorous mouth her whole expression was kindly she had a delicate prettiness of colouring and a vivacity which seemed to place her amongst a different order of beings never were sisters more like and unlike in this world  sometimes she said reflectively i have wondered whether father was not very hard upon douglas he was so different from everybody else there so fond of books and pictures clever people and busy places there was no one in feldwick with whom he could have had any tastes at all in commonnot a scholar amongst the lot of us  joan frowned heavily her dark brows contracted the black eyes flashed  pictures and books she muttered what has a minister of the gospel to do with these douglas guest had chosen his path in life  nay cicely interrupted eagerly it was chosen for him he was young and father was very stern and obstinate as who should know better than ourselves joan douglas never seemed happy after he came back from college his life was not suitable for him  joan was slowly getting angry  not suitable for him she retorted what folly who was he to pick and choose it was rare fortune for him that father should have brought him up as he did youll say next that i was forced on him that he didna ask me to be his wifeay and stand hand in hand with me before all of them youve forgotten it maybe  but cicely to whom that day had been one of agony marked with a black stone never to be forgotten shook her head with a little shudder  im sure i never hinted at it joan she said but for all you can say i believe hes dead  maybe joan answered coldly but im not yet believing it its led astray i believe he was and heavys the penalty hell have to pay its my notion hes alive in this city and thats why im here itll be a day of reckoning when we meet him but itll come cicely ive dreamed of it and itll come ill never bend the knee at meeting till ive found him  cicely shuddered  itll never bring poor father back to life she murmured youd best go back to feldwick joan theres the farmyou and reuben smith could work it well enough folks there will think youre out of your mind staying on here in london  folks may think what they will she answered savagely ill not go back till douglas guest hangs  then may you never see feldwick again cicely prayed  youre but a poor creature yourself joan cried turning upon her with a sudden passion you would have him go unpunished then robber murderer deceiver oh dont think that i never saw what was in your mind i know very well what brings you here now you want to save him i saw it all many a time at feldwick but youve none so much to flatter yourself about he took little enough notice of me and none at all of you he deceived us all and as im a living woman he shall suffer for it  cicely rose up with pale face  joan she said you are talking of the dead  but joan only scoffed she was a woman whose beliefs once allowed to take root in the mind were unassailable proof against probability proof against argument douglas guest was alive and it was her mission to bid him stand forth before the world she was the avengershe believed in herself the spirit of the prophetess was in her veins she grew more tolerant towards her younger sister after all she was of weaker mould how should she see what had come even to her only as an inspiration  come cicely she said im not for bandying words with you the world is wide enough for both of us let us live at peace towards one another at any rate theres tea comingpoor stuff enough but its city water and city milk you shall sit down and tell me what has brought you here for its not only to see me i guess  the tea was brought they sat and discussed their plans cicely had followed her sister to london utterly unable to live any longer in a place so full of horrible memories they had a little moneycicely almost enough to live on but she wanted work joan listened but for her part she had little to say only as the clock drew near seven oclock she grew restless her attention wandered she looked often towards the window  youll stay the night here anyhow sister she said at last  why id counted on it cicely admitted  well thats settled then this is mostly the time i go out are you going with me or will you rest a bit  cicely rose up briskly  ill come along she said a walk will do me good the airs so cruel close up here  joan hesitated  im a fast walker she said and i go far  but cicely who divined something of the truth hesitated no longer not even for a second  i will come she said                                      they passed out into the streets and the younger girl knew from the first that their walk was a quest they chose the most frequented thoroughfares and where the throng was thickest there only they lingered there was a new look in the face of the elder girl a grim tightening of the lips a curious doggedness about the jaws a light in the black eyes which made her sister shudder to look upon for there were in joan strong daughter of many generations of north country yeomen the possibilities of tragedy a leaven of that passionate resistless force which when once kindled is no more to be governed than the winds narrow she was devoid of imagination and uneducated yet married to the man whom she had boldly and persistently sought after she would have been a faithful housewife after the fashion of her kind but with the tragedy in her home the desertion of the man whom she had selected for her husband another woman had leaped into life something in her nature had been touched which in an ordinary case would have lain dormant for ever cicely knew it and was terrified this was her sister and yet a stranger with whom she walked this steadfast untiring figure ever with her eyes mutely questioning the passing throngs they had become a great way removed during these last few weeks and save her sister there was no one else left in the world with aching feet and tears in her eyes cicely kept pace as well as she could with the untiring relentless figure by her side many people looked at them curiouslythe tall cassandralike figure of the elder woman and the pretty slight girl struggling to keep pace with her her lips quivering her eyes so obviously full of fear the loiterers on the pavement stared joans fierce untiring eyes took no more notice of them than if they had been dumb figures cicely was continually shrinking back from glances half familiar half challenging more than once they were openly accosted but joan swept such attempts away with stony indifference for hour after hour they walked steadily onthen with a little sob of relief cicely saw at last that they had reached their own street the elder girl produced a key and drew a long sigh then she looked curiously down at her companion  youll go back to feldwick tomorrow or maybe saturday cicely she said you understand now  how longwill this go on  joan drew herself up the fierceness of the prophetess was in her dark face  till my hands are upon him she said till i have dragged him out from the shadows of this hateful city    chapter xvii  a plain question and a warning  douglas jesson had his opportunity accepted it and became one of the elect he passed on to the staff of the courier where his work was spasmodic and of a leisurely character but always valuable and appreciated his salary which was liberal seemed to him magnificent besides he had the opportunity of doing other work all the magazines were open to him although he was tied down to write for no other newspaper the passionate effort of one night of misery had brought him out for ever from amongst the purgatory of the unrecognised for his work was full of grit often brilliant never dull even drexley who hated him admitted it emily de reuss was charmed  douglass first visit was to rice whom he dragged out with him to lunch ordering such luxuries as were seldom asked for at spargettis they lingered over their cigarettes and talked much yet about rice there was a certain restraint the more noticeable because of his hosts gaiety douglas welldressed debonair with a flower in his buttonhole and never a wrinkle upon his handsome face was in no humour for reservations he filled his companions glass brimful of wine and attacked him boldly  i want to know he said what ails my philosophic friend out with it man has drexley been more of a bear than usual or has spargetti ceased his credit  neither rice answered smiling drexley is always a bear and spargettis credit is a thing which not one of the chosen has ever seen the bottom of  then what in the name of all that is unholy douglas asked ails you  rice lighted a cigarette glanced around and leaned over the table  you my friend and host you are upon my mind i will confess  douglas nodded and waited rice seemed to find it not altogether easy to continue he dropped his voice the question he asked was almost a whisper  is your name really douglas jessonor is it douglas guest  douglas gasped and clutched for a moment at the tablecloth the room was suddenly spinning round and round the faces of the people were shrouded in mist his newlyacquired strength was all engrossed in a desperate struggle against that sickening sensation of fainting rices voice seemed to come to him from a long way off  drink your wine manquick  mechanically he obeyed he set the glass down empty once more the faces in the restaurant were clear the mists had passed away but the keen joy of living no longer throbbed in his pulses  how did you know he asked hoarsely  from the story you sent us rice answered at first you wrote on the titlepage douglas guest as the author then apparently you changed your mind crossed it out and substituted douglas jesson which we took to be a nomdeplume especially as you gave us for your address initials to a postoffice  did any one else see it  not unless drexley did he has never spoken to me about it  douglas drank more wine he was unused to it and the colour mounted to his pale cheeks  you have asked me a question he said and it is answered what else  nothing rice said slowly it is no concern of mine  you are not anxious then douglas said to earn a hundred pounds reward  i think if i were you rice said i would get the courier to send you abroad they would do it in a minute  abroad douglas looked across the table questioningly it was a new idea to him yes you could visit odd places and write impressions of them yours is just the style for that sort of thingquick and nervous you know and lots of colour people are rabid for anything of that sort just now take my tip suggest it to rawlinson  i think i will douglas said yes it is a good idea i wonder  rice leaned once more across the table  you wonder what the countess de reuss will say is that it  douglas nodded  i should consult her of course  a rare seriousness fell upon rice the nonchalance which was the most pronounced of his mannerisms had fallen away it was a new man speaking one saw as it were for the first time that his hair was grey and that the lines on his face were deeply engraven  my young friend he said i want you to listen to me i am twice your age i have seen very much more of the world than you years ago i had a friendsilverton he was about your ageclever ambitious goodlooking he scored a small successa poem i think it wasand some one took him one day to call on emily de reuss i do not know where he is now but two months ago i met him in rags far advanced in consumption an utter wreck bodily and mentally yet when i spoke one word of her he struck me across the lips today i suppose he is deadpaupers funeral and all that sort of thing without a doubt i have taken his case first because he reminded me of you he had come from the north somewhere and he was about your age but he is only one of a score there is drexley a broken man once he wrote prose which of its sort was the best thing going today he is absolutely nerveless he cannot write a line and he is drinking heavily that he has not gone under altogether is simply because as yet he has not received his final dismissal he still has his uses so he is allowed to hang on a little longer now douglas jesson listen to one who knows what you are and who you arewell no matter i liked you when we met here and you have a splendid opportunity before you listen emily de reuss will care nothing for your safety she will oppose your going abroad you are her latest plaything she is not weary of you yet so she will not let you go be a man and do the sensible thing too many have been her victims it may make your heart ache a little you may fancy yourself a little ungracious never mind you will save your life and your soul go abroad as soon as rawlinson will send you  rices words were too impressive to be disregarded altogether they stirred up in douglass mind a vague uneasiness but his sense of loyalty to the woman who had befriended him was unshaken rice was led away by his feelings for his friend  rice he said i know youre speaking what you believe i cant quite accept it all never mind ill remember everything youve said im not quite a boy you know and i dont wear my heart upon my sleeve  hard to convince as they all are rice said with a wintry smile never mind ill do my best to save you listen to this do you know why drexley behaved so disgracefully to you about your story  douglas looked up eagerly the thing had always puzzled him  no why  because he had orders from emily de reuss to do so she had given you her address and bidden you go and see her you never went so she wrote drexley to give you no encouragement it was your punishment you were to go to her  i dont believe it douglas declared hotly  then you dont believe me rice said quietly for on my honour i tell you that i have seen the letter  douglas leaned his head upon his hand  im sorry he said wearily i believe absolutely in you but i believe also in her there must be some misunderstanding  rice rose up douglas had paid the bill long ago a waiter overcome with the munificence of his tip brought them their hats and preceded them smiling to the door they passed out into the street and the fresh air was grateful to them both rice passed his arm through his companions  i want you to give me just an hour he saidno more  douglas nodded and they made their way through a maze of squares and streets southwards at last rice stopped before a house in a terrace of smokebegrimed tenements and led the way inside they mounted flight after flight of stairs pausing at last before a door on the topmost floor rice threw it open and motioned his companion to follow him in  it was a small chamber bare and gaunt without ornament or luxury without even comfort the furniture was the poorest of its sort the scrap of carpet was eked out with linoleum from which the pattern had long been worn there was only one thing which could be said in its favourthe room was clean rice leaned against the mantelpiece watching his companions face  my friend he said i have brought you here because i wanted you to see my home shall i tell you why because it is exactly typical of my life bare and empty comfortless with never a bright spot nor a ray of hope there is nothing here to dazzle you is there all that you can remark in its favour is that it is tolerably cleanall in my life that i can lay claim to is that i have managed to preserve a moderate amount of selfrespect this is my life my present and my future i wanted you to see it  douglas was puzzled he scarcely knew what to say but instinctively he felt that rices purpose in bringing him here had not yet been explained so he waited  i have told you rice continued of drexley and of poor young silverton i have told you that there have been many others i have told you that she even tried to do you ill that you might be numbered amongst her victims now i tell you what as yet i have told no man i too was once the most pitiful of her slaves  you  a sharp staccato cry broke from douglass lips he had not expected this rice was suddenly an older man the careless front he showed to the world was gone he was haggard weary elderly it was a rare moment with him  i made a brave start he continuedlike you some one took me to her house i made an epigram that pleased her i passed at once into the circle of her intimates she flattered me dazzled me fed my ambition and my passion i told her of the girl whom i loved whom i was engaged to marry she was on the surface sympathetic in reality she never afterwards let pass an opportunity of making some scathing remark as to the folly of a young man sacrificing a possibly brilliant future for the commonplace joys of domesticity i became even as the rest my head was turned my letters to alice became less frequent every penny of the money i was earning went to pay my tailors bills and to keep pace with the life which as her constant companion i was forced to live all the while the girl who trusted me never complained but was breaking her heart they sent for meshe was unwell i had promised to take emily upon the river and she declined to let me off i think that evening some premonition of the truth came to me we saw a child drownedi watched emilys face she looked at the corpse without a shudder with frank and brutal curiosity she had never seen anything really deadit was quite interesting well i hurried back to my rooms meaning to catch a night train into devonshire on the mantelpiece was a telegram which had come early in the morning alice was worsetheir only hope was in my speedy coming i dashed into a hansom but on the step another telegram was handed to me alice was dead i had not seen her for ten months and she was dead  there was an odd strained silence douglas walked away to the window and gazed with misty eyes over a wilderness of housetops rices head had fallen forward upon his arms it was long before he spoke again when he did his tone was changed  for days i was stupefied then habit conquered i went to her i hoped for sympathyshe laughed at me it was for the best then i told her truths and she flung them back at me i knew then what manner of woman she waswithout heart vain callous soulless it is the sport of her life to play with and cast aside when she is weary of them the men whom she thinks it worth while to make her slaves a murderess is a queen amongst the angels to her it is the souls of men she destroys and laughs when she sees them sink down into hell my eyes were opened but it was too late i had lost the girl who loved me and whom i loved i was head over ears in debt my work had suffered from constant attendance upon her i lost my position and every chance i ever had in life went with it i have become an illpaid hack and even today i am not free from debt after years of struggling douglas jesson i have never spoken of these things to any breathing man but every word is the gospel truth  then again there was a silence for dismay had stolen into the heart of the man who listened for douglas knew that the bonds were upon him too though they had lain upon his shoulders like silken threads rice came over to him and laid his hand almost affectionately upon his arm  douglas he said you are man enough to strike a blow for your life you know that i have spoken truth to you  i know it  you will be your own man  douglas turned upon him with blazing eyes  rice he cried you are a brick ill do it ill go to her now  he went out with a brief farewell rice sat down upon his one cane chair and folded his arms the room seemed very empty    chapter xviii  the taste of the lotus  douglas was kept waiting for a minute or two in the long cool drawingroom at grosvenor square the effect of rices story was still strong upon him the perfume of the flowers the elegance of the room and its peculiar atmosphere of taste and luxury irritated rather than soothed him even the deference which the servants had shown him the apologetic butler her ladyships own maid with a special message acquired new significance now looking at things from rices point of view there was so much in his own circumstances which had lent weight to what he had been told he was earning a good deal of money but he was spending more emily had insisted upon rooms of her own choosing in a fashionable neighbourhood and had herself selected the furniturewhich was not yet paid for she had insisted gently but firmly upon his going to the best tailors the little expeditions in which he had been permitted to act as her escort the luncheons and dinners at restaurants although they were not many were expensive yes rice was right to be near emily de reuss was to live within a maze of fascination but the end to it could only be the end of the others already he was in debt a trifle behind with his worka trifle less keen about it already the memory of his sufferings seemed to lie far back in another worldhis realisation of them had grown faint there was something paralysing about the atmosphere of pleasure with which she knew so well how to surround herself  the door opened and she came in a dream of spotless muslin and glinting colours she came over to him with outstretched hands and a brilliant smile upon her lips  how is it my friend she cried that you always come exactly when i want you you must be a very clever person i have to go for a minute or two to the stupidest of garden parties at surbiton you shall drive with me and afterwards if you like we will come back by richmond and dine what do you say  delightful he answered and if i were an idle man nothing in the world would give me more pleasure but this afternoon i must not think of it i am behind with my work already i only came round for a few minutes talk with you  she looked at him curiously she was not used to be denied  surely she said your work is not so important as all that  i am afraid he said that lately i have been forgetting how important my work really is that is precisely what i came to talk to you about  she sat down composedly but he fancied that her long dark eyes had narrowed a little and the smile had gone from her face  you will think i am ungrateful i am afraid he began but do you know i am losing hold upon my work and i have come to the conclusion that i am giving a good deal too much of my time to going out thanks to you i seem to have invitations for almost every dayi go to polo matches to river parties to dinners and dances i do everything except work you know that i have made a fair start and i feel that i ought to be making some uses of my opportunities besidesi may be quite frank with you i knowi am spending a great deal more than i am earning and that wont do will it  she came over and sat by his side on the couch there was not the slightest sign of disapproval in her manner  do you know that sounds very sensible douglas my friend she said quietly i should hate to think that i was selfish in liking to have you with me so much and your work is the first thing of course only you mustnt forget this your profession is settled now irrevocably you will be a writer and a famous writer and one reason why i have procured all these invitations for you and encouraged you to accept them has been because i want you to grasp life as a whole you think that you are idling now you are not every new experience you gain is of value to you hitherto you have only seen life through duncoloured spectacles i want you also to understand the other side it is your business to know and grasp it from all points cant you see that i have found it a pleasure to help you to see that side of which you were ignorant  that is all very true he answered only i have already had more opportunities than most men dont you think yourself that it is almost time i buckled to and started life more seriously  it is for you to say she answered quietly you know better than i if you have work in your brain and you are weary of other thingswell au revoir and good luck to you only you will come and see me now and then and tell me how you are getting on for i shall be a little lonely just at first  she looked at him with eyes a trifle dim and douglas felt his heart beat thickly and the memory of rices passionate words seemed suddenly weak  i shall come and see you always he said as often as you would have me come you know that  she shook her head as though but half convinced then she rose to her feet  there is just one thing i should like to ask you she said this new resolution of yoursdid you come by it alone or has any one been advising you  douglas hesitated  i have been talking to a man he admitted who certainly seemed to think that i was neglecting my work  will you tell me who it was  douglas looked into her face and became suddenly grave the eyes were narrower and brighter a glint of white teeth showed through the momentarily parted lips a tiny spot of colour burned in her cheekssomething of the wild animal seemed suddenly to have leaped up in her yet how beautiful she was  i cannot do that he faltered  then it was some one who spoke to you of me she continued calmly you need not trouble to contradict me hadnt you better hurry away before i have the chance to do you any harm there is one young man i know of a melodramatic turn of mind who persists in looking upon me as a sort of siren calling my victims on to the rocks i expect that is the person with whom you have been talking douglas jesson i think that i am a little disappointed in you  she stood up and smoothed out her skirts thoughtfully  he was very near at that moment throwing all thoughts of rices words to the winds and retracting all that he had said after all it was she who had brought him back from death whatever his future might be he owed it to her she looked into his eyes and felt that she had conquered yet the very fascination of that smile which parted her lips was like a chill warning to him  i will tell you who it was who has been talking to me he said it is a clerk of drexleys a man named rice  she nodded  i thought so poor boy he will never forgive me  for what douglas asked quickly that was the crux of the whole matter  for his own folly she answered quietly i was good to himhelped him in many ways he tried to make love to me i had to send him away of course that is the worst of you young men if a woman tries to help you you seem to think it your duty to fall in love with her what is she to do then  cant a womanalways make it clearif she wants tothat that sort of thing is not permitted  do you think that she can do you think that she knows what she wishes herself until the last moment until it is too late  douglas rose up a little unsteadily  take my own case he cried with a sudden little burst of passion you are the most beautiful woman whom i have ever seen you are kind to me you suffer me to be your companion yet if i commit the folly of falling in love with you you will dismiss me in a moment without a sigh i am only an ordinary being dont you think that i am wise if i try to avoid running such a risk  she laughed softly  what a calculating mortal is this all the effect of mr rices warning  well isnt it truth  she shook her head  i cant pretend to say do any of us really know i wonder what we would do under any given circumstances i wish you would tell me exactly what your friend complained of in my treatment of him  he spokenot only of himself douglas answered there was a man called silverton  what  he looked across at her in swift surprise it seemed to him that her anger had suddenly changed into a wonderful and speechless terror her left hand was buried in the sofa cushions the pupils of her eyes were dilated she was bloodless to the lips when she spoke it was hard to recognise her voice  what of him what did he know what did he tell youof him  douglass expression of blank surprise seemed an immense relief to her  onlysomething like what he told me of himself he also was foolish enough to fall in love with you and  she rose suddenly and held out her hand  come my friend she said i have had enough of this take me out to my carriage i think you are very wise to avoid such a dangerous person  she swept out of the room before him and down the broad stairs a footman stood by the side of her victoria until she had settled herself in the most comfortable corner then he mounted the box and she leaned for a moment forward  you wont come she asked with a slight gesture of invitation towards the vacant seat  but douglas to whom the invitation seemed in a sense allegorical shook his head he pointed eastwards  the taste of the lotus is sweet he said but one must live    chapter xix  a man without a past  whether rices point of view and judgment upon emily de reuss were prejudiced or not douglas certainly passed from her influence into a more robust and invigorating literary life he gave up his expensive chambers sold the furniture reorganised his expenses and took a single room in a dull little street off the strand rice aided by a few friends and also by douglass own growing reputation secured his admission into the same bohemian club to which he and drexley belonged for the first time douglas began to meet those who were strictly speaking his fellows and the wonderful good comradeship of his newlyadopted profession was a thing gradually revealed to him he made many friends studied hard and did some brilliant work he abandoned upon calmer reflection the idea of going abroad and was given to understand that his position on the courier might be regarded as a permanency he saw his future gradually defined in clearer coloursit became obvious to him that his days of struggling were past and over he had won his place within the charmed circle of those who had been tried and proved only there was always at the bottom of his heart a secret dread a shadowy terror most often present when he found himself alone with rice or emily de reuss it seemed to him that their eyes were perpetually questioning him and there was one subject which both religiously and fearfully avoided  he was popular enough amongst the jovial lighthearted circle of his fellowworkers and club companions yet he himself was scarcely of their disposition his attitude towards life was still serious he carried always with him some suggestions of a past which must ever remain an ugly and fearsome thing his sense of humour was unlimitedin repartee he easily held his own he was agreeable to everybody but he never sought acquaintances and avoided intimacies more especially was he averse to any mention of his earlier days  speedwell subeditor of the minute buttonholed him one day at the club and led him into a corner  you are the very man i wanted to see jesson he exclaimed have a drink  ive just dined thanks douglas answered what can i do for you  im giving some space in my rag speedwell explained blandly to a series of memoirs on prominent journalists of the day and i want to include you  im sure youre very kind douglas answered but you cant be in earnest to begin with im not a prominent journalist and i dont suppose i ever shall be  well youre a bit of a miracle you know speedwell interrupted youve come to the front so quickly and youve a method of your ownthe staccato nervous style you know with lots of colour and dashes i wish id a man on the staff who could do it still thats neither here nor there and you neednt think im hinting for i tell you frankly the minute cant afford largesalaried men what i want from you is a photograph and just a little sketch of your early lifewhere you were born and where you went to school and that sort of thing it maynt do you much good but it cant do you any harm and ill be awfully obliged  douglas was silent for a moment the whole panorama of that joyless youth of his seemed suddenly stretched out before him he saw himself as boy and youth and man the village school changed into the sectarian university where the great highroad to knowledge was rank with the weeds of prejudice he saw himself back again at the farmhouse he felt again the vague throbbings of that discontent which had culminated in a tragedy he was suddenly white almost to the lips a mist seemed to hang about the room and the cheerful voices of the men playing pool came to him like a dirge from the far distance speedwell waiting in vain for his answer looked at him in surprise  arent you well old chap he asked you look as though youd seen a ghost  douglas pulled himself together with an effort  im not quite the thing he said late last night i suppose im sure its very good of you to think of me speedwell but id rather you left me out  why  you see im really only a novicequite a beginner and i dont feel ive the right to be included  that speedwell answered is our business you didnt come to usi came to you all you have to do is to answer a few questions and let me have that photo  douglas shook his head  you must please excuse me speedwell he said its very kind of you but to tell you the truth there are certain painful incidents in connection with my life before i came to london which i am anxious to forget i do not choose to have a past at all  speedwell shrugged his shoulders and lit a cigarette he was none too well pleased  you cant expect he remarked to become famous and remain at the same time unknown there is a great and growing weakness on the part of the public today for personalities i suppose it is the spread of american methods in journalism which is responsible for it some day your chroniclers will help themselves to your past whether you will or not  douglas rose up with an uneasy laugh  it will be an evil day for them he said perhaps for me but at least i will not anticipate it  he wandered restlessly from room to room of the club returning the greetings of his acquaintances with a certain vagueness lingering nowhere for more than a moment or two finally he took his hat from the rack and walked out into the street fronting him was the thames he leaned against the iron railing and looked out across the dusty sunbaked gardens to where the river flowed down between the bridges something of the despair which had so nearly broken his heart a short while since seemed again to lay tormenting clutches upon him after all was not a man for ever the slave of his past no present success no future triumphs could ever wholly free him from the memory of that one merciless hour as a rule his thoughts recoiled shuddering from even the slightest lingering about it tonight there swept in upon him with irresistible force a crowd of vivid memories he saw the quaint old village its grey stone houses dotted about the hillside the farmhouse which had been his homebare gaunt everything outside and in typical of the man who ruled there and over the little neighbourhood a tyrant and a despot the misery of those days laid hold of him he turned away from the railings and walked strandwards past the door of his lodgings and round many side streets grimy and unpretentious he walked like a man possessed but his memories had taken firm hold of him shadowy but inexorcisable fiends it was cicely now who was walking by his side and his heart was beating with something of the old stir what a change her coming had made in that strange corner of the world cicely with her dainty figure and bright sunny smile wonderfully lighthearted a gleam of brilliant colour thrown across their grey life she loved poetry too the hills the sunsets and those long walks across the purple moorland it was a wonderful companionship into which they had drifted he was her refuge in a life which she frankly declared to be insupportable she was a revelation to himthe first he had hadof delicate femininity full ever of suggestions of that wonderful world beyond of which at that time he had only dared to dream it was she who had kindled his ambitions who had preached to him silently but with convincing eloquence of the glories of freedom the heritage of his manhood and all the while joan from apart was watching them no word crossed her lips yet often on their return from a days rambling he caught a look in her eyes which amazed him gideon strong went his way unseeing stern and unbending as ever even to his younger daughter but in those days there was thunder always in the air douglas remembered the sensation and shuddered once he had come across joan and her sister together suddenly and had found it hard work to keep from a shriek of terror there was a light in joans eyesit seemed to him that he had seen it there often lately was there another joan whom he did not know  he walked on grim pale chilled the time when he would lie awake in his little oakbeamed chamber and thoughts of cicely would soothe him to sleep with pleasant fancies was gone he thought of her now without emotionno longer the memory of those walks thrilled his pulses he knew very well that never again would his heart beat the quicker for her coming never again even though the memory of that terrible night could be swept away would her coming bring joy to him firmly though his feet were planted upon the ladder it seemed to him then in that gloomy mood that every step must take him further away from any chance of that wonderful happiness so intangible yet so sweet an adjunct to life for he was following like a doomed creature in the wake of drexley and rice and those others too late had come his warning the woman of whom he never dared to think was surely a sorceress she was only a womanscarcely even beautiful yet the world of her sex had become to douglas guest as a thing that was not he turned at last back into the strand he would go to his rooms and work for a while but as he walked slowly down jostled by many passersby still not wholly detached from that phantasmal past there came upon him a shock so sudden and so overwhelming that the very pavement seemed to yawn at his feet towards him two women were slowly walking holding their own in the press of the crowd one with horrified eyes already fastened upon him the other as yet unconscious of his presence nearer and nearer they came and although every impulse of his body bade him fly his limbs were rigid and every muscle seemed frozen for the women were joan and her sister cicely    chapter xx  cicely asks a question  after all it was the woman who sought him who passed him by her unwilling companion who recognised him at once in spite of his altered dress and bearing they were swallowed up in the crowd before douglas had recovered himself something in cicelys terrified gaze had instantly checked his first instinct which prompted him to accost them they were gone leaving him alike speechless and bewildered he staggered into a small restaurant and sitting at an unoccupied table called for a bottle of wine  with the first draught his courage returned his mental perspective commenced to rearrange itself cicely and joan were in london cicely had seen him joan had not from the first he had realised that there was danger to him in this encounter cicely had seen him but she had made no motion of recognition she had obviously refrained from telling her sister of his near presence from this he concluded that whilst she believed in him and was still his friend joan was his enemy he rolled a cigarette with nervous fingers and lighted it did joan suspect that he was still alive and was she looking for him to the world in general douglas guest was dead how was it with these two girls there were various small reasons why they might be inclined to doubt what to other people would seem obvious he recalled joans face grim and forbidding enough almost a tragical figure in her black garb as severe and sombre as a country dressmaker could fashion it he must get to know these things he must find cicely he walked thoughtfully back to the offices of the courier where he found some work which for the time completely engrossed him  the next morning the following advertisement appeared in most of the london newspapers  to c s i must see you british museum today at six  for three days douglas watched in vain on the fourth his heart gave a great leap for a sombre little figure stepped out from an omnibus at the corner of russell square and stood hesitatingly upon the pavement looking in through the iron bars at the museum he came across the street to her boldlyshe turned and saw him after all their greeting approached the conventional he remembered to raise his hatshe held out her handwould have withdrawn it but found it already clasped in his  cicely how good of you you saw my advertisement  yes  and you saw me in the strand but you would not speak to me was that because of joan  yes  i want to talk to you he said i have so much to say  she raised her eyes to his and he saw for the first time how much thinner she was  douglas she said there is something i must ask you first of all before i stay with you for a moment must i put it into words  i do not think you need cicely he answered i went to your fathers room that night beyond a doubt but i never raised my hand against him i should have very hard work to prove it i fancy but i am wholly innocent of his deathinnocent that is to say so far as any direct action of mine was concerned  she drew a long deep breath of relief then she looked up to him with a beautiful smile  douglas she said i was sure of it yet it is a great weight from my heart to hear you say so now can you take me somewhere where we can talk i am afraid of the streets i will tell you why afterwards  he called a hansom and handed her in after a moments hesitation he gave the address of the restaurant where he had first met rice  it is only a shabby little place he explained to her apologetically but we can talk there freely  anywhere she answered how strange it seems to be herein london with you  there was a sense of unreality about it to him but he only laughed  now tell me about joan  she hesitated  it will not be pleasant  i do not deserve that it should be he answered gravely  she has always been quite sure that it was not you who was killed in the railway accident she even imbued me with that belief  her instinct there at any rate was true enough he answered  she also believes cicely continued more slowly that you robbed and murdered father  douglas shivered it was hard even now to recall that night unmoved well  she has made up her mind that you are in london and that sooner or later she will find you  and if she does  she has been to scotland yard they will arrest you  the cab pulled up with a jerk and a commissionaire threw open the apron douglas handed his companion out and they entered the restaurant together in a distant corner they found a table to themselves and he ordered dinner  well we are safe from joan here for a little time at any rate he said laughing are you living with her then  cicely nodded  yes we have left the farm there was very little money you know after all and joan and i will have to take situations at present we are living upon our capital in the most shameful way i am afraid she is completely absorbed by one ideait is horrible  it is odd that she should be so vindictive he said wearily  cicely shrugged her shoulders she was intensely interested in the little brown pot of soup which the waiter had brought them  joan is very peculiar she said when i think of her i feel like a doll she is as strong as steel i think that she cared for you douglas and putting aside everything else you behaved shamefully to her  she is not like other women he answered decidedly her caring for me was not a matter of sentiment her father ordered and she obeyed she knew quite well that it was exactly the same with me i have never uttered a word of affection to her in my life our engagement was an utter farce  still i believe she cared cicely continued and i believe that apart from anything else a sort of slow anger towards you is rankling in her heart all the time  i was a coward douglas said decidedly even now i cannot understand why for a moment i ever accepted such an impossible situation  cicely showed all her teethshe had fine white teethin a brilliant smile  joan would be quite handsome she said if she were decently dressed  some people might think so he answered she wouldnt be my style i think i agreed because in those days we all seemed to do exactly what your father ordered besides the thing was sprung upon me so suddenly it took my breath away  that was rather like father she remarked he liked taking us by storm now i want to hear how you have got on and what you are doing let us drop the past for a little while at any rate  he poured her out a glass of wine and found time to notice how pretty she was with her slightly flushed cheeks and bright eyes  i am on a newspaper he said the daily courier i got on quite by chance and they are going to keep me  she looked at him with keen interest  how delightfully fortunate she exclaimed it is what you wanted all your life isnt it and the ibex story  will appear next month i have lots of orders for others too the first thing i wrote for the courier was quite successful  she looked at him wistfully couldnt you send it to me she asked  he took out pencil and paper  of course give me your address  she began but stopped short with a little cry  whatever am i doing she exclaimed why douglas you mustnt think of writing nor of sending anything to me joan might see it and she would know your handwriting in a moment  he paused with the pencil in his hand  thats rather a nuisance he said isnt there somewhere else i can write  she shook her head regretfully  im afraid not  it is rather ridiculous he said frowning i dont want to go about in fear and trembling all my life dont you think that if i were to see her or write to you i could convince  she stopped him horrified  douglas she said you dont understand joan i am not sure that even i who live with her do she reminds me sometimes of those women of the french revolution there is a light in her eyes when she speaks of you which makes me shiver stay in london if you must but pray always that chance may not bring you two together  he answered her with an affectation of lightness but her words were not without effect upon him he paid the bill and she lowered her veil out in the street he would have called a hansom but she checked him  an omnibus if you please douglas she exclaimed joan would never forgive me the extravagance if she saw me in a cab i can find one at the corner and i should feel so much more comfortable if you would leave me here  he looked down at her and realised once more the dainty watteaulike grace of her oval face and slim supple figure he thought of the days when they had stolen out together on to the hillside oftenest in the falling twilight sometimes even in the grey dawn and his heart beat regretfully how was it that in those days he had never more fully realised her charms  i hate letting you go alone he said truthfully and i certainly cannot let you go like this without any idea as to your whereabouts  we are staying in wensum street she said i tell you that you may avoid the neighbourhood if i am to see you again it certainly must not be there  why not here he urged next thursday nightsay at halfpast six i must not lose sight of you againso soon  she raised her eyes quickly it was pleasant to her to think that he cared  i think i could manage that she said softly  douglas went off to his club with a keen sense of having acquired a new interest in life he was in that mood when companionship of some sort is a necessity    chapter xxi  the rebellion of drexley  you think drexley said his deep bass voice trembling with barelyrestrained passion that we are all your puppetsthat you have but to touch the string and we dance to your tune leave young jesson alone emily he has been man enough to strike out a line for himself let him keep to it give him a chance  she shrugged her shoulders and smiled upon him sweetly she always preferred drexley in his less abject moods  you have seen him lately my friend she inquired he is well i hope  yes he is well drexley answered bitterly living like a sensible man honestly by the labour of his brain the friend and companion of mennot the sycophant of a woman i envy him  she pointed lazily towards the door  he was man enough to choose for himself she said so may you to tell you the truth my dear friend when you weary me like this i feel inclined to saygo and when i say goit is for always  then there came into his face something which she had seen there once before and which ever since she had recalled with a vague uneasinessthe look murderous the veins in his forehead became like whipcordthere was a red flash in his eyes yet his selfcontrol was marvellous his voice when he spoke seemed scarcely to rise above a whisper  for always he surmisedit would be rest at least you are not an easy taskmistress emily  her momentary fear of him evaporated almost as quickly as it had been conceived she stood with her hand on the bell i think she said that you had better go to your club  he held out a protesting handtamed at any rate for the moment  you were speaking of jesson he said well  she moved her finger from the bell conscious that the crisis was past she might yet score a victory  yes i was speaking of jesson she continued lazily as you remarknone too politely bythebyehe has decided to do without my help i have no objection to that i admire independence in a man yet when he spoke to me from his point of view i am afraid that i was rude we parted at any rate abruptly i have been thinking it over and i am sorry for it i should like to let him know that on the whole i approve of his intention  write and tell him to come and see you then drexley said gruffly he cant refusepoor devil  the beautifullyshaped eyebrows of the countess de reuss were a trifle uplifted yet she smiled faintly  no she said he could not refuse but it is not quite what i want if i write to him he will imagine many things  what do you want me to do he asked brusquely  you see him often at the club  yes  go there tonight say that we have spoken of him hint that this absolute withdrawal from my house must appear ungratefulhas seemed so to me i shall be at home alone a week tonight do you understand  i understand at least that i am not to come and see you a week tonight he answered with a harsh laugh  that is quite true my friend she said but what of it you have no special claim have you to monopolise my societyyou nor any man you are all my friends  there was a knock at the doora maid entered  her ladyship will excuse me she said but she is dining at dowchester house tonight at eight oclock  emily rose and held out her hand to drexley  quite right marie she said i see that i must hurry you will remember my friend  i will remember he answered quietly  he walked eastwards across the park not briskly as a strong man with the joy of living in his veins but with slow dejected footsteps his great shoulders bent his heart heavy physically he was sound enough yet the springs of life seemed slack and a curious lassitude a weariness of heart and limbs came over him as he passed through the crowds of welldressed men his fellows yet to his mind creatures of some other world he sank into an empty seat and watched them with lacklustre eyes why had this thing come to him he wondered of all men he was middleaged unimaginative shrewd and well balanced in his whole outlook upon life three years ago no man in the world would have appeared less likely to become the wreck he now felt himselfthree years ago he had met emily de reuss with a certain fierce eagerness he set himself to face his position surely he was still a man escape must lie some way then he laughed softly and bitterly to himself yes there was escapeescape through the small blue hole in the forehead which more than once he had pictured to himself lately with horrid reality when fingering his revolverescape in the arms of the sea which he still loved for in his day he had been a mighty swimmer there were no other means save such as these long ago he had wearied of asking himself what manner of woman this was whose lips he had never touched yet whose allurements seemed to have that touch of wonderful magic which ever postpones never forbids he only knew that she was to him as she was to those othersonly with him the struggle was fiercer there were times as now when his love seemed turned to fury she seemed to him then like some beautiful but unclean animal who fed upon the souls of men he burned to seize her in his arms to cover her face with hot kisses and then to press his fingers around that delicate white throat until the music of her death cry should set him free for ever but when his thoughts led him hitherwards a cold fear gave him strength to break awayfor with them came the singing in his ears the lights before his eyes the airiness of heart and laughter which go before madness he sprang to his feet steadied himself for a moment and walked rapidly onwards the momentary exhilaration died slowly awaythe old depression settled down upon his spirits yet when he reached the club he was breathless and the hand which lighted a cigar in the hall shook  on the stairs he met an acquaintance  going to dine drexley  no i dont think so he answered blankly do you know if jesson is in the club  havent seen him come and have a drink you look a bit shaky  drexley shook his head he wanted to drink but not with any thoughts of good fellowship in his heart his was a fiercer desirethe craving for mad blood or the waters of lethe he chose a quiet corner in the reading room and rang for brandy  meanwhile douglas came blithely down the strand a smile upon his lips a crowd of pleasant thoughts in his brain to think that little cicely should have grown so pretty how pleased she had been to see him and how she had enjoyed their little dinner next week would be something to look forward to he would look out some of his work which he knew would interest her after all it had been she who had been the first person in the world to say a word of encouragement to him  in the hall of the club some one shouted that drexley had been inquiring for him he ordered some coffee and made his way up into the writingroom drexley was there waiting his head drooped upon his folded arms he looked up as douglas entered    chapter xxii  drexley speaks out  douglas halted in the middle of the room he knew drexley but slightly and his appearance was forbidding drexley waved him to a chair and looked up his eyes were bloodshot but his tone was steady enough  they told me downstairs that you were inquiring for me douglas said  drexley nodded  yes sit down will you i have a sort of message and there is something i wanted to say  a waiter brought douglas his coffee and being in an extravagant mood he ordered a liqueur  whatll you have he asked  drexley hesitated but finally shook his head  no more he said a cigar if you like  even then drexley shrank from his task their chairs were close together and the room emptyyet for the first ten minutes they spoke of alien subjects till a suggestive pause from douglas and a glance at his watch made postponement no longer possible then blowing out fierce clouds of tobacco smoke he plunged into his subject  ive come he said from emily de reuss no dont interrupt me ive a sort of message for you which isnt to be delivered as a message at all im to drop a hint to you that she would like you to go and see her that your refusal to do so would be a little ungracious because she came and saw you when you were ill im to let you think that shes feeling a little hurt at your behaviour and finally to work you up into going do you see  not altogether douglas answered laughing  well it isnt altogether a laughing matter drexley said grimly ive got rid of my message now im going to speak to you on my own account youre young and you havent seen much of life you are no more capable of understanding a woman like emily de reuss than you are of talking hindustanee for the matter of that neither am i nor any of us any ordinary words which i could use about her must sound ridiculous because of their inadequacy however to make myself understood i must try she is not only a beautiful woman of unlimited wealth and social position but she has when she chooses to use them the most extraordinary powers of attracting people to her she might exercise these gifts upon men of her own social rank who are as a rule of slighter character and whose experience of the best of her sex is of course larger than ours she prefers however to stoop into another world for her victimsinto our world  why victims douglas asked isnt that rather an extreme view of the case  it is a mild view drexley said i will justify it afterwards in the first place i believe that she has genuine literary tastes and a delight for the original in any shape or form the men in her own rank of life would neither afford her any pleasure nor would they be for a moment content with the return which she is prepared to offer for their devotion so she has chosen her victims or as you would say friends from amongst our menat least with a more robust virility and more limited expectation you will admit that so far i have spoken without bias  in the main yes douglas answered  there are women drexley said who are very beautiful and very attractive who admit at times to their friendship men with whom anything but friendship would be impossible and who contrive to insinuate in some subtle way that their personality is for themselves alone or for some other chosen one how its done i dont know but i believe there are plenty of women who do know and who are able to preserve unbroken friendships with men who but for the exercise of that gift must inevitably fall in love with them and there are also women drexley continued with voice not quite so steady who have the opposite gift who are absolutely heartless wholly unscrupulous as cold as adders and who are continually promising with their eyes and lips and their cursed manner what they never intend to give they will take a strong man and break him upon the wheel the wreck of whose life is a glorification to their vanity and of this type is emily de reuss  douglas was embarrassedvaguely uneasy the memory of rices words came flooding back to him whatever else was true this mans sufferings were real indeed to him she had never been anything but a most charming benefactor in a momentary fit of introspection he told himself then that her sex had scarcely ever troubled him  i think i know mr drexley he said why you have spoken to me like this and i can assure you that i am grateful if emily de reuss is what you say i am very sorry for i have never received anything but kindness from her so far as regards anything else i do not think that i am in any sort of danger i will confess to you that i am ambitious i have not the slightest intention of falling a victim to emily de reuss or any other woman  drexley took up his cigar and relit it  you speak he said exactly as i should have done years ago yet you are fortunateso far  with regard to next thursday douglas added i could not go in any case as i have an engagement  i may tell her that drexley said looking at him keenly i may tell her that you cannot come on thursday because you have an engagement  certainly you may add if you like that i have drifted so far into bohemianism that i am not a fit subject for social civilities she was very kind to me indeed and if ever she wishes me to go and see her i will go of course but fashionable life as a whole has no attractions for me i am happier where i am  drexley stood up and held out his hand  i congratulate you he said dont think im an absolute driveller but dont forget what ive said if even at present the need for a warning doesnt exist im one of her literary proteges you seeand there have been othersand i am what you see me  douglas hesitated  surely with you he said it isnt too late  drexley looked up there was the dull hopelessness of despair in his bloodshot eyes douglas who had never seen anything like it before felt an unaccountable sense of depression sweep in upon him  i am her bondman he said body and soul i could not tell you at this moment whether i hate her or love her the more but i could not live without seeing her  douglas passed upstairs to his billiards with a grim vision before his eyes drexley was a broken manof that there was no doubt he knew that his warning was kindly meant but many times both during that evening and afterwards he regretted that he had ever heard it he had come into the club almost lighthearted thinking only of cicely and of the pleasant days of companionship which might still be theirs he left it at midnight vaguely restless and disturbed with the work of weeks destroyed emily de reuss had regained her old place without the slightest effort surely it was a hopeless struggle    chapter xxiii  cicelys secret  a hard weeks work left douglas little time for outside thoughts besides his daily articles for the courier which in themselves were no inconsiderable task he had begun at last the novel the plot of which had for long been simmering in his brain he had certainly received every encouragement rawlinson who had insisted upon seeing the opening chapters had at once made him an offer for the story and the publishing house with which he was connected although of only recent development had already made a name and attained a unique position he gave up the club and worked steadily every night at his rooms resolutely thrusting aside all alien thoughts and immensely relieved to find the excitement of literary creation gradually attaining its old hold upon him he took his meals at a shabby little restaurant which none of his associates frequented declined all invitations and retired for the next seven days into an obscurity from which nothing could tempt him there came no word from emily de reuss for which he was thankful and when he left the office at six oclock on thursday evening and lighting a cigarette strolled through a network of streets towards the restaurant where he was to meet cicely he had very much the feeling of a schoolboy whose tasks were laid aside and whose holiday lay before him  cicely was there already looking wonderfully bright and pretty wearing a new hat and a black and white dress which after her countrymade mourning seemed positively smart douglas drew her hand through his arm as they entered the room and felt a pleasant sensation of proprietorship at her laughing surrender he chose a table where they would least likely be disturbed and imperilled his reputation with the smiling waiter by ignoring the inevitable chianti and calling for champagne cicely reproved him for his extravagance but sipped her wine with the air of a connoisseur  i couldnt help it he said smiling you know ive years of parsimony and misery to make up for yet this new life is so delightful and since you have comewell i couldnt help celebrating besides you know im earning quite a good deal of money and ive started the novel at last  tell me about it she begged with sparkling eyes  presently he answered eat your fish now please over our coffee i will tell you the first chapter and what excuse have you for wearing a new frock to dazzle the eyes of a lonely bachelor with  like it she asked turning round on her chair towards him  immensely  i made it myself she said continuing her dinner all since last thursday too  wonderful he exclaimed looking at her once more with admiration you must be worn out let me fill your glass  oh i rather like dressmaking she said joans disapprobation was much more trying  and how is she  better i believe and inclined to be more sensible she answered cheerfully she has given up those horrid walks and is thinking about taking a situation i cant tell you how grateful i am  so am i he answered fervently  they avoided by mutual though unspoken consent any further reference to a subject so near akin to grave matters she was satisfied with douglass declaration of innocencehe was only anxious to forget his whole past and that chapter of it in special so they passed on to lighter subjects discussed the people who entered and passed out praised the dinner and marvelled at its cheapness they watched the head waiter with his little black imperial and beady eyes a miracle of suaveness deftness and lightfootedness one moment bowing before a newcomer his face wreathed with smiles the next storming with volubility absolutely indescribable at a tardy waiter a moment later gravely discussing the wine list with a bon viveur and offering confidential and wholly disinterested advice it was all ordinary enough perhaps but a chapter out of real life their pleasure was almost the pleasure of children  later she grew confidential  douglas she said i am going to tell you a secret  if there is anything i thoroughly enjoy after a good dinner he remarked fishing an olive out of the dish it is a secret  you mustnt laugh  ill be as sober as a judge he promised  you know i shall have to earn my own living we have really very little money and we must both of us do something now i have been trying to do in earnest what i have done for my own pleasure all my life do you know what that is  i think i can guess he answered smiling  yes i told you oncewriting childrens fairy stories now i dont want you to be bothered about it but i do wish you could give me an idea where to send them  you have some written  she smiled  i have two in that little parcel there  he broke the string and took one out it was very neatly typewritten and a quick glance down the page pleased him  who typed it for you he asked  did it myself she answered i learnt shorthand you know years ago and i bought a typewriter last week i thought if nothing else turned up i might earn a little that way  you are certainly not one of the helpless sort of young women he said will you let me have the stories for a few days  will it bother you she asked wistfully  well i dont think so he assured her i wont let it  drexley a little gaunt and pale but more carefully dressed than usual in evening clothes passed their table looking for a vacant seat douglas touched his arm  sit here drexley he said were off in a minute and then you can have the whole table  drexley thanked him and surrendered his hat and coat to the waiter douglas leaned across to cicely  cicely he said let me introduce mr drexley to you mr drexleymiss strong mr drexley will probably be my first victim on your behalf  cicely blushed and looked timidly up at the tall bearded man who was regarding her with some interest he smiled kindly and held out his hand  i am very pleased to know you miss strong he said may i ask in what way i am to suffer on your behalf  you have the misfortune sir douglas said to be the editor of a popular magazine and you are consequently never safe from the literary aspirant i am one miss strong is another  oh mr drexley she exclaimed in some confusion please dont listen to him i have never tried to do anything except childrens fairy stories and im sure theyre not half good enough for the ibex i brought douglas two to look at but im not sure that theyre any good at all i meant to offer them to a childrens paper  nevertheless if you will allow me drexley said stretching out his hand i will take them with me and judge for myself if i can use them miss strong it will be a pleasure to me to do so if i cannot i may be able to make some suggestion as to their disposal  its awfully good of you drexley douglas declared but drexley was bowing to cicely all the gratitude the heart of man could desire was in those soft brown eyes and flushed cheeks  i see youve nearly finished drexley said i am only in time to offer you liqueurs i always take a fin instead of a savoury and i shall take the liberty of ordering one for you jesson and a creme de menthe for miss strong  youre very good douglas answered  the order was given to the headwaiter himself who stood by drexleys chair drexley raised his little glass and bowed to the girl  i drink your health miss strong he said gravely and yours jesson may i find your stories as good as i expect to  cicely smiled back at him her face was scarlet for the coupling of their names and drexleys quiet smile was significant but douglas only laughed gaily as he reached for his hat and drew cicelys feather boa around her with a little air of protection  good night drexley he said  and drexley rising to his feet bowed gravely looking into the girls face with a light in his eyes which ever afterwards haunted her when his name was mentioneda light half wistful half kindly for several minutes after they had left he sat looking idly at the bill of fare with the same look on his face there had been no such chance of salvation for him    chapter xxiv  the countess the cousin and the critic  out in the streets they paused a theatre or any place of amusement was out of the question for cicely dared not stay out later than halfpast nine then a luminous idea came to douglas  why on earth shouldnt you come to my rooms he asked i can give you some decent coffee and read you the first chapter of my novel  she hesitated but barely for a moment  it sounds delightful she admitted ill come glad to isnt it lovely to be in this great city and to know what freedom isto do what seems well and hear nothing of that everlasting other people say  its magnificent he answered  he beckoned a hansom handed her in and somehow forgot to release her hand the wheels were rubbertyred and the springs easy they glided into the sea of traffic with scarcely a sense of movement  life he said is full of new sensations holding her fingers a little tighter  it is our extreme youth she murmured gently but firmly withdrawing them in a years time all this will seem crude to you  in a years time he answered looking down at her suddenly thoughtful i will remind you of that speech  she sighed but her gravity was only for a moment she was chattering again gaily by the time they reached the street where douglass rooms were he led her up the stairs illcarpeted and narrow his room had never seemed so small and shabby as when at last they reached it and he threw the door open  she walked at once to the window the houses of parliament westminster the thames were all visible a hundred lights flashed upon the embankments and across the bridges away opposite a revolving series of illuminations proclaimed the surpassing quality of a wellknown whiskey westwards a glow of fire hung over the city from leicester square and the theatres she gazed at it all fascinated  what a wonderful view douglas she exclaimed he rose up hot from his struggles with a refractory lamp and came to her side a sound of bubbling and a pleasant smell of coffee proclaimed the result of his labours  i have never yet tired of looking at it he answered i have no blind as you see and at night i have had my writingtable here and the window open listen  he threw up the sash a deep monotonous roar almost like the incoming tide of the sea fell upon their ears  you hear it he said that is life that rolling of wheels the falling of a thousand footsteps upon the pavement men and women going to their pleasures the outcasts and the parasites bearing them company it is like the sea it is always there it is the everbeating pulse of humanity  he closed the window and led her to an easy chair  cissy he said do you know this is what we always talked of that i should write a story and read it first to you do you remember  yes she answered softly i remember  we didnt anticipate this he looked around dont judge me altogether by my surroundings to tell you the truth when i started i went too much to the other extreme i discovered i had made a mistake so i sold up and found myself in debt i am earning plenty of money but i have to economise to get clear this novel is going to set me straight  he took some loose pages up in his hand she looked over his shoulder  you havent improved a bit in your writing she exclaimed do let me type it for you  you shall with pleasure he answered i believe youre the only person who could read it  she laughed and took her coffee from him  please light a cigarette she begged i loathe the taste but the perfume is delightful  he obeyed her and she arranged the lamp so that the light fell upon the sheets which he had gathered up into his hand then she leaned back in her chair and listened                                      well  she sat up and faced him her face flushed with excitement her eyes flashing soft fires  there is nothing i can say beyond this she cried it is the sort of book which i always hoped and believed that one day you would write  you like it  like is no word it is magnificent  he laughed at her  if all my critics were like you  she sighed  i am only afraid of one thing she said when it is finished and published you will be a great man you will be so far off i think i wish that it were not quite so clever it makes me feel lonely  he came over and sat upon the arm of her chair she was very sweet very dainty very pretty  cissy he said you need never be afraid of that whatever might happen in the future i shall never enjoy an evening more than this one it rests with you to say whether we may not have many more  with me  she looked up at him quickly from where he sat he could see her bosom rising and falling quickly then he started suddenly awaycicely sat up in terror grasping the sides of her chair there was a sharp knock at the closed door  is mr jesson in a soft voice asked  who is it douglas cried in blank amazement  the door opened and a woman in a long opera cloak and rustling skirt gathered up in her hands glided in it was the countess de reuss                                      she stood in a little halo of lamplight a diamond star flashing in her hair and her neck ablaze with gems she was dressed to make her bow presently in the presence of royalty her dress decollete her figure superb her jewels famous throughout the world cicely looked at her and gaspeddouglas was speechless she herself maintained a magnificent composure although she had as a matter of fact received a shock  i admit my friend she said holding out her hand to douglas that my visit is unusual but i can assure you that i am not a ghost try my fingers they are very real  douglas recovered himself and drew a long breath  i am very glad to see you he said but if i had had any idea that you really wished to see me i would have spared you the trouble of coming to such an outlandish place  oh i can assure you that i have rather enjoyed it she answered him my coachman believes that i am mad and my maid is sure of it wont you introduce me to your friendyour sister perhaps  douglas preserved his composure  this is my cousin cicely strong he said the countess de reuss the countess de reuss was very kind to me cicely when i was ill i think i told you about her  cicely was timid and nervous nor did she at all understand the situation  the countess nodded to her kindly  you have a very clever relation she said we are all expecting great things from him now let me tell you douglas why i have come there are two men coming to see me tomorrow whom you positively must meet one is mr anderson who owns the great provincial syndicate of newspapers and pays enormous prices for letters from london the other is an american ive asked them purposely for you and you see ive taken some pains to make sure of your coming  it is very good of you douglas replied i will come of course with pleasure  at eight oclock she said gathering up her skirts into her hand now goodby young people  she nodded pleasantly and turned away douglas took the lamp and hurried to the door  you will let me see you to your carriage he said  cissy i shall only be a moment do you mind the darkness  she answered him blithely the countess laid her delicate fingers upon his arm and held up her skirts till he could see her shapely feet with diamond buckles carefully feeling for each stair  my friend she exclaimed what ill taste you have shown you are abominably lodged  i am not a chooser he answered but at least here i can pay my way  she laughed at him  bourgeois  maybe i believe my ancestors were shopkeepers  and the little cousin she said looking at him sideways  she is the dearest little girl in the world he answered heartily  i am not sure that i approve of her though the countess said gaily not at any rate if it has been she who has kept you away from me all this time  there was a more personal note in her conversation the touch of her fingers upon his arm was warm and firm thinking of these things douglas did not hear the rustle of a skirt behind him as they stepped out upon the pavement the countess saw it and kept him talking there lightly for a moment when at last she let him go and he ran upstairs he nearly dropped the lamp he was carrying in surprise for his little room was empty cicely was gone    chapter xxv  a tragic interruption  so you see my friend douglas we must dine alone try to look as though the calamity were not so great  the frown did not pass from douglass face although he made the answer which was expected of him in a sense he felt that he had been trapped opposite to him was emily de reuss in her favourite attitude leaning a little forward her hands clasped around her right knee rocking herself backwards and forwards with a slow rhythmical motion she wore a gown of vivid scarlet soft yet brilliant in its colouring her arms and shoulders were bare and a string of pearls around the neck was her only ornament dressed exactly as she now was he had once told her with honest and boyish frankness that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen that she whose wardrobe was a miracle and jewelcase the envy of every woman in london should have chosen to appear tonight in precisely the same toilette was at the same time an embarrassment and a warning to him the image of drexley rose up the sound of his despairing warning seemed still in his ears there was a colour in her cheeks a light in her eyessubtle indications that his visit was a thing looked forward to no ordinary occasion they were in one of the smaller rooms outside a round table was laid for dinner in the palmlined conservatory presently they sat there together through the glass was a dazzling view of blue sky starlit and clear within a vista of exotics whose perfume hung heavy upon the air great palms were above their heads the silver waters of a fountain rose and fell a few feet behind they were served by a single servant in the de reuss liveries of grey and silver everything on the table was daintily fashioned and perfect of its sort to douglas who at heart was passionately fond of beautiful things it seemed after his gloomy garret a retaste of paradise champagne was served to them in a long glass jug of venetian workmanship rendered cloudy by the ice like frosted ware emily herself filled his glass and pledged him a toast  to the novel she cried may it be as successful in literature as your other work has been in journalism and douglas of course youve dedicated it to me  i havent imposed a dedication upon any one he answered arent they out of date  she shrugged her shoulders her elbows were both on the table and she leaned across towards him  tell me about your story she begged there is fruit coming and coffee let me fill your glass and you shall tell me of what things you have written evil or good the things which are or the things which should be  she raised the jug and the wine fell in a little yellow shower into his foaming glass he raised it to his lips thoughtfully  it is wonderful he said that you should be so interested  in the man or his story  in either he answered as a storywriter i am altogether unproven my novel may prove an utter failure  she shook her head  you are not of the race of men who fail my dear douglas she said i think that that is why i like you  i have been as near failure as any man can go he said  it is over she answered now tell me of your story  he told her its outline she listened with slowly nodding head grasping every point quickly electrically sympathetically his slight awkwardness in speaking of his own work passed away he expatiated was coherent and convincing more than once she interrupted him her insight was almost miraculous she penetrated with perfect ease beneath his words analysed his motives with him showed him a psychological weakness in the workings of one of his characters she was liberal with her praise called his characters by their christian names as though they were old friends suggested other moves across the chessboard of his plot until he felt that he and she and those dear puppets of his own creations were denizens together of some fairy and ethereal world wandering through the fascinating maze of imaginative life it was almost an intoxication this wonderfully stimulating contact with a mind so receptive so brilliant so sympathetic he forgot his garret cicely the drear past the passionate warnings of drexley and rice as a weaver of stories he was in his first youth he had peopled but few worlds with those wonderfully precious creationsthe children of the brain they were as dear to him as the offspring of his own flesh and blood could ever be hitherto they had been the mysterious but delightful companions of his solitude there was a peculiar pleasure in finding that another too could realise them they seemed indeed to pass as they two sat there and talked of them into an actual and material existence to have taken to themselves bodily shapes the dear servants of his will delightful puppets of his own creation the colour mounted into his cheeks and the fire of hot life flashed through his pulses he drank wine again conscious only of a subtle and quickening happiness a delicious sense of full and musical life  you have given me a wonderful idea of your story she murmured nothing has charmed me so much for a long while now the only thing which i am curious about is the style  the style he repeated i dont think i have ever thought of that  and yet she said you must have modified your usual style your journalistic work i think is wonderfulstrong full of life and colour lurid biting rivetting yet i doubt whether one could write a novel like that  you can scarcely expect a hack journalist he said with a smile to write with the elegance of a walter pater yet of course i have taken painsand there is a good deal of revision to be done  she shook her head softly  revision she said never affects style the swing of a good story is never so good as in the first writing of it ah here is mr anderson  an elderly gentleman was ushered in to them he carried his hat with him and had the appearance of a man in a hurry he greeted emily with courtesy douglas with interest  ive looked in for a moment he said carriage waiting at the doorgot to speak at the institute of journalists and catch the midnight train home so this is mr jesson eh  douglas admitted the fact and the newcomer eyed him keenly  will you write me a london letter of a thousand words three times a week for ten pounds he asked abruptly  certainly if you think i can send you what you want douglas answered promptly  the countess answers for it that you can ive seen your work in the courier its exactly what i wish forpithy to the point crisp and interesting never be beguiled into a long sentence abjure politics as much as possible and read other london letters that you may learn what to avoid i cant give you better advice than this  ill try douglas declared laughing  the elderly gentleman picked up his hat declined coffee vigorously and liqueurs scornfully  ten pounds a week he said three months notice either side and no work of the same sort for any other country paper ill be frank with you i shall sell the letters out and make a profit on em a dozen newspapersll take them goodnight address here  he laid down a card and disappeared douglas looked at his companion and laughed they sat upon a lounge placed back between the fountain and the palms and drank their coffee douglas lit a cigarette  why im a rich man he exclaimed i suppose its all right  oh its quite genuine she said but you ought to have asked more money mr anderson is very odd but hes honest and liberal and a great friend of mine  ten pounds seemed such wealth he said with a sudden thought that his days in a garret were over when he chose  it is very little she repeated i could have got you more still there are some other things i have in view for you  a sudden wave of gratitude made him ashamed that he had ever for a moment listened to drexley the lunatic and rice miserable croaker he held out his hand to her  i owe you so much he said i shall never be half grateful enough  she held his fingerssurely no womans hand was ever so delicately shaped so soft so electric his fingers remained only now they enclosed hers  i do not want any word of thanks from you she said only i should like you to remember that i have tried to do what little i could for you  still their hands lingered together and douglas was thrilled through all his senses by the touch of her fingers and the soft dark fire of her eyes he held his breath for a momentthe splashing of the fountain alone broke a silence eloquent enough so fascinating indeed that he felt his breath tighten in his throat and a sudden overmastering desire to seize the embrace which some unspoken instinct seemed to denote awaited him afterwards he always felt that if no untoward thing had come then the story of his after life would surely have been painted in other colours but there came an interruption altogether unexpected marvellous tragical their hands were still joined he had turned slightly towards her so that his eyes looked into hers they were face to face with one of those psychological crises which since the days of primitiveness have made mans destiny and womans vocation ever afterwards a thought of that moment brought thrilling recollectionsthere was the suspense the footstep outside the crashing of a pistol shot through the glass douglas leaped to his feet with a cry of horror emily had sunk back upon her seat a red spot upon one of her beautiful shoulders her cheeks slowly paling into unconsciousness there was a smell of gunpowder in the air a little cloud of smoke hanging around and he had one single photographic glimpse of a mans face haggard unkempt maniacal pressed against the broken pane of glass whence the shot had come a moment afterwards when the place was full of servants and one had run for a doctor he rushed outside backwards and forwards like a madman looking in the shrubs the arbour behind seats everywhere but of the man who had fired that shot there was no trace    chapter xxvi  a visitor for douglas jesson  there followed for douglas a period of much anxiety days of fretful restlessness sleepless nights full of vague and shadowy dejection emily de reuss was ill too ill to see him or any one all callers were denied daily he left flowers and messages for herthere was no response save a repetition to him always of the doctors peremptory instructions the countess was to see no one to receive no letters to be worried by no messages absolute quiet was necessary her nerves had received a severe shock neither from the papers in the fashionable columns of which he read regretful accounts of her indisposition nor from the servants who answered his continual inquiries was there ever the slightest reference to the tragical nature of it it was obvious that she had recovered consciousness sufficiently to lay her commands upon those few who must have known and that they had been faithful her illness was announced as due to a combination of a fashionable malady and a severe nervous breakdown yet the memory of that other thing was ever before him the fierce white face with the blazing eyes pressed against the glass the flash the wreath of smoke the faint exciting smell of gunpowder and the spot of blood upon that alabaster shoulder it had been murder attempted at least no occupation could distract his thoughts from that the horror of it seemed ever chilling his veins he longed to share his knowledge with some one to talk it over with her neither was possible solitude had never oppressed him more he grew daily more nervous and hysterical  for he was all the while tormented by fears and suspicions which stalked ever by his side grim and ghostly phantoms those wan features and dark starving eyes had kindled within him from the first a hideous sense of familiarityagainst which he fought indeed but ever vainly once before he had seen them and it was at the moment when his own life had first come into touch with things tragical yet if his memory served him truthfully he was surely face to face with an insoluble enigma what had emily de reuss to do with such a man as this  as the days passed by leaving the situation unchanged he made a great effort to put all these harrowing speculations away to devote himself once more to his work which was beginning to weigh heavily upon him in a measure he was successful he was able to perform such tasks as fell to his lot during office hours with his usual exactitude though everything he wrote was marked at this time with a certain nervous energy which without detracting from its literary value was a sure indication of his own mental state but it was after the days work was over that his sufferings commenced in earnest a vigorous distaste for the society of his fellows asserted itself night after night his solitary dinner hastily snatched at an obscure restaurant he spent alone in his gaunt sittingroom his work neglected his face turned westwards his luminous eyes ever fascinated by the prospect which stretched from the dark street beneath to the murky horizon night after night his imagination peopled with shadows and spectres the great city whose lights cast a deep glow upon the brooding clouds and whose ceaseless roar of life seemed ever in his ears before him lay the unwritten pages of his novel through the open window came the sobbing and wailing the joy and excitement the ever ringing chorus of life which if only he could interpret it must make him famous for ever night after night he listened and drank it in greedily thrilled through all his senses by this near contact with the great throbbing heart of the world yet his pen was idle more than ever he realised that he had a long apprenticeship to serve there came a time when he threw down his manuscript and wandered out into the streets by such means alone could he gain knowledge and the power of knowledge  emily de reuss was still denied to him cicely seemed to have passed of her own will entirely out of his life in those days either might easily have obtained an empire over him for he was in a keenly impressionable stage of living passing through one of those crises which in men of more experience come earlier in life he was full of emotions struggling for expressionit seemed to him at last that in solitude he would never find an outlet for them if he had known where to look he would have sought for cicely at all risks he even looked for her nightly at the spot of their first meetingbut always in vain it was as though she had vanished into thin air by chance he heard of her at last she had sent some work to drexley which he had decided to accept he spoke warmly of it but when douglas asked for her address he shook his head it had come to him with the proviso of anonymous publication and his own secrecy as to her whereabouts he was able to tell douglas nothing refused even when he was pressed douglas left him with an angry exclamation upon his lips  his solitude became intolerable one night he looked out his dress clothes and dined at a large cosmopolitan restaurant where men and women of all sorts were gathered together then for the first time he realised something of the tawdriness of this life of pleasure which seemed ever calling to him through the open windows of his lonely room he had a small table to himself ordered his dinner with care and drank champagne to bring his spirits so far as possible into touch with the general atmosphere there was music playing all the while and the ripple of gay feminine voices fell constantly upon his ears women were all around him gaily dressed and bejewelled a soft voluptuous wave of enjoyment seemed floating about the place enfolding them allsave him for as he watched and listened his face grew darker and his heart heavier he felt himself out of place outside the orbit of these people very little in sympathy with them he looked at the woman sitting at the next table elegantly dressed laden with jewels whose laughter was incessant and speeches pointlessher companion found her interesting enough but douglas was conscious of nothing save her restless desire to please her little bursts of frivolous mirth and an ugly twitch of her lips which every now and then revolted him it was a chance perhaps or a mood which made him look out upon a scene ordinary enough and inoffensive through duncoloured spectacles he paid his bill and walked thoughtfully homeward thankful for the cool night air which fanned his forehead he even entered his bare sittingroom and threw up the window with a positive feeling of relief  he brought out his work lighted a cigarette and sat there smoking thoughtfully the match which kindled his lamp showed him a large square envelope on his mantelpiece he tore it open and drew out a letter it was from emily  he read it eagerly whatever its message it seemed a relief to him just then to know that his suspense was to be ended  my friendi am suffering from a slight accidentyou alone know the nature of itand from a shock the nature of which you cannot understand i am better but my doctor is an old woman he insists upon sending me away i am goingnever mind where it may be that we shall not meet again for some time i want you to think of me my dear douglas as kindly as you can it seems to me that i am a very unfortunate woman those whom i would befriend usually end by regarding me as their worst enemy do not you also lose faith in me some day i shall return and i hope to find you famous work at your novel dedicate it if no one who has more right to such an honour has come into your life to me and whatever you do remember that i am always your friend and that your success will be as dear to me as to yourself  emily de reuss  precisely the moment when such a thought came to him he could not say but before he had finished reading his attention was partially distracted by a curious and instinctive conviction he felt that he was not alonethat the solitude of his chamber high up in the building and cut off as it were from the world had been broken he ceased reading and although he was no coward he could feel his heart beating he felt a strange reluctance to turn round then the silence was broken close to his left ear sounded the click of a revolver and a mans voice came to him from out of the shadows    chapter xxvii  fellowcriminals  stand precisely as you are douglas guest if you turn your head or take a single step towards me you are a dead man  douglas was not a coward and the sound of a human voice dispelled in a moment the vague fears which had caused his heart to leap he remained immovable  under those circumstances he answered steadily i can assure you that i have not the slightest intention of moving who are you and what do you want with me  a hard little laugh again the click of a revolver  i want from you several things first of all and most important the address of the writer of that letter which you have just been reading  thats precisely douglas said what i should like to know myself the lady does not give it  you are very near death douglas guest her address  i am not in the habit of swearing douglas answered but upon my oath it is not in this letter upon my oath i do not know it  he caught the sound of a sob but when he would have turned his head there came again the sharp click of the revolver and an angry exclamation from his unseen adversary  stand as you are if by chance you should see my face i will shoot you i have killed men before and i have no love for you  then douglas knew that his assailant if not a lunatic was surely verging upon madness he looked towards the doorthe distance was too far no answer occurred to him which seemed discreet so he remained silent  as to her state of health douglas guest she has been ill  i know nothing save that she is better  have you seen her since  you were with her when she was taken ill  i was douglas answered  you know the circumstances  i know douglas said that she was the victim of a cowardly and infamous attempt at assassination  there came a mocking little laugh douglas never turned his head but he felt instinctively that his life was in dangerthat a finger was laid upon the trigger of that revolver  you are a brave man douglas guest  braver at least douglas answered than the man who shoots at women and runs away  there was the sound of a scornful laugh a step upon the floor his unbidden guest was coming from out of the shadows  you need fear no longer i am known to you i see i have put my revolver away you and i will talk for a while  douglas turned round with a little breath of relief yes it was the man whom he had expected to see pale as death with sunken eyes encircled with deep black lines one little spot of colour flaring on his cheeks shabbily dressed yet carrying in his personality still the traces of refinement he dropped into the one easy chair and douglas watched him half fascinated  you have become he continued leaning his head upon his bony fingers a man of letters i believe i congratulate you you have stepped into the whirlpool from which no man can retrace his steps yet even this is better is it not than the methodism you were not cut out i think for a parson  never mind me and my affairs douglas said hoarsely i want to have nothing to do with you i wish you no harmonly i beg that you will leave this room and that i may never see you again  the newcomer did not move  that is all very well mr guest he said but i fancy that last time we met it was as fellowcriminals eh  we were both trying to rob your father douglas answered slowly but there was a difference the money i wanted and took was mineay and more besides he had no right to withhold it as for you  well he was my father and of his own will he had never given me a halfpenny in my life surely i had a right to something  let the robbery go douglas said leaning across the table its true that i took but my ownbut no more of that at least i never raised my hand against him  the man in the chair beat with the tips of his fingers upon the table by his side he spoke in a dull unemotional tone  perhaps not but while you robbed he slept i was as gentle as you and quieter but in the midst of it he woke up and i found his eyes wide open watching me i saw his fingers stiffenin a moment he would have been upon meso i struck him down you heard him call and came back yet we neither of us thought him dead i did not wish to kill him do you remember how we stood side by side and shuddered  dont douglas cried sharply dont i wish you would go away  the man in the chair took no notice there was a retrospective light in his dark eyes he tapped upon the table again with his skinny forefinger  just a little blue mark upon his temple he continued in the same hard emotionless voice we stood and looked at it you and i it was close upon morning then you knowit seemed to grow light as we stood there didnt it you tried to bring him to i knew that it was no use i knew then that he was dead  douglas reeled where he stood and every atom of colour had left his cheeks  i wish you would go away or be silent he moaned you will send me madas you are  then the man in the chair smiled and awful though his impassiveness had been that smile was worse  it is not i who will send you mad he said she will do it in good time she has done it to othersshe has done it to me that is why i tried to kill her that is why i may not rest until i have killed her dont you know why i wanted that money she was at the priory and i walked there to see her for a moment to hear her voice i hid in the groundsit was two days before i saw her then she shrank away from me as though i were some unclean animal she would not look at me nor suffer me to speak i had no right she said to come into her presence in such a state i was to come decently dressed in my right mindthen she might talk with me but a creature in rags it wasnt kind was it i had waited so long and i was what she had made me so i went across the hills to feldwick and i wrote a note to my father he tore it into small pieces unread so i came by night a thief and you also were there by night a thief the same night too it was queer  i do not want to hear any more douglas said with a shiver i thought that you were dead  i have an excellent recipe for immortality was the slow bitter answer i desire to die  there are your sisters douglas said slowly they are in london after all you did not mean to kill him  the man shook his head  i have no sisters he said nor any kin  why not africa and a fresh start douglas said i am poor but i can help you and i can borrow a bitenough for your passage and clothes at any rate  no thanksno sign even of having heard the man had moved to the window he seemed fascinated by the view there was a silence between them then he waved his hand towards that red glow which hung like a mist of fire over the city  a cauldron he muttered a seething cauldron of stinking vice and imperishable iniquity once i lodged somewhere near here i have stood at a window like this by the hour and my heart has leaped like a boys at the sound of that roar douglas those old methodists up in the hillvillage were not so far from the truthnot so far from the truth after all how i laughed when they wagged their old grey heads and told me that the great south road was the road to hell  life is what we make it here or in the hills douglas said with a sententiousness which sounded to himself like ugly irony  the man at the window drew himself up for a moment there was a gleam of the old self  for the cattle ay douglas he answered for such as you and me it is what the woman makes it im going ive no illwill towards you but if you hinder or follow me ill shoot you like a dog  so he passed out and was lost in the byways douglas remained sitting at the window with folded arms    chapter xxviii  the little figure in black  a season of intense depression almost of melancholia came to douglas he grew more reserved than ever with his colleagues on the staff of the courier who regretted his aloofness and would gladly have drawn him into the ranks of their pleasant comradeship he avoided the club where his absence was commented upon and where he was in a fair way to become a popular member on the threshold of his ambitions when the way seemed fair before him life had suddenly become distasteful with a fierce effort of concentration he continued to work at his novel which yet progressed but slowly he spent much time sitting alone pondering upon subjects which from such a standpoint as his present one seemed terrible enough he had seen a good deal of the underneath life of london had himself suffered bitterly and he began to think of the city which now sheltered him as a city of lost souls drifting onwards to a mysterious and awful goal though he had thrown away in the moment of his revolt the shackles of his creed the religious sense was still strong in him in those dark days it became almost a torment he felt that he too was going under the springs of his ambition his lusty love of living and fighting grew weak as physically his muscles grew flaccid he thought often of strongbroken on the wheel a creature hopelessly lost was he drifting towards this one night a strange sickly excitement came over him while he sat with the pen in his hand his head swam and voices which he had almost forgotten rang in his ears little specks of red fire danced before his eyeshe lost hold upon his consciousnesshe was doubtful even of his own identity he had become a unit a lost unit and for a moment or two he babbled like a child he set his teeth walked swiftly up and down the room struggled and recovered himself yet he felt as though a dark wave had broken over his head and he were still amongst the tumbling waters he stood before the window and cried out a passionate prayerto what god he scarcely knewyet it soothed him he put on his hat hastily and walked out into the streets  afterwards he knew that he had stood that night in deadly danger a wild craving to escape from himself and his solitude by some unusual means beat against the walls of his heart so far in life from early boyhood to manhood a vigorous love for things beautiful an intense selfrespect an epicureanism half instinctive half inculcated by his country life and innate spirituality had kept him from even the thought of things evil yet tonight the mainspring of his life was out of gear it was distraction instant and immediate he craved forof any kind almost at any cost he walked blindly and a curious sense of irresponsibility possessed him the lights of a little restaurant flared in his facehe entered and called for wine he sat at a small table with champagne before him and the men and women who crowded the place looked at him curiously doggedly he filled his glass and drank some one came and spoke to himfrom whom at another time he would have turned away kindly enough but as from a leper he shared his wine talked purposelessly and listened a luminous moment came however he paid his bill and walked firmly from the place in the strand the church bells were ringing for it was sunday he turned westwards and walked rapidly towards westminster  even in the porch he hesitated since he had left he had never entered a church nor chapel the sound of the organ came pealing out to himothers were passing in in a little stream soon he too found himself in one of the back seats                                      two hours later he walked out into the cool night air a new man with head erect his brain clear swept clean of many sickly phantoms his virility was renewed he looked out once more upon life with eyes militant and brave heart he was full of the sense of having passed through some purging and beneficent experience it was not that his religious belief or disbeliefs had been affected or even quickened by anything he had heardyet from first to last those two hours had been full of delight to him the vast dimlylit building with its imposing array of statuary shadowy figures of great statesmen soldiers and priests seen by him then as it chanced for the first time woke him at once from his lethargy religion seemed brought in a single moment into touch with the great things of life there were men there who had been creedless but great genius was honoured side by side with sanctity the rolling music the pure fresh voices of the boys appealed to his sense of the beautiful as those historical associations reawakened his ambition the whiterobed priest who stood in the centre of the great building yet whose voice without effort seemed able to penetrate to its furthest corner seemed both in his personal self and in his scholarly diction exquisitely in accord with his great surroundings without a manuscript with scarcely a note he stood there calm and imposing the prototype of the modern priest pleading against worldliness for the sake of beauty and of god with delicately chosen words and exquisite imagery the calm enthusiasm of the orator always selfcontrolled and sweetly convincing seemed to douglas like the transmutation of a beautiful picture into a beautiful poem instinct with life vivid and thrilling he stayed till the sermon was over and the solemn words of the benediction pronounced till the deep throbbing notes of the organ rang down the emptying aisles then he walked out into the streets a saner and a better man  the life tingled in his veins as he walked slowly back into pagan london here the great restaurants brilliantly lighted reminded him that all day he had eaten nothing he jumped into a hansom and was driven to his rooms kept the man while he changed his clothes and drove to piccadilly here he entered a famous restaurant known to him only by name found a small table and ordered his dinner with care he leaned back and looked out upon the throng with a kindly human interest he had the feeling of having returned once more into touch with his kind a faint smile was upon his lips too long suppressed as he ate and drank the heavy barrier which had come between him and the garden of his imagination seemed to glide apart he saw away into the future of the lifestory which he was writing new images sprang up and the old ones became once more pliant and supple difficulties fell awaya singular clearness of perception seemed to come to him in those few minutes the joy of life was in his heart the zest of it between his teeth he felt the unaccustomed colour in his cheeks and an acquaintance who paused to shake hands was astonished at his affability the gay music sounded strangely to his ears after the great organ notes but in its way it too was beautiful life was meant to be beautiful he had never before felt so sure of it  the men and women who dine in public at the restaurant of the moment are usually at their best douglas was astonished at the beauty of the women their dresses and jewellery and the flowers with which their tables were smothered the gaiety of the place was infectious he too began to desire a companion he thought of emily de reusshow well she would look at his table with her matchless art of dressing and wonderful pearls he fancied too without vanity that she would approve of his companionship in his present mood and from emily de reuss his thoughts wandered on to cicely they were the only two women who had ever held any place in his life he contrasted them and grew thoughtful  later he paid his bill lighted a cigar and strolled homewards already his brain was at work the scenes of his story lay stretched invitingly before himit seemed that he would only have to take up his pen and write until exhaustion came he turned off the strand humming softly to himself so wrapt in his world of teeming fancies that he did not notice the little figure in sober black who looked eagerly into his face as she approached he would have passed on but for her timid word of remonstrance  douglas  then he stopped short it was cicely    chapter xxix  joan strong finds her brother  douglas threw away his cigar and held out both his hands the trouble passed from cicelys face his tone was full of pleasure and his eyes were radiant  what fortune cissy he cried you were the last person in my thoughts thank god that i have found you again  you are sure you wanted to see me she asked with some timidity  absolutely he answered  i was foolish to run awaythat evening  it was too bad of youand to keep away  i think that your visitor frightened me douglas  he laughed  then you need have no more fears he said she has gone abroad  do you have manyladies to see you she asked  she has never been before or since he answered  cicely laughed  i was foolish she said i will ask no more questions  they had reached the railings and he pointed downwards to the gardens below  there is an empty seat he said shall we go there and sit down  she nodded  anywhere joan is out i need not go home for an hour  still he asked with a grim smile searching  cicely did not smile it was the tragedy of her life to see her sister once devoted purely to domestic interests quicktongued cleanly severe calvinistic spend fruitless hours day by day seeking a futile vengeance joan she had always thought of as a typical farmers housewifesevere with her tongue perhaps shrewd and a trifle of a scold but this woman who walked the streets of london in her solemn black clothes palefaced untiring ever with that same glitter in her eyes was a revelation she turned to douglas suddenly  douglas she said did joan care for you very much  i should not have said so he answered she was willing to marry me when your father ordered it you know what our engagement was like we were called into the parlour the sunday morning before iiyou remember my trial sunday at feldwick  well he just turned to joan and said joan it is my will that you marry douglas she was evidently prepared for she held out her hand to me  i am willing douglas she said that was all as for me i was certainly weak but for the life of me i could think of nothing to say then the chapel bell began to ring and we were hurried away and your father solemnly announced our engagement as the people came together there was not any lovemaking if that is what you mean  yet i think she said that joan must have cared i sometimes think that it is not the man whom she believes to have killed father for whom she seeksit is for the man who slighted her  i hope he said gravely that she may never find either let us forget that such a person exists  willingly she answered with a little shrug of the shoulders what shall we talk about  ourselves  first of all then why are you in evening dress on a sunday  been out to dinner he answered let me tell you all about it  he tried to let her understand something of the period of depression through which he had passed and he found her as ever wonderfully sympathetic quick to comprehend keenly interested they talked of his novel he told her of his new ideas of the fancies which had come dancing into his brain during the last few hours but she was perhaps more moved than at any time when he spoke of that wonderful visit of his to the abbey he tried to make her feel what it had meant to him and in a measure he succeeded suddenly he stoppedalmost in the middle of a sentence he was astonished to realise how pretty she was  now tell me about yourself he said have you sent anything to drexley yet  she nodded  i think mr drexley is quite the nicest man i know she declared gaily i sent him three little fairy tales and last week he sent me a cheque for them and asked for more and do you know what he said douglas i asked him to let me have his honest opinion as to whether i could make enough to live on by such work as i sent him and he replied that there could be no possible doubt about it he wants me to write something longer  he took her handwhich she yielded to him franklyand forgot to restore it he was honestly delighted he noticed too that her fingers were very shapely and their touchshe had withdrawn her glovesa pleasant thing  cissy he said i must see more of you we are comrades and fellowworkers we have begun to do the things we talked about up amongst the hills in the old days do you remember how we lay in the heather and the dreams we had actually i believe that they are coming true  her dark eyes were soft with reminiscences and her face was brilliant with smiles  it sounds delightful cousin douglas she replied oh if only joan would come to her senses it seems like a thunderbolt always hanging over us i believe that if she were to see us together she would go mad  i have little to reproach myself with as regards joan he said of course that night must always be a black chapter in my life i could not get to london without money and i took only a part of what was my own i need not tell you cicely that i never raised my hand against your father  her fingers closed upon his  i believe you douglas but there is something i must ask  whilst we are talking of it ask me then we will put the subject away for ever  do you know who it was  his face grew very pale and stern  i believe i do he answered  and you are shielding him your silence is shielding him is it not  i am doing more he said i destroyed my own identity and the douglas guest of feldwick is an accounted murderer by others besides joan i can tell you only this cissy i did it because it seemed to me the best and the most merciful thing to be done  she looked at him gravely  he was my father douglas and though i am not like joan yet i too would have justice done  there are things he added which you do not know there are things which i pray that you may never know  it is hard to understand she said  it is better not to understand he answered it is even better for joan to believe what she does that is all i can tell you  they sat in silence for a while there was a frown on cicelys face she was not wholly satisfied and from the river with its fringe of yellow lights came the whistling of tugs as they passed out on their way to the ocean and the flashing of strange illuminations on her dark bosom  then suddenly cicely started forward on the seat her fingers seized his arm with a feverish grip she gazed with distended eyes at the grim form coming slowly along in the centre of the asphalted path it was joan who came towards them their surprise was too greather coming too sudden for words only douglas felt a small hand steal into his and cicely in spite of her mortal terror experienced a pleasant sense of protection as those strong fingers closed over hers  joan was fifty yards away level with another seat on which a solitary man had been sitting in a slouching attitude as she drew near him the two who were watching with fascinated eyes saw him draw himself upright and then shrink suddenly back but he was too late joans eyes had lighted upon him she stopped short the mans attempt at evasion was obvious in a moment she was at his side  david she cried david  he rose up and would have slunk off but she caught him by the arm he shook her away but there was no escape he looked around like a hunted animal she sat down by his side and he was a prisoner  come douglas whispered  they rose up and went off together    chapter xxx  david and joan  joan  well david  you have had your way with me i have suffered you to bring me here to make me eat and drink now i am ready to go  but where you do not look as though you had any settled lodging we can find you a room here for awhile you have not told me yet how it is that you are alive after all  he pushed back a mass of tangled hair and looked at her grimly  so it was father who told you that i was dead eh  four years ago david ay and more than that  he was a very hard man david strong said four years ago i wrote to himi had a chancei wanted a few pounds only to make a decent appearance that was his answer to me there came none  he did what he believed to be right joan said you disobeyed him in going away  it is true he answered  the man began to move about the room glancing every now and then towards the door with a certain restlessness he had come once more under the influence of the one person who in his earlier life had always dominated him she had brought him along unwilling and feebly protesting he began to wonder how he should get away  you will stay here david she said you have not yet seen cicely  he shook his head  no i am not fit for the company of respectable people you do not know how low i have fallen i have lost my caste i live only for one purpose when that is accomplished i mean to die  that is very foolish talk for a man she remarked calmly i too have a purpose in life but when it is accomplished i mean to live on to live more fully  he smiled mockingly  there is yet nothing of kinship between us he said for between your purpose and mine there could be no more comparison than between a street puddle and feldwick farm it is a life i seek  i would to god david she cried fiercely that it were the same life for at the end of my purpose is death  he gazed at her speechless for the first time the change in her was brought home to him the stern lines in her face had become rigid and cruel a new light shone in her eyes joan the domineering had become joan the tragical he listened to her fascinatedand his limbs shook with fear  can you wonder what it is david you have tasted the bitterness of strange happenings and you have almost forgotten your name and whence you came it is your task which i have made mine yet it is not too late for you if you will help  speak out he whispered hoarsely  you knew of fathers death  you knew that he was robbed and murdered  the man who was lurking so far as he could in the shadows of the room said nothingbut his eyes seemed to become like balls of red fire and his livid cheeks were horrible to look upon even joan was startled  you knew of these things david she cried  ay he answered i knew what of it  can you ask you have drifted far away from us david yet you too are a strong and the last of our race he was murdered and as yet the man who slew him goes unpunished can you ask me then what should be the purpose of my life it is to see him hang  she had risen to her feet a grim threatening figure in the unshaded lamplight the yellow glare fell upon her hard set face her tightly compressed lips and black eyebrows of a sudden david realised her strange and wonderful likeness to the dead man his own bloodless lips parted and the room rang with horrid laughter surely the laughter of a lunatic  oh it is a wonderful purpose that he cried to see him hanghang by the neck bah what concern of yours joan is it i wonder  i am his daughter  and i his son and listen my sister here is news for you it was no living man at whose door his death lies but at a womans a womans i tell you you understand i swear it  she looked at him doubtfully surely he was raving  a womans david  ay a womans and there are others tooher victims look at me i myself am one her victim body and soul corrupt if one could only reach her throat  even joan shuddered at the look which seemed to her devilish joan whose nerves were of iron and in whom herself the lust for vengeance was as the cry for blood yet this was not possible  i think that you are raving she said did you not know that douglas guest disappeared that night and was never more heard ofay that there was money missing  douglas guest took but his own he answered it is the woman who is guilty  she was bewildered  woman david why there was none who would have harmed a hair of his head  again he laughed and again she turned pale with the horror of that unearthly merriment  you see but a little way sister joan he said and the vengeance you cry for is in other hands as for douglas guest leave him alone he is as guiltless as you are  you have told me so much she said firmly you must tell me more how comes it that you know these things  he shuddered his lips moved but she did not catch the sound of words he was apparently in a state of collapse she reached brandy from a cupboard and forced some between his teeth  be strong david she whispered and tell me of these things  he sat up and with his incoherent words came the birth to her of a new and horrible suspicion  i had to have money he muttered she drove me to it she turned me away i was in rags an illlooking object but i never meant that douglas was before me and he knows it  his head fell back he was unconscious joan rang the bell and sent the maid for a doctor yet when he recovered and learnt what she had done he refused flatly to see him  a doctor he muttered would feel my forehead and ask me questions their madhouses are full enough without me ive work to do yet  she spoke to him soothingly as to a child  david she said we have a little moneynot much but such as it is you must share i cannot have you go about starved or in rags  he staggered up  im off keep your money ive no use for it  she stood in front of the door her jaws were set and there was a bright hard light in her eyes  youll not go yet she said youve a secret youre keeping from me its my concern as well as yours well talk of it together david  ill talk of it with no living soul he answered thickly out of my way  but joan neither moved nor quailed  they will have it that douglas guest was killed she said i have never believed it i do not believe it now he is keeping out of the way because of what he did that night  ay he muttered likely enough  we must find him she continued day by day we have searched you shall help if he be not guilty he knows the truth and he hides so i say that if he lives we must find him  guilty enough he muttered he is in her toils let me pass sister joan  you have seen him she cried you know that he is alive  ay alive he answered hes alive  you have seen him  yes  tell me where and when by chance he said hesitatingin the streets  she wrung her hands  have i not walked the streets she moaned till my feet have been sore with blisters and my head dizzy yet i have never met him  he stood with his hand upon his chin thinking as well as he might what did he owe to douglas guest the friend of emily de reuss successful where he had failed had he not seen their hands joined he drew a breath which sounded like a hiss  i thought he muttered that it had been a woman yetwho knows it may have been douglas guestand joan there was truth in your thought he lives i cannot tell you where i cannot help you find him for i have another task yet he lives i tell you that now let me go  her eyes flashed with something which was like joy she had forgotten davids wandering words all the time her instincts had been true  let me go joan  she laid her hands upon his shoulders  we are brother and sister she said and what is mine is yours stay and share with me share the little we have and let cissy nurse youay and share our vengeance  she was flung on one side off her guard for a moment he had pushed past her with unexpected strength  david she cried david  but she heard only his footsteps upon the stairs swift and stealthy in the hall he turned and looked up at her she was leaning over the banisters  take some money at least she said see i have dropped my purse  he watched it where it lay within a few feet of him burst open with the drop and with the gleam of gold showing from one of the compartments he made no movement to pick it up it seemed to her that as he passed out he shrank from it from the window she watched him turn the corner of the street and vanish in the shadows    chapter xxxi  drexley foresees danger  it was housedinner night at the club and there was a larger gathering even than usual douglas was there lighthearted and in capital spirits taking his first holiday for a week things were going well enough with him now his novel was nearly finished and the last few articles he had written for the courier had brought a special visit from rawlinson who had patted him on the back and raised his salary he felt like a man who had buffeted his way through the rough waters into the smooth shelter of the harbouralready he had almost forgotten how near they had come to closing over his head spring was coming and the love of life was once more hot in his veins westwards the chestnuts were budding and the lilac was in blossom london was beginning to raise herself with a great yawn and to remember that at this season of the year at least she had a place amongst the beautiful cities of the world douglas goodnatured always tonight particularly happy saw drexley standing alone as usual by the terrace window and crossed over to his side  play me a game of billiards drexley he exclaimed ive only half an hour to spare  drexley turned his head only just sufficiently to see who it was that addressed him  is that you jesson he said no thanks i gave up billiards long ago  douglas remained by his side  they tell me he remarked that two years ago you were the best player in the club why dont you keep it up  lost interest was the brief reply you cant do things well that you dont care about can you  douglas forgot to answer he was aware that his companion was watching some onea shabby wan figure leaning over the palisading which bordered the terrace below his own heart gave a throb he knew at once who it was  david he exclaimed  drexley turned upon him sharply  you know him  douglas nodded  yes he said it is david strong he is mad  you know that it was he  yes drexley drew a long breath  look at him he said softly tonight he is safequite harmless some one has been giving him money he is quite drunk thank god  douglas stared at himsurprised  drunk drexley explained quietly he is safe he will curl down in some odd corner somewhere soon and sleep till morning there are other times when i have followed him about for hours when i have seen the knife bulge in his pocket and known that murder was in his heart i have dogged him about the streets then till daylightfrom her house to theatre steps to concert rooms restaurants and private houses anywhere where he imagined that she might be i have seen him loiter about the pavements for hours when the canvas archway and awning has been put out from one of the great westend houses just in the hope that she might be amongst the guests so far he has been unlucky but some day i feel that for all my watching they will meet and then may god help her you have influence over her jesson i wish you would persuade her to have him put under restraint she could identify him quite well as the man who shot at her on the terrace of her house and so could you or if she will not do this she might keep away from england for a few more months  influence over her douglas repeated with a sudden bitterness in his tone i have so much that although i was with her on that terrible evening and have written to her time after time i have never had a line from her since she left england  drexley laughed oddly  you too he exclaimed your day is over then well it was a short and a merry one you bear it well my young friend  douglas shrugged his shoulders but avoided drexleys earnest gaze  emily de reuss was very kind to me he said but she is not the only woman in the world for those who have known her drexley said none can come after  then i must be one of those who have never known her douglas answered with a lightness which sounded natural enough for i am going to take the most charming little girl in london to the theatre tonight  drexley pointed downwards the slouching figure which they had been watching had half collapsed against the railings he was obviously overpowered with drink  he was once like that drexley said as young and eager and confident as you when she was first unkind he laughed and tried a week in paris but he came back always there is the coming back it was the same with young morrisonwith meit will be the same with you it creeps into the blood and no mans will nor any other womans can rid you of it  douglas had already repented of that instinct of good nature which had led him to address drexley a spectre which for months he had been doing his best to stifle was stalking once more by his side  he turned away abruptly  well he said i think youre talking rot i shall go down and see whether anything can be done for that poor wretch there  drexley turned and clutched him by the shoulder  dont he said at least listen to me for a moment strong was in my office once i knew him at his best i watched his decline i have known him always hes absolutely beyond help from you or me or any living person three times i have given him the money to emigrate and he has pocketed it and laughed at me he has no conscience nor any sense of honour his life or what is left of it is a desirea desire to kill he would take your money and spend it in bribing servants or in procuring fresh weapons in any case it would go towards helping him in his horrible purpose propose to kill him if you like and i am with you at all risks but dont go near him dont give him money  douglas lit a cigarette and turned his back to the window  very well he said i will forget him you had better do the same  drexley nodded slowly  for tonight perhaps he said tomorrow it will begin again i watch him all my spare time even then i scarcely dare open a morning paper  douglas looked at him suddenly moved by the mans wonderful faithfulness of his own sufferings he seemed oblivious  what are you going to do tonight drexley he asked  drexley shrugged his shoulders  sit about here he answered smoke and drink i suppose till eleven and then go home not that im complaining theres nothing else i care to do  douglas laid his hand upon his shoulder  look here he said ive an idea im taking miss strong and a friend to the gaiety we want a fourth and i was just looking round for a man come with us  drexley laughed grimly  youre talking nonsense he said very good of you of course he added but you must please excuse me that sort of things not in my way at all  douglas was persistent  theres no reason why it shouldnt be in your way he said you know miss strong and ill look after the other girl ive a fancy to have you come  drexley took up a paper  go and pick up one of the young men he said there are plenty of them who will be glad to spend the evening with miss strong as for me its out of the question i should only be a wet blanket  you or no one drexley douglas said taking out his watch look here youve twenty minutes to change your clothes the girls are calling here at eight oclock hurry please  i shall do nothing of the sort drexley snorted theres molyneux ask him ive an engagement later on  douglas took out his watch again  youve only eighteen minutes now he said i know youll keep them waiting                                      for the first half an hour it was doubtful whether the evening was going to be a success drexley was gloomy and had not altogether lost the air of having been forced to do something which bored him he was polite but monosyllabic and gloomy and his interest in the play was obviously feigned douglas wisely left him to cicely and devoted himself to her little friend and he soon had the pleasure of seeing drexley thaw cicely only laughed at his momentary lapses and she was far too charming a companion to be ignored before the first act was ended she had conquered drexley was watching her with a quiet smile upon his lips amused at her eagerness answering her many questions readily in the corridor after the play was over he touched douglas on the shoulder  you are all coming to the milan to supper with me he said miss strong and i arranged it after the second act and i sent a commissionaire down for a table  cicely laughed up at him  isnt it delightful she exclaimed milly and i are so hungry and were dying to see the milan will you bring milly in another hansom  douglas nodded and lit a cigarette he wondered whether after all this experiment was going to be such a brilliant success    chapter xxxii  a supper at the milan and a meeting  drexley a travelled man of fastidious tastes and with ample means to gratify them proved a delightful host in his earlier days he had been a constant dinerout he understood the ordering of impromptu meals and he had that decision and air which inspires respect even in a headwaiter he marshalled his little party to the table reserved for them waved away the table dhote card and ordered his dishes and wine with excellent judgment and consideration for the tastes of his guests it was all most delightfuldelightfully novel to cicely and her friend delightful to drexley who was amazed to find that the power of enjoyment still remained with him the soft strains of music rose and fell from a small but perfectly chosen hungarian band out on the balcony the hum of conversation grew louder and merrier at every moment the champagne flashed in their glasses and a younger drexley occupied the place of their kindly but taciturn host douglas to whom fell the entertaining of cicelys friend was honestly delighted at the change but in the midst of it came a crushing blow emily de reuss walked into the room  as usual she was marvellously dressed a stately glittering figure in a gown of shimmering black which seemed at every moment on fire her beautiful neck and shoulders were uncovered and undecorated she walked between a greyheaded man who wore the orders of an ambassador and a blue sash on his evening clothes and his wife every one turned to look at her every one was watching when she stopped for a moment before drexleys table but every one did not see the flash in her eyes and the sudden tightening of her lips as she recognised the little party yet she was graciousness itself to them and douglas was the only one who noticed that first impulse of displeasure she rested her fingers almost affectionately on drexleys shoulder and the new flush of colour in his cheeks faded into sallowness at her touch  here are two at least of my friends who have proved faithless she said lightly i have been abroad forah how long it seemsone two three months and neither of you has bidden me welcome back to this wonderful city  we are not magicians douglas answered and as yet i am sure there is no paper which has chronicled your return only yesterday i was told that you were at vienna  never she said smiling into his face never under any circumstances believe anything anybody ever says about me i have to tell that to my friends in order that i may keep them tell me have you begun the country letters yet for mr anderson  i send my first one away on thursday douglas answered  you will send me a proof  if i may with pleasure  she turned to drexley  and you my friend she said how have things gone with you the ibex is as good as ever i bought this months at a kiosk in buda you must get mr jesson to write you more stories as good as no mans land  drexley looked up at her with a grim smile twitching at the corners of his lips  yes he said quietly it was a good story although i am afraid we rather humbugged jesson about it im not at all sure that hell trust us with another  she returned drexleys look with a stare of noncomprehension it was the first sign of revolt from one in whom she had thought all along such a thing dead then with a pleasant nod to douglas she passed on threading her way slowly amongst the tables to where her friends were waiting it was not until after she had gone that the two men realised how utterly she had ignored their two companions  they took up the thread of their conversationand it was the unexpected which intervened drexley relaxed still further there was a quiet humour in everything he said he took upon his shoulders the whole entertainment of the little party the coming of emily de reuss might well have been a matter of indifference to him with douglas it was strangely different to him she had never seemed more beautiful the fascination of her near presence her voice her exquisite toilette crept into his blood he was silent at first a bright light gleamed in his eyes he watched her continually a sense of aloofness crept over him he spoke and ate mechanically scarcely noticing that he was drinking a good deal more wine than usual once he glanced quickly at cicely her cheeks were flushed and she was looking her besthe saw only her imperfections her prettiness after all was ordinary her simple evening gown even to his inexperienced eyes suggested the home dressmaker that slight tenderness for her which only a few days ago had seemed such a pleasant thing seemed suddenly swept away in the broad flood of a passion against which unconsciously he had long been struggling he forced himself after a while to share in their conversation he joined in their laughter and listened to drexleys stories but all the time with a sense of inward excitement which he found it hard to conceal coffee and cigarettes were served at drexleys suggestion out in the palm court attached to the restaurant afterwards when the girls rose to leave douglas was conscious for the first time of a look of reproach in cicelys dark eyes he pretended to ignore ithe felt that any sort of response just then was impossible the girls refused any escort home they drove away in a hansom and drexley remained upon the pavement listening to the echo of their farewell speeches as to a very pleasant thing he turned back with a rare smile upon his lips and laid his hand upon douglass shoulder  your cousin is charming jesson he said ill never be able to thank you enough for this evening for the first time i have felt that after all there may be a chance for me  im very glad douglas answeredvery glad indeed  drexley looked at him curiously  youre not quite yourself this evening jesson he remarked  im all right which way are you goingto the club  drexley shook his head  back to my rooms he answered i shall have a pipe and go to bed i havent slept well lately tonight i think i shall  they were parted by a stream of outcoming people and douglas took advantage of the opportunity to slip away a little way along the street a small brougham which was very familiar to him was waiting  twenty grosvenor square he said hailing a hansom  he was driven through the seething streets along piccadilly all on fire with its streams of people carriages and brilliant lights and arriving at the corner of the square jumped out he walked slowly up and down the pavement he could feel his heart thumping with excitement his cheeks were burning with an unusual colour he cursed himself for coming yet the sound of every carriage which turned the corner sent the blood leaping through his veins he cursed himself for a fool but waited with the eagerness of a boy and when her brougham came into sight he was conscious of an acute thrill of excitement which turned him almost dizzy supposingshe were not alone he forgot to draw back into the shadows as at first had been his intention but stood in the middle of the pavement so that the footman who jumped down to open the carriage door looked at him curiously she was within a few feet of him when she stepped out  douglas she exclaimed is that you  may i come in or is it too late  she looked into his face and the ready assent died away upon her lips he noticed her hesitation but remained silent  of course she said slowly what have you done with your friends  they have gone home he answered shortly i came on here i wanted to see you  they passed into the house and to her little sittingroom where a couch was drawn up before a tiny fire of cedar wood and her maid was waiting emily dismissed her almost at once and throwing herself down lighted a cigarette  sit down my friend and smoke she said i will tell you if you like about my travels and then i must hear about the novel  but douglas came over and stood by her side his eyes were burning with fire and his voice was tremulous with emotion as he replied  afterwards i have something else to say to you first    chapter xxxiii  a misunderstanding  the cigarette dropped from her fingers she sat up then he saw that she too was agitated there was an unusual spot of colour in her cheeks her breathing was certainly less regular the variance from her habitual placidity encouraged him he scarcely hesitated for a moment  youll think im insane he began i dont care theres drexley heartbroken that other poor wretch mad and others that they have told me of do you know that these men are your victims emily de reuss  myvictims  ay now listen i will absolve you from blame i will say that the fault was theirs that your kindness was meant for kindness and nothing else a proof if you will of a generous nature what does it matter these men have poured out their lives upon the altar of your vanity they have given you their love and you have given themnothing i honestly believe nothing i will believe that theirs was the fault that you are not heartless nor vain nor indifferent only i am not going to be as these men emily i love youno one but you you always and you shall be mine or i will leave your doors for ever and crush down every thought of you a curse upon friendship and such rubbish you are a beautiful woman far above mebut at least i am a manand i love youand i will have you for my own or no other woman  he bent down snatched hold of her hands and drew her face towards his his heart leaped in quick fierce beats at least she was not indifferent her cheeks were flushed and her eyes marvellously soft she did not repulse him nor did she yield herself at once to his embrace she looked up at him with wet eyes and a curious smile  my friend she said do you wish to take me by storm what is all this you are sayingand why do you look so fierce  because i am desperate dear he answered because i am alone with you the woman i love and because a single word from you can open the gates of heaven for me dont think i am too rough i will not hold you for a moment if you bid me let you go see you are free now you shall answer me or i will read your silence as i chooseand  his arms were around her waist her face was turned away but he saw the glitter of a tear in her eyes and he was very bold he kissed it away  emily he cried you care for mea little you are not heartless dear i will wait for you as long as you like  she unclasped his hands and drew a little away from him but he did not lose heart for though her smile was a wistful one her eyes were soft with unshed tears and her face was the face of a woman  douglas she said will you listen to me for a moment you spoke of those other men you charged me with heartlessness perhaps you were right what then  the brutal selfishness of love and of youth swept from his memory strongs broken life and drexleys despair  nothing he cried so long as you will care for me i am not your judge i want youyou emily and your love tonight i care for nothing else  she laid her soft fingers upon his eager face half caressingly half in repulse  i never wished them harm she said i was interested in their work and to me they were merely units so they called me heartless i was only selfish i let them come to me because i like clever people about me and society requires just such an antidote when they made love to me i sent them away or bade them remain as friends but that does not necessarily mean that i am without a heart  i never want to think of them again he murmured all that i want in this world is that you tell me that you care for me  she looked into his face eager passionate almost beautiful in its intensity and smiled only the smile covered a sigh  if i tell you that douglas she said will it be kindness i wonder i wonder  say it and i will forget everything else in the world he begged  then i think that i docare for you douglas if  he stopped her wordsshe gave herself up for a moment to that long passionate kiss then she withdrew herself but for him the whole world was lit with happiness he had heard the words which more than anything else he desired to hear she could never take them back her melancholy was a miasma he would laugh it away with her  douglas she said it was because i fancied that you were beginning to care for me and because i knew that i cared for you that i went awaynot because i was afraid  he looked puzzled then he spoke slowly  emily is it because i am poor and unknown i am no fit husband for you i know yet i love you and if you care i will make you happy  it is not that she answered  he rose to his feet a darker shade was upon his face and his eyes were lit with fire a new look of resolution was in his face his lower jaws were knit together with a sullen strength  emily he said there is nothing in this world which i will suffer to come between you and me i have been lonely all my daysfatherless motherless friendless now i have found you and i know how bitterly i must have suffered if there are battles to fight i will fight them if you would have me famous first i will make myself famous but no power in this world or any other shall take you away from me again tell me what it is you fear why do you hesitate i am a man and your lover and i can bear to hear anything but you belong to me remember that i wont part with you i wont be denied    and i love you so much emily  she rose too and her arms went round his neck she drew his lips to hers and kissed him  there she murmured you talk as i love to hear a man talk    andi too have been very lonely sometimes douglas  you have had so many friends such a beautiful life he answered  she smiled at him  dear she said do you think any of these things are worth a moments consideration to a woman against the love of the man she cares for we are all the same though some of us do not wear our hearts upon our sleeves the longing for love is always there and the women who go hungry for it through life are the women to be pitied douglas i would change places with that simple darkeyed little girl you were with this evening ifif i could marry you tomorrow is that too bold  he started away a sudden fear wrenched at his heartstrings he looked at her wildly  do you mean that you will not be my wifethat you care for me but not enough to marry me he cried she shook her head slowly  no dear she said for if i were a princess and you were a shopkeeper i would marry you and be proud of my husband dont think so meanly of me as that there is anothera more powerful reason  tell it me he begged dont keep me in suspense  she thrust her arm through his and led him gently to the sofa  douglas wont you trust me i want to keep my secret for a little while listen it shall not keep us apart but i cannot be your wife yet dearly though i would love to be  the old mistrust blazed up in the man drexleys cynicism strongs ravings came back to him he too was to be fooled her love was a pretence he was simply a puppet to yield her amusement and to be thrown aside  the truth he cried roughly emily remember that i have seen men made mad for love of you have heard them curse your deceit and heartlessness ill forget it all but you must trust me prove to me that you cannot marry me and ill wait ill be your slave my life shall be yours to do what you will with but ill have the truth ill have no lonely nights when doubts of you creep like hideous phantoms about the room and drexley and strong come mocking me oh forgive me but you dont know what solitude is be merciful emily trust me  she had turned white the hands she held out to him trembled  douglas she cried if you have any love for me at all you must have faith in me too it shall not be for long in less than a year you shall know everything and until then you shall see me when you will you shall be the dearest person in the world to me  i want the truth he pleaded emily if you send me away youll send me into hell i darent have any doubts theyd drive me mad be merciful tell me everything  she was very white very cold yet her voice shook with passion  douglas you have called me heartless you were nearer the truth than you thought perhaps you are the first man whom i have ever cared for it is all new to me dont make me crush it dont destroy what seems like a beautiful dream you can be patient for a little while can you not you shall be my dearest friend my life shall be moulded as you willlisten i will swear that no one in this world shall ever have a single word of love from me save you dont wreck our lives dear just from an impulse do you know you have saved me from a nightmare i am older than you douglas and i was beginning to wonder to fear whether i might not be one of those poor unfortunate creatures to whom god has never given the power to love anythingand life sometimes was so cold and lonely you could light it all for me dear with your love you have shown me how different it could be dont go away  it is an easy thing i ask he cried hoarsely i have given you my whole lovemy whole life i want yours  you are the only man dear she answered whom i have ever loved and i do love you  your life too every corner of it i want it swept clear of shadows you need have no fear if you were a murderess or if every day of it was black with sin my love could never alter he cried  dearest she whispered havent i told you that you shall take my life into your keeping and do with it what you will  he unwound her arms  and the past  everything you shall knowtheres nothing terrifyingsave that one thingand that before long  is it like this he cried that you have kept men in chains beforewatched them go mad for sport ill not be your slave emilyshut out from your confidencewaiting day by day for god knows what  she drew herself up a storm of passion blazed in her face the new tenderness which had so transfigured it had passed away  then go she ordered pointing to the door you make a mockery of what you call love i never wish to see you again douglas jesson  he stood facing her for a moment without movement then he turned and walked slowly out of the house    chapter xxxiv  the wooing of cicely  the completion of douglas jessons novel was the principal event of the following week there had come no word from emily de reuss nor had douglas himself sought her better he told himself to face his suffering like a man grapple with it once and for all than to become even as drexley and those others who had never found strength to resist she was beautiful magnetic fascinating and he loved her on the other hand there was his selfrespect and the strength of his manhood he was young he had courage and a careersurely the battle would go for him but the days which followed were weary and the nights were pitiless  he finished his novel doggedly and conscientiously the great publishing house who had been waiting for it had pledged themselves to produce it within a month and douglas was everywhere pursued with little bundles of proofs requiring immediate attention these and his work at the courier kept him fairly occupied during the day but the night time was fast becoming a season of terror he tried theatres music halls the cluball vainly for there were always the silent hours before the dawn when distraction was impossiblehours when he lay with hot wideopen eyes and looked back upon that little scenesaw emily with her hands outstretched towards him and that new light upon her face heard her changed tone saw the wonderful light in her eyes felt the thrilling touch of her lips after all was he not a foola quixotehe to dare to make terms with her who offered him her lovehe unknown poor of humble birthshe an aristocrat to the fingertips rich beautiful famous what a gulf between them she had stretched out her hands to help him across and he had lingered bargaining he leaped from his couch and stood before his window he would go to her at onceher love he would have on any terms until she was weary of him and the measure of his life should be the measure of those days he would have his day and die then the empty streets the curling white mists the chill vaporous breeze and the faroff sickly lights gleaming down the riverside reminded him that many hours must come before he could see her and with the later morning came fresh resolutionsthe moment of weakness was gone  one night he did an act of charity he brought home to his rooms a homeless wanderer whom he had found discharged from a night in the cells gave him his own bedroom and sent for a doctor and nurse from them he learnt that so far as emily de reuss was concerned there was nothing more to be feared from david strong his days were numbered at last and the end was very near so douglas would hear nothing of a hospital and spent weary nights at the dying mans side for which and his act of charity he had soon an ample reward  one morning a grinning youth invaded his sanctum at the courier with the information that a lady wished to see him the walls spun round and his heart leaped with delirious hope but when he reached the waitingroom it was cicely who rose smiling to greet him cicely in the smartest clothes she had ever worn and a new hat looking as dainty and pretty as a picture but it was cicelynot the woman for whose coming he would have given years of his life  she herself was too happy to notice the sudden fall in his countenance her piquant little face was beaming she held out a pearlgloved hand to him  douglas she exclaimed i have come to take you out to lunch it was a bargain remember i have just drawn a cheque from the ibex for twenty pounds  twenty pounds he repeated with mock reverence heavens what affluence will you walk round with me and wait while i change  why yes i came early in case you wanted to go to your rooms first do you know ive been to the milan and chosen my table theres a lovely band playing and its all quite a fairy tale isnt it  he laughed and they went out together into the street she looked at him with sudden gravity youre not well douglas never better he assured her gaily she shook her head you havent been worrying about joan  never think of her he answered truthfully she sighed  i wish i didnt douglas i didnt mean to talk of this just now for its a horrid subject and today is a fete day but supposing joan finds you out could she make them arrest you  not a doubt about it he answered if she chose  and afterwards  well it wouldnt be pleasant he admitted i think i should get out of it but it might be awkward and in getting out of it i might perhaps bring more pain upon joan than any she has suffered yet  did any one kill father douglas  he hesitated  i didnt  do you know who did  im afraid i can guess  she was silent for a moment then they turned off into the side street where his rooms were and she passed her arm through his  there now im going to banish that and all unpleasant subjects she declared do you know i feel ridiculously lighthearted today douglas i warn you that i shall be a frivolous companion  youll be a very welcome one he answered there was never a time when i wanted you so much ive finished my novel and i have a fit of the blues  it is your own fault she said it is because you have not been to see me for a fortnight  and i wonder how much you have missed me all that fortnight tell me what you have been doing  she looked at him sideways he almost fancied that she was blushing  tuesday night mr drexley took me out to dinner and we went to the lyceum she said  he stopped short upon the pavement  what  she looked up at him demurely  why you dont mind do you douglas mr drexley is a friend of yours isnt he he has been so kind  the devil he has douglas muttered amazed and how many more times have you seen him during the fortnight i wonder  wellonce or twice she admitted  any more dinner parties  we went to richmond one afternoon mr drexley rows so nicely he introduced me to his sister  never knew he had one douglas muttered  here we are come in and sit down while i change  douglas was not long over his toilet when he returned he was inclined to be thoughtful for no earthly reason he could think of cissys friendship with drexley irritated him he did not understand it he had looked upon drexley as a man whose emancipation was an impossibility for whom there was no hope of any further social life was it possible that he could be seriously attracted by cicely he watched her with this thought all through luncheon and gradually there crept into his mind a fuller and more complete appreciation of her unmistakable charm all the time she was chattering gaily to him chasing away his gloom forcing him to breathe the atmosphere of gaiety and lightheartedness which she seemed at once to create and to revel in it occurred to him that if ever a girl in the world was created to save a man from despair surely she was that one dainty cheerful unselfish with a charming command of language and a piquant wit cicely had made vast strides in selfdevelopment since the days when they had sat together on the feldwick hills and talked of that future into which it seemed then so impossible that they should ever pass  do you remember he asked her what we used to call the pearl light the soft crystalline glow before the sunrise and how fresh and sweet the air was when we scrambled up the hill  she nodded thoughtfully  i think very often of those days and the dreams we used to weave together sometimes i can scarcely believe how near we have come to realising them what a wonderfully still lonely country it was  we used to sit and watch the smoke curl upwards from the cottages one by one the farm was always the first  yes joan saw to that  and the nights do you remember how sweet the perfumes werethe heather and the wild thyme those long cool nights cissy when we watched the lights flicker out one by one and the corncrakes and the barn owl came and made music for us  it is like a beautiful picture the memory she murmured  build a fence around and keep it he said life there was an abstraction but a beautiful one london has made man and woman of us but are we any happier i wonder  i am she answered simply  you are happy because you have not grasped at shadows he said bitterly you have taken the good which has come and been thankful  and you she replied softly you are known already in a few months time you will be famous  ay but shall i be happy he asked himself only half aloud  if you will she answered if you have spent any of your time grasping at shadows be thankful at least that you are man enough to realise it and put them from you life should be a full thing for you douglas i think that you are wonderful all that we dreamed of for you has come true  he looked into her face with a sudden intensitya pretty face enough flushed and earnest  cissy help me to realise one at least of those dreams will you  she looked at him suddenly white bewildered a little doubtful  what do you mean douglas  you were very dear to me in those days cissy he said leaning over and taking her fingers into his you have always been dear to me our plans for the future were always large enough for two take me into yourscome into mine can you care for me enough for that  she was silent her face was averted they were alone and his fingers tightened upon hers  we never spoke of it in words cissy he went on but i think we understood will you help me to leave the shadows alone will you be my wife  you careenough for that she asked raising her eyes to his suddenly  a moments wild revolta seething flood of emotions sternly repressed he met her eyes and though there was no smile upon his lips his tone was firm enough  i careenough for that cissy he answered    chapter xxxv  the net of joans vengeance  successcomplete overpowering unquestioned douglas jessons novel was more than the book of the seasonit became and still remains a classic there is much talk nowadays by minor writers of the difficulty of making a name of the inaccessibility of the public as a matter of fact there never was a time when good work was so quickly recognised both by the press and the public never a novel which sees the light of day but meets with appreciably more or less than its merits there was never a seconds hesitation about the destiny of phillip bourke the critics praised and the public bought it edition followed edition douglas jesson took his place without an effort amongst the foremost writers of the day  and this same success brought him face to face with one of the great crises of his life it brought joan to him successful at last in her long search their interview which if unexpected must surely have savoured of the dramatic was reduced more or less to the commonplace from the fact that she came to him prepared already assured of his identity for who else could have immortalised so wonderfully the little hillside village where they had both been brought up he walked into the waitingroom at the courier equally prepared for he had seen her pass the window she turned and faced him as he entered carefully closing the door behind him with a grim smile of triumph about her thin set lips  at last then douglas guest she exclaimed laying his book upon the table are you not weary of skulking under a false name  i chose it as much for your sake as mine joan he gravely replied  her black eyes flashed hatred and disbelief upon him  you dont imagine that you can make me believe that she answered passionately you have fooled many people but i think your turn has come at last i did not come here to listen to any fairy tales  you will forgive me if i ask what you did come for joan i would rather you had come as a friend but i fear there is no chance of that  she laughed mockingly  i have searched for you many days she said and many nights i have ransacked a city which was strange to me i have walked many hundreds of miles over its pavements until i have grown sick with disappointments and now that i have found you douglas guest you are right when you say that i do not come as your friend  you had a motive i presume  yes i had a motive i wanted to look into your face and tell you that the net of my vengeance is drawn close about you and the cords are gathered in my hands today you are flushed with triumph tomorrow you will be pale with fear  joan he said looking across the table into her face distorted with passion you believe that i killed your father  believe i know it  nevertheless i did not raise my hand against him i took money because it was my own i left him sound and well  there are others she exclaimed scornfully who may believe that but not many i should think  joan he said earnestly you will be a happier woman all your life if you will listen to me now your father was killed that night and robbed but not by me i took twenty pounds which was not a tithe of what belonged to menot a penny more it was after i had left  two in one night she interrupted it doesnt sound ingenious douglas guest though you are welcome of course to your own story  ingenious or not it is true he answered you are very bitter against me and some hard thoughts from you i have certainly deserved but of what you think i am not guilty and unless you want to do a thing of which you will repent until your dying day you must put that thought away from you  do you think that i am a child she asked scornfully do you think that i am to be put off with such rubbish as that i made all my arrangements long ago for when i found you in less than an hour you will be in prison  joan you are very hard he said  i loved my father and i hate you she returned passionately  he nodded  i misjudged you he said reflectively i never gave you credit for such tenacity of purpose i did not think that love or hate would ever burn their way into your life  then you were a fool she answered shortly you have never understood me perhaps when you have the rope about your neck you will read a womans nature more truthfully  you are very vindictive joan  i want justice she replied sharply and i hate you  listen he said i am not going to make any attempt to escape i will answer this charge of yours when the time comes meanwhile there is something which i want to show you it will not take long and it may alter your purpose  nothing could ever alter my purpose she remarked emphatically  you cannot tell he answered now i declare to you most solemnly that if you have me arrested before you do what i ask you will never cease to repent it all your life  what do you want me to do she asked  he took down his hat from a peg behind the door  it is something i have to show you we must go to my rooms they are only just the other side of the strand  in absolute silence they walked along together joan had but one fearthe fear which had made her grant his requestand that she put resolutely behind her god was just she muttered to herself again and again and he would not see her cheated of her vengeance from behind her thick veil she looked at douglas he was pale and serious but there was no look of fear in his face then he had always been brave she remembered that from the old days he would walk to the scaffold like that she shuddered yet without any thought of relenting on the way he met acquaintances and greeted them crossing the strand he held out his hand to steer her clear of a passing vehicle but she shrank away with a little gesture of indignation when at last they reached the street where his rooms were and stopped in front of the tall grimy building she addressed him for the first time  what place is this what are you bringing me here for  this is where i live he answered there is something in my rooms which i must show you  she stood still moody and inclined to be suspicious  why should i trust you we are enemies you and i there may be evil inside this house for me  he threw open the door  you are quite safe he said curtly and you know it it is for your good not mine that i have brought you here  she entered and followed him upstairs a vague sense of coming trouble was upon her she started when douglas ushered her into a dimlylighted room with a bed in one corner a hospital nurse rose to meet them and looked reproachfully at douglas a man was leaning back amongst the pillows wildeyed and with flaring colour in his cheeks when he saw joan he called out to her  youve come then he cried you know joan i never meant to do it upon my soul i didnt  the nurse bent over him but he thrust her aside  my sister he shouted my sister i must talk with her listen joan i struck only one blow it was an accident i shall swear that it was an accident i had the money safei was ready to go he was mad to interfere with me for i was desperate it was only one blowi wanted to free myself and down he went like a log a hard man too and a powerful but he went down like a log i didnt want his life i wanted money for i was in rags and she wouldnt look at me come to me properly clothed she said i who had ruined myself for her joan hist come here  they were under the spell of his terrible excitement the nurse fell back joan took her place at his pillow he gripped her arm with clawlike fingers but though he drew her down till his lips nearly touched her ear his hoarse whispering was distinctly heard throughout the room  two of usfather and son will you avenge us eh listen then i will tell you her name she played with my life and wrecked it she took my time my love nay life she gave me nothing it was she who poisoned my blood with the lust for gold it was she who sent me over the hills to feldwick ay it was she who nerved me to steal and to kill joan will you not avenge me and him for i must die and it is she who has killed meemily de reuss oh may the gods whoever they bethe gods of the heathen and the god of the christian your god joan and the god of justice curse her if i had lived i should have killed her if my fingerswere upon her throati could die happy  he fell back upon the pillows douglas led joan from the room she turned and faced him  who is this woman she asked    chapter xxxvi  a scene at the club  he made her sit down for she was white and faint for the moment he left her question unanswered  you have learnt the truth joan from his own lips he said i have a confession signed last week by him before the fever set in you can read it if you like  there is no need she answered i have heard enough who is this emily de reuss  she is a very clever woman he said with whom your brother became most unreasonably infatuated she took an interest in him as she has done in many young literary men he fell in love with her without any encouragement and gave way to his foolishness in a most unwarrantable manner he neglected his work to follow her about lost his position and his friendseventually as you see his reason i cannot tell you any more than that she was perhaps unwise in her kindness perhaps a little vain inasmuch as she liked to pose as the literary inspirer of young talent and to surround herself with worshippers that is the extent of her fault i do not believe that for a moment she deliberately encouraged him or was in any way personally responsible for the wreck of his life  you perhaps know her  i do  well  i think that i may say so  she rose  then you can tell her this she said tell her that before long she will have a visit from david strongs sister douglas shook his head it is not she who is to blame he said she pointed to the room which they had left  men do not become like that she said of their own will or from their own fault alone he is mad and in madness is truth did you not hear him say that it was she who had destroyed him am i to lose father and brother ay and husband douglas and sit meekly in my chimneycorner  as to the last he said you know that it was your fathers doing i was nothing to you he ordered and we obeyed in those days he ruled us like a tyrant one would not wish to speak evil of the dead or else one would surely say that it was he who was responsible for the evil things which have come upon us  how do you know she demanded fiercely were you not my promised husbandand you stole away like a coward from the pestilence  he was aghast silent from sheer confusion this was a point of view which had never once occurred to him  am i not a woman she continued with rising passionas other women you were given to me you were mine why should you steal away like a thief with never a word and ignore me wholly as a creature of no worth come answer me that were you not my promised husband  i never spoke a word of love to you he said your father forced it on us  she leaned over the table towards him  you fool she cried do you think life at feldwick was any more bearable to me than to you and cissy because i wasnt always mooning about on the hills or reading poetry you never took the trouble to find out you looked upon me as a drudge because i did the work which was my duty you were mine and i wanted you when you stole away i hated you i have tried to hunt you down because i hated you you have escaped me now but i shall hate you always remember it douglas guest some day you may yet have cause to  she left him speechless too amazed to think of making her any answer it was joan who had said these things to him joan the silent with her hard handsome face and her lathers dogged silence never again would he believe that he understood anything whatsoever about women he walked up and down for a while restlessly then put on his hat and walked across to the club                                      let me go i tell you by heaven therell be mischief if you dont  half a dozen of them were holding drexleya pitiable sight his coat was torn his eyes seemed starting from his sockets his breath reeked of brandy and his face was pale with passion opposite him was douglas his cheek bleeding from the sudden blow which drexley had struck him gazing with blank surprise at his late assailant some one had told him that drexley was there had been drinking brandy all day and was already verging on madness and he had gone at once into the little bar hoping to be able to quieten him but at his first words drexley had sprung upon him like a wild animalnothing but his own great personal strength and the prompt intervention of all the men who were present had saved the attack from being a murderous one there had been no wordsno sort of explanation none came nowdrexley was furious but silent  i think you had better go away jesson one of the members said we will take him home  but drexley heard and shook his head he spoke then for the first time  i want a word with jesson he said im sorry i made a fool of myself im all right now you neednt hold me  they stood away from him he made no movement  ive a word or two to say to jesson in private he said no one need be afraid of me you can tie my hands if you like but it isnt necessary  cleavers one of the members who had witnessed the assault shook his head  i wouldnt trust myself with him if i were you jesson he said hes half mad now and for some reason or other hes got his knife into you you slip off home quietly  jesson looked across the room to drexley who was leaning against the wall with folded arms  give me your word of honour drexley he said and ill hear what you have to say  i give it i swear that i will not lay a finger upon you  come this way then jesson added  he left the room and entered a small committee chamber nearly opposite drexley closed the door but he showed no signs of excitement  jesson he began i hated you once because i was the poor slave of a woman who cared nothing for me or any who had gone before me and who from the first looked upon you differently i hated you from the day emily de reuss wrote me and ordered me to delay your story and deny you work so that you might be driven to go to her for aid then i think i became apathetic we drifted together i tolerated you the woman i had worshipped all my life forgot to dole out to me even those few crumbs of consolation to which i had become accustomed it was theni metthrough youmiss strong  douglas was suddenly interested what had cissy to do with it all he put his thought into words  what of that he asked i dont understand how i have injured you  oh you have not injured me drexley answered bitterly you have simply stood between me and salvation  you must speak more plainly if you want me to understand you douglas said  there was only one thing in the world which could have saved me from thisfrom myself drexley continued fiercely call me what hard names you like ill accept them i wasted half a lifetime only to find that my folly had been colossal no other woman but your cousin has ever been kind to meshe held out her hand and i seemed to see the lightand then you must come and take her from me  douglas gazed at him in blank amazement  do you mean to tell me that you care for my cousinseriouslywould have asked her to marry you he exclaimed yes  and she  she was kind to me in time i should have won her i am sure of it  douglas rose from his chair and walked restlessly up and down the room  drexley he said if only i could have guessed thisif only i could have had any idea of it  you couldnt drexley answered shortly i couldnt myself id have given the lie to anybody who had dared so much as to hint at it it was like a thunderclap to me  you know that i have asked her to be my wife yes  listen then douglas said suddenly pausing in his restless walk and facing his companion i will tell you how it came about you remember the night that we were at the milan  yes  emily de reuss was there  yes  for months i had been steadily trying to forget her that night the work of months was undone she had only to hold out her hands to speak for a moment kindly and the truth seemed to flare out in letters of fire i cannot forget her i never shall be able to forget her i own myself drexley one of the vanquished i love her as i shall never love any other woman in this world  drexleys face was black with passion but douglas would not have him speak  wait he said hear my story first i left you that night abruptlyas you know i went to her i put aside all false modesty i forgot that i was only a journalist with a possible future and no pastand that she was an aristocratmy passion carried me away i knew only that i was a man and she was the woman i loved so i pleaded with her and at first i thought that i had won  ah others have thought that drexley scoffed  she answered me douglas continued in a tone momentarily softened as i would have had her answer me and for a time i thought that i was going to be the happiest man in the world butafterwardsdrexley even at this moment i do not know whether i have not been the most consummate fool on gods earth  go on speak plainly  i spoke of marriageshe evaded it there was an obstacle i begged for her whole confidence she withheld it then drexley all your damnable warnings all that i had ever heard ofher vanity her heartlessness her selfworship came like madness into my brain i refused to trust to my own instincts i refused to trust her so she sent me away and drexley if she be a true woman then may god help me for i need it  she sent you away  ay i spent some miserable days no word came from her it was over then it chanced that cicely came to me she was sympathetic bright and cheerful she made me forget for a little while my despair i have always been fond of her i think that she has always been fond of me you know the rest  you are going to marry cicely strong drexley said slowly but you love emily de reuss  douglas winced  i am afraidthat you are right he said  and have you told miss strong drexley continued that you are proposing to marry her but that you love another woman   douglas looked up frowning drexleys tone had become almost contemptuous  do you think that you are behaving fairly to her he asked remember that she is not the child with whom you used to talk sentiment in your little cumberland village she is a woman now with keen susceptibilitiesas little a woman to be trifled with in her way as emily de reuss herself  the two men faced one another douglas was angry with drexley angry too with himself  i believe youre right drexley he said with an effort but im hanged if i see what business it is of yours  it is the business of any man at any time drexley answered softly to speak for the woman whom he loves    chapter xxxvii  cicely makes her choice  society over whose borders douglas had once before passed under the tutelage of emily de reuss opened her doors to him now freely and douglas convinced that here was a solitude which the four walls of his chambers in adam street peopled as they were with memories could never offer passed willingly inside for a week or two he accepted recklessly whatever hospitalities were offered him always with an unacknowledged hope that chance might offer him at least a glimpse of the woman who was destined to be the one great influence of his life he frequented the houses where the possibilities of meeting her seemed best and he listened continually and with illsuppressed eagerness for any mention of her name it chanced however that even the latter faint consolation was denied to him and he neither saw anything of her at the houses of her friends nor came across her name in the papers which as a rule never failed to chronicle her doings at the club they chaffed him mercilesslya rabid tufthunter or had he political ambitions he chaffed back again and held his own as usual but not a soul save perhaps drexley understood him in those days then there came to him one day a sudden fear she was surely illor she had disappeared he caught up his hat and coat and walked swiftly to grosvenor square  he reached the house and stopped short in front of it it seemed to him to have a gloomy almost an uninhabited appearance for a few moments he struggled with himselfwith his pride a vague sense of alarm every moment growing stronger as the dismantled aspect of the house became more apparent to him then he walked up the steps and rang the bell  a servant in plain clothes answered it after a delay which was in itself significant he appeared surprised at douglass inquiry knowing him well as a frequent visitor at the house the countess had left for abroad several days sincehe believed for russia and for a considerable time the servants were all discharged and the house to let he himself remained only as caretaker douglas walked back again into the streets with a heart like lead and a mist before his eyes she had taken him at his word thenhe had lost her after all it was the inevitable  mechanically at first and afterwards with a purpose he turned southwards to the tiny fiat where cicely had established herself a trim little maidservant showed him into her room and she welcomed him with outstretched hands yet he saw in the dim lamplight that her cheeks were pale and there was some measure of restraint in her greeting  you have come at last then she said gaily enough now you must let me give you some tea and afterwards you must tell me what you think of my rooms of course i havent finished furnishing yet but theyre nice arent they  he looked round approvingly everything was very simple but dainty and comfortable a vase of beautiful chrysanthemums stood upon her writingtable amber and pink and drooping white they seemed to diffuse an almost illuminating glow a tiny teatable was drawn up before a bright fire as he sat down by her side there swept over him once more a desire keen passionate to escape from the turmoil of the last few months here at least was rest the very homeliness of the little scene awoke in him the domestic instinctheritage of his middleclass ancestors cicely chattered gaily to him she was very charming in her dark red dress and she had so much to say about this sudden fame which had come to himso well deserved so brilliantly won her face was aglow with pleasure a wave of tenderness swept over him he felt that it would be very pleasant to take her into his arms to forget with her little hands in his those days of madness when he had yielded himself up to wild and passionate dreams of things impossible better to bury them to take such measure of happiness as would at least ensure content life would surely be a sweeter and an easier thing lived out to the light music of the violins than played to the deep storm throbbings of the great orchestra so he broke in upon her laughing congratulations and faced her gravely  you had my letter cicely her face changed her eyes sought his nervously yes you have thought about it of nothing else she answered well  she leaned over towards him it made me at first very angry she said he glanced at her quickly she held up her hand  now i am going to explain she said you see douglas when you asked me to be your wife i believed that you cared for me wellaltogetherand that you wanted it very much indeed if i had known then what your letter has since told me what do you think that i should have said to you  i do want it very much he repeated softly and i have always cared for you  i believe that you have she answered but in the same way that i have always cared for you you do not care for me as you do for emily de reuss nor do you want me so much as the woman whom you cannot have i want to be honest dear perhaps if i loved you and felt that there was no one else in this world whom i could care for this might be enough i might be content with the chance that the rest would come although no woman douglas likes to think herself a makeshiftto be offered anything less than the whole you see it is for life isnt it when you asked me i never dreamed but that so long as you wanted me at all you wanted me more than any one else in the world now i know that this was not so i am only an insignificant little thing douglas and not fit to be your companion in many ways but i could not marry you to think that there would be moments when you and i would stand apart that there would be another woman living whose coming might quicken your heart and make the world a more beautiful place for you can you understand that i wonder  no he answered fiercely i asked you then i beg of you now as an honest man if you will have me i will pluck out from my heart every other memory by the rootsthere shall not live in this world any other woman for me nay it is done already she has gone for ever  douglas she said gently there are some things which a woman knows more about than a man listen and answer truthfully if she and i stood before you here both free both with our hands stretched out towards youah i need not go any further need i you think that you have lost her and you want me to help you to forget it is too dangerous an experiment douglas we will leave it alone  i thought he said slowly that you cared for me  as a very very dear friend and comrade i do indeed she answered as anything else i might have learnt tobut not now  there was a short silence between them it was not until then that he realised how dear during these last few months her companionship had been to him he looked into the fire with sad listless eyes after all what was success worth he had grasped at the shadow and cicely with her charming little ways her glorious companionableness and her dainty prettiness was lost to him for ever he had too much selfrestraint to indulge in anything in the nature of recrimination in his heart he felt that drexley had taken his placeand whose the fault save his own a sense of intolerable weariness swept over him as he rose to bid her goodby yet he was man enough to show a brave front  i believe you are right cicely he said what i wished for after all was selfish your friendship i know that i may keep  always she answered giving him both her hands  on the stairs he passed drexley with a bunch of violets in his coat and a new light in his face a sudden impulse of anger seized him the second cup on the teatray upstairs the glowing chrysanthemums the change in cicelyhere was the meaning of these things but for him she would have been content with what he had to give her  damn you drexley he muttered    but at the foot of the stairs he looked up it was only a momentary impulse it was not in his nature to grudge any man his salvation  sorry old chap he called up good luck to you  he walked down the street with the echo of drexleys cheerful reply still in his ears    chapter xxxviii  she was a woman i was a coward  again douglas found himself face to face with a future emptied of all delight only this time as a saner and an older man the growth of his literary powers an increased virility following upon the greater freedom of his life and the cessation of those haunting fears which had ever hung like a shadow over his earlier days in london came to his aid all that was best and strongest in his character was called into action he faced his future like a brave man determined to make the most of his daysto make the best use of the powers which he undoubtedly possessed he remodelled his manner of living to suit his altered circumstances took rooms in jermyn street which he furnished quietly but comfortably and although he never became a society man he went out often and did not indulge in an excess of solitude he had grown older and graver but had lost none of his good looks and was particularly careful never to pose as a man of disappointments of emily de reuss he saw or heard nothing she seemed to have vanished completely from her place in society and although he ventured to make a few careful inquiries he never chanced to come across any one who could tell him anything about her it was astonishing how soon she was forgotten even amongst those who had been her greatest admirers he seldom heard her name mentioned and although he never failed to believe that she would return some day to london he set himself as deliberately as possible to forget her on the whole he believed that he was succeeding very well he was a favourite amongst women for he treated them charmingly always with a ready and natural gallantry but always with the most profound and unvarying respect only the very keenest observers fancied sometimes that they detected the shadow of a past in his far from cheerless demeanour for douglas held his head high and met the world which had turned aside to welcome him with outstretched hands  one evening at a large and crowded reception a man whom he knew slightly touched him on the shoulder  guest he said there is a lady with whom i have been talking who wishes to renew her acquaintance with you may i take you to her  douglas murmured a conventional acquiescence and bowed to the pleasantfaced greyheaded old lady with a sense of pleasure  i am honoured that you should have remembered me duchess he said it seems quite a long time since i have had the honour of meeting you  she made room for him by her side  i am glad to see you again mr guest she said pleasantly for your own sake of course and also because you were a friend of emily de reuss  douglas looked steadily away for a moment he had not yet come to that stage when he could speak of her lightly as a casual friend  you have not heard from her lately i suppose the duchess asked i hear that she writes to no one  i have not heard from her since before she left england douglas answered  the duchess sighed  poor emily she said you know i am amongst those few who knew her wellyou also i think were one of them there was no one i was more fond ofno one whom i have missed so much  again douglas was silent did this woman understand he wondered  it is a pleasure to me she continued to find some one with whom i can talk about hersome one who knew and appreciated her  do you know he asked where she is  yes  it was amazing what effect the monosyllable had upon him the mask which he carried always with him fell suddenly away he turned upon her with an abruptness almost disconcerting his eyes were lit with fire and there was a strange flush upon his cheeks  where he demandedwhere is she the duchess looked at him with sympathy she was a kindly woman and she had probed his secret long ago  she is in a little village some five hundred miles across the frontier in siberia i had imagined that you might have known  siberia he repeated the word in blank amazement the duchess nodded  now i have told you something very interesting she said and in return i am going to ask you something you quarrelled with her did you not  scarcely that i asked her to marry me he answered  which of course was impossible  impossible why  she raised her eyebrows  is it conceivable she exclaimed that you do not know  i knew of no other barrier save the difference in our social positions he said gravely  she was silent for a moment  you did not know thenbe calm my friendthat emily had a husband living  a sharp little cry almost immediately smothered broke from his lips he looked at his companion aghast a flood of new light seemed to be breaking in upon him  married emily married he exclaimed and she never told me  she probably meant to in her own good time the duchess said of course i do not know how matters were between you only i fancied that some change had come to her during the last few months i hoped that she was growing to care for somebody she is too rare a woman to lead for ever a lonely life  but her husband he stammered  she will never do more the duchess said gravely than look upon his face through iron bars he is a prisoner for life in one of the gloomiest and most impregnable of siberian fortresses some day if you like i will tell you the story of her marriage it was a most unhappy one  tell me now he begged breathlessly  she hesitated a foreign prince bowed before her his breast glittering with orders she looked up at him smiling  prince she said mr guest and i are elaborating together the plot of his next novel and it is wonderfully fascinating  he bowed low and passed on she turned again to douglas  i can tell it you she said sufficiently in half a dozen sentences emily was the orphan child of one of the richest and noblest hungarian familiesthe man she married was half a pole half a hungarian poor but also of noble family his life was a network of deceit he himself was a conspirator of the lowest order he married emily for her moneythat it might be used for what he called the cause when she declined to have anything to do with it he first illtreated her shamefully and afterwards deserted her twice he was graciously pardoned by the czar twice he broke his word of honour and plunged again into infamy the third time it seemed that nothing could save him for he was caught in the act of directing a shameful conspiracy against the man who had treated him so generously he was sentenced to death but emily crossed europe in a special train and after terrible difficulties won his life from the czar herself when every other means had failed he was condemned to imprisonment for life and she gave her word that she would never ask for any mitigation of that sentence think of the generosity of that action although the man had treated her vilely and she was young and beautiful yet she doomed herself to a perpetual widowhood in order to save his life i happen to know too that her love for him was wholly dead  it was magnificent he murmured with something that sounded like a sob  she came to live in london where her story was little known that was ten years ago i think that i am almost the only person who knows the whole truth about her and if you ask me why i have told you well i can only say that it was by instinct  duchess he said you have told me the story of a heroinenow let me tell you the story of a fool i came to london a very short time ago poor friendless and untried she was the only person from whom i received any spontaneous kindness whatever she visited me when i was ill she asked me to her house she encouraged me in my work she showed me how exquisite a thing the intelligent sympathy of a cultivated woman can be to a man who is struggling for expression and in returnlisten there were others whom she had befriendedlike me she had keen literary instincts as you know and it was her pleasure to help in any way young beginners she was also a woman and beautiful some of them lost their heads two especially it was their faultnot hers they were presumptuous and she rebuked them they whined like whipped curs went wrong as it chanced afterwards and were held up to me as warnings it was her vanity they declared which prompted her kindness we were all puppets to hernot men she had no heart when my turn came i should be served like the rest i loved her duchess who could help it and the time came when we stood face to face and i saw the woman shining out of her eyes and the gates of heaven were opened to me was there ever such transcendental folly as mine i locked the gates myself and remainedoutside  he looked away and there was a short silence a womans song died sweetly away in an anteroom beyond the murmur of pleasant conversation floated once more all around them the duchess unfurled a fan of wavy white feathers and half sheltered him she only saw the dimness in his eyes as he went on  those few minutes he said i cannot speak of then there came by some hateful chance a cloud over my happiness i remembered the warnings with which i had been pestered the fool in me spoke whilst the man was silent i demanded a pledge from her i asked her when she would marry me she bade me be patient hinted at an obstaclesome day i should know everything the fool in me raved i demanded her promise to marry me as a token of her sincerity then she answered me as i deserved if i did not trust her i might goand god help me i went  again the bitter silence and again the feathers swelled and waved the band was playing softly waltz music now the duchess who was a motherly woman and loved young men felt her own eyes grow dim  after all she said you must not blame yourself too much emily had her faults like other women she was a little vain a little imperious not always wise she should have told you everything  douglas rose and made his adieux  she trusted me once duchess when everything looked against me and never even deigned to ask for an explanation she was a woman when my turn came i was a coward    chapter xxxix  a journeyand a wedding  a brilliant and scathing criticism of a successful society play signed by douglas in full and admitted to the columns of a periodical whose standing was unique followed close upon the issue of his novel his articles to the courier were as vivid and characteristic as everhe had passed with scarcely an effort after his initial success into the front ranks of contemporary writers of his private sorrows the world knew nothing and he carried himself always with an impenetrable front yet after that night he felt that a break in his life was imperativewas a necessary condition indeed of his sanity the literary and society papers chronicled his retirement into the wilds of devonshire where he was reported to be studying the plot of his next novel as a matter of fact he had embarked upon a longer journey  from paris after hours of indecision he wired to emily de reuss at molchavano  may i come to youdouglas  for a week he waited restlessly a week of weary sightseeing and abortive attempts at holiday making no answer came on the eighth day he moved on to vienna and sent another telegram  i am coming to youdouglas  still no reply he waited for a day or two and then moved on to st petersburg here he took up his quarters at the hotel de leurope and began to make inquiries about the journey across siberia from here he sent another message out over the snowbound wastes  i leave for molchavano in fourteen daysdouglas   he made all the preparations for his journey but on the twelfth day came word from her  i implore you not to come return to london and await my letter he travelled back and those who saw him on his return remarked that the air of devonshire had been without its usual benefit so far as he was concerned he shut himself up wrote scarcely a line waited only for his letter it came sooner than he had expected it contained more than he had dared to hope less than he had prayed for this is what he read  the fortress of molchavano  october 17th  so douglas you have learnt the truth well i am glad of it you believe in me now you always may looking back upon our last interview my only regret is that i did not tell you the whole truth then  it was foolish of me to withhold itfoolish and inconsequent yet i believe that if i had told you i should not have been here now so after all i have no regrets  i can hear you ask me thenjealous as everwhat is it that i have found here to reconcile me so easily to our separation to an isolation which is indeed incredible and almost awful douglas it is that i have found good to do everybody you i am afraid included has always looked upon me as a very selfish woman and indeed i have been so most of the days of my life never mind my chance has come it was you who drove me here thank you douglas believe me that i shall bless you for it so long as i live  would you care to know anything of my life i wonder no for many reasons it were best not to tell you too much the fortress in which i livewhere the walls and floors are of stone and without the snow is deep upon the groundis only a few yards from the prison where my husband is kept i see him for five minutes every day through a window with iron barsyet he tells me that the thought of that five minutes keeps him alive hour by hour and i am beginning to believe it for douglas such monotony as this is a thing outside the imagination from the hilltop on which the prison is built i can see for twenty miles and there is not a tree nor a building not even a rise or fall in the ground to break the awful and dazzling loneliness of that great field of snow below me are the grim shafts of the mines down which the prisoners here go ironed every day away on the horizon westwards is the black line of pine forests in whose shadows is night everlasting a wolf howls beneath my window every night and for months i have seen no colour save in an occasionally lurid sunset with crimson afterglow in the daytime i help in the hospitalat night i sit before a wood fire and look out beyond my whitewashed walls across the mighty forest back to london and then dear you may know that it is you of whom i am thinking  your telegrams reached me together or i would have stopped you on the way i am glad douglas that you know the truth i am glad that you have wanted me be patient and brave life is opening for you through many avenues take what comes to you and remember that your development is a holy duty to yourself and your fellows we are like two stars douglas who have passed one another in the darkness and floated away into a great sea of space the future may be ours again but the present is for other things than regrets there are worlds to lighten ever though our shining is a very small thing be true to yourself and to your destiny  i want to be honest with you douglas for the first time in my life i am willingly suffering privations i am neglecting my own amusement and happiness for the sake of others yet i am not of the stuff whereof saints and martyrs are fashioned this life in time would drive me mad you would ask me i knowhow long i answer that i stay here so long as i can bear it and my health serves it may be for months perhaps years yet i promise you this if it is a promise which you care to have when it is ended i will send you word  until then douglas if you care to have me sign myself so  i am  your faithful friend  emily de reuss  douglas drew paper and ink towards him and wrote back with breathless haste  i will do your bidding and whether it be for a year or twenty years i will wait                                      he carried her letter with him to cicelys wedding and they all noticed with pleasure a new buoyancy in his walk and bearing a keener light in his eyes and the old true ring in his voice there was never a shadow of envy in his heart as he watched drexleys happiness joan and he saw them off at charing cross for the continent and they walked back to her rooms together  so you are really going home to feldwick joan he asked  she nodded  yes since i left it i have done nothing but make mistakes i think that the old life is best for me  he glanced at her curiously a moment or two later as they crossed the street she had grown older during the last few months and there were streaks of grey in her hair yet the lines in her face were softer the narrowness and suspicion were smoothed away her eyes were still keen but with a kindlier light at her door where he parted from her she looked away across his shoulder  it is a wonderful city this douglas she said it has made a great man of you and a happy woman of cissy  and you he asked gently  well it has taught me a little tolerance i think she said you know we strongs are hill folk our loves and hates are lasting and perhaps narrow i have been a mistaken woman but i have much to be thankful for i came to my senses before any one was made to suffer through me so now good night and goodby douglas you bear me no illwill i know  not a shred he answered taking her hand into his you will miss cissy i am afraid  she sighed and he saw something in her eyes which haunted him for long afterwards  some of us she said are born to be lonelyto see those whom we care for drift away theres no help for it im afraid so goodby douglas and good fortune to you  the door closed sharply upon her sob douglas walked slowly away westwards    chapter xl  a call before the curtain  they passed out from the stuffy atmosphere of the dimlylit theatre to the sunlit squares and streets drexley and douglas arm in arm the former voluble douglas curiously silent for it had been an afternoon of events the final rehearsal of a play of which great things were expected and which was to take london by storm drexley had always had faith in his friend he believed him to be a clever even a brilliant writerwitty original unique in his own vivid and picturesque style but even drexley had never believed him capable of such work as this without the accessories of costume and lights and continuity the story which flashed out into the shadows of the dark and empty stalls from the lips of those human puppets wholly fascinated and completely absorbed him douglas had forsaken all traditions he had been fettered with only a small knowledge of the stage and its workings and he had escaped the fatal tribute to the conventionalities paid by almost every contemporary playwright it was a sweet and passionate story which leaped out from the lips of those fashionably dressed but earnest men and women grandly human exquisitely told here and there the touches were lurid enough but there was plenty of graceful relief every sentence seemed pervaded with that unerring sense of the truthful and artistic which was the outcome of the mans genius drexleys words were ready enough in the open streets with the fresh wind in their faces and the sunshine streaming around in the theatre and immediately afterwards in the managers room where a famous actress had dispensed tea and compliments and congratulations were the order of the day he had been spellbound and silent  douglas he cried already you are known and recognised tomorrow you will be famous you are a genius man nothing like this or anything approaching it has been produced for years  dont be too sure drexley douglas said smiling the public must decide you know they may not like it as you do a firstnight audience takes strange whims sometimes  drexley shook his head  disappointed playwrights may tell you so but dont believe it he answered a london audience as a rule is absolutely infallible but then such a play as this lays itself open to no two opinions it is of the best and the best all can recognise when it is shown them tonight will be a great triumph for you my congratulations you have already cissy and i together will shout them to you later  douglas laughed  well he said i believe the play will be a success i have had a curious sense with me all day that something pleasant is going to happen i feel as though fortune had taken me by the hand what does it mean i wonder  drexley laughed heartily he had grown years younger happiness had taken hold of him and he was a changed being  a man may doubt his own work sometimes he said but when he has struck an imperishable and everlasting note of music wellhe hears it as surely as other people hear it until tonight then my friend  douglas shook him by the hand  there will be some sort of a kickup behind after the show he remarked champagne and sandwiches and a little royalty remember that i am relying upon you to bring cicely  we are as likely to forget our own existence drexley laughed for a few hours then au revoir  douglas walked down the broad street to his rooms smoking a cigarette and humming an opera tune his eyes were bright his head thrown back a touch of the spring seemed to have found its way into his blood for he was curiously lighthearted he let himself in with a latchkey and entered his study for a moment or two intending to dress early and dine at his club on his writingtable were several letters a couple of cards and an orangecoloured envelope he took the latter into his fingers hesitated for a moment and then tore it open  gard de nord paris  i shall arrive at dover at eight this evening will you meet meemily  then he knew what this curious premonition of coming happiness had meant and his heart leaped like a boys whilst the colour burned in his cheeks she was coming home coming back to him the days of her exile were overthe days of her exile and his probation he snatched at a timetable with trembling fingers called for his servant ordered a hansom he forgot his play and did not even send a message to the theatre a galloping hansom with the prospect of a halfsovereign fare seemed to him to crawl to charing cross like a snail across a windowpane he caught the trainhad he missed it he would have ordered out a specialand even the express rushing seawards with mails and a full load of continental passengers seemed like a stagecoach he paced up and down the narrow corridor till the steward looked at him curiously and people began to regard him with suspicion as a possible criminal he made himself a nuisance to the ticketinspector and when they waited for ten minutes outside the harbour station he dragged out his watch every few moments and made scathing comments upon the railway company and every one connected with it nevertheless he found himself in ample time to smoke a dozen spasmodic cigarettes before the stream of passengers from the boat at last crossed the gangwayand amongst them emily de reuss  so little changedher voice her smile even her style of travelling dress was the same as ever he held out his hands and words seemed ridiculous nevertheless in a moment or two they found themselves exchanging conventional remarks about the journey the weather the crossing as he piloted her along the platform to the carriage which he had reserved her maid arranged the wraps and discreetly withdrew her old luxurious habits had evidently survived her exile for a courier was in charge of her luggage she had come she told him direct from st petersburg they sat opposite to one another whilst all around them was the bustle of incoming passengers conversation was impossiblesilence alone was eloquent  you have changed so little she said smiling at him as the train swept away from the station  and you surely not at all he answered  you knewthat he was dead she asked softly  the duchess told me sosix months ago i wondered why you stayed there  she sighed  i have been a woman of many luxuries she said yet i think the sweetest of them all i experienced at molchavano i really think that i did a little good after his death i sent to petersburg for nurses and i stayed at the hospital till they came  the luxury of doing good can be indulged in here as well as molchavano he murmured                                      they were nearing london far away on either side was an amphitheatre of lights she leaned forward and gazed thoughtfully out of the window  douglas she said do you remember our first journey together  he laughed  shall i ever forget it  how young you were she murmuredhow eager and how ambitious life was like a fairy tale to you full of wonderful things which no one believes in nowadays i wonder have you found the truth yet have you learnt your lesson  life is more like a fairy tale than ever tonight he answered gaily as to the rest i will answer you presently only remember that if i have jealously preserved a few illusions it is because they are the flowers which grow along the byeways of life you may smile at them if you will but not unkindly  their way led past the theatre he glanced at his watchthe last act was still in full swing he pulled the check cord  do you mind he asked for five minutes my answer is waiting here  in my travelling dress she asked  he handed her out  it will not matter he assured her i can find a seat where your dress will be unnoticed  they passed into the stage box where their entrance although they kept as far as possible in the background excited much comment they felt at once that they had come into an atmosphere charged with electric emotion little ripples of excitement were floating through the theatre interest had become strainedalmost painful a brilliant house had been worked up into a state of breathless absorption a little man burst in upon them  thank god youve come guest they nearly had the house down after the last act shouting for you oh i beg your pardon  he retreated closing the door they neither of them noticed him up from the stage the triumphant cry of a great actor carried away by the inspiration of a great part answered her in her lovers own words  philosophy is selfishness and ambition a shadowthe lesson of life is the lesson of love  the curtain fell and the storm burst she looked into his face with a brilliant smile  i am very sweetly answered mr author she said now let me efface myself  douglas could not escape for he had been recognised and the house rang with his name he bowed his acknowledgments time after time from the front of the box and every one wondered at his late arrival and morning clothes and at the woman in a long travelling coat who sat by his side half hidden by the curtain only the duchess whose box was exactly opposite and who had remarkably good eyesight suddenly understood she leaned over and waved her hand gaily  gracious she exclaimed its emily
