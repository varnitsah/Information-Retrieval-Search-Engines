23866976	the happy prince and other tales     contents  the happy prince the nightingale and the rose the selfish giant the devoted friend the remarkable rocket    the happy prince    high above the city on a tall column stood the statue of the happy prince  he was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold for eyes he had two bright sapphires and a large red ruby glowed on his swordhilt  he was very much admired indeed  he is as beautiful as a weathercock remarked one of the town councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes only not quite so useful he added fearing lest people should think him unpractical which he really was not  why cant you be like the happy prince asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon  the happy prince never dreams of crying for anything  i am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue  he looks just like an angel said the charity children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores  how do you know said the mathematical master you have never seen one  ah but we have in our dreams answered the children and the mathematical master frowned and looked very severe for he did not approve of children dreaming  one night there flew over the city a little swallow  his friends had gone away to egypt six weeks before but he had stayed behind for he was in love with the most beautiful reed  he had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her  shall i love you said the swallow who liked to come to the point at once and the reed made him a low bow  so he flew round and round her touching the water with his wings and making silver ripples  this was his courtship and it lasted all through the summer  it is a ridiculous attachment twittered the other swallows she has no money and far too many relations and indeed the river was quite full of reeds  then when the autumn came they all flew away  after they had gone he felt lonely and began to tire of his lady love  she has no conversation he said and i am afraid that she is a coquette for she is always flirting with the wind  and certainly whenever the wind blew the reed made the most graceful curtseys  i admit that she is domestic he continued but i love travelling and my wife consequently should love travelling also  will you come away with me he said finally to her but the reed shook her head she was so attached to her home  you have been trifling with me he cried  i am off to the pyramids  goodbye and he flew away  all day long he flew and at nighttime he arrived at the city where shall i put up he said i hope the town has made preparations  then he saw the statue on the tall column  i will put up there he cried it is a fine position with plenty of fresh air  so he alighted just between the feet of the happy prince  i have a golden bedroom he said softly to himself as he looked round and he prepared to go to sleep but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him  what a curious thing he cried there is not a single cloud in the sky the stars are quite clear and bright and yet it is raining  the climate in the north of europe is really dreadful  the reed used to like the rain but that was merely her selfishness  then another drop fell  what is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off he said i must look for a good chimneypot and he determined to fly away  but before he had opened his wings a third drop fell and he looked up and sawah what did he see  the eyes of the happy prince were filled with tears and tears were running down his golden cheeks  his face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little swallow was filled with pity  who are you he said  i am the happy prince  why are you weeping then asked the swallow you have quite drenched me  when i was alive and had a human heart answered the statue i did not know what tears were for i lived in the palace of sans souci where sorrow is not allowed to enter  in the daytime i played with my companions in the garden and in the evening i led the dance in the great hall  round the garden ran a very lofty wall but i never cared to ask what lay beyond it everything about me was so beautiful  my courtiers called me the happy prince and happy indeed i was if pleasure be happiness  so i lived and so i died  and now that i am dead they have set me up here so high that i can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city and though my heart is made of lead yet i cannot chose but weep  what is he not solid gold said the swallow to himself  he was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud  far away continued the statue in a low musical voice far away in a little street there is a poor house  one of the windows is open and through it i can see a woman seated at a table  her face is thin and worn and she has coarse red hands all pricked by the needle for she is a seamstress  she is embroidering passion flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the queens maidsof honour to wear at the next courtball  in a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill  he has a fever and is asking for oranges  his mother has nothing to give him but river water so he is crying  swallow swallow little swallow will you not bring her the ruby out of my swordhilt  my feet are fastened to this pedestal and i cannot move  i am waited for in egypt said the swallow  my friends are flying up and down the nile and talking to the large lotus flowers  soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great king the king is there himself in his painted coffin  he is wrapped in yellow linen and embalmed with spices  round his neck is a chain of pale green jade and his hands are like withered leaves  swallow swallow little swallow said the prince will you not stay with me for one night and be my messenger  the boy is so thirsty and the mother so sad  i dont think i like boys answered the swallow  last summer when i was staying on the river there were two rude boys the millers sons who were always throwing stones at me  they never hit me of course we swallows fly far too well for that and besides i come of a family famous for its agility but still it was a mark of disrespect  but the happy prince looked so sad that the little swallow was sorry  it is very cold here he said but i will stay with you for one night and be your messenger  thank you little swallow said the prince  so the swallow picked out the great ruby from the princes sword and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town  he passed by the cathedral tower where the white marble angels were sculptured  he passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing  a beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover how wonderful the stars are he said to her and how wonderful is the power of love  i hope my dress will be ready in time for the stateball she answered i have ordered passionflowers to be embroidered on it but the seamstresses are so lazy  he passed over the river and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships  he passed over the ghetto and saw the old jews bargaining with each other and weighing out money in copper scales  at last he came to the poor house and looked in  the boy was tossing feverishly on his bed and the mother had fallen asleep she was so tired  in he hopped and laid the great ruby on the table beside the womans thimble  then he flew gently round the bed fanning the boys forehead with his wings  how cool i feel said the boy i must be getting better and he sank into a delicious slumber  then the swallow flew back to the happy prince and told him what he had done  it is curious he remarked but i feel quite warm now although it is so cold  that is because you have done a good action said the prince and the little swallow began to think and then he fell asleep thinking always made him sleepy  when day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath  what a remarkable phenomenon said the professor of ornithology as he was passing over the bridge  a swallow in winter  and he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper  every one quoted it it was full of so many words that they could not understand  tonight i go to egypt said the swallow and he was in high spirits at the prospect  he visited all the public monuments and sat a long time on top of the church steeple  wherever he went the sparrows chirruped and said to each other what a distinguished stranger so he enjoyed himself very much  when the moon rose he flew back to the happy prince  have you any commissions for egypt he cried i am just starting  swallow swallow little swallow said the prince will you not stay with me one night longer  i am waited for in egypt answered the swallow  tomorrow my friends will fly up to the second cataract  the riverhorse couches there among the bulrushes and on a great granite throne sits the god memnon  all night long he watches the stars and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy and then he is silent  at noon the yellow lions come down to the waters edge to drink  they have eyes like green beryls and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract  swallow swallow little swallow said the prince far away across the city i see a young man in a garret  he is leaning over a desk covered with papers and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets  his hair is brown and crisp and his lips are red as a pomegranate and he has large and dreamy eyes he is trying to finish a play for the director of the theatre but he is too cold to write any more  there is no fire in the grate and hunger has made him faint  i will wait with you one night longer said the swallow who really had a good heart  shall i take him another ruby  alas  i have no ruby now said the prince my eyes are all that i have left  they are made of rare sapphires which were brought out of india a thousand years ago  pluck out one of them and take it to him  he will sell it to the jeweller and buy food and firewood and finish his play  dear prince said the swallow i cannot do that and he began to weep  swallow swallow little swallow said the prince do as i command you  so the swallow plucked out the princes eye and flew away to the students garret  it was easy enough to get in as there was a hole in the roof  through this he darted and came into the room the young man had his head buried in his hands so he did not hear the flutter of the birds wings and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets  i am beginning to be appreciated he cried this is from some great admirer  now i can finish my play and he looked quite happy  the next day the swallow flew down to the harbour  he sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes  heave ahoy they shouted as each chest came up  i am going to egypt cried the swallow but nobody minded and when the moon rose he flew back to the happy prince  i am come to bid you goodbye he cried  swallow swallow little swallow said the prince will you not stay with me one night longer  it is winter answered the swallow and the chill snow will soon be here  in egypt the sun is warm on the green palmtrees and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them  my companions are building a nest in the temple of baalbec and the pink and white doves are watching them and cooing to each other dear prince i must leave you but i will never forget you and next spring i will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away  the ruby shall be redder than a red rose and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea  in the square below said the happy prince there stands a little matchgirl  she has let her matches fall in the gutter and they are all spoiled  her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money and she is crying  she has no shoes or stockings and her little head is bare  pluck out my other eye and give it to her and her father will not beat her  i will stay with you one night longer said the swallow but i cannot pluck out your eye  you would be quite blind then  swallow swallow little swallow said the prince do as i command you  so he plucked out the princes other eye and darted down with it he swooped past the matchgirl and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand  what a lovely bit of glass cried the little girl and she ran home laughing  then the swallow came back to the prince  you are blind now he said so i will stay with you always  no little swallow said the poor prince you must go away to egypt  i will stay with you always said the swallow and he slept at the princes feet  all the next day he sat on the princes shoulder and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands  he told him of the red ibises who stand in long rows on the banks of the nile and catch goldfish in their beaks of the sphinx who is as old as the world itself and lives in the desert and knows everything of the merchants who walk slowly by the side of their camels and carry amber beads in their hands of the king of the mountains of the moon who is as black as ebony and worships a large crystal of the great green snake that sleeps in a palmtree and has twenty priests to feed it with honeycakes and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves and are always at war with the butterflies  dear little swallow said the prince you tell me of marvellous things but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women  there is no mystery so great as misery  fly over my city little swallow and tell me what you see there  so the swallow flew over the great city and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses while the beggars were sitting at the gates  he flew into dark lanes and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one anothers arms to try and keep themselves warm  how hungry we are they said  you must not lie here shouted the watchman and they wandered out into the rain  then he flew back and told the prince what he had seen  i am covered with fine gold said the prince you must take it off leaf by leaf and give it to my poor the living always think that gold can make them happy  leaf after leaf of the fine gold the swallow picked off till the happy prince looked quite dull and grey  leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor and the childrens faces grew rosier and they laughed and played games in the street  we have bread now they cried  then the snow came and after the snow came the frost  the streets looked as if they were made of silver they were so bright and glistening long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses everybody went about in furs and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice  the poor little swallow grew colder and colder but he would not leave the prince he loved him too well  he picked up crumbs outside the bakers door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings  but at last he knew that he was going to die  he had just strength to fly up to the princes shoulder once more  goodbye dear prince he murmured will you let me kiss your hand  i am glad that you are going to egypt at last little swallow said the prince you have stayed too long here but you must kiss me on the lips for i love you  it is not to egypt that i am going said the swallow  i am going to the house of death  death is the brother of sleep is he not  and he kissed the happy prince on the lips and fell down dead at his feet  at that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue as if something had broken  the fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two  it certainly was a dreadfully hard frost  early the next morning the mayor was walking in the square below in company with the town councillors  as they passed the column he looked up at the statue  dear me how shabby the happy prince looks he said  how shabby indeed cried the town councillors who always agreed with the mayor and they went up to look at it  the ruby has fallen out of his sword his eyes are gone and he is golden no longer said the mayor in fact he is litttle beter than a beggar  little better than a beggar said the town councillors  and here is actually a dead bird at his feet continued the mayor  we must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here  and the town clerk made a note of the suggestion  so they pulled down the statue of the happy prince  as he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful said the art professor at the university  then they melted the statue in a furnace and the mayor held a meeting of the corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal  we must have another statue of course he said and it shall be a statue of myself  of myself said each of the town councillors and they quarrelled  when i last heard of them they were quarrelling still  what a strange thing said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry  this broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace  we must throw it away  so they threw it on a dustheap where the dead swallow was also lying  bring me the two most precious things in the city said god to one of his angels and the angel brought him the leaden heart and the dead bird  you have rightly chosen said god for in my garden of paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore and in my city of gold the happy prince shall praise me    the nightingale and the rose    she said that she would dance with me if i brought her red roses cried the young student but in all my garden there is no red rose  from her nest in the holmoak tree the nightingale heard him and she looked out through the leaves and wondered  no red rose in all my garden he cried and his beautiful eyes filled with tears  ah on what little things does happiness depend  i have read all that the wise men have written and all the secrets of philosophy are mine yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched  here at last is a true lover said the nightingale  night after night have i sung of him though i knew him not  night after night have i told his story to the stars and now i see him  his hair is dark as the hyacinthblossom and his lips are red as the rose of his desire but passion has made his face like pale ivory and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow  the prince gives a ball tomorrow night murmured the young student and my love will be of the company  if i bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn  if i bring her a red rose i shall hold her in my arms and she will lean her head upon my shoulder and her hand will be clasped in mine  but there is no red rose in my garden so i shall sit lonely and she will pass me by  she will have no heed of me and my heart will break  here indeed is the true lover said the nightingale  what i sing of he sufferswhat is joy to me to him is pain  surely love is a wonderful thing  it is more precious than emeralds and dearer than fine opals  pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it nor is it set forth in the marketplace  it may not be purchased of the merchants nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold  the musicians will sit in their gallery said the young student and play upon their stringed instruments and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin  she will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her  but with me she will not dance for i have no red rose to give her and he flung himself down on the grass and buried his face in his hands and wept  why is he weeping asked a little green lizard as he ran past him with his tail in the air  why indeed said a butterfly who was fluttering about after a sunbeam  why indeed whispered a daisy to his neighbour in a soft low voice  he is weeping for a red rose said the nightingale  for a red rose they cried how very ridiculous and the little lizard who was something of a cynic laughed outright  but the nightingale understood the secret of the students sorrow and she sat silent in the oaktree and thought about the mystery of love  suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight and soared into the air  she passed through the grove like a shadow and like a shadow she sailed across the garden  in the centre of the grassplot was standing a beautiful rosetree and when she saw it she flew over to it and lit upon a spray  give me a red rose she cried and i will sing you my sweetest song  but the tree shook its head  my roses are white it answered as white as the foam of the sea and whiter than the snow upon the mountain  but go to my brother who grows round the old sundial and perhaps he will give you what you want  so the nightingale flew over to the rosetree that was growing round the old sundial  give me a red rose she cried and i will sing you my sweetest song  but the tree shook its head  my roses are yellow it answered as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe  but go to my brother who grows beneath the students window and perhaps he will give you what you want  so the nightingale flew over to the rosetree that was growing beneath the students window  give me a red rose she cried and i will sing you my sweetest song  but the tree shook its head  my roses are red it answered as red as the feet of the dove and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the oceancavern  but the winter has chilled my veins and the frost has nipped my buds and the storm has broken my branches and i shall have no roses at all this year  one red rose is all i want cried the nightingale only one red rose  is there no way by which i can get it  there is away answered the tree but it is so terrible that i dare not tell it to you  tell it to me said the nightingale i am not afraid  if you want a red rose said the tree you must build it out of music by moonlight and stain it with your own heartsblood  you must sing to me with your breast against a thorn  all night long you must sing to me and the thorn must pierce your heart and your lifeblood must flow into my veins and become mine  death is a great price to pay for a red rose cried the nightingale and life is very dear to all  it is pleasant to sit in the green wood and to watch the sun in his chariot of gold and the moon in her chariot of pearl  sweet is the scent of the hawthorn and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley and the heather that blows on the hill  yet love is better than life and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man  so she spread her brown wings for flight and soared into the air she swept over the garden like a shadow and like a shadow she sailed through the grove  the young student was still lying on the grass where she had left him and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes  be happy cried the nightingale be happy you shall have your red rose  i will build it out of music by moonlight and stain it with my own heartsblood  all that i ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover for love is wiser than philosophy though she is wise and mightier than power though he is mighty  flame coloured are his wings and coloured like flame is his body  his lips are sweet as honey and his breath is like frankincense  the student looked up from the grass and listened but he could not understand what the nightingale was saying to him for he only knew the things that are written down in books  but the oaktree understood and felt sad for he was very fond of the little nightingale who had built her nest in his branches  sing me one last song he whispered i shall feel very lonely when you are gone  so the nightingale sang to the oaktree and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar  when she had finished her song the student got up and pulled a notebook and a leadpencil out of his pocket  she has form he said to himself as he walked away through the grovethat cannot be denied to her but has she got feeling  i am afraid not  in fact she is like most artists she is all style without any sincerity  she would not sacrifice herself for others  she thinks merely of music and everybody knows that the arts are selfish  still it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice  what a pity it is that they do not mean anything or do any practical good  and he went into his room and lay down on his little palletbed and began to think of his love and after a time he fell asleep  and when the moon shone in the heavens the nightingale flew to the rosetree and set her breast against the thorn  all night long she sang with her breast against the thorn and the cold crystal moon leaned down and listened  all night long she sang and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast and her lifeblood ebbed away from her  she sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl  and on the topmost spray of the rosetree there blossomed a marvellous rose petal following petal as song followed song pale was it at first as the mist that hangs over the riverpale as the feet of the morning and silver as the wings of the dawn as the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver as the shadow of a rose in a waterpool so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the tree  but the tree cried to the nightingale to press closer against the thorn  press closer little nightingale cried the tree or the day will come before the rose is finished  so the nightingale pressed closer against the thorn and louder and louder grew her song for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid  and a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride  but the thorn had not yet reached her heart so the roses heart remained white for only a nightingales heartsblood can crimson the heart of a rose  and the tree cried to the nightingale to press closer against the thorn  press closer little nightingale cried the tree or the day will come before the rose is finished  so the nightingale pressed closer against the thorn and the thorn touched her heart and a fierce pang of pain shot through her bitter bitter was the pain and wilder and wilder grew her song for she sang of the love that is perfected by death of the love that dies not in the tomb  and the marvellous rose became crimson like the rose of the eastern sky  crimson was the girdle of petals and crimson as a ruby was the heart  but the nightingales voice grew fainter and her little wings began to beat and a film came over her eyes  fainter and fainter grew her song and she felt something choking her in her throat  then she gave one last burst of music  the white moon heard it and she forgot the dawn and lingered on in the sky  the red rose heard it and it trembled all over with ecstasy and opened its petals to the cold morning air  echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams it floated through the reeds of the river and they carried its message to the sea  look look cried the tree the rose is finished now but the nightingale made no answer for she was lying dead in the long grass with the thorn in her heart  and at noon the student opened his window and looked out  why what a wonderful piece of luck he cried here is a red rose  i have never seen any rose like it in all my life  it is so beautiful that i am sure it has a long latin name and he leaned down and plucked it  then he put on his hat and ran up to the professors house with the rose in his hand  the daughter of the professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel and her little dog was lying at her feet  you said that you would dance with me if i brought you a red rose cried the student  here is the reddest rose in all the world  you will wear it tonight next your heart and as we dance together it will tell you how i love you  but the girl frowned  i am afraid it will not go with my dress she answered and besides the chamberlains nephew has sent me some real jewels and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers  well upon my word you are very ungrateful said the student angrily and he threw the rose into the street where it fell into the gutter and a cartwheel went over it  ungrateful said the girl  i tell you what you are very rude and after all who are you  only a student  why i dont believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the chamberlains nephew has and she got up from her chair and went into the house  what i a silly thing love is said the student as he walked away it is not half as useful as logic for it does not prove anything and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen and making one believe things that are not true  in fact it is quite unpractical and as in this age to be practical is everything i shall go back to philosophy and study metaphysics  so he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book and began to read    the selfish giant    every afternoon as they were coming from school the children used to go and play in the giants garden  it was a large lovely garden with soft green grass  here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars and there were twelve peachtrees that in the springtime broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl and in the autumn bore rich fruit  the birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them  how happy we are here they cried to each other  one day the giant came back  he had been to visit his friend the cornish ogre and had stayed with him for seven years  after the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say for his conversation was limited and he determined to return to his own castle  when he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden  what are you doing here he cried in a very gruff voice and the children ran away  my own garden is my own garden said the giant any one can understand that and i will allow nobody to play in it but myself so he built a high wall all round it and put up a noticeboard   trespassers will be prosecuted   he was a very selfish giant  the poor children had now nowhere to play  they tried to play on the road but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones and they did not like it  they used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over and talk about the beautiful garden inside  how happy we were there they said to each other  then the spring came and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds  only in the garden of the selfish giant it was still winter  the birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children and the trees forgot to blossom  once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass but when it saw the noticeboard it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again and went off to sleep  the only people who were pleased were the snow and the frost  spring has forgotten this garden they cried so we will live here all the year round  the snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak and the frost painted all the trees silver  then they invited the north wind to stay with them and he came  he was wrapped in furs and he roared all day about the garden and blew the chimneypots down  this is a delightful spot he said we must ask the hail on a visit  so the hail came  every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go  he was dressed in grey and his breath was like ice  i cannot understand why the spring is so late in coming said the selfish giant as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden i hope there will be a change in the weather  but the spring never came nor the summer  the autumn gave golden fruit to every garden but to the giants garden she gave none he is too selfish she said  so it was always winter there and the north wind and the hail and the frost and the snow danced about through the trees  one morning the giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music  it sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the kings musicians passing by  it was really only a little linnet singing outside his window but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world  then the hail stopped dancing over his head and the north wind ceased roaring and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement  i believe the spring has come at last said the giant and he jumped out of bed and looked out  what did he see  he saw a most wonderful sight  through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in and they were sitting in the branches of the trees  in every tree that he could see there was a little child  and the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms and were waving their arms gently above the childrens heads  the birds were flying about and twittering with delight and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing  it was a lovely scene only in one corner it was still winter  it was the farthest corner of the garden and in it was standing a little boy  he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree and he was wandering all round it crying bitterly  the poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow and the north wind was blowing and roaring above it  climb up little boy said the tree and it bent its branches down as low as it could but the boy was too tiny  and the giants heart melted as he looked out  how selfish i have been he said now i know why the spring would not come here  i will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree and then i will knock down the wall and my garden shall be the childrens playground for ever and ever  he was really very sorry for what he had done  so he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly and went out into the garden  but when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away and the garden became winter again  only the little boy did not run for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming  and the giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand and put him up into the tree  and the tree broke at once into blossom and the birds came and sang on it and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the giants neck and kissed him  and the other children when they saw that the giant was not wicked any longer came running back and with them came the spring  it is your garden now little children said the giant and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall  and when the people were going to market at twelve oclock they found the giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen  all day long they played and in the evening they came to the giant to bid him goodbye  but where is your little companion he said  the boy i put into the tree  the giant loved him the best because he had kissed him  we dont know answered the children he has gone away  you must tell him to be sure and come here tomorrow said the giant  but the children said that they did not know where he lived and had never seen him before and the giant felt very sad  every afternoon when school was over the children came and played with the giant  but the little boy whom the giant loved was never seen again  the giant was very kind to all the children yet he longed for his first little friend and often spoke of him  how i would like to see him he used to say  years went over and the giant grew very old and feeble  he could not play about any more so he sat in a huge armchair and watched the children at their games and admired his garden  i have many beautiful flowers he said but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all  one winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing he did not hate the winter now for he knew that it was merely the spring asleep and that the flowers were resting  suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder and looked and looked  it certainly was a marvellous sight  in the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms  its branches were all golden and silver fruit hung down from them and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved  downstairs ran the giant in great joy and out into the garden  he hastened across the grass and came near to the child  and when he came quite close his face grew red with anger and he said who hath dared to wound thee  for on the palms of the childs hands were the prints of two nails and the prints of two nails were on the little feet  who hath dared to wound thee cried the giant tell me that i may take my big sword and slay him  nay answered the child but these are the wounds of love  who art thou said the giant and a strange awe fell on him and he knelt before the little child  and the child smiled on the giant and said to him you let me play once in your garden today you shall come with me to my garden which is paradise  and when the children ran in that afternoon they found the giant lying dead under the tree all covered with white blossoms    the devoted friend    one morning the old waterrat put his head out of his hole  he had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black indiarubber  the little ducks were swimming about in the pond looking just like a lot of yellow canaries and their mother who was pure white with real red legs was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water  you will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads she kept saying to them and every now and then she showed them how it was done  but the little ducks paid no attention to her  they were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all  what disobedient children cried the old waterrat they really deserve to be drowned  nothing of the kind answered the duck every one must make a beginning and parents cannot be too patient  ah i know nothing about the feelings of parents said the water rat i am not a family man  in fact i have never been married and i never intend to be  love is all very well in its way but friendship is much higher  indeed i know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship  and what pray is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend asked a green linnet who was sitting in a willowtree hard by and had overheard the conversation  yes that is just what i want to know said the duck and she swam away to the end of the pond and stood upon her head in order to give her children a good example  what a silly question cried the waterrat  i should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me of course  and what would you do in return said the little bird swinging upon a silver spray and flapping his tiny wings  i dont understand you answered the waterrat  let me tell you a story on the subject said the linnet  is the story about me asked the waterrat  if so i will listen to it for i am extremely fond of fiction  it is applicable to you answered the linnet and he flew down and alighting upon the bank he told the story of the devoted friend  once upon a time said the linnet there was an honest little fellow named hans  was he very distinguished asked the waterrat  no answered the linnet i dont think he was distinguished at all except for his kind heart and his funny round goodhumoured face  he lived in a tiny cottage all by himself and every day he worked in his garden  in all the countryside there was no garden so lovely as his  sweetwilliam grew there and gillyflowers and shepherdspurses and fairmaids of france  there were damask roses and yellow roses lilac crocuses and gold purple violets and white  columbine and ladysmock marjoram and wild basil the cowslip and the flowerdeluce the daffodil and the clovepink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by one flower taking another flowers place so that there were always beautiful things to look at and pleasant odours to smell  little hans had a great many friends but the most devoted friend of all was big hugh the miller  indeed so devoted was the rich miller to little hans that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay or a handful of sweet herbs or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season  real friends should have everything in common the miller used to say and little hans nodded and smiled and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas  sometimes indeed the neighbours thought it strange that the rich miller never gave little hans anything in return though he had a hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill and six milch cows and a large flock of woolly sheep but hans never troubled his head about these things and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things the miller used to say about the unselfishness of true friendship  so little hans worked away in his garden  during the spring the summer and the autumn he was very happy but when the winter came and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts  in the winter also he was extremely lonely as the miller never came to see him then  there is no good in my going to see little hans as long as the snow lasts the miller used to say to his wife for when people are in trouble they should be left alone and not be bothered by visitors  that at least is my idea about friendship and i am sure i am right  so i shall wait till the spring comes and then i shall pay him a visit and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make him so happy  you are certainly very thoughtful about others answered the wife as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire very thoughtful indeed  it is quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship  i am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful things as you do though he does live in a threestoried house and wear a gold ring on his little finger  but could we not ask little hans up here said the millers youngest son  if poor hans is in trouble i will give him half my porridge and show him my white rabbits  what a silly boy you are cried the miller i really dont know what is the use of sending you to school  you seem not to learn anything  why if little hans came up here and saw our warm fire and our good supper and our great cask of red wine he might get envious and envy is a most terrible thing and would spoil anybodys nature  i certainly will not allow hans nature to be spoiled  i am his best friend and i will always watch over him and see that he is not led into any temptations  besides if hans came here he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit and that i could not do  flour is one thing and friendship is another and they should not be confused  why the words are spelt differently and mean quite different things  everybody can see that  how well you talk said the millers wife pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale really i feel quite drowsy  it is just like being in church  lots of people act well answered the miller but very few people talk well which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two and much the finer thing also and he looked sternly across the table at his little son who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his head down and grew quite scarlet and began to cry into his tea  however he was so young that you must excuse him  is that the end of the story asked the waterrat  certainly not answered the linnet that is the beginning  then you are quite behind the age said the waterrat  every good storyteller nowadays starts with the end and then goes on to the beginning and concludes with the middle  that is the new method  i heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man  he spoke of the matter at great length and i am sure he must have been right for he had blue spectacles and a bald head and whenever the young man made any remark he always answered pooh  but pray go on with your story  i like the miller immensely  i have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself so there is a great sympathy between us  well said the linnet hopping now on one leg and now on the other as soon as the winter was over and the primroses began to open their pale yellow stars the miller said to his wife that he would go down and see little hans  why what a good heart you have cried his wife you are always thinking of others  and mind you take the big basket with you for the flowers  so the miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron chain and went down the hill with the basket on his arm  good morning little hans said the miller  good morning said hans leaning on his spade and smiling from ear to ear  and how have you been all the winter said the miller  well really cried hans it is very good of you to ask very good indeed  i am afraid i had rather a hard time of it but now the spring has come and i am quite happy and all my flowers are doing well  we often talked of you during the winter hans said the miller and wondered how you were getting on  that was kind of you said hans i was half afraid you had forgotten me  hans i am surprised at you said the miller friendship never forgets  that is the wonderful thing about it but i am afraid you dont understand the poetry of life  how lovely your primroses are looking bythebye  they are certainly very lovely said hans and it is a most lucky thing for me that i have so many  i am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the burgomasters daughter and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money  buy back your wheelbarrow  you dont mean to say you have sold it  what a very stupid thing to do  well the fact is said hans that i was obliged to  you see the winter was a very bad time for me and i really had no money at all to buy bread with  so i first sold the silver buttons off my sunday coat and then i sold my silver chain and then i sold my big pipe and at last i sold my wheelbarrow  but i am going to buy them all back again now  hans said the miller i will give you my wheelbarrow  it is not in very good repair indeed one side is gone and there is something wrong with the wheelspokes but in spite of that i will give it to you  i know it is very generous of me and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it but i am not like the rest of the world  i think that generosity is the essence of friendship and besides i have got a new wheelbarrow for myself  yes you may set your mind at ease i will give you my wheelbarrow  well really that is generous of you said little hans and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure  i can easily put it in repair as i have a plank of wood in the house  a plank of wood said the miller why that is just what i want for the roof of my barn  there is a very large hole in it and the corn will all get damp if i dont stop it up  how lucky you mentioned it  it is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another  i have given you my wheelbarrow and now you are going to give me your plank  of course the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank but true friendship never notices things like that  pray get it at once and i will set to work at my barn this very day  certainly cried little hans and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out  it is not a very big plank said the miller looking at it and i am afraid that after i have mended my barnroof there wont be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with but of course that is not my fault  and now as i have given you my wheelbarrow i am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return  here is the basket and mind you fill it quite full  quite full said little hans rather sorrowfully for it was really a very big basket and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back  well really answered the miller as i have given you my wheelbarrow i dont think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers  i may be wrong but i should have thought that friendship true friendship was quite free from selfishness of any kind  my dear friend my best friend cried little hans you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden  i would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons any day and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses and filled the millers basket  goodbye little hans said the miller as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder and the big basket in his hand  goodbye said little hans and he began to dig away quite merrily he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow  the next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch when he heard the millers voice calling to him from the road  so he jumped off the ladder and ran down the garden and looked over the wall  there was the miller with a large sack of flour on his back  dear little hans said the miller would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market  oh i am so sorry said hans but i am really very busy today i have got all my creepers to nail up and all my flowers to water and all my grass to roll  well really said the miller i think that considering that i am going to give you my wheelbarrow it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse  oh dont say that cried little hans i wouldnt be unfriendly for the whole world and he ran in for his cap and trudged off with the big sack on his shoulders  it was a very hot day and the road was terribly dusty and before hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down and rest  however he went on bravely and as last he reached the market  after he had waited there some time he sold the sack of flour for a very good price and then he returned home at once for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way  it has certainly been a hard day said little hans to himself as he was going to bed but i am glad i did not refuse the miller for he is my best friend and besides he is going to give me his wheelbarrow  early the next morning the miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour but little hans was so tired that he was still in bed  upon my word said the miller you are very lazy  really considering that i am going to give you my wheelbarrow i think you might work harder  idleness is a great sin and i certainly dont like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish  you must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you  of course i should not dream of doing so if i were not your friend  but what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means  anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter but a true friend always says unpleasant things and does not mind giving pain  indeed if he is a really true friend he prefers it for he knows that then he is doing good  i am very sorry said little hans rubbing his eyes and pulling off his nightcap but i was so tired that i thought i would lie in bed for a little time and listen to the birds singing  do you know that i always work better after hearing the birds sing  well i am glad of that said the miller clapping little hans on the back for i want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed and mend my barnroof for me  poor little hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden for his flowers had not been watered for two days but he did not like to refuse the miller as he was such a good friend to him  do you think it would be unfriendly of me if i said i was busy he inquired in a shy and timid voice  well really answered the miller i do not think it is much to ask of you considering that i am going to give you my wheelbarrow but of course if you refuse i will go and do it myself  oh on no account cried little hans and he jumped out of bed and dressed himself and went up to the barn  he worked there all day long till sunset and at sunset the miller came to see how he was getting on  have you mended the hole in the roof yet little hans cried the miller in a cheery voice  it is quite mended answered little hans coming down the ladder  ah said the miller there is no work so delightful as the work one does for others  it is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk answered little hans sitting down and wiping his forehead a very great privilege  but i am afraid i shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have  oh they will come to you said the miller but you must take more pains  at present you have only the practice of friendship some day you will have the theory also  do you really think i shall asked little hans  i have no doubt of it answered the miller but now that you have mended the roof you had better go home and rest for i want you to drive my sheep to the mountain tomorrow  poor little hans was afraid to say anything to this and early the next morning the miller brought his sheep round to the cottage and hans started off with them to the mountain  it took him the whole day to get there and back and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair and did not wake up till it was broad daylight  what a delightful time i shall have in my garden he said and he went to work at once  but somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all for his friend the miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands or getting him to help at the mill  little hans was very much distressed at times as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them but he consoled himself by the reflection that the miller was his best friend  besides he used to say he is going to give me his wheelbarrow and that is an act of pure generosity  so little hans worked away for the miller and the miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship which hans took down in a notebook and used to read over at night for he was a very good scholar  now it happened that one evening little hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door  it was a very wild night and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm  but a second rap came and then a third louder than any of the others  it is some poor traveller said little hans to himself and he ran to the door  there stood the miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other  dear little hans cried the miller i am in great trouble  my little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself and i am going for the doctor  but he lives so far away and it is such a bad night that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me  you know i am going to give you my wheelbarrow and so it is only fair that you should do something for me in return  certainly cried little hans i take it quite as a compliment your coming to me and i will start off at once  but you must lend me your lantern as the night is so dark that i am afraid i might fall into the ditch  i am very sorry answered the miller but it is my new lantern and it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it  well never mind i will do without it cried little hans and he took down his great fur coat and his warm scarlet cap and tied a muffler round his throat and started off  what a dreadful storm it was  the night was so black that little hans could hardly see and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely stand  however he was very courageous and after he had been walking about three hours he arrived at the doctors house and knocked at the door  who is there cried the doctor putting his head out of his bedroom window  little hans doctor  what do you want little hans  the millers son has fallen from a ladder and has hurt himself and the miller wants you to come at once  all right said the doctor and he ordered his horse and his big boots and his lantern and came downstairs and rode off in the direction of the millers house little hans trudging behind him  but the storm grew worse and worse and the rain fell in torrents and little hans could not see where he was going or keep up with the horse  at last he lost his way and wandered off on the moor which was a very dangerous place as it was full of deep holes and there poor little hans was drowned  his body was found the next day by some goatherds floating in a great pool of water and was brought back by them to the cottage  everybody went to little hans funeral as he was so popular and the miller was the chief mourner  as i was his best friend said the miller it is only fair that i should have the best place so he walked at the head of the procession in a long black cloak and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a big pockethandkerchief  little hans is certainly a great loss to every one said the blacksmith when the funeral was over and they were all seated comfortably in the inn drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes  a great loss to me at any rate answered the miller why i had as good as given him my wheelbarrow and now i really dont know what to do with it  it is very much in my way at home and it is in such bad repair that i could not get anything for it if i sold it  i will certainly take care not to give away anything again one always suffers for being generous  well said the waterrat after a long pause  well that is the end said the linnet  but what became of the miller asked the waterrat  oh  i really dont know replied the linnet and i am sure that i dont care  it is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature said the waterrat  i am afraid you dont quite see the moral of the story remarked the linnet  the what screamed the waterrat  the moral  do you mean to say that the story has a moral  certainly said the linnet  well really said the waterrat in a very angry manner i think you should have told me that before you began  if you had done so i certainly would not have listened to you in fact i should have said pooh like the critic  however i can say it now so he shouted out pooh at the top of his voice gave a whisk with his tail and went back into his hole  and how do you like the waterrat asked the duck who came paddling up some minutes afterwards  he has a great many good points but for my own part i have a mothers feelings and i can never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes  i am rather afraid that i have annoyed him answered the linnet the fact is that i told him a story with a moral  ah that is always a very dangerous thing to do said the duck  and i quite agree with her    the remarkable rocket    the kings son was going to be married so there were general rejoicings  he had waited a whole year for his bride and at last she had arrived  she was a russian princess and had driven all the way from finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer  the sledge was shaped like a great golden swan and between the swans wings lay the little princess herself  her long erminecloak reached right down to her feet on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue and she was as pale as the snow palace in which she had always lived  so pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered  she is like a white rose they cried and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies  at the gate of the castle the prince was waiting to receive her he had dreamy violet eyes and his hair was like fine gold  when he saw her he sank upon one knee and kissed her hand  your picture was beautiful he murmured but you are more beautiful than your picture and the little princess blushed  she was like a white rose before said a young page to his neighbour but she is like a red rose now and the whole court was delighted  for the next three days everybody went about saying white rose red rose red rose white rose and the king gave orders that the pages salary was to be doubled  as he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him but it was considered a great honour and was duly published in the court gazette  when the three days were over the marriage was celebrated  it was a magnificent ceremony and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls  then there was a state banquet which lasted for five hours  the prince and princess sat at the top of the great hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal  only true lovers could drink out of this cup for if false lips touched it it grew grey and dull and cloudy  its quite clear that they love each other said the little page as clear as crystal and the king doubled his salary a second time  what an honour cried all the courtiers  after the banquet there was to be a ball  the bride and bridegroom were to dance the rosedance together and the king had promised to play the flute  he played very badly but no one had ever dared to tell him so because he was the king  indeed he knew only two airs and was never quite certain which one he was playing but it made no matter for whatever he did everybody cried out charming charming  the last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks to be let off exactly at midnight  the little princess had never seen a firework in her life so the king had given orders that the royal pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage  what are fireworks like she had asked the prince one morning as she was walking on the terrace  they are like the aurora borealis said the king who always answered questions that were addressed to other people only much more natural  i prefer them to stars myself as you always know when they are going to appear and they are as delightful as my own fluteplaying  you must certainly see them  so at the end of the kings garden a great stand had been set up and as soon as the royal pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place the fireworks began to talk to each other  the world is certainly very beautiful cried a little squib just look at those yellow tulips  why if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier  i am very glad i have travelled travel improves the mind wonderfully and does away with all ones prejudices  the kings garden is not the world you foolish squib said a big roman candle the world is an enormous place and it would take you three days to see it thoroughly  any place you love is the world to you exclaimed a pensive catherine wheel who had been attached to an old deal box in early life and prided herself on her broken heart but love is not fashionable any more the poets have killed it  they wrote so much about it that nobody believed them and i am not surprised  true love suffers and is silent  i remember myself oncebut it is no matter now  romance is a thing of the past  nonsense said the roman candle romance never dies  it is like the moon and lives for ever  the bride and bridegroom for instance love each other very dearly  i heard all about them this morning from a brownpaper cartridge who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself and knew the latest court news  but the catherine wheel shook her head  romance is dead romance is dead romance is dead she murmured  she was one of those people who think that if you say the same thing over and over a great many times it becomes true in the end  suddenly a sharp dry cough was heard and they all looked round  it came from a tall superciliouslooking rocket who was tied to the end of a long stick  he always coughed before he made any observation so as to attract attention  ahem ahem he said and everybody listened except the poor catherine wheel who was still shaking her head and murmuring romance is dead  order order cried out a cracker  he was something of a politician and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections so he knew the proper parliamentary expressions to use  quite dead whispered the catherine wheel and she went off to sleep  as soon as there was perfect silence the rocket coughed a third time and began  he spoke with a very slow distinct voice as if he was dictating his memoirs and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking  in fact he had a most distinguished manner  how fortunate it is for the kings son he remarked that he is to be married on the very day on which i am to be let off  really if it had been arranged beforehand it could not have turned out better for him but princes are always lucky  dear me said the little squib i thought it was quite the other way and that we were to be let off in the princes honour  it may be so with you he answered indeed i have no doubt that it is but with me it is different  i am a very remarkable rocket and come of remarkable parents  my mother was the most celebrated catherine wheel of her day and was renowned for her graceful dancing  when she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars  she was three feet and a half in diameter and made of the very best gunpowder  my father was a rocket like myself and of french extraction  he flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again  he did though for he was of a kindly disposition and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain  the newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms indeed the court gazette called him a triumph of pylotechnic art  pyrotechnic pyrotechnic you mean said a bengal light i know it is pyrotechnic for i saw it written on my own canister  well i said pylotechnic answered the rocket in a severe tone of voice and the bengal light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs in order to show that he was still a person of some importance  i was saying continued the rocket i was sayingwhat was i saying  you were talking about yourself replied the roman candle  of course i knew i was discussing some interesting subject when i was so rudely interrupted  i hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind for i am extremely sensitive  no one in the whole world is so sensitive as i am i am quite sure of that  what is a sensitive person said the cracker to the roman candle  a person who because he has corns himself always treads on other peoples toes answered the roman candle in a low whisper and the cracker nearly exploded with laughter  pray what are you laughing at inquired the rocket i am not laughing  i am laughing because i am happy replied the cracker  that is a very selfish reason said the rocket angrily  what right have you to be happy  you should be thinking about others in fact you should be thinking about me  i am always thinking about myself and i expect everybody else to do the same  that is what is called sympathy  it is a beautiful virtue and i possess it in a high degree  suppose for instance anything happened to me tonight what a misfortune that would be for every one  the prince and princess would never be happy again their whole married life would be spoiled and as for the king i know he would not get over it  really when i begin to reflect on the importance of my position i am almost moved to tears  if you want to give pleasure to others cried the roman candle you had better keep yourself dry  certainly exclaimed the bengal light who was now in better spirits that is only common sense  common sense indeed said the rocket indignantly you forget that i am very uncommon and very remarkable  why anybody can have common sense provided that they have no imagination  but i have imagination for i never think of things as they really are i always think of them as being quite different  as for keeping myself dry there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature  fortunately for myself i dont care  the only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else and this is a feeling that i have always cultivated  but none of you have any hearts  here you are laughing and making merry just as if the prince and princess had not just been married  well really exclaimed a small fireballoon why not  it is a most joyful occasion and when i soar up into the air i intend to tell the stars all about it  you will see them twinkle when i talk to them about the pretty bride  ah what a trivial view of life said the rocket but it is only what i expected  there is nothing in you you are hollow and empty  why perhaps the prince and princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river and perhaps they may have one only son a little fairhaired boy with violet eyes like the prince himself and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great eldertree and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned what a terrible misfortune  poor people to lose their only son it is really too dreadful  i shall never get over it  but they have not lost their only son said the roman candle no misfortune has happened to them at all  i never said that they had replied the rocket i said that they might  if they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter  i hate people who cry over spilt milk  but when i think that they might lose their only son i certainly am very much affected  you certainly are cried the bengal light  in fact you are the most affected person i ever met  you are the rudest person i ever met said the rocket and you cannot understand my friendship for the prince  why you dont even know him growled the roman candle  i never said i knew him answered the rocket  i dare say that if i knew him i should not be his friend at all  it is a very dangerous thing to know ones friends  you had really better keep yourself dry said the fireballoon that is the important thing  very important for you i have no doubt answered the rocket but i shall weep if i choose and he actually burst into real tears which flowed down his stick like raindrops and nearly drowned two little beetles who were just thinking of setting up house together and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in  he must have a truly romantic nature said the catherine wheel for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about and she heaved a deep sigh and thought about the deal box  but the roman candle and the bengal light were quite indignant and kept saying humbug humbug at the top of their voices  they were extremely practical and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug  then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield and the stars began to shine and a sound of music came from the palace  the prince and princess were leading the dance  they danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time  then ten oclock struck and then eleven and then twelve and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace and the king sent for the royal pyrotechnist  let the fireworks begin said the king and the royal pyrotechnist made a low bow and marched down to the end of the garden  he had six attendants with him each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole  it was certainly a magnificent display  whizz whizz went the catherine wheel as she spun round and round  boom  boom went the roman candle  then the squibs danced all over the place and the bengal lights made everything look scarlet  goodbye cried the fireballoon as he soared away dropping tiny blue sparks  bang bang answered the crackers who were enjoying themselves immensely  every one was a great success except the remarkable rocket  he was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all  the best thing in him was the gunpowder and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use  all his poor relations to whom he would never speak except with a sneer shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with blossoms of fire  huzza huzza cried the court and the little princess laughed with pleasure  i suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion said the rocket no doubt that is what it means and he looked more supercilious than ever  the next day the workmen came to put everything tidy  this is evidently a deputation said the rocket i will receive them with becoming dignity so he put his nose in the air and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject but they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away  then one of them caught sight of him  hallo he cried what a bad rocket and he threw him over the wall into the ditch  bad rocket  bad rocket he said as he whirled through the air impossible  grand rocket that is what the man said  bad and grand sound very much the same indeed they often are the same and he fell into the mud  it is not comfortable here he remarked but no doubt it is some fashionable wateringplace and they have sent me away to recruit my health  my nerves are certainly very much shattered and i require rest  then a little frog with bright jewelled eyes and a green mottled coat swam up to him  a new arrival i see said the frog  well after all there is nothing like mud  give me rainy weather and a ditch and i am quite happy  do you think it will be a wet afternoon  i am sure i hope so but the sky is quite blue and cloudless  what a pity  ahem ahem said the rocket and he began to cough  what a delightful voice you have cried the frog  really it is quite like a croak and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world  you will hear our gleeclub this evening  we sit in the old duck pond close by the farmers house and as soon as the moon rises we begin  it is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us  in fact it was only yesterday that i heard the farmers wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us  it is most gratifying to find oneself so popular  ahem ahem said the rocket angrily  he was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in  a delightful voice certainly continued the frog i hope you will come over to the duckpond  i am off to look for my daughters  i have six beautiful daughters and i am so afraid the pike may meet them  he is a perfect monster and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them  well goodbye  i have enjoyed our conversation very much i assure you  conversation indeed said the rocket  you have talked the whole time yourself  that is not conversation  somebody must listen answered the frog and i like to do all the talking myself  it saves time and prevents arguments  but i like arguments said the rocket  i hope not said the frog complacently  arguments are extremely vulgar for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions  goodbye a second time i see my daughters in the distance and the little frog swam away  you are a very irritating person said the rocket and very ill bred  i hate people who talk about themselves as you do when one wants to talk about oneself as i do  it is what i call selfishness and selfishness is a most detestable thing especially to any one of my temperament for i am well known for my sympathetic nature  in fact you should take example by me you could not possibly have a better model  now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it for i am going back to court almost immediately  i am a great favourite at court in fact the prince and princess were married yesterday in my honour of course you know nothing of these matters for you are a provincial  there is no good talking to him said a dragonfly who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush no good at all for he has gone away  well that is his loss not mine answered the rocket  i am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention i like hearing myself talk  it is one of my greatest pleasures  i often have long conversations all by myself and i am so clever that sometimes i dont understand a single word of what i am saying  then you should certainly lecture on philosophy said the dragon fly and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky  how very silly of him not to stay here said the rocket  i am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind however i dont care a bit  genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day and he sank down a little deeper into the mud  after some time a large white duck swam up to him  she had yellow legs and webbed feet and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle  quack quack quack she said  what a curious shape you are may i ask were you born like that or is it the result of an accident  it is quite evident that you have always lived in the country answered the rocket otherwise you would know who i am  however i excuse your ignorance  it would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as oneself  you will no doubt be surprised to hear that i can fly up into the sky and come down in a shower of golden rain  i dont think much of that said the duck as i cannot see what use it is to any one  now if you could plough the fields like the ox or draw a cart like the horse or look after the sheep like the colliedog that would be something  my good creature cried the rocket in a very haughty tone of voice i see that you belong to the lower orders  a person of my position is never useful  we have certain accomplishments and that is more than sufficient  i have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend  indeed i have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do  well well said the duck who was of a very peaceable disposition and never quarrelled with any one everybody has different tastes  i hope at any rate that you are going to take up your residence here  oh dear no cried the rocket  i am merely a visitor a distinguished visitor  the fact is that i find this place rather tedious  there is neither society here nor solitude  in fact it is essentially suburban  i shall probably go back to court for i know that i am destined to make a sensation in the world  i had thoughts of entering public life once myself remarked the duck there are so many things that need reforming  indeed i took the chair at a meeting some time ago and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like  however they did not seem to have much effect  now i go in for domesticity and look after my family   i am made for public life said the rocket and so are all my relations even the humblest of them  whenever we appear we excite great attention  i have not actually appeared myself but when i do so it will be a magnificent sight  as for domesticity it ages one rapidly and distracts ones mind from higher things  ah the higher things of life how fine they are said the duck and that reminds me how hungry i feel  and she swam away down the stream saying quack quack quack  come back come back screamed the rocket i have a great deal to say to you but the duck paid no attention to him  i am glad that she has gone he said to himself she has a decidedly middleclass mind and he sank a little deeper still into the mud and began to think about the loneliness of genius when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank with a kettle and some faggots  this must be the deputation said the rocket and he tried to look very dignified  hallo cried one of the boys look at this old stick  i wonder how it came here and he picked the rocket out of the ditch  old stick said the rocket impossible  gold stick that is what he said  gold stick is very complimentary  in fact he mistakes me for one of the court dignitaries  let us put it into the fire said the other boy it will help to boil the kettle  so they piled the faggots together and put the rocket on top and lit the fire  this is magnificent cried the rocket they are going to let me off in broad daylight so that every one can see me  we will go to sleep now they said and when we wake up the kettle will be boiled and they lay down on the grass and shut their eyes  the rocket was very damp so he took a long time to burn  at last however the fire caught him  now i am going off he cried and he made himself very stiff and straight  i know i shall go much higher than the stars much higher than the moon much higher than the sun  in fact i shall go so high that  fizz fizz fizz and he went straight up into the air  delightful he cried i shall go on like this for ever  what a success i am  but nobody saw him  then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him  now i am going to explode he cried  i shall set the whole world on fire and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year  and he certainly did explode bang bang bang went the gunpowder  there was no doubt about it  but nobody heard him not even the two little boys for they were sound asleep  then all that was left of him was the stick and this fell down on the back of a goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch  good heavens cried the goose  it is going to rain sticks and she rushed into the water  i knew i should create a great sensation gasped the rocket and he went out
