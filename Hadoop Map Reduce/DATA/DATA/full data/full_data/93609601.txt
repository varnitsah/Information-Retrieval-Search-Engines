93609601	brown wolf  illustration     brown wolf  and  other jack london stories   as chosen by  franklin k mathiews  chief scout librarian boy scouts of america     table of contents  brown wolf  that spot  trust  all gold canyon  the story of keesh  nambok the unveracious  yellow handkerchief  make westing  the heathen  the hobo and the fairy  just meat  a nose for the king   introduction  boys delight in men who have had adventures and when they are privileged to read of such exploits in thrilling story form that is the seventh heaven for them such a boys man was jack london whose whole life was one of stirring action on land and sea gifted as a story teller he wrote books almost without end some of them the call of the wild the sea wolf and white fang have already been recognized as fine books for boys others volumes of short stories contain many of like interest possessing the same qualities that have made the other and longer stories so acceptable as juveniles  effort has been made by the editor to bring together in one volume a number of such stories not for the reason alone that there might be another jack london book for boys but also in order to add to our juvenile literature a volume likely to be chewed and digested as bacon says a book worthy to be read whole and with diligence and attention for my belief is that boys read altogether too few of such books or perhaps it would be more correct to say have too few opportunities to read such books because so often we fail to see how quick in their reading their minds are to grasp the more difficult and how keen and competent their conscience to draw the right conclusion when situations are presented wherein men err so grievously  it is hoped the stories presented will serve to exercise both the boys mind and conscience that seeing and feeling life and nature as jack london saw and felt itthe best and the worst in human nature with the infinite always near and from whom there is no escapeseeing and feeling such things boys will develop the emotional muscles of the spirit have opened up new windows to their imaginations and withal add some line or color to their lifes ideals  franklin k mathiews chief scout librarian boy scouts of america  illustration     brown wolf   she had delayed because of the dewwet grass in order to put on her overshoes and when she emerged from the house found her waiting husband absorbed in the wonder of a bursting almondbud she sent a questing glance across the tall grass and in and out among the orchard trees  wheres wolf she asked  he was here a moment ago walt irvine drew himself away with a jerk from the metaphysics and poetry of the organic miracle of blossom and surveyed the landscape he was running a rabbit the last i saw of him  wolf wolf here wolf she called as they left the clearing and took the trail that led down through the waxenbelled manzanita jungle to the county road  irvine thrust between his lips the little finger of each hand and lent to her efforts a shrill whistling  she covered her ears hastily and made a wry grimace  my for a poet delicately attuned and all the rest of it you can make unlovely noises my eardrums are pierced you outwhistle  orpheus  i was about to say a streetarab she concluded severely  poesy does not prevent one from being practicalat least it doesnt prevent me mine is no futility of genius that cant sell gems to the magazines  he assumed a mock extravagance and went on  i am no attic singer no ballroom warbler and why because i am practical mine is no squalor of song that cannot transmute itself with proper exchange value into a flowercrowned cottage a sweet mountainmeadow a grove of redwoods an orchard of thirtyseven trees one long row of blackberries and two short rows of strawberries to say nothing of a quarter of a mile of gurgling brook  oh that all your songtransmutations were as successful she laughed  name one that wasnt  those two beautiful sonnets that you transmuted into the cow that was accounted the worst milker in the township  she was beautiful he began  but she didnt give milk madge interrupted  but she was beautiful now wasnt she he insisted  and heres where beauty and utility fall out was her reply and theres the wolf  from the thicketcovered hillside came a crashing of underbrush and then forty feet above them on the edge of the sheer wall of rock appeared a wolfs head and shoulders his braced forepaws dislodged a pebble and with sharppricked ears and peering eyes he watched the fall of the pebble till it struck at their feet then he transferred his gaze and with open mouth laughed down at them  you wolf you and you blessed wolf the man and woman called out to him the ears flattened back and down at the sound and the head seemed to snuggle under the caress of an invisible hand  they watched him scramble backward into the thicket then proceeded on their way several minutes later rounding a turn in the trail where the descent was less precipitous he joined them in the midst of a miniature avalanche of pebbles and loose soil he was not demonstrative a pat and a rub around the ears from the man and a more prolonged caressing from the woman and he was away down the trail in front of them gliding effortlessly over the ground in true wolf fashion  in build and coat and brush he was a huge timberwolf but the lie was given to his wolfhood by his color and marking there the dog unmistakably advertised itself no wolf was ever colored like him he was brown deep brown redbrown an orgy of browns back and shoulders were a warm brown that paled on the sides and underneath to a yellow that was dingy because of the brown that lingered in it the white of the throat and paws and the spots over the eyes was dirty because of the persistent and ineradicable brown while the eyes themselves were twin topazes golden and brown  the man and woman loved the dog very much perhaps this was because it had been such a task to win his love it had been no easy matter when he first drifted in mysteriously out of nowhere to their little mountain cottage footsore and famished he had killed a rabbit under their very noses and under their very windows and then crawled away and slept by the spring at the foot of the blackberry bushes when walt irvine went down to inspect the intruder he was snarled at for his pains and madge likewise was snarled at when she went down to present as a peaceoffering a large pan of bread and milk  a most unsociable dog he proved to be resenting all their advances refusing to let them lay hands on him menacing them with bared fangs and bristling hair nevertheless he remained sleeping and resting by the spring and eating the food they gave him after they set it down at a safe distance and retreated his wretched physical condition explained why he lingered and when he had recuperated after several days sojourn he disappeared  and this would have been the end of him so far as irvine and his wife were concerned had not irvine at that particular time been called away into the northern part of the state biding along on the train near to the line between california and oregon he chanced to look out of the window and saw his unsociable guest sliding along the wagon road brown and wolfish tired yet tireless dustcovered and soiled with two hundred miles of travel  now irvine was a man of impulse a poet he got off the train at the next station bought a piece of meat at a butcher shop and captured the vagrant on the outskirts of the town the return trip was made in the baggage car and so wolf came a second time to the mountain cottage here he was tied up for a week and made love to by the man and woman but it was very circumspect lovemaking remote and alien as a traveller from another planet he snarled down their softspoken lovewords he never barked in all the time they had him he was never known to bark  to win him became a problem irvine liked problems he had a metal plate made on which was stamped return to walt irvine glen ellen sonoma county california this was riveted to a collar and strapped about the dogs neck then he was turned loose and promptly he disappeared a day later came a telegram from mendocino county in twenty hours he had made over a hundred miles to the north and was still going when captured  he came back by wells fargo express was tied up three days and was loosed on the fourth and lost this time he gained southern oregon before he was caught and returned always as soon as he received his liberty he fled away and always he fled north he was possessed of an obsession that drove him north the homing instinct irvine called it after he had expended the selling price of a sonnet in getting the animal back from northern oregon  another time the brown wanderer succeeded in traversing half the length of california all of oregon and most of washington before he was picked up and returned collect a remarkable thing was the speed with which he traveled fed up and rested as soon as he was loosed he devoted all his energy to getting over the ground on the first days run he was known to cover as high as a hundred and fifty miles and after that he would average a hundred miles a day until caught he always arrived back lean and hungry and savage and always departed fresh and vigorous cleaving his way northward in response to some prompting of his being that no one could understand  but at last after a futile year of flight he accepted the inevitable and elected to remain at the cottage where first he had killed the rabbit and slept by the spring even after that a long time elapsed before the man and woman succeeded in patting him it was a great victory for they alone were allowed to put hands on him he was fastidiously exclusive and no guest at the cottage ever succeeded in making up to him a low growl greeted such approach if any one had the hardihood to come nearer the lips lifted the naked fangs appeared and the growl became a snarla snarl so terrible and malignant that it awed the stoutest of them as it likewise awed the farmers dogs that knew ordinary dog snarling but had never seen wolf snarling before  he was without antecedents his history began with walt and madge he had come up from the south but never a clew did they get of the owner from whom he had evidently fled mrs johnson their nearest neighbor and the one who supplied them with milk proclaimed him a klondike dog her brother was burrowing for frozen paystreaks in that far country and so she constituted herself an authority on the subject  but they did not dispute her there were the tips of wolfs ears obviously so severely frozen at some time that they would never quite heal again besides he looked like the photographs of the alaskan dogs they saw published in magazines and newspapers they often speculated over his past and tried to conjure up from what they had read and heard what his northland life had been that the northland still drew him they knew for at night they sometimes heard him crying softly and when the north wind blew and the bite of frost was in the air a great restlessness would come upon him and he would lift a mournful lament which they knew to be the long wolfhowl yet he never barked no provocation was great enough to draw from him that canine cry  long discussion they had during the time of winning him as to whose dog he was each claimed him and each proclaimed loudly any expression of affection made by him but the man had the better of it at first chiefly because he was a man it was patent that wolf had had no experience with women he did not understand women madges skirts were something he never quite accepted the swish of them was enough to set him abristle with suspicion and on a windy day she could not approach him at all  on the other hand it was madge who fed him also it was she who ruled the kitchen and it was by her favor and her favor alone that he was permitted to come within that sacred precinct it was because of these things that she bade fair to overcome the handicap of her garments then it was that walt put forth special effort making it a practice to have wolf lie at his feet while he wrote and between petting and talking losing much time from his work walt won in the end and his victory was most probably due to the fact that he was a man though madge averred that they would have had another quarter of a mile of gurgling brook and at least two west winds sighing through their redwoods had walt properly devoted his energies to songtransmutation and left wolf alone to exercise a natural taste and an unbiased judgment  its about time i heard from those triolets walt said after a silence of five minutes during which they had swung steadily down the trail therell be a check at the post office i know and well transmute it into beautiful buckwheat flour a gallon of maple syrup and a new pair of overshoes for you  and into beautiful milk from mrs johnsons beautiful cow madge added tomorrows the first of the month you know  walt scowled unconsciously then his face brightened and he clapped his hand to his breast pocket  never mind i have here a nice beautiful new cow the best milker in california  when did you write it she demanded eagerly then reproachfully and you never showed it to me  i saved it to read to you on the way to the post office in a spot remarkably like this one he answered indicating with a wave of his hand a dry log on which to sit  a tiny stream flowed out of a dense fernbrake slipped down a mossylipped stone and ran across the path at their feet from the valley arose the mellow song of meadow larks while about them in and out through sunshine and shadow fluttered great yellow butterflies  up from below came another sound that broke in upon walt reading softly from his manuscript it was a crunching of heavy feet punctuated now and again by the clattering of a displaced stone as walt finished and looked to his wife for approval a man came into view around the turn of the trail he was bareheaded and sweaty with a handkerchief in one hand he mopped his face while in the other hand he carried a new hat and a wilted starched collar which he had removed from his neck he was a wellbuilt man and his muscles seemed on the point of bursting out of the painfully new and readymade black clothes he wore  warm day walt greeted him walt believed in country democracy and never missed an opportunity to practice it  the man paused and nodded  i guess i aint used much to the warm he vouchsafed half apologetically im more accustomed to zero weather  you dont find any of that in this country walt laughed  should say not the man answered an i aint here alookin for it neither im tryin to find my sister mebbe you know where she lives her names johnson mrs william johnson  youre not her klondike brother madge cried her eyes bright with interest about whom weve heard so much  yesm thats me he answered modestly my names miller skiff miller i just thought id sprise her  you are on the right track then only youve come by the footpath madge stood up to direct him pointing up the canyon a quarter of a mile you see that blasted redwood take the little trail turning off to the right its the short cut to her house you cant miss it  yesm thank you maam he said  he made tentative efforts to go but seemed awkwardly rooted to the spot he was gazing at her with an open admiration of which he was quite unconscious and which was drowning along with him in the rising sea of embarrassment in which he floundered  wed like to hear you tell about the klondike madge said maynt we come over some day while you are at your sisters or better yet wont you come over and have dinner with us  yesm thank you maam he mumbled mechanically then he caught himself up and added i aint stoppin long i got to be pullin north again i go out on tonights train you see ive got a mail contract with the government  when madge had said that it was too bad he made another futile effort to go but he could not take his eyes from her face he forgot his embarrassment in his admiration and it was her turn to flush and feel uncomfortable  it was at this juncture when walt had just decided it was time for him to be saying something to relieve the strain that wolf who had been away nosing through the brush trotted wolflike into view  skiff millers abstraction disappeared the pretty woman before him passed out of his field of vision he had eyes only for the dog and a great wonder came into his face  well ill be hanged he enunciated slowly and solemnly  he sat down ponderingly on the log leaving madge standing at the sound of his voice wolfs ears had flattened down then his mouth had opened in a laugh he trotted slowly up to the stranger and first smelled his hands then licked them with his tongue  skiff miller patted the dogs head and slowly and solemnly repeated well ill be hanged  excuse me maam he said the next moment i was just sprised some that was all  were surprised too she answered lightly we never saw wolf make up to a stranger before  is that what you call himwolf the man asked  madge nodded but i cant understand his friendliness toward youunless its because youre from the klondike hes a klondike dog you know  yesm miller said absently he lifted one of wolfs forelegs and examined the footpads pressing them and denting them with his thumb kind of soft he remarked he aint been on trail for a long time  i say walt broke in it is remarkable the way he lets you handle him  skiff miller arose no longer awkward with admiration of madge and in a sharp businesslike manner asked how long have you had him  but just then the dog squirming and rubbing against the newcomers legs opened his mouth and barked it was an explosive bark brief and joyous but a bark  thats a new one on me skiff miller remarked  walt and madge stared at each other the miracle had happened wolf had barked  its the first time he ever barked madge said  first time i ever heard him too miller volunteered  madge smiled at him the man was evidently a humorist  of course she said since you have only seen him for five minutes  skiff miller looked at her sharply seeking in her face the guile her words had led him to suspect  i thought you understood he said slowly i thought youd tumbled to it from his makin up to me hes my dog his name aint wolf its brown  oh walt was madges instinctive cry to her husband  walt was on the defensive at once  how do you know hes your dog he demanded  because he is was the reply  mere assertion walt said sharply  in his slow and pondering way skiff miller looked at him then asked with a nod of his head toward madge  how dyou know shes your wife you just say because she is and ill say its mere assertion the dogs mine i bred m an raised m an i guess i ought to know look here ill prove it to you  skiff miller turned to the dog brown his voice rang out sharply and at the sound the dogs ears flattened down as to a caress gee the dog made a swinging turn to the right now mushon and the dog ceased his swing abruptly and started straight ahead halting obediently at command  i can do it with whistles skiff miller said proudly he was my lead dog  but you are not going to take him away with you madge asked tremulously  the man nodded  back into that awful klondike world of suffering  he nodded and added oh it aint so bad as all that look at me pretty healthy specimen aint i  but the dogs the terrible hardship the heartbreaking toil the starvation the frost oh ive read about it and i know  i nearly ate him once over on little fish river miller volunteered grimly if i hadnt got a moose that day was all that saved m  id have died first madge cried  things is different down here miller explained you dont have to eat dogs you think different just about the time youre all in youve never been all in so you dont know anything about it  thats the very point she argued warmly dogs are not eaten in california why not leave him here he is happy hell never want for foodyou know that hell never suffer from cold and hardship here all is softness and gentleness neither the human nor nature is savage he will never know a whiplash again and as for the weatherwhy it never snows here  but its allfired hot in summer beggin your pardon skiff miller laughed  but you do not answer madge continued passionately what have you to offer him in that northland life  grub when ive got it and thats most of the time came the answer  and the rest of the time  no grub  and the work  yes plenty of work miller blurted out impatiently work without end an famine an frost an all the rest of the miseriesthats what hell get when he comes with me but he likes it he is used to it he knows that life he was born to it an brought up to it an you dont know anything about it you dont know what youre talking about thats where the dog belongs and thats where hell be happiest  the dog doesnt go walt announced in a determined voice so there is no need of further discussion  whats that skiff miller demanded big brows lowering and an obstinate flush of blood reddening his forehead  i said the dog doesnt go and that settles it i dont believe hes your dog you may have seen him sometime you may even sometime have driven him for his owner but his obeying the ordinary driving commands of the alaskan trail is no demonstration that he is yours any dog in alaska would obey you as he obeyed besides he is undoubtedly a valuable dog as dogs go in alaska and that is sufficient explanation of your desire to get possession of him anyway youve got to prove property  skiff miller cool and collected the obstinate flush a trifle deeper on his forehead his huge muscles bulging under the black cloth of his coat carefully looked the poet up and down as though measuring the strength of his slenderness  the klondikers face took on a contemptuous expression as he said finally i reckon theres nothin in sight to prevent me takin the dog right here an now  walts face reddened and the strikingmuscles of his arms and shoulders seemed to stiffen and grow tense his wife fluttered apprehensively into the breach  maybe mr miller is right she said i am afraid that he is wolf does seem to know him and certainly he answers to the name of brown he made friends with him instantly and you know thats something he never did with anybody before besides look at the way he barked he was just bursting with joy joy over what without doubt at finding mr miller  walts strikingmuscles relaxed and his shoulders seemed to droop with hopelessness  i guess youre right madge he said wolf isnt wolf but brown and he must belong to mr miller  perhaps mr miller will sell him she suggested we can buy him  skiff miller shook his head no longer belligerent but kindly quick to be generous in response to generousness  i had five dogs he said casting about for the easiest way to temper his refusal he was the leader they was the crack team of alaska nothin could touch em in 1898 i refused five thousand dollars for the bunch dogs was high then anyway but that wasnt what made the fancy price it was the team itself brown was the best in the team that winter i refused twelve hundred for m i didnt sell m then an i aint asellin m now besides i think a mighty lot of that dog ive been lookin for m for three years it made me fair sick when i found hed been stolenot the value of him but thewell i liked m so thats all i couldnt believe my eyes when i seen m just now i thought i was dreamin it was too good to be true why i was his nurse i put m to bed snug every night his mother died and i brought m up on condensed milk at two dollars a can when i couldnt afford it in my own coffee he never knew any mother but me he used to suck my finger regular the darn little pupthat finger right there  and skiff miller too overwrought for speech held up a forefinger for them to see  that very finger he managed to articulate as though it somehow clinched the proof of ownership and the bond of affection  he was still gazing at his extended finger when madge began to speak  but the dog she said you havent considered the dog  skiff miller looked puzzled  have you thought about him she asked  dont know what youre drivin at was the response  maybe the dog has some choice in the matter madge went on maybe he has his likes and desires you have not considered him you give him no choice it has never entered your mind that possibly he might prefer california to alaska you consider only what you like you do with him as you would with a sack of potatoes or a bale of hay  this was a new way of looking at it and miller was visibly impressed as he debated it in his mind madge took advantage of his indecision  if you really love him what would be happiness to him would be your happiness also she urged  skiff miller continued to debate with himself and madge stole a glance of exultation to her husband who looked back warm approval  what do you think the klondiker suddenly demanded  it was her turn to be puzzled what do you mean she asked  dye think hed sooner stay in california  she nodded her head with positiveness i am sure of it  skiff miller again debated with himself though this time aloud at the same time running his gaze in a judicial way over the mooted animal  he was a good worker hes done a heap of work for me he never loafed on me an he was a joedandy at hammerin a raw team into shape hes got a head on him he can do everything but talk he knows what you say to him look at m now he knows were talkin about him  the dog was lying at skiff millers feet head close down on paws ears erect and listening and eyes that were quick and eager to follow the sound of speech as it fell from the lips of first one and then the other  an theres a lot of work in m yet hes good for years to come an i do like him  once or twice after that skiff miller opened his mouth and closed it again without speaking finally he said  ill tell you what ill do your remarks maam has some weight in them the dogs worked hard and maybe hes earned a soft berth an has got a right to choose anyway well leave it up to him whatever he says goes you people stay right here settin down ill say goodby and walk off casuallike if he wants to stay he can stay if he wants to come with me let m come i wont call m to come an dont you call m to come back  he looked with sudden suspicion at madge and added only you must play fair no persuadin after my back is turned  well play fair madge began but skiff miller broke in on her assurances  i know the ways of women he announced their hearts is soft when their hearts is touched theyre likely to stack the cards look at the bottom of the deck an liebeggin your pardon maam im only discoursin about women in general  i dont know how to thank you madge quavered  i dont see as youve got any call to thank me he replied brown aint decided yet now you wont mind if i go away slow its no moren fair seein ill be out of sight inside a hundred yards  madge agreed and added and i promise you faithfully that we wont do anything to influence him  well then i might as well he gettin along skiff miller said in the ordinary tones of one departing  at this change in his voice wolf lifted his head quickly and still more quickly got to his feet when the man and woman shook hands he sprang up on his hind legs resting his fore paws on her hip and at the same time licking skiff millers hand when the latter shook hands with walt wolf repeated his act resting his weight on walt and licking both mens hands  it aint no picnic i can tell you that were the klondikers last words as he turned and went slowly up the trail  for the distance of twenty feet wolf watched him go himself all eagerness and expectancy as though waiting for the man to turn and retrace his steps then with a quick low whine wolf sprang after him overtook him caught his hand between his teeth with reluctant tenderness and strove gently to make him pause  failing in this wolf raced back to where walt irvine sat catching his coat sleeve in his teeth and trying vainly to drag him after the retreating man  wolfs perturbation began to wax he desired ubiquity he wanted to be in two places at the same time with the old master and the new and steadily the distance between them was increasing he sprang about excitedly making short nervous leaps and twists now toward one now toward the other in painful indecision not knowing his own mind desiring both and unable to choose uttering quick sharp whines and beginning to pant  he sat down abruptly on his haunches thrusting his nose upward the mouth opening and closing with jerking movements each time opening wider these jerking movements were in unison with the recurrent spasms that attacked the throat each spasm severer and more intense than the preceding one and in accord with jerks and spasms the larynx began to vibrate at first silently accompanied by the rush of air expelled from the lungs then sounding a low deep note the lowest in the register of the human ear all this was the nervous and muscular preliminary to howling  but just as the howl was on the verge of bursting from the full throat the wideopened mouth was closed the paroxysms ceased and he looked long and steadily at the retreating man suddenly wolf turned his head and over his shoulder just as steadily regarded walt the appeal was unanswered not a word nor a sign did the dog receive no suggestion and no clew as to what his conduct should be  a glance ahead to where the old master was nearing the curve of the trail excited him again he sprang to his feet with a whine and then struck by a new idea turned his attention to madge hitherto he had ignored her but now both masters failing him she alone was left he went over to her and snuggled his head in her lap nudging her arm with his nosean old trick of his when begging for favors he backed away from her and began writhing and twisting playfully curvetting and prancing half rearing and striking his forepaws to the earth struggling with all his body from the wheedling eyes and flattening ears to the wagging tail to express the thought that was in him and that was denied him utterance  this too he soon abandoned he was depressed by the coldness of these humans who had never been cold before no response could he draw from them no help could he get they did not consider him they were as dead  he turned and silently gazed after the old master skiff miller was rounding the curve in a moment he would be gone from view yet he never turned his head plodding straight onward slowly and methodically as though possessed of no interest in what was occurring behind his back  and in this fashion he went out of view wolf waited for him to reappear he waited a long minute silently quietly without movement as though turned to stonewithal stone quick with eagerness and desire he barked once and waited then he turned and trotted back to walt irvine he sniffed his hand and dropped down heavily at his feet watching the trail where it curved emptily from view  the tiny stream slipping down the mossylipped stone seemed suddenly to increase the volume of its gurgling noise save for the meadow larks there was no other sound the great yellow butterflies drifted silently through the sunshine and lost themselves in the drowsy shadows madge gazed triumphantly at her husband  a few minutes later wolf got upon his feet decision and deliberation marked his movements he did not glance at the man and woman his eyes were fixed up the trail he had made up his mind they knew it and they knew so far as they were concerned that the ordeal had just begun  he broke into a trot and madges lips pursed forming an avenue for the caressing sound that it was the will of her to send forth but the caressing sound was not made she was impelled to look at her husband and she saw the sternness with which he watched her the pursed lips relaxed and she sighed inaudibly  wolfs trot broke into a run wider and wider were the leaps he made not once did he turn his head his wolfs brush standing out straight behind him he cut sharply across the curve of the trail and was gone  illustration     that spot   i dont think much of stephen mackaye any more though i used to swear by him i know that in those days i loved him more than my own brother if ever i meet stephen mackaye again i shall not be responsible for my actions it passes beyond me that a man with whom i shared food and blanket and with whom i mushed over the chilcoot trail should turn out the way he did i always sized steve up as a square man a kindly comrade without an iota of anything vindictive or malicious in his nature i shall never trust my judgment in men again why i nursed that man through typhoid fever we starved together on the headwaters of the stewart and he saved my life on the little salmon and now after the years we were together all i can say of stephen mackaye is that he is the meanest man i ever knew  we started for the klondike in the fall rush of 1897 and we started too late to get over chilcoot pass before the freezeup we packed our outfit on our backs part way over when the snow began to fly and then we had to buy dogs in order to sled it the rest of the way that was how we came to get that spot dogs were high and we paid one hundred and ten dollars for him he looked worth it i say looked because he was one of the finest appearing dogs i ever saw he weighed sixty pounds and he had all the lines of a good sled animal we never could make out his breed he wasnt husky nor malemute nor hudson bay he looked like all of them and he didnt look like any of them and on top of it all he had some of the white mans dog in him for on one side in the thick of the mixed yellowbrownredanddirtywhite that was his prevailing color there was a spot of coalblack as big as a waterbucket that was why we called him spot  he was a good looker all right when he was in condition his muscles stood out in bunches all over him and he was the strongest looking brute i ever saw in alaska also the most intelligent looking to run your eyes over him youd think he could outpull three dogs of his own weight maybe he could but i never saw it his intelligence didnt run that way he could steal and forage to perfection he had an instinct that was positively grewsome for divining when work was to be done and for making a sneak accordingly and for getting lost and not staying lost he was nothing short of inspired but when it came to work the way that intelligence dribbled out of him and left him a mere clot of wobbling stupid jelly would make your heart bleed  there are times when i think it wasnt stupidity maybe like some men i know he was too wise to work i shouldnt wonder if he put it all over us with that intelligence of his maybe he figured it all out and decided that a licking now and again and no work was a whole lot better than work all the time and no licking he was intelligent enough for such a computation i tell you ive sat and looked into that dogs eyes till the shivers ran up and down my spine and the marrow crawled like yeast what of the intelligence i saw shining out i cant express myself about that intelligence it is beyond mere words i saw it thats all at times it was like gazing into a human soul to look into his eyes and what i saw there frightened me and started all sorts of ideas in my own mind of reincarnation and all the rest i tell you i sensed something big in that brutes eyes there was a message there but i wasnt big enough myself to catch it whatever it was i know im making a fool of myselfwhatever it was it baffled me i cant give an inkling of what i saw in that brutes eyes it wasnt light it wasnt color it was something that moved away back when the eyes themselves werent moving and i guess i didnt see it move either i only sensed that it moved it was an expressionthats what it wasand i got an impression of it no it was different from a mere expression it was more than that i dont know what it was but it gave me a feeling of kinship just the same oh no not sentimental kinship it was rather a kinship of equality those eyes never pleaded like a deers eyes they challenged no it wasnt defiance it was just a calm assumption of equality and i dont think it was deliberate my belief is that it was unconscious on his part it was there because it was there and it couldnt help shining out no i dont mean shine it didnt shine it moved i know im talking rot but if youd looked into that animals eyes the way i have youd understand steve was affected the same way i was why i tried to kill that spot oncehe was no good for anything and i fell down on it i led him out into the brush and he came along slow and unwilling he knew what was going on i stopped in a likely place put my foot on the rope and pulled my big colts and that dog sat down and looked at me i tell you he didnt plead he just looked and i saw all kinds of incomprehensible things moving yes moving in those eyes of his i didnt really see them move i thought i saw them for as i said before i guess i only sensed them and i want to tell you right now that it got beyond me it was like killing a man a conscious brave man who looked calmly into your gun as much as to say whos afraid then too the message seemed so near that instead of pulling the trigger quick i stopped to see if i could catch the message there it was right before me glimmering all around in those eyes of his and then it was too late i got scared i was trembly all over and my stomach generated a nervous palpitation that made me seasick i just sat down and looked at that dog and he looked at me till i thought i was going crazy do you want to know what i did i threw down the gun and ran back to camp with the fear of god in my heart steve laughed at me but i notice that steve led spot into the woods a week later for the same purpose and that steve came back alone and a little later spot drifted back too  at any rate spot wouldnt work we paid a hundred and ten dollars for him from the bottom of our sack and he wouldnt work he wouldnt even tighten the traces steve spoke to him the first time we put him in harness and he sort of shivered that was all not an ounce on the traces he just stood still and wobbled like so much jelly steve touched him with the whip he yelped but not an ounce steve touched him again a bit harder and he howledthe regular long wolf howl then steve got mad and gave him half a dozen and i came on the run from the tent i told steve he was brutal with the animal and we had some wordsthe first wed ever had he threw the whip down in the snow and walked away mad i picked it up and went to it that spot trembled and wobbled and cowered before ever i swung the lash and with the first bite of it he howled like a lost soul next he lay down in the snow i started the rest of the dogs and they dragged him along while i threw the whip into him he rolled over on his back and bumped along his four legs waving in the air himself howling as though he was going through a sausage machine steve came back and laughed at me and i apologized for what id said  there was no getting any work out of that spot and to make up for it he was the biggest pigglutton of a dog i ever saw on top of that he was the cleverest thief there was no circumventing him many a breakfast we went without our bacon because spot had been there first and it was because of him that we nearly starved to death up the stewart he figured out the way to break into our meatcache and what he didnt eat the rest of the team did but he was impartial he stole from every body he was a restless dog always very busy snooping around or going somewhere and there was never a camp within five miles that he didnt raid the worst of it was that they always came back on us to pay his board bill which was just being the law of the land but it was mighty hard on us especially that first winter on the chilcoot when we were busted paying for whole hams and sides of bacon that we never ate he could fight too that spot he could do anything but work he never pulled a pound but he was the boss of the whole team the way he made those dogs stand around was an education he bullied them and there was always one or more of them freshmarked with his fangs but he was more than a bully he wasnt afraid of anything that walked on four legs and ive seen him march singlehanded into a strange team without any provocation whatever and put the kibosh on the whole outfit did i say he could eat i caught him eating the whip once thats straight he started in at the lash and when i caught him he was down to the handle and still going  but he was a good looker at the end of the first week we sold him for seventyfive dollars to the mounted police they had experienced dogdrivers and we knew that by the time hed covered the six hundred miles to dawson hed be a good sleddog i say we knew for we were just getting acquainted with that spot a little later we were not brash enough to know anything where he was concerned a week later we woke up in the morning to the dangdest dogfight wed ever heard it was that spot came back and knocking the team into shape we ate a pretty depressing breakfast i can tell you but cheered up two hours afterward when we sold him to an official courier bound in to dawson with government despatches that spot was only three days in coming back and as usual celebrated his arrival with a roughhouse  we spent the winter and spring after our own outfit was across the pass freighting other peoples outfits and we made a fat stake also we made money out of spot if we sold him once we sold him twenty times he always came back and no one asked for their money we didnt want the money wed have paid handsomely for any one to take him off our hands for keeps we had to get rid of him and we couldnt give him away for that would have been suspicious but he was such a fine looker that we never had any difficulty in selling him unbroke wed say and theyd pay any old price for him we sold him as low as twentyfive dollars and once we got a hundred and fifty for him that particular party returned him in person refused to take his money back and the way he abused us was something awful he said it was cheap at the price to tell us what he thought of us and we felt he was so justified that we never talked back but to this day ive never quite regained all the old selfrespect that was mine before that man talked to me  when the ice cleared out of the lakes and river we put our outfit in a lake bennett boat and started for dawson we had a good team of dogs and of course we piled them on top the outfit that spot was alongthere was no losing him and a dozen times the first day he knocked one or another of the dogs overboard in the course of fighting with them it was close quarters and he didnt like being crowded  what that dog needs is space steve said the second day lets maroon him  we did running the boat in at caribou crossing for him to jump ashore two of the other dogs good dogs followed him and we lost two whole days trying to find them we never saw those two dogs again but the quietness and relief we enjoyed made us decide like the man who refused his hundred and fifty that it was cheap at the price for the first time in months steve and i laughed and whistled and sang we were as happy as clams the dark days were over the nightmare had been lifted that spot was gone  three weeks later one morning steve and i were standing on the riverbank at dawson a small boat was just arriving from lake bennett i saw steve give a start and heard him say something that was not nice and that was not under his breath then i looked and there in the bow of the boat with ears pricked up sat spot steve and i sneaked immediately like beaten curs like cowards like absconders from justice it was this last that the lieutenant of police thought when he saw us sneaking he surmised that there was lawofficers in the boat who were after us he didnt wait to find out but kept us in sight and in the m  m saloon got us in a corner we had a merry time explaining for we refused to go back to the boat and meet spot and finally he held us under guard of another policeman while he went to the boat after we got clear of him we started for the cabin and when we arrived there was that spot sitting on the stoop waiting for us now how did he know we lived there there were forty thousand people in dawson that summer and how did he savve our cabin out of all the cabins how did he know we were in dawson anyway i leave it to you but dont forget what i have said about his intelligence and that immortal something i have seen glimmering in his eyes  there was no getting rid of him any more there were too many people in dawson who had bought him up on chilcoot and the story got around half a dozen times we put him on board steamboats going down the yukon but he merely went ashore at the first landing and trotted back up the bank we couldnt sell him we couldnt kill him both steve and i had tried and nobody else was able to kill him he bore a charmed life ive seen him go down in a dogfight on the main street with fifty dogs on top of him and when they were separated hed appear on all his four legs unharmed while two of the dogs that had been on top of him would be lying dead  i saw him steal a chunk of moose meat from major dinwiddies cache so heavy that he could just keep one jump ahead of mrs dinwiddies squaw cook who was after him with an axe as he went up the hill after the squaw gave up major dinwiddie himself came out and pumped his winchester into the landscape he emptied his magazine twice and never touched that spot then a policeman came along and arrested him for discharging firearms inside the city limits major dinwiddie paid his fine and steve and i paid him for the moose meat at the rate of a dollar a pound bones and all that was what he paid for it meat was high that year  i am only telling what i saw with my own eyes and now ill tell you something also i saw that spot fall through a waterhole the ice was three and a half feet thick and the current sucked him under like a straw three hundred yards below was the big waterhole used by the hospital spot crawled out of the hospital waterhole licked off the water bit out the ice that had formed between his toes trotted up the bank and whipped a big newfoundland belonging to the gold commissioner  in the fall of 1898 steve and i poled up the yukon on the last water bound for stewart river we took the dogs along all except spot we figured wed been feeding him long enough hed cost us more time and trouble and money and grub than wed got by selling him on the chilcootespecially grub so steve and i tied him down in the cabin and pulled our freight we camped that night at the mouth of indian river and steve and i were pretty facetious over having shaken him steve was a funny fellow and i was just sitting up in the blankets and laughing when a tornado hit camp the way that spot walked into those dogs and gave them whatfor was hairraising now how did he get loose its up to you i havent any theory and how did he get across the klondike river thats another facer and anyway how did he know we had gone up the yukon you see we went by water and he couldnt smell our tracks steve and i began to get superstitious about that dog he got on our nerves too and between you and me we were just a mite afraid of him  the freezeup came on when we were at the mouth of henderson creek and we traded him off for two sacks of flour to an outfit that was bound up white river after copper now that whole outfit was lost never trace nor hide nor hair of men dogs sleds or anything was ever found they dropped clean out of sight it became one of the mysteries of the country steve and i plugged away up the stewart and six weeks afterward that spot crawled into camp he was a perambulating skeleton and could just drag along but he got there and what i want to know is who told him we were up the stewart we could have gone a thousand other places how did he know you tell me and ill tell you  no losing him at the mayo he started a row with an indian dog the buck who owned the dog took a swing at spot with an axe missed him and killed his own dog talk about magic and turning bullets asidei for one consider it a blamed sight harder to turn an axe aside with a big buck at the other end of it and i saw him do it with my own eyes that buck didnt want to kill his own dog youve got to show me  i told you about spot breaking into our meatcache it was nearly the death of us there wasnt any more meat to be killed and meat was all we had to live on the moose had gone back several hundred miles and the indians with them there we were spring was on and we had to wait for the river to break we got pretty thin before we decided to eat the dogs and we decided to eat spot first do you know what that dog did he sneaked now how did he know our minds were made up to eat him we sat up nights laying for him but he never came back and we ate the other dogs we ate the whole team  and now for the sequel you know what it is when a big river breaks up and a few billion tons of ice go out jamming and milling and grinding just in the thick of it when the stewart went out rumbling and roaring we sighted spot out in the middle hed got caught as he was trying to cross up above somewhere steve and i yelled and shouted and ran up and down the bank tossing our hats in the air sometimes wed stop and hug each other we were that boisterous for we saw spots finish he didnt have a chance in a million he didnt have any chance at all after the icerun we got into a canoe and paddled down to the yukon and down the yukon to dawson stopping to feed up for a week at the cabins at the mouth of henderson creek and as we came in to the bank at dawson there sat that spot waiting for us his ears pricked up his tail wagging his mouth smiling extending a hearty welcome to us now how did he get out of that ice how did he know we were coming to dawson to the very hour and minute to be out there on the bank waiting for us  the more i think of that spot the more i am convinced that there are things in this world that go beyond science on no scientific grounds can that spot be explained its psychic phenomena or mysticism or something of that sort i guess with a lot of theosophy thrown in the klondike is a good country i might have been there yet and become a millionaire if it hadnt been for spot he got on my nerves i stood him for two years all together and then i guess my stamina broke it was the summer of 1899 when i pulled out i didnt say anything to steve i just sneaked but i fixed it up all right i wrote steve a note and enclosed a package of roughonrats telling him what to do with it i was worn down to skin and bone by that spot and i was that nervous that id jump and look around when there wasnt anybody within hailing distance but it was astonishing the way i recuperated when i got quit of him i got back twenty pounds before i arrived in san francisco and by the time id crossed the ferry to oakland i was my old self again so that even my wife looked in vain for any change in me  steve wrote to me once and his letter seemed irritated he took it kind of hard because id left him with spot also he said hed used the roughonrats per directions and that there was nothing doing a year went by i was back in the office and prospering in all wayseven getting a bit fat and then steve arrived he didnt look me up i read his name in the steamer list and wondered why but i didnt wonder long i got up one morning and found that spot chained to the gatepost and holding up the milkman steve went north to seattle i learned that very morning i didnt put on any more weight my wife made me buy him a collar and tag and within an hour he showed his gratitude by killing her pet persian cat there is no getting rid of that spot he will be with me until i die for hell never die my appetite is not so good since he arrived and my wife says i am looking peaked last night that spot got into mr harveys henhouse harvey is my next door neighbor and killed nineteen of his fancybred chickens i shall have to pay for them my neighbors on the other side quarreled with my wife and then moved out spot was the cause of it and that is why i am disappointed in stephen mackaye i had no idea he was so mean a man  illustration     trust   all lines had been cast off and the seattle no 4 was pulling slowly out from the shore her decks were piled high with freight and baggage and swarmed with a heterogeneous company of indians dogs and dogmushers prospectors traders and homewardbound goldseekers a goodly portion of dawson was lined up on the bank saying goodby as the gangplank came in and the steamer nosed into the stream the clamor of farewell became deafening also in that eleventh moment everybody began to remember final farewell messages and to shout them back and forth across the widening stretch of water louis bondell curling his yellow mustache with one hand and languidly waving the other hand to his friends on shore suddenly remembered something and sprang to the rail  oh fred he bawled oh fred  the fred desired thrust a strapping pair of shoulders through the forefront of the crowd on the bank and tried to catch louis bondells message the latter grew red in the face with vain vociferation still the water widened between steamboat and shore  hey you captain scott he yelled at the pilothouse stop the boat  the gongs clanged and the big stern wheel reversed then stopped all hands on steamboat and on bank took advantage of this respite to exchange final new and imperative farewells more futile than ever was louis bondells effort to make himself heard the seattle no 4 lost way and drifted downstream and captain scott had to go ahead and reverse a second time his head disappeared inside the pilothouse coming into view a moment later behind a big megaphone  now captain scott had a remarkable voice and the shut up he launched at the crowd on deck and on shore could have been heard at the top of moosehide mountain and as far as klondike city this official remonstrance from the pilothouse spread a film of silence over the tumult  now what do you want to say captain scott demanded  tell fred churchillhes on the bank theretell him to go to macdonald its in his safea small gripsack of mine tell him to get it and bring it out when he comes  in the silence captain scott bellowed the message ashore through the megaphone  you fred churchill go to macdonaldin his safesmall gripsackbelongs to louis bondellimportant bring it out when you come got it  churchill waved his hand in token that he had got it in truth had macdonald half a mile away opened his window hed have got it too the tumult of farewell rose again the gongs clanged and the seattle no 4 went ahead swung out into the stream turned on her heel and headed down the yukon bondell and churchill waving farewell and mutual affection to the last  that was in midsummer in the fall of the year the wh willis started up the yukon with two hundred homewardbound pilgrims on board among them was churchill in his stateroom in the middle of a clothesbag was louis bondells grip it was a small stout leather affair and its weight of forty pounds always made churchill nervous when he wandered too far from it the man in the adjoining stateroom had a treasure of golddust hidden similarly in a clothesbag and the pair of them ultimately arranged to stand watch and watch while one went down to eat the other kept an eye on the two stateroom doors when churchill wanted to take a hand at whist the other man mounted guard and when the other man wanted to relax his soul churchill read fourmonthsold newspapers on a camp stool between the two doors  there were signs of an early winter and the question that was discussed from dawn till dark and far into the dark was whether they would get out before the freezeup or be compelled to abandon the steamboat and tramp out over the ice there were irritating delays twice the engines broke down and had to be tinkered up and each time there were snow flurries to warn them of the imminence of winter nine times the wh willis essayed to ascend the fivefinger rapids with her impaired machinery and when she succeeded she was four days behind her very liberal schedule the question that then arose was whether or not the steamboat flora would wait for her above the box cañon the stretch of water between the head of the box cañon and the foot of the white horse rapids was unnavigable for steamboats and passengers were transshipped at that point walking around the rapids from one steamboat to the other there were no telephones in the country hence no way of informing the waiting flora that the willis was four days late but coming  when the wh willis pulled into white horse it was learned that the flora had waited three days over the limit and had departed only a few hours before also it was learned that she would tie up at tagish post till nine oclock sunday morning it was then four oclock saturday afternoon the pilgrims called a meeting on board was a large peterborough canoe consigned to the police post at the head of lake bennett they agreed to be responsible for it and to deliver it next they called for volunteers two men were needed to make a race for the flora a score of men volunteered on the instant among them was churchill such being his nature that he volunteered before he thought of bondells gripsack when this thought came to him he began to hope that he would not be selected but a man who had made a name as captain of a college football eleven as a president of an athletic club as a dogmusher and a stampeder in the yukon and moreover who possessed such shoulders as he had no right to avoid the honor it was thrust upon him and upon a gigantic german nick antonsen  while a crowd of the pilgrims the canoe on their shoulders started on a trot over the portage churchill ran to his stateroom he turned the contents of the clothesbag on the floor and caught up the grip with the intention of intrusting it to the man next door then the thought smote him that it was not his grip and that he had no right to let it out of his own possession so he dashed ashore with it and ran up the portage changing it often from one hand to the other and wondering if it really did not weigh more than forty pounds  it was halfpast four in the afternoon when the two men started the current of the thirty mile river was so strong that rarely could they use the paddles it was out on one bank with a towline over the shoulders stumbling over the rocks forcing a way through the underbrush slipping at times and falling into the water wading often up to the knees and waist and then when an insurmountable bluff was encountered it was into the canoe out paddles and a wild and losing dash across the current to the other bank in paddles over the side and out towline again it was exhausting work antonsen toiled like the giant he was uncomplaining persistent but driven to his utmost by the powerful body and indomitable brain of churchill they never paused for rest it was go go and keep on going a crisp wind blew down the river freezing their hands and making it imperative from time to time to beat the blood back into the numb fingers as night came on they were compelled to trust to luck they fell repeatedly on the untraveled banks and tore their clothing to shreds in the underbrush they could not see both men were badly scratched and bleeding a dozen times in their wild dashes from bank to bank they struck snags and were capsized the first time this happened churchill dived and groped in three feet of water for the gripsack he lost half an hour in recovering it and after that it was carried securely lashed to the canoe as long as the canoe floated it was safe antonsen jeered at the grip and toward morning began to abuse it but churchill vouchsafed no explanations  their delays and mischances were endless on one swift bend around which poured a healthy young rapid they lost two hours making a score of attempts and capsizing twice at this point on both banks were precipitous bluffs rising out of deep water and along which they could neither tow nor pole while they could not gain with the paddles against the current at each attempt they strained to the utmost with the paddles and each time with hearts nigh to bursting from the effort they were played out and swept back they succeeded finally by an accident in the swiftest current near the end of another failure a freak of the current sheered the canoe out of churchills control and flung it against the bluff churchill made a blind leap at the bluff and landed in a crevice holding on with one hand he held the swamped canoe with the other till antonsen dragged himself out of the water then they pulled the canoe out and rested a fresh start at this crucial point took them by they landed on the bank above and plunged immediately ashore and into the brush with the towline  daylight found them far below tagish post at nine o clock sunday morning they could hear the flora whistling her departure and when at ten oclock they dragged themselves in to the post they could just barely see the floras smoke far to the southward it was a pair of wornout tatterdemalions that captain jones of the mounted police welcomed and fed and he afterward averred that they possessed two of the most tremendous appetites he had ever observed they lay down and slept in their wet rags by the stove at the end of two hours churchill got up carried bondells grip which he had used for a pillow down to the canoe kicked antonsen awake and started in pursuit of the flora  theres no telling what might happenmachinery break down or something was his reply to captain joness expostulations im going to catch that steamer and send her back for the boys  tagish lake was white with a fall gale that blew in their teeth big swinging seas rushed upon the canoe compelling one man to bail and leaving one man to paddle headway could not be made they ran along the shallow shore and went overboard one man ahead on the towline the other shoving on the canoe they fought the gale up to their waists in the icy water often up to their necks often over their heads and buried by the big crested waves there was no rest never a moments pause from the cheerless heartbreaking battle that night at the head of tagish lake in the thick of a driving snowsquall they overhauled the flora antonsen you go back to white horse and snored transcribers note the above is evidently a printers error churchill looked like a wild man his clothes barely clung to him his face was iced up and swollen from the protracted effort of twentyfour hours while his hands were so swollen that he could not close the fingers as for his feet it was an agony to stand upon them  the captain of the flora was loath to go back to white horse churchill was persistent and imperative the captain was stubborn he pointed out finally that nothing was to be gained by going back because the only ocean steamer at dyea the athenian was to sail on tuesday morning and that he could not make the back trip to white horse and bring up the stranded pilgrims in time to make the connection  what time does the athenian sail churchill demanded  seven oclock tuesday morning  all right churchill said at the same time kicking a tattoo on the ribs of the snoring antonsen you go back to white horse well go ahead and hold the athenian  antonsen stupid with sleep not yet clothed in his waking mind was bundled into the canoe and did not realize what had happened till he was drenched with the icy spray of a big sea and heard churchill snarling at him through the darkness  paddle cant you do you want to be swamped  daylight found them at caribou crossing the wind dying down and antonsen too far gone to dip a paddle churchill grounded the canoe on a quiet beach where they slept he took the precaution of twisting his arm under the weight of his head every few minutes the pain of the pent circulation aroused him whereupon he would look at his watch and twist the other arm under his head at the end of two hours he fought with antonsen to rouse him then they started lake bennett thirty miles in length was like a millpond but halfway across a gale from the south smote them and turned the water white hour after hour they repeated the struggle on tagish over the side pulling and shoving on the canoe up to their waists and necks and over their heads in the icy water toward the last the goodnatured giant played completely out churchill drove him mercilessly but when he pitched forward and bade fair to drown in three feet of water the other dragged him into the canoe after that churchill fought on alone arriving at the police post at the head of bennett in the early afternoon he tried to help antonsen out of the canoe but failed he listened to the exhausted mans heavy breathing and envied him when he thought of what he himself had yet to undergo antonsen could lie there and sleep but he behind time must go on over mighty chilcoot and down to the sea the real struggle lay before him and he almost regretted the strength that resided in his frame because of the torment it could inflict upon that frame  churchill pulled the canoe up on the beach seized bondells grip and started on a limping dogtrot for the police post  theres a canoe down there consigned to you from dawson he hurled at the officer who answered his knock and theres a man in it pretty near dead nothing serious only played out take care of him ive got to rush goodby want to catch the athenian  a mile portage connected lake bennett and lake linderman and his last words he flung back after him as he resumed the trot it was a very painful trot but he clenched his teeth and kept on forgetting his pain most of the time in the fervent heat with which he regarded the gripsack it was a severe handicap he swung it from one hand to the other and back again he tucked it under his arm he threw one hand over the opposite shoulder and the bag bumped and pounded on his back as he ran along he could scarcely hold it in his bruised and swollen fingers and several times he dropped it once in changing from one hand to the other it escaped his clutch and fell in front of him tripped him up and threw him violently to the ground  at the far end of the portage he bought an old set of packstraps for a dollar and in them he swung the grip also he chartered a launch to run him the six miles to the upper end of lake linderman where he arrived at four in the afternoon the athenian was to sail from dyea next morning at seven dyea was twentyeight miles away and between towered chilcoot he sat down to adjust his footgear for the long climb and woke up he had dozed the instant he sat down though he had not slept thirty seconds he was afraid his next doze might be longer so he finished fixing his footgear standing up even then he was overpowered for a fleeting moment he experienced the flash of unconsciousness becoming aware of it in midair as his relaxed body was sinking to the ground and as he caught himself together he stiffened his muscles with a spasmodic wrench and escaped the fall the sudden jerk back to consciousness left him sick and trembling he beat his head with the heel of his hand knocking wakefulness into the numb brain  jack burnss packtrain was starting back light for crater lake and churchill was invited to a mule burns wanted to put the gripsack on another animal but churchill held on to it carrying it on his saddlepommel but he dozed and the grip persisted in dropping off the pommel one side or the other each time wakening him with a sickening start then in the early darkness churchills mule brushed him against a projecting branch that laid his cheek open to cap it the mule blundered off the trail and fell throwing rider and gripsack out upon the rocks after that churchill walked or stumbled rather over the apology for a trail leading the mule stray and awful odors drifting from each side the trail told of the horses that had died in the rush for gold but he did not mind he was too sleepy by the time long lake was reached however he had recovered from his sleepiness and at deep lake he resigned the gripsack to burns but thereafter by the light of the dim stars he kept his eyes on burns there were not going to be any accidents with that bag  at crater lake the packtrain went into camp and churchill slinging the grip on his back started the steep climb for the summit for the first time on that precipitous wall he realized how tired he was he crept and crawled like a crab burdened by the weight of his limbs a distinct and painful effort of will was required each time he lifted a foot an hallucination came to him that he was shod with lead like a deepsea diver and it was all he could do to resist the desire to reach down and feel the lead as for bondells gripsack it was inconceivable that forty pounds could weigh so much it pressed him down like a mountain and he looked back with unbelief to the year before when he had climbed that same pass with a hundred and fifty pounds on his back if those loads had weighed a hundred and fifty pounds then bondells grip weighed five hundred  the first rise of the divide from crater lake was across a small glacier here was a welldefined trail but above the glacier which was also above timberline was naught but a chaos of naked rock and enormous boulders there was no way of seeing the trail in the darkness and he blundered on paying thrice the ordinary exertion for all that he accomplished he won the summit in the thick of howling wind and driving snow providentially stumbling upon a small deserted tent into which he crawled there he found and bolted some ancient fried potatoes and half a dozen raw eggs  when the snow ceased and the wind eased down he began the almost impossible descent there was no trail and he stumbled and blundered often finding himself at the last moment on the edge of rocky walls and steep slopes the depth of which he had no way of judging part way down the stars clouded over again and in the consequent obscurity he slipped and rolled and slid for a hundred feet landing bruised and bleeding on the bottom of a large shallow hole from all about him arose the stench of dead horses the hole was handy to the trail and the packers had made a practice of tumbling into it their broken and dying animals the stench overpowered him making him deathly sick and as in a nightmare he scrambled out halfway up he recollected bondells gripsack it had fallen into the hole with him the packstrap had evidently broken and he had forgotten it back he went into the pestilential charnelpit where he crawled around on hands and knees and groped for half an hour altogether he encountered and counted seventeen dead horses and one horse still alive that he shot with his revolver before he found bondells grip looking back upon a life that had not been without valor and achievement he unhesitatingly declared to himself that this return after the grip was the most heroic act he had ever performed so heroic was it that he was twice on the verge of fainting before he crawled out of the hole  by the time he had descended to the scales the steep pitch of chilcoot was past and the way became easier not that it was an easy way however in the best of places but it became a really possible trail along which he could have made good time if he had not been worn out if he had had light with which to pick his steps and if it had not been for bondells gripsack to him in his exhausted condition it was the last straw having barely strength to carry himself along the additional weight of the grip was sufficient to throw him nearly every time he tripped or stumbled and when he escaped tripping branches reached out in the darkness hooked the grip between his shoulders and held him back  his mind was made up that if he missed the athenian it would be the fault of the gripsack in fact only two things remained in his consciousnessbondells grip and the steamer he knew only those two things and they became identified in a way with some stern mission upon which he had journeyed and toiled for centuries he walked and struggled on as in a dream a part of the dream was his arrival at sheep camp he stumbled into a saloon slid his shoulders out of the straps and started to deposit the grip at his feet but it slipped from his fingers and struck the floor with a heavy thud that was not unnoticed by two men who were just leaving churchill drank a glass of whiskey told the barkeeper to call him in ten minutes and sat down his feet on the grip his head on his knees  so badly did his misused body stiffen that when he was called it required another ten minutes and a second glass of whiskey to unbend his joints and limber up the muscles  hey not that way the barkeeper shouted and then went after him and started him through the darkness toward canyon city some little husk of inner consciousness told churchill that the direction was right and still as in a dream he took the canyon trail he did not know what warned him but after what seemed several centuries of travelling he sensed danger and drew his revolver still in the dream he saw two men step out and heard them halt him his revolver went off four times and he saw the flashes and heard the explosions of their revolvers also he was aware that he had been hit in the thigh he saw one man go down and as the other came for him he smashed him a straight blow with the heavy revolver full in the face then he turned and ran he came from the dream shortly afterward to find himself plunging down the trail at a limping lope his first thought was for the gripsack it was still on his back he was convinced that what had happened was a dream till he felt for his revolver and found it gone next he became aware of a sharp stinging of his thigh and after investigating he found his hand warm with blood it was a superficial wound but it was incontestable he became wider awake and kept up the lumbering run to canyon city  he found a man with a team of horses and a wagon who got out of bed and harnessed up for twenty dollars churchill crawled in on the wagonbed and slept the gripsack still on his back it was a rough ride over waterwashed boulders down the dyea valley but he roused only when the wagon hit the highest places any altitude of his body above the wagonbed of less than a foot did not faze him the last mile was smooth going and he slept soundly  he came to in the gray dawn the driver shaking him savagely and howling into his ear that the athenian was gone churchill looked blankly at the deserted harbor  theres a smoke over at skaguay the man said  churchills eyes were too swollen to see that far but he said its she get me a boat  the driver was obliging and found a skiff and a man to row it for ten dollars payment in advance churchill paid and was helped into the skiff it was beyond him to get in by himself it was six miles to skaguay and he had a blissful thought of sleeping those six miles but the man did not know how to row and churchill took the oars and toiled for a few more centuries he never knew six longer and more excruciating miles a snappy little breeze blew up the inlet and held him back he had a gone feeling at the pit of the stomach and suffered from faintness and numbness at his command the man took the bailer and threw salt water into his face  the athenians anchor was upanddown when they came alongside and churchill was at the end of his last remnant of strength  stop her stop her he shouted hoarsely important message stop her  then he dropped his chin on his chest and slept when half a dozen men started to carry him up the gangplank he awoke reached for the grip and clung to it like a drowning man on deck he became a center of horror and curiosity the clothing in which he had left white horse was represented by a few rags and he was as frayed as his clothing he had traveled for fiftyfive hours at the top notch of endurance he had slept six hours in that time and he was twenty pounds lighter than when he started face and hands and body were scratched and bruised and he could scarcely see he tried to stand up but failed sprawling out on the deck hanging on to the gripsack and delivering his message  now put me to bed he finished ill eat when i wake up  they did him honor carrying him down in his rags and dirt and depositing him and bondells grip in the bridal chamber which was the biggest and most luxurious stateroom in the ship twice he slept the clock around and he had bathed and shaved and eaten and was leaning over the rail smoking a cigar when the two hundred pilgrims from white horse came alongside  by the time the athenian arrived in seattle churchill had fully recuperated and he went ashore with bondells grip in his hand he felt proud of that grip to him it stood for achievement and integrity and trust ive delivered the goods was the way he expressed these various high terms to himself it was early in the evening and he went straight to bondells home louis bondell was glad to see him shaking hands with both hands at the same time and dragging him into the house  oh thanks old man it was good of you to bring it out bondell said when he received the gripsack  he tossed it carelessly upon a couch and churchill noted with an appreciative eye the rebound of its weight from the springs bondell was volleying him with questions  how did you make out howre the boys what became of bill smithers is del bishop still with pierce did he sell my dogs how did sulphur bottom show up youre looking fine what steamer did you come out on  to all of which churchill gave answer till half an hour had gone by and the first lull in the conversation had arrived  hadnt you better take a look at it he suggested nodding his head at the gripsack  oh its all right bondell answered did mitchells dump turn out as much as he expected  i think youd better look at it churchill insisted when i deliver a thing i want to be satisfied that its all right theres always the chance that somebody might have got into it when i was asleep or something  its nothing important old man bondell answered with a laugh  nothing important churchill echoed in a faint small voice then he spoke with decision louis whats in that bag i want to know  louis looked at him curiously then left the room and returned with a bunch of keys he inserted his hand and drew out a heavy 44 colts revolver next came out a few boxes of ammunition for the revolver and several boxes of winchester cartridges  churchill took the gripsack and looked into it then he turned it upside down and shook it gently  the guns all rusted bondell said must have been out in the rain  yes churchill answered too bad it got wet i guess i was a bit careless  he got up and went outside ten minutes later louis bondell went out and found him on the steps sitting down elbows on knees and chin on hands gazing steadfastly out into the darkness  illustration     all gold canyon   it was the green heart of the canyon where the walls swerved back from the rigid plan and relieved their harshness of line by making a little sheltered nook and filling it to the brim with sweetness and roundness and softness here all things rested even the narrow stream ceased its turbulent downrush long enough to form a quiet pool kneedeep in the water with drooping head and halfshut eyes drowsed a redcoated manyantlered buck  on one side beginning at the very lip of the pool was a tiny meadow a cool resilient surface of green that extended to the base of the frowning wall beyond the pool a gentle slope of earth ran up and up to meet the opposing wall fine grass covered the slopegrass that was spangled with flowers with here and there patches of color orange and purple and golden below the canyon was shut in there was no view the walls leaned together abruptly and the canyon ended in a chaos of rocks mosscovered and hidden by a green screen of vines and creepers and boughs of trees up the canyon rose far hills and peaks the big foothills pinecovered and remote and far beyond like clouds upon the border of the sky towered minarets of white where the sierras eternal snows flashed austerely the blazes of the sun  there was no dust in the canyon the leaves and flowers were clean and virginal the grass was young velvet over the pool three cottonwoods sent their snowy fluffs fluttering down the quiet air on the slope the blossoms of the winewooded manzanita filled the air with springtime odors while the leaves wise with experience were already beginning their vertical twist against the coming aridity of summer in the open spaces on the slope beyond the farthest shadowreach of the manzanita poised the mariposa lilies like so many flights of jewelled moths suddenly arrested and on the verge of trembling into flight again here and there that woods harlequin the madrone permitting itself to be caught in the act of changing its peagreen trunk to madderred breathed its fragrance into the air from great clusters of waxen bells creamy white were these bells shaped like liliesofthevalley with the sweetness of perfume that is of the springtime  there was not a sigh of wind the air was drowsy with its weight of perfume it was a sweetness that would have been cloying had the air been heavy and humid but the air was sharp and thin it was as starlight transmuted into atmosphere shot through and warmed by sunshine and flowerdrenched with sweetness  an occasional butterfly drifted in and out through the patches of light and shade and from all about rose the low and sleepy hum of mountain beesfeasting sybarites that jostled one another goodnaturedly at the board nor found time for rough discourtesy so quietly did the little stream drip and ripple its way through the canyon that it spoke only in faint and occasional gurgles the voice of the stream was as a drowsy whisper ever interrupted by dozings and silences ever lifted again in the awakenings  the motion of all things was a drifting in the heart of the canyon sunshine and butterflies drifted in and out among the trees the hum of the bees and the whisper of the stream were a drifting of sound and the drifting sound and drifting color seemed to weave together in the making of a delicate and intangible fabric which was the spirit of the place it was a spirit of peace that was not of death but of smoothpulsing life of quietude that was not silence of movement that was not action of repose that was quick with existence without being violent with struggle and travail the spirit of the place was the spirit of the peace of the living somnolent with the easement and content of prosperity and undisturbed by rumors of far wars  the redcoated manyantlered buck acknowledged the lordship of the spirit of the place and dozed kneedeep in the cool shaded pool there seemed no flies to vex him and he was languid with rest sometimes his ears moved when the stream awoke and whispered but they moved lazily with foreknowledge that it was merely the stream grown garrulous at discovery that it had slept  but there came a time when the bucks ears lifted and tensed with swift eagerness for sound his head was turned down the canyon his sensitive quivering nostrils scented the air his eyes could not pierce the green screen through which the stream rippled away but to his ears came the voice of a man it was a steady monotonous singsong voice once the buck heard the harsh clash of metal upon rock at the sound he snorted with a sudden start that jerked him through the air from water to meadow and his feet sank into the young velvet while he pricked his ears and again scented the air then he stole across the tiny meadow pausing once and again to listen and faded away out of the canyon like a wraith softfooted and without sound  the clash of steelshod soles against the rocks began to be heard and the mans voice grew louder it was raised in a sort of chant and became distinct with nearness so that the words could be heard     tun around an tun yo face    untoe them sweet hills of grace      d powrs of sin yo am scornin    look about an look aroun    fling yo sinpack on d groun      yo will meet wid d lord in d mornin  a sound of scrambling accompanied the song and the spirit of the place fled away on the heels of the redcoated buck the green screen was burst asunder and a man peered out at the meadow and the pool and the sloping sidehill he was a deliberate sort of man he took in the scene with one embracing glance then ran his eyes over the details to verify the general impression then and not until then did he open his mouth in vivid and solemn approval  smoke of life an snakes of purgatory will you just look at that wood an water an grass an a sidehill a pockethunters delight an a cayuses paradise cool green for tired eyes pink pills for pale people aint in it a secret pasture for prospectors and a restingplace for tired burros its just booful  he was a sandycomplexioned man in whose face geniality and humor seemed the salient characteristics it was a mobile face quickchanging to inward mood and thought thinking was in him a visible process ideas chased across his face like windflaws across the surface of a lake his hair sparse and unkempt of growth was as indeterminate and colorless as his complexion it would seem that all the color of his frame had gone into his eyes for they were startlingly blue also they were laughing and merry eyes within them much of the naiveté and wonder of the child and yet in an unassertive way they contained much of calm selfreliance and strength of purpose founded upon selfexperience and experience of the world  from out the screen of vines and creepers he flung ahead of him a miners pick and shovel and goldpan then he crawled out himself into the open he was clad in faded overalls and black cotton shirt with hobnailed brogans on his feet and on his head a hat whose shapelessness and stains advertised the rough usage of wind and rain and sun and campsmoke he stood erect seeing wideeyed the secrecy of the scene and sensuously inhaling the warm sweet breath of the canyongarden through nostrils that dilated and quivered with delight his eyes narrowed to laughing slits of blue his face wreathed itself in joy and his mouth curled in a smile as he cried aloud  jumping dandelions and happy hollyhocks but that smells good to me talk about your attar o roses an cologne factories they aint in it  he had the habit of soliloquy his quickchanging facial expressions might tell every thought and mood but the tongue perforce ran hard after repeating like a second boswell  the man lay down on the lip of the pool and drank long and deep of its water tastes good to me he murmured lifting his head and gazing across the pool at the sidehill while he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand the sidehill attracted his attention still lying on his stomach he studied the hill formation long and carefully it was a practised eye that traveled up the slope to the crumbling canyonwall and back and down again to the edge of the pool he scrambled to his feet and favored the sidehill with a second survey  looks good to me he concluded picking up his pick and shovel and goldpan  he crossed the stream below the pool stepping agilely from stone to stone where the sidehill touched the water he dug up a shovelful of dirt and put it into the goldpan he squatted down holding the pan in his two hands and partly immersing it in the stream then he imparted to the pan a deft circular motion that sent the water sluicing in and out through the dirt and gravel the larger and the lighter particles worked to the surface and these by a skilful dipping movement of the pan he spilled out and over the edge occasionally to expedite matters he rested the pan and with his fingers raked out the large pebbles and pieces of rock  the contents of the pan diminished rapidly until only fine dirt and the smallest bits of gravel remained at this stage he began to work very deliberately and carefully it was fine washing and he washed fine and finer with a keen scrutiny and delicate and fastidious touch at last the pan seemed empty of everything but water but with a quick semicircular flirt that sent the water flying over the shallow rim into the stream he disclosed a layer of black sand on the bottom of the pan so thin was this layer that it was like a streak of paint he examined it closely in the midst of it was a tiny golden speck he dribbled a little water in over the depressed edge of the pan with a quick flirt he sent the water sluicing across the bottom turning the grains of black sand over and over a second tiny golden speck rewarded his effort  the washing had now become very finefine beyond all need of ordinary placermining he worked the black sand a small portion at a time up the shallow rim of the pan each small portion he examined sharply so that his eyes saw every grain of it before he allowed it to slide over the edge and away jealously bit by bit he let the black sand slip away a golden speck no larger than a pinpoint appeared on the rim and by his manipulation of the water it returned to the bottom of the pan and in such fashion another speck was disclosed and another great was his care of them like a shepherd he herded his flock of golden specks so that not one should be lost at last of the pan of dirt nothing remained but his golden herd he counted it and then after all his labor sent it flying out of the pan with one final swirl of water  but his blue eyes were shining with desire as he rose to his feet seven he muttered aloud asserting the sum of the specks for which he had toiled so hard and which he had so wantonly thrown away seven he repeated with the emphasis of one trying to impress a number on his memory  he stood still a long while surveying the hillside in his eyes was a curiosity newaroused and burning there was an exultance about his bearing and a keenness like that of a hunting animal catching the fresh scent of game  he moved down the stream a few steps and took a second panful of dirt  again came the careful washing the jealous herding of the golden specks and the wantonness with which he sent them flying into the stream  five he muttered and repeated five  he could not forbear another survey of the hill before filling the pan farther down the stream his golden herds diminished four three two two one were his memory tabulations as he moved down the stream when but one speck of gold rewarded his washing he stopped and built a fire of dry twigs into this he thrust the goldpan and burned it till it was blueblack he held up the pan and examined it critically then he nodded approbation against such a colorbackground he could defy the tiniest yellow speck to elude him  still moving down the stream he panned again a single speck was his reward a third pan contained no gold at all not satisfied with this he panned three times again taking his shovels of dirt within a foot of one another each pan proved empty of gold and the fact instead of discouraging him seemed to give him satisfaction his elation increased with each barren washing until he arose exclaiming jubilantly  if it aint the real thing may god knock off my head with sour apples  returning to where he had started operations he began to pan up the stream at first his golden herds increasedincreased prodigiously fourteen eighteen twentyone twentysix ran his memory tabulations just above the pool he struck his richest panthirtyfive colors  almost enough to save he remarked regretfully as he allowed the water to sweep them away  the sun climbed to the top of the sky the man worked on pan by pan he went up the stream the tally of results steadily decreasing  its just booful the way it peters out he exulted when a shovelful of dirt contained no more than a single speck of gold and when no specks at all were found in several pans he straightened up and favored the hillside with a confident glance  ah ha mr pocket he cried out as though to an auditor hidden somewhere above him beneath the surface of the slope ah ha mr pocket im acomin im acomin an im shorely gwine to get yer you heah me mr pocket im gwine to get yer as shore as punkins aint cauliflowers  he turned and flung a measuring glance at the sun poised above him in the azure of the cloudless sky then he went down the canyon following the line of shovelholes he had made in filling the pans he crossed the stream below the pool and disappeared through the green screen there was little opportunity for the spirit of the place to return with its quietude and repose for the mans voice raised in ragtime song still dominated the canyon with possession  after a time with a greater clashing of steelshod feet on rock he returned the green screen was tremendously agitated it surged back and forth in the throes of a struggle there was a loud grating and clanging of metal the mans voice leaped to a higher pitch and was sharp with imperativeness a large body plunged and panted there was a snapping and ripping and rending and amid a shower of falling leaves a horse burst through the screen on its back was a pack and from this trailed broken vines and torn creepers the animal gazed with astonished eyes at the scene into which it had been precipitated then dropped its head to the grass and began contentedly to graze a second horse scrambled into view slipping once on the mossy rocks and regaining equilibrium when its hoofs sank into the yielding surface of the meadow it was riderless though on its back was a highhorned mexican saddle scarred and discolored by long usage  the man brought up the rear he threw off pack and saddle with an eye to camp location and gave the animals their freedom to graze he unpacked his food and got out fryingpan and coffeepot he gathered an armful of dry wood and with a few stones made a place for his fire  my he said but ive got an appetite i could scoff ironfilings an horseshoe nails an thank you kindly maam for a second helpin  he straightened up and while he reached for matches in the pocket of his overalls his eyes traveled across the pool to the sidehill his fingers had clutched the matchbox but they relaxed their hold and the hand came out empty the man wavered perceptibly he looked at his preparations for cooking and he looked at the hill  guess ill take another whack at her he concluded starting to cross the stream  they aint no sense in it i know he mumbled apologetically but keepin grub back an hour aint go in to hurt none i reckon  a few feet back from his first line of testpans he started a second line the sun dropped down the western sky the shadows lengthened but the man worked on he began a third line of testpans he was crosscutting the hillside line by line as he ascended the center of each line produced the richest pans while the ends came where no colors showed in the pan and as he ascended the hillside the lines grew perceptibly shorter the regularity with which their length diminished served to indicate that somewhere up the slope the last line would be so short as to have scarcely length at all and that beyond could come only a point the design was growing into an inverted v the converging sides of this v marked the boundaries of the goldbearing dirt  the apex of the v was evidently the mans goal often he ran his eye along the converging sides and on up the hill trying to divine the apex the point where the goldbearing dirt must cease here resided mr pocketfor so the man familiarly addressed the imaginary point above him on the slope crying out  come down out o that mr pocket be right smart an agreeable an come down  all right he would add later in a voice resigned to determination all right mr pocket its plain to me i got to come right up an snatch you out baldheaded an ill do it ill do it he would threaten still later  each pan he carried down to the water to wash and as he went higher up the hill the pans grew richer until he began to save the gold in an empty baking powder can which he carried carelessly in his hippocket so engrossed was he in his toil that he did not notice the long twilight of oncoming night it was not until he tried vainly to see the gold colors in the bottom of the pan that he realized the passage of time he straightened up abruptly an expression of whimsical wonderment and awe overspread his face as he drawled  gosh darn my buttons if i didnt plumb forget dinner  he stumbled across the stream in the darkness and lighted his longdelayed fire flapjacks and bacon and warmedover beans constituted his supper then he smoked a pipe by the smouldering coals listening to the night noises and watching the moonlight stream through the canyon after that he unrolled his bed took off his heavy shoes and pulled the blankets up to his chin his face showed white in the moonlight like the face of a corpse but it was a corpse that knew its resurrection for the man rose suddenly on one elbow and gazed across at his hillside  good night mr pocket he called sleepily goodnight  he slept through the early gray of morning until the direct rays of the sun smote his closed eyelids when he awoke with a start and looked about him until he had established the continuity of his existence and identified his present self with the days previously lived  to dress he had merely to buckle on his shoes he glanced at his fireplace and at his hillside wavered but fought down the temptation and started the fire  keep yer shirt on bill keep yer shirt on he admonished himself whats the good of rushin no use in gettin all het up an sweaty mr pocketll wait for you he aint arunnin away before you can get your breakfast now what you want bill is something fresh in yer bill o fare so its up to you to go an get it  he cut a short pole at the waters edge and drew from one of his pockets a bit of line and a draggled fly that had once been a royal coachman  mebbe theyll bite in the early morning he muttered as he made his first cast into the pool and a moment later he was gleefully crying whatd i tell you eh whatd i tell you  he had no reel nor any inclination to waste time and by main strength and swiftly he drew out of the water a flashing teninch trout three more caught in rapid succession furnished his breakfast when he came to the steppingstones on his way to his hillside he was struck by a sudden thought and paused  id just better take a hike downstream a ways he said theres no tellin who may be snoopin around  but he crossed over on the stones and with a i really oughter take that hike the need of the precaution passed out of his mind and he fell to work  at nightfall he straightened up the small of his back was stiff from stooping toil and as he put his hand behind him to soothe the protesting muscles he said  now what dye think of that i clean forgot my dinner again if i dont watch out ill sure be degeneratin into a twomealaday crank  pockets is the hangedest things i ever see for makin a man absentminded he communed that night as he crawled into his blankets nor did he forget to call up the hillside good night mr pocket good night  rising with the sun and snatching a hasty breakfast he was early at work a fever seemed to be growing in him nor did the increasing richness of the testpans allay this fever there was a flush in his cheek other than that made by the heat of the sun and he was oblivious to fatigue and the passage of time when he filled a pan with dirt he ran down the hill to wash it nor could he forbear running up the hill again panting and stumbling profanely to refill the pan  he was now a hundred yards from the water and the inverted v was assuming definite proportions the width of the paydirt steadily decreased and the man extended in his minds eye the sides of the v to their meeting place far up the hill this was his goal the apex of the v and he panned many times to locate it  just about two yards above that manzanita bush an a yard to the right he finally concluded  then the temptation seized him as plain as the nose on your face he said as he abandoned his laborious crosscutting and climbed to the indicated apex he filled a pan and carried it down the hill to wash it contained no trace of gold he dug deep and he dug shallow filling and washing a dozen pans and was unrewarded even by the tiniest golden speck he was enraged at having yielded to the temptation and berated himself blasphemously and pridelessly then he went down the hill and took up the crosscutting  slow an certain bill slow an certain he crooned shortcuts to fortune aint in your line an its about time you know it get wise bill get wise slow an certains the only hand you can play so go to it an keep to it too  as the crosscuts decreased showing that the sides of the v were converging the depth of the v increased the goldtrace was dipping into the hill it was only at thirty inches beneath the surface that he could get colors in his pan the dirt he found at twentyfive inches from the surface and at thirtyfive inches yielded barren pans at the base of the v by the waters edge he had found the gold colors at the grass roots the higher he went up the hill the deeper the gold dipped to dig a hole three feet deep in order to get one testpan was a task of no mean magnitude while between the man and the apex intervened an untold number of such holes to be dug an theres no tellin how much deeper itll pitch he sighed in a moments pause while his fingers soothed his aching back  feverish with desire with aching back and stiffening muscles with pick and shovel gouging and mauling the soft brown earth the man toiled up the hill before him was the smooth slope spangled with flowers and made sweet with their breath behind him was devastation it looked like some terrible eruption breaking out on the smooth skin of the hill his slow progress was like that of a slug befouling beauty with a monstrous trail  though the dipping goldtrace increased the mans work he found consolation in the increasing richness of the pans twenty cents thirty cents fifty cents sixty cents were the values of the gold found in the pans and at nightfall he washed his banner pan which gave him a dollars worth of golddust from a shovelful of dirt  ill just bet its my luck to have some inquisitive one come buttin in here on my pasture he mumbled sleepily that night as he pulled the blankets up to his chin  suddenly he sat upright bill he called sharply now listen to me bill dye hear its up to you tomorrow mornin to mosey round an see what you can see understand tomorrow morning an dont you forget it  he yawned and glanced across at his sidehill good night mr pocket he called  in the morning he stole a march on the sun for he had finished breakfast when its first rays caught him and he was climbing the wall of the canyon where it crumbled away and gave footing from the outlook at the top he found himself in the midst of loneliness as far as he could see chain after chain of mountains heaved themselves into his vision to the east his eyes leaping the miles between range and range and between many ranges brought up at last against the whitepeaked sierrasthe main crest where the backbone of the western world reared itself against the sky to the north and south he could see more distinctly the crosssystems that broke through the main trend of the sea of mountains to the west the ranges fell away one behind the other diminishing and fading into the gentle foothills that in turn descended into the great valley which he could not see  and in all that mighty sweep of earth he saw no sign of man nor of the handiwork of mansave only the torn bosom of the hillside at his feet the man looked long and carefully once far down his own canyon he thought he saw in the air a faint hint of smoke he looked again and decided that it was the purple haze of the hills made dark by a convolution of the canyon wall at its back  hey you mr pocket he called down into the canyon stand out from under im acomin mr pocket im acomin  the heavy brogans on the mans feet made him appear clumsyfooted but he swung down from the giddy height as lightly and airily as a mountain goat a rock turning under his foot on the edge of the precipice did not disconcert him he seemed to know the precise time required for the turn to culminate in disaster and in the meantime he utilized the false footing itself for the momentary earthcontact necessary to carry him on into safety where the earth sloped so steeply that it was impossible to stand for a second upright the man did not hesitate his foot pressed the impossible surface for but a fraction of the fatal second and gave him the bound that carried him onward again where even the fraction of a seconds footing was out of the question he would swing his body past by a moments handgrip on a jutting knob of rock a crevice or a precariously rooted shrub at last with a wild leap and yell he exchanged the face of the wall for an earthslide and finished the descent in the midst of several tons of sliding earth and gravel  his first pan of the morning washed out over two dollars in coarse gold it was from the centre of the v to either side the diminution in the values of the pans was swift his lines of crosscutting holes were growing very short the converging sides of the inverted v were only a few yards apart their meetingpoint was only a few yards above him but the paystreak was dipping deeper and deeper into the earth by early afternoon he was sinking the testholes five feet before the pans could show the goldtrace  for that matter the goldtrace had become something more than a trace it was a placer mine in itself and the man resolved to come back after he had found the pocket and work over the ground but the increasing richness of the pans began to worry him by late afternoon the worth of the pans had grown to three and four dollars the man scratched his head perplexedly and looked a few feet up the hill at the manzanita bush that marked approximately the apex of the v he nodded his head and said oracularly  its one o two things bill one o two things either mr pockets spilled himself all out an down the hill or else mr pockets so rich you maybe wont be able to carry him all away with you and thatd be an awful shame wouldnt it now he chuckled at contemplation of so pleasant a dilemma  nightfall found him by the edge of the stream his eyes wrestling with the gathering darkness over the washing of a fivedollar pan  wisht i had an electric light to go on working he said  he found sleep difficult that night many times he composed himself and closed his eyes for slumber to overtake him but his blood pounded with too strong desire and as many times his eyes opened and he murmured wearily wisht it was sunup  sleep came to him in the end but his eyes were open with the first paling of the stars and the gray of dawn caught him with breakfast finished and climbing the hillside in the direction of the secret abidingplace of mr pocket  the first crosscut the man made there was space for only three holes so narrow had become the paystreak and so close was he to the fountainhead of the golden stream he had been following for four days  be cam bill be cam he admonished himself as he broke ground for the final hole where the sides of the v had at last come together in a point  ive got the almighty cinch on you mr pocket an you cant lose me he said many times as he sank the hole deeper and deeper  four feet five feet six feet he dug his way down into the earth the digging grew harder his pick grated on broken rock he examined the rock rotten quartz was his conclusion as with the shovel he cleared the bottom of the hole of loose dirt he attacked the crumbling quartz with the pick bursting the disintegrating rock asunder with every stroke  he thrust his shovel into the loose mass his eye caught a gleam of yellow he dropped the shovel and squatted suddenly on his heels as a farmer rubs the clinging earth from freshdug potatoes so the man a piece of rotten quartz held in both hands rubbed the dirt away  sufferin sardanopolis he cried lumps an chunks of it lumps an chunks of it  it was only half rock he held in his hand the other half was virgin gold he dropped it into his pan and examined another piece little yellow was to be seen but with his strong fingers he crumbled the rotten quartz away till both hands were filled with glowing yellow he rubbed the dirt away from fragment after fragment tossing them into the goldpan it was a treasurehole so much had the quartz rotted away that there was less of it than there was of gold now and again he found a piece to which no rock clunga piece that was all gold a chunk where the pick had laid open the heart of the gold glittered like a handful of yellow jewels and he cocked his head at it and slowly turned it around and over to observe the rich play of the light upon it  talk about yer too much gold diggins the man snorted contemptuously why this diggin d make it look like thirty cents this diggin is all gold an right here an now i name this yere canyon all gold canyon b gosh  still squatting on his heels he continued examining the fragments and tossing them into the pan suddenly there came to him a premonition of danger it seemed a shadow had fallen upon him but there was no shadow his heart had given a great jump up into his throat and was choking him then his blood slowly chilled and he felt the sweat of his shirt cold against his flesh  he did not spring up nor look around he did not move he was considering the nature of the premonition he had received trying to locate the source of the mysterious force that had warned him striving to sense the imperative presence of the unseen thing that threatened him there is an aura of things hostile made manifest by messengers too refined for the senses to know and this aura he felt but knew not how he felt it his was the feeling as when a cloud passes over the sun it seemed that between him and life had passed something dark and smothering and menacing a gloom as it were that swallowed up life and made for deathhis death  every force of his being impelled him to spring up and confront the unseen danger but his soul dominated the panic and he remained squatting on his heels in his hands a chunk of gold he did not dare to look around but he knew by now that there was something behind him and above him he made believe to be interested in the gold in his hand he examined it critically turned it over and over and rubbed the dirt from it and all the time he knew that something behind him was looking at the gold over his shoulder  still feigning interest in the chunk of gold in his hand he listened intently and he heard the breathing of the thing behind him his eyes searched the ground in front of him for a weapon but they saw only the uprooted gold worthless to him now in his extremity there was his pick a handy weapon on occasion but this was not such an occasion the man realized his predicament he was in a narrow hole that was seven feet deep his head did not come to the surface of the ground he was in a trap  he remained squatting on his heels he was quite cool and collected but his mind considering every factor showed him only his helplessness he continued rubbing the dirt from the quartz fragments and throwing the gold into the pan there was nothing else for him to do yet he knew that he would have to rise up sooner or later and face the danger that breathed at his back the minutes passed and with the passage of each minute he knew that by so much he was nearer the time when he must stand up or elseand his wet shirt went cold against his flesh again at the thoughtor else he might receive death as he stooped there over his treasure  still he squatted on his heels rubbing dirt from gold and debating in just what manner he should rise up he might rise up with a rush and claw his way out of the hole to meet whatever threatened on the even footing above ground or he might rise up slowly and carelessly and feign casually to discover the thing that breathed at his back his instinct and every fighting fibre of his body favored the mad clawing rush to the surface his intellect and the craft thereof favored the slow and cautious meeting with the thing that menaced and which he could not see and while he debated a loud crashing noise burst on his ear at the same instant he received a stunning blow on the left side of the back and from the point of impact felt a rush of flame through his flesh he sprang up in the air but halfway to his feet collapsed his body crumpled in like a leaf withered in sudden heat and he came down his chest across his pan of gold his face in the dirt and rock his legs tangled and twisted because of the restricted space at the bottom of the hole his legs twitched convulsively several times his body was shaken as with a mighty ague there was a slow expansion of the lungs accompanied by a deep sigh then the air was slowly very slowly exhaled and his body as slowly flattened itself down into inertness  above revolver in hand a man was peering down over the edge of the hole he peered for a long time at the prone and motionless body beneath him after a while the stranger sat down on the edge of the hole so that he could see into it and rested the revolver on his knee reaching his hand into a pocket he drew out a wisp of brown paper into this he dropped a few crumbs of tobacco the combination became a cigarette brown and squat with the ends turned in not once did he take his eyes from the body at the bottom of the hole he lighted the cigarette and drew its smoke into his lungs with a caressing intake of the breath he smoked slowly once the cigarette went out and he relighted it and all the while he studied the body beneath him  in the end he tossed the cigarette stub away and rose to his feet he moved to the edge of the hole spanning it a hand resting on each edge and with the revolver still in the right hand he muscled his body down into the hole while his feet were yet a yard from the bottom he released his hands and dropped down  at the instant his feet struck bottom he saw the pocketminers arm leap out and his own legs knew a swift jerking grip that overthrew him in the nature of the jump his revolver hand was above his head swiftly as the grip had flashed about his legs just as swiftly he brought the revolver down he was still in the air his fall in process of completion when he pulled the trigger the explosion was deafening in the confined space the smoke filled the hole so that he could see nothing he struck the bottom on his back and like a cats the pocketminers body was on top of him even as the miners body passed on top the stranger crooked in his right arm to fire and even in that instant the miner with a quick thrust of elbow struck his wrist the muzzle was thrown up and the bullet thudded into the dirt of the side of the hole  the next instant the stranger felt the miners hand grip his wrist the struggle was now for the revolver each man strove to turn it against the others body the smoke in the hole was clearing the stranger lying on his back was beginning to see dimly but suddenly he was blinded by a handful of dirt deliberately flung into his eyes by his antagonist in that moment of shock his grip on the revolver was broken in the next moment he felt a smashing darkness descend upon his brain and in the midst of the darkness even the darkness ceased  but the pocketminer fired again and again until the revolver was empty then he tossed it from him and breathing heavily sat down on the dead mans legs  the miner was sobbing and struggling for breath measly skunk he panted acampin on my trail an lettin me do the work an then shootin me in the back  he was half crying from anger and exhaustion he peered at the face of the dead man it was sprinkled with loose dirt and gravel and it was difficult to distinguish the features  never laid eyes on him before the miner concluded his scrutiny just a common an ordinary thief hang him an he shot me in the back he shot me in the back  he opened his shirt and felt himself front and back on his left side  went clean through and no harm done he cried jubilantly ill bet he aimed all right all right but he drew the gun over when he pulled the triggerthe cur but i fixed m oh i fixed m  his fingers were investigating the bullethole in his side and a shade of regret passed over his face its goin to be stiffern hell he said an its up to me to get mended an get out ohere  he crawled out of the hole and went down the hill to his camp half an hour later he returned leading his packhorse his open shirt disclosed the rude bandages with which he had dressed his wound he was slow and awkward with his lefthand movements but that did not prevent his using the arm  the bight of the packrope under the dead mans shoulders enabled him to heave the body out of the hole then he set to work gathering up his gold he worked steadily for several hours pausing often to rest his stiffening shoulder and to exclaim  he shot me in the back the measly skunk he shot me in the back  when his treasure was quite cleaned up and wrapped securely into a number of blanketcovered parcels he made an estimate of its value  four hundred pounds or im a hottentot he concluded say two hundred in quartz an dirtthat leaves two hundred pounds of gold bill wake up two hundred pounds of gold forty thousand dollars an its yournall yourn  he scratched his head delightedly and his fingers blundered into an unfamiliar groove they quested along it for several inches it was a crease through his scalp where the second bullet had ploughed  he walked angrily over to the dead man  you would would you he bullied you would eh well i fixed you good an plenty an ill give you decent burial too thats moren youd have done for me  he dragged the body to the edge of the hole and toppled it in it struck the bottom with a dull crash on its side the face twisted up to the light the miner peered down at it  an you shot me in the back he said accusingly  with pick and shovel he filled the hole then he loaded the gold on his horse it was too great a load for the animal and when he had gained his camp he transferred part of it to his saddlehorse even so he was compelled to abandon a portion of his outfitpick and shovel and goldpan extra food and cooking utensils and divers odds and ends  the sun was at the zenith when the man forced the horses at the screen of vines and creepers to climb the huge boulders the animals were compelled to uprear and struggle blindly through the tangled mass of vegetation once the saddlehorse fell heavily and the man removed the pack to get the animal on its feet after it started on its way again the man thrust his head out from among the leaves and peered up at the hillside  the measly skunk he said and disappeared  there was a ripping and tearing of vines and boughs the trees surged back and forth marking the passage of the animals through the midst of them there was a clashing of steelshod hoofs on stone and now and again a sharp cry of command then the voice of the man was raised in song     tun around an tun yo face    untoe them sweet hills of grace      d powrs of sin yo am scornin    look about an look aroun    fling yo sinpack on d groun      yowill meet wid d lord in d mornin  the song grew faint and fainter and through the silence crept back the spirit of the place the stream once more drowsed and whispered the hum of the mountain bees rose sleepily down through the perfumeweighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods the butterflies drifted in and out among the trees and over all blazed the quiet sunshine only remained the hoofmarks in the meadow and the torn hillside to mark the boisterous trail of the life that had broken the peace of the place and passed on  illustration     the story of keesh   keesh lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea was head man of his village through many and prosperous years and died full of honors with his name on the lips of men so long ago did he live that only the old men remember his name his name and the tale which they got from the old men before them and which the old men to come will tell to their children and their childrens children down to the end of time and the winter darkness when the north gales make their long sweep across the icepack and the air is filled with flying white and no man may venture forth is the chosen time for the telling of how keesh from the poorest igloo in the village rose to power and place over them all  he was a bright boy so the tale runs healthy and strong and he had seen thirteen suns in their way of reckoning time for each winter the sun leaves the land in darkness and the next year a new sun returns so that they may be warm again and look upon one anothers faces the father of keesh had been a very brave man but he had met his death in a time of famine when he sought to save the lives of his people by taking the life of a great polar bear in his eagerness he came to close grapples with the bear and his bones were crushed but the bear had much meat on him and the people were saved keesh was his only son and after that keesh lived alone with his mother but the people are prone to forget and they forgot the deed of his father and he being but a boy and his mother only a woman they too were swiftly forgotten and ere long came to live in the meanest of all the igloos  it was at a council one night in the big igloo of kloshkwan the chief that keesh showed the blood that ran in his veins and the manhood that stiffened his back with the dignity of an elder he rose to his feet and waited for silence amid the babble of voices  it is true that meat be apportioned me and mine he said but it is ofttimes old and tough this meat and moreover it has an unusual quantity of bones  the hunters grizzled and gray and lusty and young were aghast the like had never been known before a child that talked like a grown man and said harsh things to their very faces  but steadily and with seriousness keesh went on for that i know my father bok was a great hunter i speak these words it is said that bok brought home more meat than any of the two best hunters that with his own hands he attended to the division of it that with his own eyes he saw to it that the least old woman and the least old man received fair share  na na the men cried put the child out send him off to bed he is no man that he should talk to men and graybeards  he waited calmly till the uproar died down  thou hast a wife ughgluk he said and for her dost thou speak and thou too massuk a mother also and for them dost thou speak my mother has no one save me wherefore i speak as i say though bok be dead because he hunted overkeenly it is just that i who am his son and that ikeega who is my mother and was his wife should have meat in plenty so long as there be meat in plenty in the tribe i keesh the son of bok have spoken  he sat down his ears keenly alert to the flood of protest and indignation his words had created  that a boy should speak in council old ughgluk was mumbling  shall the babes in arms tell us men the things we shall do massuk demanded in a loud voice am i a man that i should be made a mock by every child that cries for meat  the anger boiled a white heat they ordered him to bed threatened that he should have no meat at all and promised him sore beatings for his presumption keeshs eyes began to flash and the blood to pound darkly under his skin in the midst of the abuse he sprang to his feet  hear me ye men he cried never shall i speak in the council again never again till the men come to me and say it is well keesh that thou shouldst speak it is well and it is our wish take this now ye men for my last word bok my father was a great hunter i too his son shall go and hunt the meat that i eat and be it known now that the division of that which i kill shall be fair and no widow nor weak one shall cry in the night because there is no meat when the strong men are groaning in great pain for that they have eaten overmuch and in the days to come there shall be shame upon the strong men who have eaten overmuch i keesh have said it  jeers and scornful laughter followed him out of the igloo but his jaw was set and he went his way looking neither to right nor left  the next day he went forth along the shoreline where the ice and the land met together those who saw him go noted that he carried his bow with a goodly supply of bonebarbed arrows and that across his shoulder was his fathers big huntingspear and there was laughter and much talk at the event it was an unprecedented occurrence never did boys of his tender age go forth to hunt much less to hunt alone also were there shaking of heads and prophetic mutterings and the women looked pityingly at ikeega and her face was grave and sad  he will be back ere long they said cheeringly  let him go it will teach him a lesson the hunters said and he will come back shortly and he will be meek and soft of speech in the days to follow  but a day passed and a second and on the third a wild gale blew and there was no keesh ikeega tore her hair and put soot of the sealoil on her face in token of her grief and the women assailed the men with bitter words in that they had mistreated the boy and sent him to his death and the men made no answer preparing to go in search of the body when the storm abated  early next morning however keesh strode into the village but he came not shamefacedly across his shoulders he bore a burden of freshkilled meat and there was importance in his step and arrogance in his speech  go ye men with the dogs and sledges and take my trail for the better part of a days travel he said there is much meat on the icea shebear and two halfgrown cubs  ikeega was overcome with joy but he received her demonstrations in manlike fashion saying come ikeega let us eat and after that i shall sleep for i am weary  and he passed into their igloo and ate profoundly and after that slept for twenty running hours  there was much doubt at first much doubt and discussion the killing of a polar bear is very dangerous but thrice dangerous is it and three times thrice to kill a mother bear with her cubs the men could not bring themselves to believe that the boy keesh singlehanded had accomplished so great a marvel but the women spoke of the freshkilled meat he had brought on his back and this was an overwhelming argument against their unbelief so they finally departed grumbling greatly that in all probability if the thing were so he had neglected to cut up the carcasses now in the north it is very necessary that this should be done as soon as a kill is made if not the meat freezes so solidly as to turn the edge of the sharpest knife and a threehundredpound bear frozen stiff is no easy thing to put upon a sled and haul over the rough ice but arrived at the spot they found not only the kill which they had doubted but that keesh had quartered the beasts in true hunter fashion and removed the entrails  thus began the mystery of keesh a mystery that deepened and deepened with the passing of the days his very next trip he killed a young bear nearly fullgrown and on the trip following a large male bear and his mate he was ordinarily gone from three to four days though it was nothing unusual for him to stay away a week at a time on the icefield always he declined company on these expeditions and the people marveled how does he do it they demanded of one another never does he take a dog with him and dogs are of such great help too  why dost thou hunt only bear kloshkwan once ventured to ask  and keesh made fitting answer it is well known that there is more meat on the bear he said  but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village he hunts with evil spirits some of the people contended wherefore his hunting is rewarded how else can it be save that he hunts with evil spirits  mayhap they be not evil but good these spirits others said it is known that his father was a mighty hunter may not his father hunt with him so that he may attain excellence and patience and understanding who knows  none the less his success continued and the less skilful hunters were often kept busy hauling in his meat and in the division of it he was just as his father had done before him he saw to it that the least old woman and the last old man received a fair portion keeping no more for himself than his needs required and because of this and of his merit as a hunter he was looked upon with respect and even awe and there was talk of making him chief after old kloshkwan because of the things he had done they looked for him to appear again in the council but he never came and they were ashamed to ask  i am minded to build me an igloo he said one day to kloshkwan and a number of the hunters it shall be a large igloo wherein ikeega and i can dwell in comfort  ay they nodded gravely  but i have no time by business is hunting and it takes all my time so it is but just that the men and women of the village who eat my meat should build me my igloo  and the igloo was built accordingly on a generous scale which exceeded even the dwelling of kloshkwan keesh and his mother moved into it and it was the first prosperity she had enjoyed since the death of bok nor was material prosperity alone hers for because of her wonderful son and the position he had given her she came to be looked upon as the first woman in all the village and the women were given to visiting her to asking her advice and to quoting her wisdom when arguments arose among themselves or with the men  but it was the mystery of keeshs marvelous hunting that took chief place in all their minds and one day ughgluk taxed him with witchcraft to his face  it is charged ughgluk said ominously that thou dealest with evil spirits wherefore thy hunting is rewarded  is not the meat good keesh made answer has one in the village yet to fall sick from the eating of it how dost thou know that witchcraft be concerned or dost thou guess in the dark merely because of the envy that consumes thee  and ughgluk withdrew discomfited the women laughing at him as he walked away but in the council one night after long deliberation it was determined to put spies on his track when he went forth to hunt so that his methods might be learned so on his next trip bim and bawn two young men and of hunters the craftiest followed after him taking care not to be seen after five days they returned their eyes bulging and their tongues atremble to tell what they had seen the council was hastily called in kloshkwans dwelling and bim took up the tale  brothers as commanded we journeyed on the trail of keesh and cunningly we journeyed so that he might not know and midway of the first day he picked up with a great hebear it was a very great bear  none greater bawn corroborated and went on himself yet was the bear not inclined to fight for he turned away and made off slowly over the ice this we saw from the rocks of the shore and the bear came toward us and after him came keesh very much unafraid and he shouted harsh words after the bear and waved his arms about and made much noise then did the bear grow angry and rise up on his hind legs and growl but keesh walked right up to the bear  ay bim continued the story right up to the bear keesh walked and the bear took after him and keesh ran away but as he ran he dropped a little round ball on the ice and the bear stopped and smelled of it and then swallowed it up and keesh continued to run away and drop little round balls and the bear continued to swallow them up  exclamations and cries of doubt were being made and ughgluk expressed open unbelief  with our own eyes we saw it bim affirmed  and bawnay with our own eyes and this continued until the bear stood suddenly upright and cried aloud in pain and thrashed his forepaws madly about and keesh continued to make off over the ice to a safe distance but the bear gave him no notice being occupied with the misfortune the little round balls had wrought within him  ay within him bim interrupted for he did claw at himself and leap about over the ice like a playful puppy save from the way he growled and squealed it was plain it was not play but pain never did i see such a sight  nay never was such a sight seen bawn took up the strain and furthermore it was such a large bear  witchcraft ughgluk suggested  i know not bawn replied i tell only of what my eyes beheld and after a while the bear grew weak and tired for he was very heavy and he had jumped about with exceeding violence and he went off along the shoreice shaking his head slowly from side to side and sitting down ever and again to squeal and cry and keesh followed after the bear and we followed after keesh and for that day and three days more we followed the bear grew weak and never ceased crying from his pain  it was a charm ughgluk exclaimed surely it was a charm  it may well be  and bim relieved bawn the bear wandered now this way and now that doubling back and forth and crossing his trail in circles so that at the end he was near where keesh had first come upon him by this time he was quite sick the bear and could crawl no farther so keesh came up close and speared him to death  and then kloshkwan demanded  then we left keesh skinning the bear and came running that the news of the killing might be told  and in the afternoon of that day the women hauled in the meat of the bear while the men sat in council assembled when keesh arrived a messenger was sent to him bidding him come to the council but he sent reply saying that he was hungry and tired also that his igloo was large and comfortable and could hold many men  and curiosity was so strong on the men that the whole council kloshkwan to the fore rose up and went to the igloo of keesh he was eating but he received them with respect and seated them according to their rank ikeega was proud and embarrassed by turns but keesh was quite composed  kloshkwan recited the information brought by bim and bawn and at its close said in a stern voice so explanation is wanted o keesh of thy manner of hunting is there witchcraft in it  keesh looked up and smiled nay o kloshkwan it is not for a boy to know aught of witches and of witches i know nothing i have but devised a means whereby i may kill the icebear with ease that is all it be headcraft not witchcraft  and may any man  any man  there was a long silence the men looked in one anothers faces and keesh went on eating  and  and  and wilt thou tell us o keesh kloshkwan finally asked in a tremulous voice  yea i will tell thee keesh finished sucking a marrowbone and rose to his feet it is quite simple behold  he picked up a thin strip of whalebone and showed it to them the ends were sharp as needlepoints the strip he coiled carefully till it disappeared in his hand then suddenly releasing it it sprang straight again he picked up a piece of blubber  so he said one takes a small chunk of blubber thus and thus makes it hollow then into the hollow goes the whalebone so tightly coiled and another piece of blubber is fitted over the whalebone after that it is put outside where it freezes into a little round ball the bear swallows the little round ball the blubber melts the whalebone with its sharp ends stands out straight the bear gets sick and when the bear is very sick why you kill him with a spear it is quite simple  and ughgluk said oh and kloshkwan said ah and each said something after his own manner and all understood  and this is the story of keesh who lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea because he exercised headcraft and not witchcraft he rose from the meanest igloo to be head man of his village and through all the years that he lived it is related his tribe was prosperous and neither widow nor weak one cried aloud in the night because there was no meat  illustration     nambok the unveracious   a bidarka is it not so look a bidarka and one man who drives clumsily with a paddle  old baskwahwan rose to her knees trembling with weakness and eagerness and gazed out over the sea  nambok was ever clumsy at the paddle she maundered reminiscently shading the sun from her eyes and staring across the silverspilled water nambok was ever clumsy i remember  but the women and children laughed loudly and there was a gentle mockery in their laughter and her voice dwindled till her lips moved without sound  koogah lifted his grizzled head from his bonecarving and followed the path of her eyes except when wide yawns took it off its course a bidarka was heading in for the beach its occupant was paddling with more strength than dexterity and made his approach along the zigzag line of most resistance koogahs head dropped to his work again and on the ivory tusk between his knees he scratched the dorsal fin of a fish the like of which never swam in the sea  it is doubtless the man from the next village he said finally come to consult with me about the marking of things on bone and the man is a clumsy man he will never know how  it is nambok old baskwahwan repeated should i not know my son she demanded shrilly i say and i say again it is nambok  and so thou hast said these many summers one of the women chided softly ever when the ice passed out of the sea hast thou sat and watched through the long day saying at each chance canoe this is nambok nambok is dead o baskwahwan and the dead do not come back it cannot be that the dead come back  nambok the old woman cried so loud and clear that the whole village was startled and looked at her  she struggled to her feet and tottered down the sand she stumbled over a baby lying in the sun and the mother hushed its crying and hurled harsh words after the old woman who took no notice the children ran down the beach in advance of her and as the man in the bidarka drew closer nearly capsizing with one of his illdirected strokes the women followed koogah dropped his walrus tusk and went also leaning heavily upon his staff and after him loitered the men in twos and threes  the bidarka turned broadside and the ripple of surf threatened to swamp it only a naked boy ran into the water and pulled the bow high up on the sand the man stood up and sent a questing glance along the line of villagers a rainbow sweater dirty and the worse for wear clung loosely to his broad shoulders and a red cotton handkerchief was knotted in sailor fashion about his throat a fishermans tamoshanter on his closeclipped head and dungaree trousers and heavy brogans completed his outfit  but he was none the less a striking personage to these simple fisherfolk of the great yukon delta who all their lives had stared out on bering sea and in that time seen but two white menthe census enumerator and a lost jesuit priest they were a poor people with neither gold in the ground nor valuable furs in hand so the whites had passed them afar also the yukon through the thousands of years had shoaled that portion of the sea with the detritus of alaska till vessels grounded out of sight of land so the sodden coast with its long inside reaches and huge mudland archipelagoes was avoided by the ships of men and the fisherfolk knew not that such things were  koogah the bonescratcher retreated backward in sudden haste tripping over his staff and falling to the ground nambok he cried as he scrambled wildly for footing nambok who was blown off to sea come back  the men and women shrank away and the children scuttled off between their legs only opeekwan was brave as befitted the head man of the village he strode forward and gazed long and earnestly at the newcomer  it is nambok he said at last and at the conviction in his voice the women wailed apprehensively and drew farther away  the lips of the stranger moved indecisively and his brown throat writhed and wrestled with unspoken words  la la it is nambok baskwahwan croaked peering up into his face ever did i say nambok would come back  ay it is nambok come back this time it was nambok himself who spoke putting a leg over the side of the bidarka and standing with one foot afloat and one ashore again his throat writhed and wrestled as he grappled after forgotten words and when the words came forth they were strange of sound and a spluttering of the lips accompanied the gutturals greetings o brothers he said brothers of old time before i went away with the offshore wind  he stepped out with both feet on the sand and opeekwan waved him back  thou art dead nambok he said  nambok laughed i am fat  dead men are not fat opeekwan confessed thou hast fared well but it is strange no man may mate with the offshore wind and come back on the heels of the years  i have come back nambok answered simply  mayhap thou art a shadow then a passing shadow of the nambok that was shadows come back  i am hungry shadows do not eat  but opeekwan doubted and brushed his hand across his brow in sore puzzlement nambok was likewise puzzled and as he looked up and down the line found no welcome in the eyes of the fisherfolk the men and women whispered together the children stole timidly back among their elders and bristling dogs fawned up to him and sniffed suspiciously  i bore thee nambok and i gave thee suck when thou wast little baskwahwan whimpered drawing closer and shadow though thou be or no shadow i will give thee to eat now  nambok made to come to her but a growl of fear and menace warned him back he said something angrily in a strange tongue and added no shadow am i but a man  who may know concerning the things of mystery opeekwan demanded half of himself and half of his tribespeople we are and in a breath we are not if the man may become shadow may not the shadow become man nambok was but is not this we know but we do not know if this be nambok or the shadow of nambok  nambok cleared his throat and made answer in the old time long ago thy fathers father opeekwan went away and came back on the heels of the years nor was a place by the fire denied him it is said  he paused significantly and they hung on his utterance it is said he repeated driving his point home with deliberation that sipsip his klooch bore him two sons after he came back  but he had no doings with the offshore wind opeekwan retorted he went away into the heart of the land and it is in the nature of things that a man may go on and on into the land  and likewise the sea but that is neither here nor there it is said  that thy fathers father told strange tales of the things he saw  ay strange tales he told  i too have strange tales to tell nambok stated insidiously and as they wavered and presents likewise  he pulled from the bidarka a shawl marvelous of texture and color and flung it about his mothers shoulders the women voiced a collective sigh of admiration and old baskwahwan ruffled the gay material and patted it and crooned in childish joy  he has tales to tell koogah muttered and presents a woman seconded  and opeekwan knew that his people were eager and further he was aware himself of an itching curiosity concerning those untold tales the fishing has been good he said judiciously and we have oil in plenty so come nambok let us feast  two of the men hoisted the bidarka on their shoulders and carried it up to the fire nambok walked by the side of opeekwan and the villagers followed after save those of the women who lingered a moment to lay caressing fingers on the shawl  there was little talk while the feast went on though many and curious were the glances stolen at the son of baskwahwan this embarrassed himnot because he was modest of spirit however but for the fact that the stench of the sealoil had robbed him of his appetite and that he keenly desired to conceal his feelings on the subject  eat thou art hungry opeekwan commanded and nambok shut both his eyes and shoved his fist into the big pot of putrid fish  la la be not ashamed the seal were many this year and strong men are ever hungry and baskwahwan sopped a particularly offensive chunk of salmon into the oil and passed it fondly and dripping to her son  in despair when premonitory symptoms warned him that his stomach was not so strong as of old he filled his pipe and struck up a smoke the people fed on noisily and watched few of them could boast of intimate acquaintance with the precious weed though now and again small quantities and abominable qualities were obtained in trade from the eskimos to the northward koogah sitting next to him indicated that he was not averse to taking a draw and between two mouthfuls with the oil thick on his lips sucked away at the amber stem and thereupon nambok held his stomach with a shaky hand and declined the proffered return koogah could keep the pipe he said for he had intended so to honor him from the first and the people licked their fingers and approved of his liberality  opeekwan rose to his feet and now o nambok the feast is ended and we would listen concerning the strange things you have seen  the fisherfolk applauded with their hands and gathering about them their work prepared to listen the men were busy fashioning spears and carving on ivory while the women scraped the fat from the hides of the hair seal and made them pliable or sewed muclucs with threads of sinew namboks eyes roved over the scene but there was not the charm about it that his recollection had warranted him to expect during the years of his wandering he had looked forward to just this scene and now that it had come he was disappointed it was a bare and meagre life he deemed and not to be compared to the one to which he had become used still he would open their eyes a bit and his own eyes sparkled at the thought  brothers he began with the smug complacency of a man about to relate the big things he has done it was late summer of many summers back with much such weather as this promises to be when i went away you all remember the day when the gulls flew low and the wind blew strong from the land and i could not hold my bidarka against it i tied the covering of the bidarka about me so that no water could get in and all of the night i fought with the storm and in the morning there was no landonly the seaand the offshore wind held me close in its arms and bore me along three such nights whitened into dawn and showed me no land and the offshore wind would not let me go  and when the fourth day came i was as a madman i could not dip my paddle for want of food and my head went round and round what of the thirst that was upon me but the sea was no longer angry and the soft south wind was blowing and as i looked about me i saw a sight that made me think i was indeed mad  nambok paused to pick away a sliver of salmon lodged between his teeth and the men and women with idle hands and heads craned forward waited  it was a canoe a big canoe if all the canoes i have ever seen were made into one canoe it would not be so large  there were exclamations of doubt and koogah whose years were many shook his head  if each bidarka were as a grain of sand nambok defiantly continued and if there were as many bidarkas as there be grains of sand in this beach still would they not make so big a canoe as this i saw on the morning of the fourth day it was a very big canoe and it was called a schooner i saw this thing of wonder this great schooner coming after me and on it i saw men  hold o nambok opeekwan broke in what manner of men were theybig men  nay mere men like you and me  did the big canoe come fast  ay  the sides were tall the men short opeekwan stated the premises with conviction and did these men dip with long paddles  nambok grinned there were no paddles he said  mouths remained open and a long silence dropped down opekwan borrowed koogahs pipe for a couple of contemplative sucks one of the younger women giggled nervously and drew upon herself angry eyes  there were no paddles opeekwan asked softly returning the pipe  the south wind was behind nambok explained  but the wind drift is slow  the schooner had wingsthus he sketched a diagram of masts and sails in the sand and the men crowded around and studied it the wind was blowing briskly and for more graphic elucidation he seized the corners of his mothers shawl and spread them out till it bellied like a sail bask wahwan scolded and struggled but was blown down the breach for a score of feet and left breathless and stranded in a heap of driftwood the men uttered sage grunts of comprehension but koogah suddenly tossed back his hoary head  ho ho he laughed a foolish thing this big canoe a most foolish thing the plaything of the wind wheresoever the wind goes it goes too no man who journeys therein may name the landing beach for always he goes with the wind and the wind goes everywhere but no man knows where  it is so opeekwan supplemented gravely with the wind the going is easy but against the wind a man striveth hard and for that they had no paddles these men on the big canoe did not strive at all  small need to strive nambok cried angrily the schooner went likewise against the wind  and what said you made the schschschooner go koogah asked tripping craftily over the strange word  the wind was the impatient response  then the wind made the schschschooner go against the wind old koogah dropped an open leer to opeekwan and the laughter growing around him continued the wind blows from the south and blows the schooner south the wind blows against the wind the wind blows one way and the other at the same time it is very simple we understand nambok we clearly understand  thou art a fool  truth falls from thy lips koogah answered meekly i was overlong in understanding and the thing was simple  but namboks face was dark and he said rapid words which they had never heard before bonescratching and skinscraping were resumed but he shut his lips tightly on the tongue that could not be believed  this schschschooner koogah imperturbably asked it was made of a big tree  it was made of many trees nambok snapped shortly it was very big  he lapsed into sullen silence again and opeekwan nudged koogah who shook his head with slow amazement and murmured it is very strange  nambok took the bait that is nothing he said airily you should see the steamer as the grain of sand is to the bidarka as the bidarka is to the schooner so the schooner is to the steamer further the steamer is made of iron it is all iron  nay nay nambok cried the head man how can that be always iron goes to the bottom for behold i received an iron knife in trade from the head man of the next village and yesterday the iron knife slipped from my fingers and went down down into the sea to all things there be law never was there one thing outside the law this we know and moreover we know that things of a kind have the one law and that all iron has the one law so unsay thy words nambok that we may yet honor thee  it is so nambok persisted the steamer is all iron and does not sink  nay nay this cannot be  with my own eyes i saw it  it is not in the nature of things  but tell me nambok koogah interrupted for fear the tale would go no farther tell me the manner of these men in finding their way across the sea when there is no land by which to steer  the sun points out the path  but how  at midday the head man of the schooner takes a thing through which his eye looks at the sun and then he makes the sun climb down out of the sky to the edge of the earth  now this be evil medicine cried opeekwan aghast at the sacrilege the men held up their hands in horror and the women moaned this be evil medicine it is not good to misdirect the great sun which drives away the night and gives us the seal the salmon and warm weather  what if it be evil medicine nambok demanded truculently i too have looked through the thing at the sun and made the sun climb down out of the sky  those who were nearest drew away from him hurriedly and a woman covered the face of a child at her breast so that his eye might not fall upon it  but on the morning of the fourth day o nambok koogah suggested on the morning of the fourth day when the schschschooner came after thee  i had little strength left in me and could not run away so i was taken on board and water was poured down my throat and good food given me twice my brothers you have seen a white man these men were all white and as many as have i fingers and toes and when i saw they were full of kindness i took heart and i resolved to bring away with me report of all that i saw and they taught me the work they did and gave me good food and a place to sleep  and day after day we went over the sea and each day the head man drew the sun down out of the sky and made it tell where we were and when the waves were kind we hunted the fur seal and i marvelled much for always did they fling the meat and the fat away and save only the skin  opeekwans mouth was twitching violently and he was about to make denunciation of such waste when koogah kicked him to be still  after a weary time when the sun was gone and the bite of the frost come into the air the head man pointed the nose of the schooner south south and east we traveled for days upon days with never the land in sight and we were near to the village from which hailed the men  how did they know they were near opeekwan unable to contain himself longer demanded there was no land to see  nambok glowered on him wrathfully did i not say the head man brought the sun down out of the sky  koogah interposed and nambok went on as i say when we were near to that village a great storm blew up and in the night we were helpless and knew not where we were  thou hast just said the head man knew  oh peace opeekwan thou art a fool and cannot understand as i say we were helpless in the night when i heard above the roar of the storm the sound of the sea on the beach and next we struck with a mighty crash and i was in the water swimming it was a rockbound coast with one patch of beach in many miles and the law was that i should dig my hands into the sand and draw myself clear of the surf the other men must have pounded against the rocks for none of them came ashore but the head man and him i knew only by the ring on his finger  when day came there being nothing of the schooner i turned my face to the land and journeyed into it that i might get food and look upon the faces of the people and when i came to a house i was taken in and given to eat for i had learned their speech and the white men are ever kindly and it was a house bigger than all the houses built by us and our fathers before us  it was a mighty house koogah said masking his unbelief with wonder  and many trees went into the making of such a house opeekwan added taking the cue  that is nothing nambok shrugged his shoulders in belittling fashion as our houses are to that house so that house was to the houses i was yet to see  and they are not big men  nay mere men like you and me nambok answered i had cut a stick that i might walk in comfort and remembering that i was to bring report to you my brothers i cut a notch in the stick for each person who lived in that house and i stayed there many days and worked for which they gave me moneya thing of which you know nothing but which is very good  and one day i departed from that place to go farther into the land and as i walked i met many people and i cut smaller notches in the stick that there might be room for all then i came upon a strange thing on the ground before me was a bar of iron as big in thickness as my arm and a long step away was another bar of iron  then wert thou a rich man opeekwan asserted for iron be worth more than anything else in the world it would have made many knives  nay it was not mine  it was a find and a find be lawful  not so the white men had placed it there and further these bars were so long that no man could carry them awayso long that as far as i could see there was no end to them  nambok that is very much iron opeekwan cautioned  ay it was hard to believe with my own eyes upon it but i could not gainsay my eyes and as i looked i heard  he turned abruptly upon the head man opeekwan thou hast heard the sealion bellow in his anger make it plain in thy mind of as many sealions as there be waves to the sea and make it plain that all these sealions be made into one sealion and as that one sealion would bellow so bellowed the thing i heard  the fisherfolk cried aloud in astonishment and opeekwans jaw lowered and remained lowered  and in the distance i saw a monster like unto a thousand whales it was oneeyed and vomited smoke and it snorted with exceeding loudness i was afraid and ran with shaking legs along the path between the bars but it came with speed of the wind this monster and i leaped the iron bars with its breath hot on my face   opeekwan gained control of his jaw again andand then o nambok  then it came by on the bars and harmed me not and when my legs could hold me up again it was gone from sight and it is a very common thing in that country even the women and children are not afraid men make them to do work these monsters  as we make our dogs do work koogah asked with sceptic twinkle in his eye  ay as we make our dogs do work  and how do they breed thesethese things opeekwan questioned  they breed not at all men fashion them cunningly of iron and feed them with stone and give them water to drink the stone becomes fire and the water becomes steam and the steam of the water is the breath of their nostrils and  there there o nambok opeekwan interrupted tell us of other wonders we grow tired of this which we may not understand  you do not understand nambok asked despairingly  nay we do not understand the men and women wailed back we cannot understand  nambok thought of a combined harvester and of the machines wherein visions of living men were to be seen and of the machines from which came the voices of men and he knew his people could never understand  dare i say i rode this iron monster through the land he asked bitterly  opeekwan threw up his hands palms outward in open incredulity say on say anything we listen  then did i ride the iron monster for which i gave money  thou saidst it was fed with stone  and likewise thou fool i said money was a thing of which you know nothing as i say i rode the monster through the land and through many villages until i came to a big village on a salt arm of the sea and the houses shoved their roofs among the stars in the sky and the clouds drifted by them and everywhere was much smoke and the roar of that village was like the roar of the sea in storm and the people were so many that i flung away my stick and no longer remembered the notches upon it  hadst thou made small notches koogah reproved thou mightst have brought report  nambok whirled upon him in anger had i made small notches listen koogah thou scratcher of bone if i had made small notches neither the stick nor twenty sticks could have borne themnay not all the driftwood of all the beaches between this village and the next and if all of you the women and children as well were twenty times as many and if you had twenty hands each and in each hand a stick and a knife still the notches could not be cut for the people i saw so many were they and so fast did they come and go  there cannot be so many people in all the world opeekwan objected for he was stunned and his mind could not grasp such magnitude of numbers  what dost thou know of all the world and how large it is nambok demanded  but there cannot be so many people in one place  who art thou to say what can be and what cannot be  it stands to reason there cannot be so many people in one place their canoes would clutter the sea till there was no room and they could empty the sea each day of its fish and they would not all be fed  so it would seem nambok made final answer yet it was so with my own eyes i saw and flung my stick away he yawned heavily and rose to his feet i have paddled far the day has been long and i am tired now i will sleep and tomorrow we will have further talk upon the things i have seen  baskwahwan hobbling fearfully in advance proud indeed yet awed by her wonderful son led him to her igloo and stowed him away among the greasy illsmelling furs but the men lingered by the fire and a council was held wherein was there much whispering and lowvoiced discussion  an hour passed and a second and nambok slept and the talk went on the evening sun dipped toward the northwest and at eleven at night was nearly due north then it was that the head man and the bonescratcher separated themselves from the council and aroused nambok he blinked up into their faces and turned on his side to sleep again opeekwan gripped him by the arm and kindly but firmly shook his senses back into him  come nambok arise he commanded it be time  another feast nambok cried nay i am not hungry go on with the eating and let me sleep  time to be gone koogah thundered  but opeekwan spoke more softly thou wast bidarkamate with me when we were boys he said together we first chased the seal and drew the salmon from the traps and thou didst drag me back to life nambok when the sea closed over me and i was sucked down to the black rocks together we hungered and bore the chill of the frost and together we crawled beneath the one fur and lay close to each other and because of these things and the kindness in which i stood to thee it grieves me sore that thou shouldst return such a remarkable liar we cannot understand and our heads be dizzy with the things thou hast spoken it is not good and there has been much talk in the council wherefore we send thee away that our heads may remain clear and strong and be not troubled by the unaccountable things  these things thou speakest of be shadows koogah took up the strain from the shadowworld thou hast brought them and to the shadowworld thou must return them thy bidarka be ready and the tribespeople wait they may not sleep until thou art gone  nambok was perplexed but hearkened to the voice of the head man  if thou art nambok opeekwan was saying thou art a fearful and most wonderful liar if thou art the shadow of nambok then thou speakest of shadows concerning which it is not good that living men have knowledge this great village thou hast spoken of we deem the village of shadows therein flutter the souls of the dead for the dead be many and the living few the dead do not come back never have the dead come backsave thou with thy wondertales it is not meet that the dead come back and should we permit it great trouble may be our portion  nambok knew his people well and was aware that the voice of the council was supreme so he allowed himself to be led down to the waters edge where he was put aboard his bidarka and a paddle thrust into his hand a stray wildfowl honked somewhere to seaward and the surf broke limply and hollowly on the sand a dim twilight brooded over land and water and in the north the sun smouldered vague and troubled and draped about with bloodred mists the gulls were flying low the offshore wind blew keen and chill and the blackmassed clouds behind it gave promise of bitter weather  out of the sea thou earnest opeekwan chanted oracularly and back into the sea thou goest thus is balance achieved and all things brought to law  baskwahwan limped to the frothmark and cried i bless thee nambok for that thou remembered me  but koogah shoving nambok clear or the beach tore the shawl from her shoulders and flung it into the bidarka  it is cold in the long nights she wailed and the frost is prone to nip old bones  the thing is a shadow the bonescratcher answered and shadows cannot keep thee warm  nambok stood up that his voice might carry o baskwahwan mother that bore me he called listen to the words of nambok thy son there be room in his bidarka for two and he would that thou earnest with him for his journey is to where there are fish and oil in plenty there the frost comes not and life is easy and the things of iron do the work of men wilt thou come o baskwahwan  she debated a moment while the bidarka drifted swiftly from her then raised her voice to a quavering treble i am old nambok and soon i shall pass down among the shadows but i have no wish to go before my time i am old nambok and i am afraid  a shaft of light shot across the dimlit sea and wrapped boat and man in a splendor of red and gold then a hush fell upon the fisherfolk and only was heard the moan of the offshore wind and the cries of the gulls flying low in the air  illustration     yellow handkerchief   im not wanting to dictate to you lad charley said but im very much against your making a last raid youve gone safely through rough times with rough men and it would be a shame to have something happen to you at the very end  but how can i get out of making a last raid i demanded with the cocksureness of youth there always has to be a last you know to anything  charley crossed his legs leaned back and considered the problem very true but why not call the capture of demetrios contos the last youre back from it safe and sound and hearty for all your good wetting andand his voice broke and he could not speak for a moment and i could never forgive myself if anything happened to you now  i laughed at charleys fears while i gave in to the claims of his affection and agreed to consider the last raid already performed we had been together for two years and now i was leaving the fish patrol in order to go back and finish my education i had earned and saved money to put me through three years at the high school and though the beginning of the term was several months away i intended doing a lot of studying for the entrance examinations  my belongings were packed snugly in a seachest and i was all ready to buy my ticket and ride down on the train to oakland when neil partington arrived in benicia the reindeer was needed immediately for work far down on the lower bay and neil said he intended to run straight for oakland as that was his home and as i was to live with his family while going to school he saw no reason he said why i should not put my chest aboard and come along  so the chest went aboard and in the middle of the afternoon we hoisted the reindeers big mainsail and cast off it was tantalizing fall weather the seabreeze which had blown steadily all summer was gone and in its place were capricious winds and murky skies which made the time of arriving anywhere extremely problematical we started on the first of the ebb and as we slipped down the carquinez straits i looked my last for some time upon benicia and the bight at turners shipyard where we had besieged the lancashire queen and had captured big alec the king of the greeks and at the mouth of the straits i looked with not a little interest upon the spot where a few days before i should have drowned but for the good that was in the nature of demetrios contos  a great wall of fog advanced across san pablo bay to meet us and in a few minutes the reindeer was running blindly through the damp obscurity charley who was steering seemed to have an instinct for that kind of work how he did it he himself confessed that he did not know but he had a way of calculating winds currents distance time drift and sailing speed that was truly marvellous  it looks as though it were lifting neil partington said a couple of hours after we had entered the fog where do you say we are charley  charley looked at his watch six oclock and three hours more of ebb he remarked casually  but where do you say we are neil insisted  charley pondered a moment and then answered the tide has edged us over a bit out of our course but if the fog lifts right now as it is going to lift youll find were not more than a thousand miles off mcnears landing  you might be a little more definite by a few miles anyway neil grumbled showing by his tone that he disagreed  all right then charley said conclusively not less than a quarter of a mile nor more than a half  the wind freshened with a couple of little puffs and the fog thinned perceptibly  mcnears is right off there charley said pointing directly into the fog on our weather beam  the three of us were peering intently in that direction when the reindeer struck with a dull crash and came to a standstill we ran forward and found her bowsprit entangled in the tanned rigging of a short chunky mast she had collided head on with a chinese junk lying at anchor  at the moment we arrived forward five chinese like so many bees came swarming out of the little tweendecks cabin the sleep still in their eyes  leading them came a big muscular man conspicuous for his pockmarked face and the yellow silk handkerchief swathed about his head it was yellow handkerchief the chinaman whom we had arrested for illegal shrimpfishing the year before and who at that time had nearly sunk the reindeer as he had nearly sunk it now by violating the rules of navigation  what dye mean you yellowfaced heathen lying here in a fairway without a horn agoing charley cried hotly  mean neil calmly answered just take a lookthats what he means  our eyes followed the direction indicated by neils finger and we saw the open amidships of the junk half filled as we found on closer examination with freshcaught shrimps mingled with the shrimps were myriads of small fish from a quarter of an inch upward in size yellow handkerchief had lifted the trapnet at highwater slack and taking advantage of the concealment offered by the fog had boldly been lying by waiting to lift the net again at lowwater slack  well neil hummed and hawed in all my varied and extensive experience as a fish patrolman i must say this is the easiest capture i ever made whatll we do with them charley  tow the junk into san rafael of course came the answer charley turned to me you stand by the junk lad and ill pass you a towing line if the wind doesnt fail us well make the creek before the tide gets too low sleep at san rafael and arrive in oakland tomorrow by midday  so saying charley and neil returned to the reindeer and got under way the junk towing astern i went aft and took charge of the prize steering by means of an antiquated tiller and a rudder with large diamondshaped holes through which the water rushed back and forth  by now the last of the fog had vanished and charleys estimate of our position was confirmed by the sight of mcnears landing a short halfmile away following along the west shore we rounded point pedro in plain view of the chinese shrimp villages and a great todo was raised when they saw one of their junks towing behind the familiar fish patrol sloop  the wind coming off the land was rather puffy and uncertain and it would have been more to our advantage had it been stronger san rafael creek up which we had to go to reach the town and turn over our prisoners to the authorities ran through widestretching marshes and was difficult to navigate on a falling tide while at low tide it was impossible to navigate at all so with the tide already halfebbed it was necessary for us to make time this the heavy junk prevented lumbering along behind and holding the reindeer back by just so much dead weight  tell those coolies to get up that sail charley finally called to me we dont want to hang up on the mud flats for the rest of the night  i repeated the order to yellow handkerchief who mumbled it huskily to his men he was suffering from a bad cold which doubled him up in convulsive coughing spells and made his eyes heavy and bloodshot this made him more evillooking than ever and when he glared viciously at me i remembered with a shiver the close shave i had had with him at the time of his previous arrest  his crew sullenly tailed on to the halyards and the strange outlandish sail lateen in rig and dyed a warm brown rose in the air we were sailing on the wind and when yellow handkerchief flattened down the sheet the junk forged ahead and the towline went slack fast as the reindeer could sail the junk outsailed her and to avoid running her down i hauled a little closer on the wind but the junk likewise outpointed and in a couple of minutes i was abreast of the reindeer and to windward the towline had now tautened at right angles to the two boats and the predicament was laughable  cast off i shouted  charley hesitated  its all right i added nothing can happen well make the creek on this tack and youll be right behind me all the way up to san rafael  at this charley cast off and yellow handkerchief sent one of his men forward to haul in the line in the gathering darkness i could just make out the mouth of san rafael creek and by the time we entered it i could barely see its banks the reindeer was fully five minutes astern and we continued to leave her astern as we beat up the narrow winding channel with charley behind us it seemed i had little to fear from my five prisoners but the darkness prevented my keeping a sharp eye on them so i transferred my revolver from my trousers pocket to the side pocket of my coat where i could more quickly put my hand on it  yellow handkerchief was the one i feared and that he knew it and made use of it subsequent events will show he was sitting a few feet away from me on what then happened to be the weather side of the junk i could scarcely see the outlines of his form but i soon became convinced that he was slowly very slowly edging closer to me i watched him carefully steering with my left hand i slipped my right into my pocket and got hold of the revolver  i saw him shift along for a couple of inches and i was just about to order him backthe words were trembling on the tip of my tonguewhen i was struck with great force by a heavy figure that had leaped through the air upon me from the lee side it was one of the crew he pinioned my right arm so that i could not withdraw my hand from my pocket and at the same time clapped his other hand over my mouth of course i could have struggled away from him and freed my hand or gotten my mouth clear so that i might cry an alarm but in a trice yellow handkerchief was on top of me  i struggled around to no purpose in the bottom of the junk while my legs and arms were tied and my mouth securely bound in what i afterward found to be a cotton shirt then i was left lying in the bottom yellow handkerchief took the tiller issuing his orders in whispers and from our position at the time and from the alteration of the sail which i could dimly make out above me as a blot against the stars i knew the junk was being headed into the mouth of a small slough which emptied at that point into san rafael creek  in a couple of minutes we ran softly alongside the bank and the sail was silently lowered the chinese kept very quiet yellow handkerchief sat down in the bottom alongside of me and i could feel him straining to repress his raspy hacking cough possibly seven or eight minutes later i heard charleys voice as the reindeer went past the mouth of the slough  i cant tell you how relieved i am i could plainly hear him saying to neil that the lad has finished with the fish patrol without accident  here neil said something which i could not catch and then charleys voice went on  the youngster takes naturally to the water and if when he finishes high school he takes a course in navigation and goes deep sea i see no reason why he shouldnt rise to be master of the finest and biggest ship afloat  it was all very flattering to me but lying there bound and gagged by my own prisoners with the voices growing faint and fainter as the reindeer slipped on through the darkness toward san rafael i must say i was not in quite the proper situation to enjoy my smiling future with the reindeer went my last hope what was to happen next i could not imagine for the chinese were a different race from mine and from what i knew i was confident that fair play was no part of their makeup  after waiting a few minutes longer the crew hoisted the lateen sail and yellow handkerchief steered down toward the mouth of san rafael creek the tide was getting lower and he had difficulty in escaping the mudbanks i was hoping he would run aground but he succeeded in making the bay without accident  as we passed out of the creek a noisy discussion arose which i knew related to me yellow handkerchief was vehement but the other four as vehemently opposed him it was very evident that he advocated doing away with me and that they were afraid of the consequences i was familiar enough with the chinese character to know that fear alone restrained them but what plan they offered in place of yellow handkerchiefs murderous one i could not make out  my feelings as my fate hung in the balance may be guessed the discussion developed into a quarrel in the midst of which yellow handkerchief unshipped the heavy tiller and sprang toward me but his four companions threw themselves between and a clumsy struggle took place for possession of the tiller in the end yellow handkerchief was overcome and sullenly returned to the steering while they soundly berated him for his rashness  not long after the sail was run down and the junk slowly urged forward by means of the sweeps i felt it ground gently on the soft mud three of the chinesethey all wore long seabootsgot over the side and the other two passed me across the rail with yellow handkerchief at my legs and his two companions at my shoulders they began to flounder along through the mud after some time their feet struck firmer footing and i knew they were carrying me up some beach the location of this beach was not doubtful in my mind it could be none other than one of the marin islands a group of rocky islets which lay off the marin county shore  when they reached the firm sand that marked high tide i was dropped and none too gently yellow handkerchief kicked me spitefully in the ribs and then the trio floundered back through the mud to the junk a moment later i heard the sail go up and slat in the wind as they drew in the sheet then silence fell and i was left to my own devices for getting free  i remembered having seen tricksters writhe and squirm out of ropes with which they were bound but though i writhed and squirmed like a good fellow the knots remained as hard as ever and there was no appreciable slack in the course of my squirming however i rolled over upon a heap of clamshellsthe remains evidently of some yachting partys clambake this gave me an idea my hands were tied behind my back and clutching a shell in them i rolled over and over up the beach till i came to the rocks i knew to be there  rolling around and searching i finally discovered a narrow crevice into which i shoved the shell the edge of it was sharp and across the sharp edge i proceeded to saw the rope that bound my wrists the edge of the shell was also brittle and i broke it by bearing too heavily upon it then i rolled back to the heap and returned with as many shells as i could carry in both hands i broke many shells cut my hands a number of times and got cramps in my legs from my strained position and my exertions  while i was suffering from the cramps and resting i heard a familiar halloo drift across the water it was charley searching for me the gag in my mouth prevented me from replying and i could only lie there helplessly fuming while he rowed past the island and his voice slowly lost itself in the distance  i returned to the sawing process and at the end of half an hour succeeded in severing the rope the rest was easy my hands once free it was a matter of minutes to loosen my legs and to take the gag out of my mouth i ran around the island to make sure it was an island and not by any chance a portion of the mainland an island it certainly was one of the marin group fringed with a sandy beach and surrounded by a sea of mud nothing remained but to wait till daylight and to keep warm for it was a cold raw night for california with just enough wind to pierce the skin and cause one to shiver  to keep up the circulation i ran around the island a dozen times or so and clambered across its rocky backbone as many times moreall of which was of greater service to me as i afterward discovered than merely to warm me up in the midst of this exercise i wondered if i had lost anything out of my pockets while rolling over and over in the sand a search showed the absence of my revolver and pocketknife the first yellow handkerchief had taken but the knife had been lost in the sand  i was hunting for it when the sound of rowlocks came to my ears at first of course i thought of charley but on second thought i knew charley would be calling out as he rowed along a sudden premonition of danger seized me the marin islands are lonely places chance visitors in the dead of night are hardly to be expected what if it were yellow handkerchief the sound made by the rowlocks grew more distinct i crouched in the sand and listened intently the boat which i judged a small skiff from the quick stroke of the oars was landing in the mud about fifty yards up the beach i heard a raspy hacking cough and my heart stood still it was yellow handkerchief not to be robbed of his revenge by his more cautious companions he had stolen away from the village and come back alone  i did some swift thinking i was unarmed and helpless on a tiny islet and a yellow barbarian whom i had reason to fear was coming after me any place was safer than the island and i turned instinctively to the water or rather to the mud as he began to flounder ashore through the mud i started to flounder out into it going over the same course which the chinese had taken in landing me and in returning to the junk  yellow handkerchief believing me to be lying tightly bound exercised no care but came ashore noisily this helped me for under the shield of his noise and making no more myself than necessary i managed to cover fifty feet by the time he had made the beach here i lay down in the mud it was cold and clammy and made me shiver but i did not care to stand up and run the risk of being discovered by his sharp eyes  he walked down the beach straight to where he had left me lying and i had a fleeting feeling of regret at not being able to see his surprise when he did not find me but it was a very fleeting regret for my teeth were chattering with the cold  what his movements were after that i had largely to deduce from the facts of the situation for i could scarcely see him in the dim starlight but i was sure that the first thing he did was to make the circuit of the beach to learn if landings had been made by other boats this he would have known at once by the tracks through the mud  convinced that no boat had removed me from the island he next started to find out what had become of me beginning at the pile of clamshells he lighted matches to trace my tracks in the sand at such times i could see his villainous face plainly and when the sulphur from the matches irritated his lungs between the raspy cough that followed and the clammy mud in which i was lying i confess i shivered harder than ever  the multiplicity of my footprints puzzled him then the idea that i might be out in the mud must have struck him for he waded out a few yards in my direction and stooping with his eyes searched the dim surface long and carefully he could not have been more than fifteen feet from me and had he lighted a match he would surely have discovered me  he returned to the beach and clambered about over the rocky backbone again hunting for me with lighted matches the closeness of the shave impelled me to further flight not daring to wade upright on account of the noise made by floundering and by the suck of the mud i remained lying down in the mud and propelled myself over its surface by means of my hands still keeping the trail made by the chinese in going from and to the junk i held on until i reached the water into this i waded to a depth of three feet and then i turned off to the side on a line parallel with the beach  the thought came to me of going toward yellow handkerchiefs skiff and escaping in it but at that very moment he returned to the beach and as though fearing the very thing i had in mind he slushed out through the mud to assure himself that the skiff was safe this turned me in the opposite direction half swimming half wading with my head just out of water and avoiding splashing i succeeded in putting about a hundred feet between myself and the spot where the chinese had begun to wade ashore from the junk i drew myself out on the mud and remained lying flat  again yellow handkerchief returned to the beach and made a search of the island and again he returned to the heap of clamshells i knew what was running in his mind as well as he did himself no one could leave or land without making tracks in the mud the only tracks to be seen were those leading from his skiff and from where the junk had been i was not on the island i must have left it by one or the other of those two tracks he had just been over the one to his skiff and was certain i had not left that way therefore i could have left the island only by going over the tracks of the junk landing this he proceeded to verify by wading out over them himself lighting matches as he came along  when he arrived at the point where i had first lain i knew by the matches he burned and the time he took that he had discovered the marks left by my body these he followed straight to the water and into it but in three feet of water he could no longer see them on the other hand as the tide was still falling he could easily make out the impression made by the junks bow and could have likewise made out the impression of any other boat if it had landed at that particular spot but there was no such mark and i knew that he was absolutely convinced that i was hiding somewhere in the mud  but to hunt on a dark night for a boy in a sea of mud would be like hunting for a needle in a haystack and he did not attempt it instead he went back to the beach and prowled around for some time i was hoping he would give me up and go for by this time i was suffering severely from the cold at last he waded out to his skiff and rowed away what if this departure of yellow handkerchiefs were a sham what if he had done it merely to entice me ashore  the more i thought of it the more certain i became that he had made a little too much noise with his oars as he rowed away so i remained lying in the mud and shivering i shivered till the muscles of the small of my back ached and pained me as badly as the cold and i had need of all my selfcontrol to force myself to remain in my miserable situation  it was well that i did however for possibly an hour later i thought i could make out something moving on the beach i watched intently but my ears were rewarded first by a raspy cough i knew only too well yellow handkerchief had sneaked back landed on the other side of the island and crept around to surprise me if i had returned  after that though hours passed without sign of him i was afraid to return to the island at all on the other hand i was almost equally afraid that i should die of the exposure i was undergoing i had never dreamed one could suffer so i grew so cold and numb finally that i ceased to shiver but my muscles and bones began to ache in a way that was agony the tide had long since begun to rise and foot by foot it drove me in toward the beach high water came at three oclock and at three oclock i drew myself up on the beach more dead than alive and too helpless to have offered any resistance had yellow handkerchief swooped down upon me  but no yellow handkerchief appeared he had given me up and gone back to point pedro nevertheless i was in a deplorable not to say a dangerous condition i could not stand upon my feet much less walk my clammy muddy garments clung to me like sheets of ice i thought i should never get them off so numb and lifeless were my fingers and so weak was i that it seemed to take an hour to get off my shoes i had not the strength to break the porpoisehide laces and the knots defied me i repeatedly beat my hands upon the rocks to get some sort of life into them sometimes i felt sure i was going to die  but in the endafter several centuries it seemed to mei got off the last of my clothes the water was now close at hand and i crawled painfully into it and washed the mud from my naked body still i could not get on my feet and walk and i was afraid to lie still nothing remained but to crawl weakly like a snail and at the cost of constant pain up and down the sand i kept this up as long as possible but as the east paled with the coming of dawn i began to succumb the sky grew rosyred and the golden rim of the sun showing above the horizon found me lying helpless and motionless among the clamshells  as in a dream i saw the familiar mainsail of the reindeer as she slipped out of san rafael creek on a light puff of morning air this dream was very much broken there are intervals i can never recollect on looking back over it three things however i distinctly remember the first sight of the reindeers mainsail her lying at anchor a few hundred feet away and a small boat leaving her side and the cabin stove roaring redhot myself swathed all over with blankets except on the chest and shoulders which charley was pounding and mauling unmercifully and my mouth and throat burning with the coffee which neil partington was pouring down a trifle too hot  but burn or no burn i tell you it felt good by the time we arrived in oakland i was as limber and strong as everthough charley and neil partington were afraid i was going to have pneumonia and mrs partington for my first six months of school kept an anxious eye upon me to discover the first symptoms of consumption  time flies it seems but yesterday that i was a lad of sixteen on the fish patrol yet i know that i arrived this very morning from china with a quick passage to my credit and master of the barkentine harvester and i know that tomorrow morning i shall run over to oakland to see neil partington and his wife and family and later on up to benicia to see charley le grant and talk over old times no i shall not go to benicia now that i think about it i expect to be a highly interested party to a wedding shortly to take place her name is alice partington and since charley has promised to be best man he will have to come down to oakland instead  illustration     make westing  whatever you do make westing make westing sailing directions for cape horn   for seven weeks the mary rogers had been between 50° south in the atlantic and 50° south in the pacific which meant that for seven weeks she had been struggling to round cape horn for seven weeks she had been either in dirt or close to dirt save once and then following upon six days of excessive dirt which she had ridden out under the shelter of the redoubtable terra del fuego coast she had almost gone ashore during a heavy swell in the dead calm that had suddenly fallen for seven weeks she had wrestled with the cape horn graybeards and in return been buffeted and smashed by them she was a wooden ship and her ceaseless straining had opened her seams so that twice a day the watch took its turn at the pumps  the mary rogers was strained the crew was strained and big dan cullen master was likewise strained perhaps he was strained most of all for upon him rested the responsibility of that titanic struggle he slept most of the time in his clothes though he rarely slept he haunted the deck at night a great burly robust ghost black with the sunburn of thirty years of sea and hairy as an orangutan he in turn was haunted by one thought of action a sailing direction for the horn whatever you do make westing make westing it was an obsession he thought of nothing else except at times to blaspheme god for sending such bitter weather  make westing he hugged the horn and a dozen times lay hove to with the iron cape bearing eastbynorth or northnortheast a score of miles away and each time the eternal west wind smote him back and he made easting he fought gale after gale south to 64° inside the antarctic driftice and pledged his immortal soul to the powers of darkness for a bit of westing for a slant to take him around and he made easting in despair he had tried to make the passage through the straits of le maire halfway through the wind hauled to the north ard of northwest the glass dropped to 2888 and he turned and ran before a gale of cyclonic fury missing by a hairs breadth piling up the mary rogers on the blacktoothed rocks twice he had made west to the diego ramirez rocks one of the times saved between two snowsqualls by sighting the gravestones of ships a quarter of a mile dead ahead  blow captain dan cullen instanced all his thirty years at sea to prove that never had it blown so before the mary rogers was hove to at the time he gave the evidence and to clinch it inside half an hour the mary rogers was hove down to the hatches her new maintopsail and brand new spencer were blown away like tissue paper and five sails furled and fast under double gaskets were blown loose and stripped from the yards and before morning the mary rogers was hove down twice again and holes were knocked in her bulwarks to ease her decks from the weight of ocean that pressed her down  on an average of once a week captain dan cullen caught glimpses of the sun once for ten minutes the sun shone at midday and ten minutes afterward a new gale was piping up both watches were shortening sail and all was buried in the obscurity of a driving snowsquall for a fortnight once captain dan cullen was without a meridian or a chronometer sight rarely did he know his position within half a degree except when in sight of land for sun and stars remained hidden behind the sky and it was so gloomy that even at the best the horizons were poor for accurate observations a gray gloom shrouded the world the clouds were gray the great driving seas were leaden gray gloom shrouded the world the clouds were gray the great driving seas were leadening even the occasional albatrosses were gray while the snowflurries were not white but gray under the sombre pall of the heavens  life on board the mary rogers was graygray and gloomy the faces of the sailors were bluegray they were afflicted with seacuts and seaboils and suffered exquisitely they were shadows of men for seven weeks in the forecastle or on deck they had not known what it was to be dry they had forgotten what it was to sleep out a watch and all watches it was all hands on deck they caught snatches of agonized sleep and they slept in their oilskins ready for the everlasting call so weak and worn were they that it took both watches to do the work of one that was why both watches were on deck so much of the time and no shadow of a man could shirk duty nothing less than a broken leg could enable a man to knock off work and there were two such who had been mauled and pulped by the seas that broke aboard  one other man who was the shadow of a man was george dorety he was the only passenger on board a friend of the firm and he had elected to make the voyage for his health but seven weeks of cape horn had not bettered his health he gasped and panted in his bunk through the long heaving nights and when on deck he was so bundled up for warmth that he resembled a peripatetic oldclothes shop at midday eating at the cabin table in a gloom so deep that the swinging sealamps burned always he looked as bluegray as the sickest saddest man forard nor did gazing across the table at captain dan cullen have any cheering effect upon him captain cullen chewed and scowled and kept silent the scowls were for god and with every chew he reiterated the sole thought of his existence which was make westing he was a big hairy brute and the sight of him was not stimulating to the others appetite he looked upon george dorety as a jonah and told him so once each meal savagely transferring the scowl from god to the passenger and back again  nor did the mate prove a first aid to a languid appetite joshua higgins by name a seaman by profession and pull but a potwolloper by capacity he was a loosejointed sniffling creature heartless and selfish and cowardly without a soul in fear of his life of dan cullen and a bully over the sailors who knew that behind the mate was captain cullen the lawgiver and compeller the driver and the destroyer the incarnation of a dozen bucko mates in that wild weather at the southern end of the earth joshua higgins ceased washing his grimy face usually robbed george dorety of what little appetite he managed to accumulate ordinarily this lavatorial dereliction would have caught captain cullens eye and vocabulary but in the present his mind was filled with making westing to the exclusion of all other things not contributory thereto whether the mates face was clean or dirty had no bearing upon westing later on when 50° south in the pacific had been reached joshua higgins would wash his face very abruptly in the meantime at the cabin table where gray twilight alternated with lamplight while the lamps were being filled george dorety sat between the two men one a tiger and the other a hyena and wondered why god had made them the second mate matthew turner was a true sailor and a man but george dorety did not have the solace of his company for he ate by himself solitary when they had finished  on saturday morning july 24 george dorety awoke to a feeling of life and headlong movement on deck he found the mary rogers running off before a howling southeaster nothing was set but the lower topsails and the foresail it was all she could stand yet she was making fourteen knots as mr turner shouted in doretys ear when he came on deck and it was all westing she was going around the horn at last  if the wind held mr turner looked happy the end of the struggle was in sight but captain cullen did not look happy he scowled at dorety in passing captain cullen did not want god to know that he was pleased with that wind he had a conception of a malicious god and believed in his secret soul that if god knew it was a desirable wind god would promptly efface it and send a snorter from the west so he walked softly before god smothering his joy down under scowls and muttered curses and so fooling god for god was the only thing in the universe of which dan cullen was afraid  all saturday and saturday night the mary rogers raced her westing persistently she logged her fourteen knots so that by sunday morning she had covered three hundred and fifty miles if the wind held she would make around if it failed and the snorter came from anywhere between southwest and north back the mary rogers would be hurled and be no better off than she had been seven weeks before and on sunday morning the wind was failing the big sea was going down and running smooth both watches were on deck setting sail after sail as fast as the ship could stand it and now captain cullen went around brazenly before god smoking a big cigar smiling jubilantly as if the failing wind delighted him while down underneath he was raging against god for taking the life out of the blessed wind make westing so he would if god would only leave him alone secretly he pledged himself anew to the powers of darkness if they would let him make westing he pledged himself so easily because he did not believe in the powers of darkness he really believed only in god though he did not know it and in his inverted theology god was really the prince of darkness captain cullen was a devilworshipper but he called the devil by another name that was all  at midday after calling eight bells captain cullen ordered the royals on the men went aloft faster than they had gone in weeks not alone were they nimble because of the westing but a benignant sun was shining down and limbering their stiff bodies george dorety stood aft near captain cullen less bundled in clothes than usual soaking in the grateful warmth as he watched the scene swiftly and abruptly the incident occurred there was a cry from the foreroyalyard of man overboard somebody threw a life buoy over the side and at the same instant the second mates voice came aft ringing and peremptory  hard down your helm  the man at the wheel never moved a spoke he knew better for captain dan cullen was standing alongside of him he wanted to move a spoke to move all the spokes to grind the wheel down hard down for his comrade drowning in the sea he glanced at captain dan cullen and captain dan cullen gave no sign  down hard down the second mate roared as he sprang aft  but he ceased springing and commanding and stood still when he saw dan cullen by the wheel and big dan cullen puffed at his cigar and said nothing astern and going astern fast could be seen the sailor he had caught the life buoy and was clinging to it nobody spoke nobody moved the men aloft clung to the royal yards and watched with terror stricken faces and the mary rogers raced on making her westing a long silent minute passed  who was it captain cullen demanded  mops sir eagerly answered the sailor at the wheel  mops topped a wave astern and disappeared temporarily in the trough it was a large wave but it was no graybeard a small boat could live easily in such a sea and in such a sea the mary rogers could easily come to but she could not come to and make westing at the same time  for the first time in all his years george dorety was seeing a real drama of life and deatha sordid little drama in which the scales balanced an unknown sailor named mops against a few miles of longitude at first he had watched the man astern but now he watched big dan cullen hairy and black vested with power of life and death smoking a cigar  captain dan cullen smoked another long silent minute then he removed the cigar from his mouth he glanced aloft at the spars of the mary rogers and overside at the sea  sheet home the royals he cried  fifteen minutes later they sat at table in the cabin with food served before them on one side of george dorety sat dan cullen the tiger on the other side joshua higgins the hyena nobody spoke on deck the men were sheeting home the skysails george dorety could hear their cries while a persistent vision haunted him of a man called mops alive and well clinging to a life buoy miles astern in that lonely ocean he glanced at captain cullen and experienced a feeling of nausea for the man was eating his food with relish almost bolting it  captain cullen dorety said you are in command of this ship and it is not proper for me to comment now upon what you do but i wish to say one thing there is a hereafter and yours will be a hot one  captain cullen did not even scowl in his voice was regret as he saidit was blowing a living gale it was impossible to save the man  he fell from the royalyard dorety cried hotly you were setting the royals at the time fifteen minutes afterward you were setting the skysails  it was a living gale wasnt it mr higgins captain cullen said turning to the mate  if youd brought her to itd have taken the sticks out of her was the mates answer you did the proper thing captain cullen the man hadnt a ghost of a show  george dorety made no answer and to the meals end no one spoke after that dorety had his meals served in his stateroom captain cullen scowled at him no longer though no speech was exchanged between them while the mary rogers sped north toward warmer latitudes at the end of the week dan cullen cornered dorety on deck  what are you going to do when we get to frisco he demanded bluntly  i am going to swear out a warrant for your arrest dorety answered quietly i am going to charge you with murder and i am going to see you hanged for it  youre almighty sure of yourself captain cullen sneered turning on his heel  a second week passed and one morning found george dorety standing in the coachhouse companionway at the forard end of the long poop taking his first gaze around the deck the mary rogers was reaching fullandby in a stiff breeze every sail was set and drawing including the staysails captain cullen strolled forard along the poop he strolled carelessly glancing at the passenger out of the corner of his eye dorety was looking the other way standing with head and shoulders outside the companionway and only the back of his head was to be seen captain cullen with swift eye embraced the mainstaysailblock and the head and estimated the distance he glanced about him nobody was looking aft joshua higgins pacing up and down had just turned his back and was going the other way captain cullen bent over suddenly and cast the staysailsheet off from its pin the heavy block hurtled through the air smashing doretys head like an eggshell and hurtling on and back and forth as the staysail whipped and slatted in the wind joshua higgins turned around to see what had carried away and met the full blast of the vilest portion of captain cullens profanity  i made the sheet fast myself whimpered the mate in the first lull with an extra turn to make sure i remember it distinctly  made fast the captain snarled back for the benefit of the watch as it struggled to capture the flying sail before it tore to ribbons you couldnt make your grandmother fast you useless scullion if you made that sheet fast with an extra turn why didnt it stay fast thats what i want to know why didnt it stay fast  the mate whined inarticulately  oh shut up was the final word of captain cullen  half an hour later he was as surprised as any when the body of george dorety was found inside the companionway on the floor in the afternoon alone in his room he doctored up the log  ordinary seaman karl brun he wrote lost overboard from foreroyalyard in a gale of wind was running at the time and for the safety of the ship did not dare come up to the wind nor could a boat have lived in the sea that was running  on another page he wrote  had often warned mr dorety about the danger he ran because of his carelessness on deck i told him once that some day he would get his head knocked off by a block a carelessly fastened mainstaysail sheet was the cause of the accident which was deeply to be regretted because mr dorety was a favorite with all of us  captain dan cullen read over his literary effort with admiration blotted the page and closed the log he lighted a cigar and stared before him he felt the mary rogers lift and heel and surge along and knew that she was making nine knots a smile of satisfaction slowly dawned on his black and hairy face well anyway he had made his westing and fooled god  illustration     the heathen   i met him first in a hurricane and though we had gone through the hurricane on the same schooner it was not until the schooner had gone to pieces under us that i first laid eyes on him without doubt i had seen him with the rest of the kanaka crew on board but i had not consciously been aware of his existence for the petite jeanne was rather overcrowded in addition to her eight or ten kanaka seamen her white captain mate and supercargo and her six cabin passengers she sailed from rangiroa with something like eightyfive deck passengerspaumotans and tahitians men women and children each with a trade box to say nothing of sleepingmats blankets and clothesbundles  the pearling season in the paumotus was over and all hands were returning to tahiti the six of us cabin passengers were pearlbuyers two were americans one was ah choon the whitest chinese i have ever known one was a german one was a polish jew and i completed the half dozen  it had been a prosperous season not one of us had cause for complaint nor one of the eightyfive deck passengers either all had done well and all were looking forward to a restoff and a good time in papeete  of course the petite jeanne was overloaded she was only seventy tons and she had no right to carry a tithe of the mob she had on board beneath her hatches she was crammed and jammed with pearlshell and copra even the trade room was packed full of shell it was a miracle that the sailors could work her there was no moving about the decks they simply climbed back and forth along the rails  in the nighttime they walked upon the sleepers who carpeted the deck ill swear two deep oh and there were pigs and chickens on deck and sacks of yams while every conceivable place was festooned with strings of drinking cocoanuts and bunches of bananas on both sides between the fore and main shrouds guys had been stretched just low enough for the foreboom to swing clear and from each of these guys at least fifty bunches of bananas were suspended  it promised to be a messy passage even if we did make it in the two or three days that would have been required if the southeast trades had been blowing fresh but they werent blowing fresh after the first five hours the trade died away in a dozen or so gasping fans the calm continued all that night and the next dayone of those glaring glassy calms when the very thought of opening ones eyes to look at it is sufficient to cause a headache  the second day a man diedan easter islander one of the best divers that season in the lagoon smallpoxthat is what it was though how smallpox could come on board when there had been no known cases ashore when we left rangiroa is beyond me there it was thoughsmallpox a man dead and three others down on their backs  there was nothing to be done we could not segregate the sick nor could we care for them we were packed like sardines there was nothing to do but rot or diethat is there was nothing to do after the night that followed the first death on that night the mate the supercargo the polish jew and four native divers sneaked away in the large whaleboat they were never heard of again in the morning the captain promptly scuttled the remaining boats and there we were  that day there were two deaths the following day three then it jumped to eight it was curious to see how we took it the natives for instance fell into a condition of dumb stolid fear the captainoudouse his name was a frenchmanbecame very nervous and voluble he actually got the twitches he was a large fleshy man weighing at least two hundred pounds and he quickly became a faithful representation of a quivering jellymountain of fat  the german the two americans and myself bought up all the scotch whiskey and proceeded to stay drunk the theory was beautifulnamely if we kept ourselves soaked in alcohol every smallpox germ that came into contact with us would immediately be scorched to a cinder and the theory worked though i must confess that neither captain oudouse nor ah choon were attacked by the disease either the frenchman did not drink at all while ah choon restricted himself to one drink daily  it was a pretty time the sun going into northern declination was straight overhead there was no wind except for frequent squalls which blew fiercely for from five minutes to half an hour and wound up by deluging us with rain after each squall the awful sun would come out drawing clouds of steam from the soaked decks  the steam was not nice it was the vapor of death freighted with millions and millions of germs we always took another drink when we saw it going up from the dead and dying and usually we took two or three more drinks mixing them exceptionally stiff also we made it a rule to take an additional several each time they hove the dead over to the sharks that swarmed about us  we had a week of it and then the whiskey gave out it is just as well or i shouldnt be alive now it took a sober man to pull through what followed as you will see when i mention the little fact that only two men did pull through the other man was the heathenat least that was what i heard captain oudouse call him at the moment i first became aware of the heathens existence but to come back  it was at the end of the week with the whiskey gone and the pearlbuyers sober that i happened to glance at the barometer that hung in the cabin companionway its normal register in the paumotus was 2990 and it was quite customary to see it vacillate between 2985 and 3000 or even 3005 but to see it as i saw it down to 2962 was sufficient to sober the most drunken pearlbuyer that ever incinerated smallpox microbes in scotch whiskey  i called captain oudouses attention to it only to be informed that he had watched it going down for several hours there was little to do but that little he did very well considering the circumstances he took off the light sails shortened right down to storm canvas spread lifelines and waited for the wind his mistake lay in what he did after the wind came he hove to on the port tack which was the right thing to do south of the equator ifand there was the rubif one were not in the direct path of the hurricane  we were in the direct path i could see that by the steady increase of the wind and the equally steady fall of the barometer i wanted him to turn and run with the wind on the port quarter until the barometer ceased falling and then to heave to we argued till he was reduced to hysteria but budge he would not the worst of it was that i could not get the rest of the pearlbuyers to back me up who was i anyway to know more about the sea and its ways than a properly qualified captain was what was in their minds i knew  of course the sea rose with the wind frightfully and i shall never forget the first three seas the petite jeanne shipped she had fallen off as vessels do at times when hove to and the first sea made a clean breach the lifelines were only for the strong and well and little good were they even for them when the women and children the bananas and cocoanuts the pigs and trade boxes the sick and the dying were swept along in a solid screeching groaning mass  the second sea filled the petite jeannes decks flush with the rails and as her stern sank down and her bow tossed skyward all the miserable dunnage of life and luggage poured aft it was a human torrent they came headfirst feetfirst sidewise rolling over and over twisting squirming writhing and crumpling up now and again one caught a grip on a stanchion or a rope but the weight of the bodies behind tore such grips loose  one man i noticed fetch up head on and square on with the starboardbitt his head cracked like an egg i saw what was coming sprang on top of the cabin and from there into the mainsail itself ah choon and one of the americans tried to follow me but i was one jump ahead of them the american was swept away and over the stern like a piece of chaff ah choon caught a spoke of the wheel and swung in behind it but a strapping raratonga vahine womanshe must have weighed two hundred and fiftybrought up against him and got an arm around his neck he clutched the kanaka steersman with his other hand and just at that moment the schooner flung down to starboard  the rush of bodies and sea that was coming along the port runway between the cabin and the rail turned abruptly and poured to starboard away they wentvahine ah choon and steersman and i swear i saw ah choon grin at me with philosophic resignation as he cleared the rail and went under  the third seathe biggest of the threedid not do so much damage by the time it arrived nearly everybody was in the rigging on deck perhaps a dozen gasping halfdrowned and halfstunned wretches were rolling about or attempting to crawl into safety they went by the board as did the wreckage of the two remaining boats the other pearlbuyers and myself between seas managed to get about fifteen women and children into the cabin and battened down little good it did the poor creatures in the end  wind out of all my experience i could not have believed it possible for the wind to blow as it did there is no describing it how can one describe a nightmare it was the same way with that wind it tore the clothes off our bodies i say tore them off and i mean it i am not asking you to believe it i am merely telling something that i saw and felt there are times when i do not believe it myself i went through it and that is enough one could not face that wind and live it was a monstrous thing and the most monstrous thing about it was that it increased and continued to increase  imagine countless millions and billions of tons of sand imagine this sand tearing along at ninety a hundred a hundred and twenty or any other number of miles per hour imagine further this sand to be invisible impalpable yet to retain all the weight and density of sand do all this and you may get a vague inkling of what that wind was like  perhaps sand is not the right comparison consider it mud invisible impalpable but heavy as mud nay it goes beyond that consider every molecule of air to be a mudbank in itself then try to imagine the multitudinous impact of mudbanks no it is beyond me language may be adequate to express the ordinary conditions of life but it cannot possibly express any of the conditions of so enormous a blast of wind it would have been better had i stuck by my original intention of not attempting a description  i will say this much the sea which had risen at first was beaten down by that wind more it seemed as if the whole ocean had been sucked up in the maw of the hurricane and hurled on through that portion of space which previously had been occupied by the air  of course our canvas had gone long before but captain oudouse had on the petite jeanne something i had never before seen on a south sea schoonera seaanchor it was a conical canvas bag the mouth of which was kept open by a huge hoop of iron the seaanchor was bridled something like a kite so that it bit into the water as a kite bites into the air but with a difference the seaanchor remained just under the surface of the ocean in a perpendicular position a long line in turn connected it with the schooner as a result the petite jeanne rode bow on to the wind and to what sea there was  the situation really would have been favorable had we not been in the path of the storm true the wind itself tore our canvas out of the gaskets jerked out our topmasts and made a raffle of our runninggear but still we would have come through nicely had we not been square in front of the advancing stormcentre that was what fixed us i was in a state of stunned numbed paralyzed collapse from enduring the impact of the wind and i think i was just about ready to give up and die when the centre smote us the blow we received was an absolute lull there was not a breath of air the effect on one was sickening  remember that for hours we had been at terrific muscular tension withstanding the awful pressure of that wind and then suddenly the pressure was removed i know that i felt as though i was about to expand to fly apart in all directions it seemed as if every atom composing my body was repelling every other atom and was on the verge of rushing off irresistibly into space but that lasted only for a moment destruction was upon us  in the absence of the wind and pressure the sea rose it jumped it leaped it soared straight toward the clouds remember from every point of the compass that inconceivable wind was blowing in toward the centre of calm the result was that the seas sprang up from every point of the compass there was no wind to check them they popped up like corks released from the bottom of a pail of water there was no system to them no stability they were hollow maniacal seas they were eighty feet high at the least they were not seas at all they resembled no sea a man had ever seen  they were splashes monstrous splashesthat is all splashes that were eighty feet high eighty they were more than eighty they went over our mastheads they were spouts explosions they were drunken they fell anywhere anyhow they jostled one another they collided they rushed together and collapsed upon one another or fell apart like a thousand waterfalls all at once it was no ocean any man had ever dreamed of that hurricane centre it was confusion thrice confounded it was anarchy it was a hellpit of seawater gone mad  the petite jeanne i dont know the heathen told me afterward that he did not know she was literally torn apart ripped wide open beaten into a pulp smashed into kindling wood annihilated when i came to i was in the water swimming automatically though i was about twothirds drowned how i got there i had no recollection i remembered seeing the petite jeanne fly to pieces at what must have been the instant that my own consciousness was buffetted out of me but there i was with nothing to do but make the best of it and in that best there was little promise the wind was blowing again the sea was much smaller and more regular and i knew that i had passed through the centre fortunately there were no sharks about the hurricane had dissipated the ravenous horde that had surrounded the death ship and fed off the dead  it was about midday when the petite jeanne went to pieces and it must have been two hours afterward when i picked up with one of her hatchcovers thick rain was driving at the time and it was the merest chance that flung me and the hatchcover together a short length of line was trailing from the rope handle and i knew that i was good for a day at least if the sharks did not return three hours later possibly a little longer sticking close to the cover and with closed eyes concentrating my whole soul upon the task of breathing in enough air to keep me going and at the same time of avoiding breathing in enough water to drown me it seemed to me that i heard voices the rain had ceased and wind and sea were easing marvellously not twenty feet away from me on another hatchcover were captain oudouse and the heathen they were fighting over the possession of the coverat least the frenchman was  paien noir i heard him scream and at the same time i saw him kick the kanaka  now captain oudouse had lost all his clothes except his shoes and they were heavy brogans it was a cruel blow for it caught the heathen on the mouth and the point of the chin half stunning him i looked for him to retaliate but he contented himself with swimming about forlornly a safe ten feet away whenever a fling of the sea threw him closer the frenchman hanging on with his hands kicked out at him with both feet also at the moment of delivering each kick he called the kanaka a black heathen  for two centimes id come over there and drown you you white beast i yelled  the only reason i did not go was that i felt too tired the very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating so i called to the kanaka to come to me and proceeded to share the hatchcover with him otoo he told me his name was pronounced otoo also he told me that he was a native of bora bora the most westerly of the society group as i learned afterward he had got the hatchcover first and after some time encountering captain oudouse had offered to share it with him and had been kicked off for his pains  and that was how otoo and i first came together he was no fighter he was all sweetness and gentleness a lovecreature though he stood nearly six feet tall and was muscled like a gladiator he was no fighter but he was also no coward he had the heart of a lion and in the years that followed i have seen him run risks that i would never dream of taking what i mean is that while he was no fighter and while he always avoided precipitating a row he never ran away from trouble when it started and it was ware shoal when once otoo went into action i shall never forget what he did to bill king it occurred in german samoa bill king was hailed the champion heavyweight of the american navy he was a big brute of a man a veritable gorilla one of those hardhitting roughhousing chaps and clever with his fists as well he picked the quarrel and he kicked otoo twice and struck him once before otoo felt it to be necessary to fight i dont think it lasted four minutes at the end of which time bill king was the unhappy possessor of four broken ribs a broken forearm and a dislocated shoulderblade otoo knew nothing of scientific boxing he was merely a manhandler and bill king was something like three months in recovering from the bit of manhandling he received that afternoon on apia beach  but i am running ahead of my yarn we shared the hatchcover between us we took turn and turn about one lying flat on the cover and resting while the other submerged to the neck merely held on with his hands for two days and nights spell and spell on the cover and in the water we drifted over the ocean toward the last i was delirious most of the time and there were times too when i heard otoo babbling and raving in his native tongue our continuous immersion prevented us from dying of thirst though the seawater and the sunshine gave us the prettiest imaginable combination of salt pickle and sunburn  in the end otoo saved my life for i came to lying on the beach twenty feet from the water sheltered from the sun by a couple of cocoanut leaves no one but otoo could have dragged me there and stuck up the leaves for shade he was lying beside me i went off again and the next time i came round it was cool and starry night and otoo was pressing a drinking cocoanut to my lips  we were the sole survivors of the petite jeanne captain oudouse must have succumbed to exhaustion for several days later his hatchcover drifted ashore without him otoo and i lived with the natives of the atoll for a week when we were rescued by a french cruiser and taken to tahiti in the meantime however we had performed the ceremony of exchanging names in the south seas such a ceremony binds two men closer together than bloodbrothership the initiative had been mine and otoo was rapturously delighted when i suggested it  it is well he said in tahitian for we have been mates together for two days on the lips of death  but death stuttered i smiled  it was a brave deed you did master he replied and death was not vile enough to speak  why do you master me i demanded with a show of hurt feelings we have exchanged names to you i am otoo to me you are charley and between you and me forever and forever you shall be charley and i shall be otoo it is the way of the custom and when we die if it does happen that we live again somewhere beyond the stars and the sky still shall you be charley to me and i otoo to you  yes master he answered his eyes luminous and soft with joy  there you go i cried indignantly  what does it matter what my lips utter he argued they are only my lips but i shall think otoo always whenever i think of myself i shall think of you whenever men call me by name i shall think of you and beyond the sky and beyond the stars always and forever you shall be otoo to me is it well master  i hid my smile and answered that it was well  we parted at papeete i remained ashore to recuperate and he went on in a cutter to his own island bora bora six weeks later he was back i was surprised for he had told me of his wife and said that he was returning to her and would give over sailing on far voyages  where do you go master he asked after our first greetings  i shrugged my shoulders it was a hard question  all the world was my answerall the world all the sea and all the islands that are in the sea  i will go with you he said simply my wife is dead  i never had a brother but from what i have seen of other mens brothers i doubt if any man ever had a brother that was to him what otoo was to me he was brother and father and mother as well and this i know i lived a straighter and better man because of otoo i cared little for other men but i had to live straight in otoos eyes because of him i dared not tarnish myself he made me his ideal compounding me i fear chiefly out of his own love and worship and there were times when i stood close to the steep pitch of hades and would have taken the plunge had not the thought of otoo restrained me his pride in me entered into me until it became one of the major rules in my personal code to do nothing that would diminish that pride of his  naturally i did not learn right away what his feelings were toward me he never criticised never censured and slowly the exalted place i held in his eyes dawned upon me and slowly i grew to comprehend the hurt i could inflict upon him by being anything less than my best  for seventeen years we were together for seventeen years he was at my shoulder watching while i slept nursing me through fever and woundsay and receiving wounds in fighting for me he signed on the same ships with me and together we ranged the pacific from hawaii to sydney head and from torres straits to the galapagos we blackbirded from the new hebrides and the line islands over to the westward clear through the louisades new britain new ireland and new hanover we were wrecked three timesin the gilberts in the santa cruz group and in the fijis and we traded and salved wherever a dollar promised in the way of pearl and pearlshell copra bechedemer hawkbill turtleshell and stranded wrecks  it began in papeete immediately after his announcement that he was going with me over all the sea and the islands in the midst thereof there was a club in those days in papeete where the pearlers traders captains and riffraff of south sea adventurers foregathered the play ran high and the drink ran high and i am very much afraid that i kept later hours than were becoming or proper no matter what the hour was when i left the club there was otoo waiting to see me safely home  at first i smiled next i chided him then i told him flatly that i stood in need of no wetnursing after that i did not see him when i came out of the club quite by accident a week or so later i discovered that he still saw me home lurking across the street among the shadows of the mangotrees what could i do i know what i did do  insensibly i began to keep better hours on wet and stormy nights in the thick of the folly and the fun the thought would persist in coming to me of otoo keeping his dreary vigil under the dripping mangoes truly he had made a better man of me yet he was not straitlaced and he knew nothing of common christian morality all the people on bora bora were christians but he was a heathen the only unbeliever on the island a gross materialist who believed that when he died he was dead he believed merely in fair play and square dealing petty meanness in his code was almost as serious as wanton homicide and i do believe that he respected a murderer more than a man given to small practices  otoo had my welfare always at heart he thought ahead for me weighed my plans and took a greater interest in them than i did myself at first when i was unaware of this interest of his in my affairs he had to divine my intentions as for instance at papeete when i contemplated going partners with a knavish fellowcountryman on a guano venture i did not know he was a knave nor did any white man in papeete neither did otoo know but he saw how thick we were getting and found out for me and without my asking him native sailors from the ends of the seas knock about on the beach in tahiti and otoo suspicious merely went among them till he had gathered sufficient data to justify his suspicions oh it was a nice history that of randolph waters i couldnt believe it when otoo first narrated it but when i sheeted it home to waters he gave in without a murmur and got away on the first steamer to aukland  at first i am free to confess i couldnt help resenting otoos poking his nose into my business but i knew that he was wholly unselfish and soon i had to acknowledge his wisdom and discretion he had his eyes open always to my main chance and he was both keensighted and farsighted in time he became my counsellor until he knew more of my business than i did myself he really had my interest at heart more than i did mine was the magnificent carelessness of youth for i preferred romance to dollars and adventure to a comfortable billet with all night in so it was well that i had some one to look out for me i know that if it had not been for otoo i should not be here today  of numerous instances let me give one i had had some experience in blackbirding before i went pearling in the paumotus otoo and i were in samoawe really were on the beach and hard agroundwhen my chance came to go as recruiter on a blackbird brig otoo signed on before the mast and for the next halfdozen years in as many ships we knocked about the wildest portions of melanesia otoo saw to it that he always pulled strokeoar in my boat our custom in recruiting labor was to land the recruiter on the beach the covering boat always lay on its oars several hundred feet off shore while the recruiters boat also lying on its oars kept afloat on the edge of the beach when i landed with my tradegoods leaving my steering sweep apeak otoo left his stroke position and came into the sternsheets where a winchester lay ready to hand under a flap of canvas the boats crew was also armed the sniders concealed under canvas flaps that ran the length of the gunwales while i was busy arguing and persuading the woollyheaded cannibals to come and labor on the queensland plantations otoo kept watch and often and often his low voice warned me of suspicious actions and impending treachery sometimes it was the quick shot from his rifle knocking a savage over that was the first warning i received and in my rush to the boat his hand was always there to jerk me flying aboard once i remember on santa anna the boat grounded just as the trouble began the covering boat was dashing to our assistance but the several score of savages would have wiped us out before it arrived otoo took a flying leap ashore dug both hands into the tradegoods and scattered tobacco beads tomahawks knives and calicoes in all directions  this was too much for the woollyheads while they scrambled for the treasures the boat was shoved clear and we were aboard and forty feet away and i got thirty recruits off that very beach in the next four hours  the particular instance i have in mind was on malaita the most savage island in the easterly solomons the natives had been remarkably friendly and how were we to know that the whole village had been taking up a collection for over two years with which to buy a white mans head the beggars are all headhunters and they especially esteem a white mans head the fellow who captured the head would receive the whole collection as i say they appeared very friendly and on this day i was fully a hundred yards down the beach from the boat otoo had cautioned me and as usual when i did not heed him i came to grief  the first i knew a cloud of spears sailed out of the mangrove swamp at me at least a dozen were sticking into me i started to run but tripped over one that was fast in my calf and went down the woollyheads made a run for me each with a longhandled fantail tomahawk with which to hack off my head they were so eager for the prize that they got in one anothers way in the confusion i avoided several hacks by throwing myself right and left on the sand  then otoo arrivedotoo the manhandler in some way he had got hold of a heavy war club and at close quarters it was a far more efficient weapon than a rifle he was right in the thick of them so that they could not spear him while their tomahawks seemed worse than useless he was fighting for me and he was in a true berserker rage the way he handled that club was amazing their skulls squashed like overripe oranges it was not until he had driven them back picked me up in his arms and started to run that he received his first wounds he arrived in the boat with four spear thrusts got his winchester and with it got a man for every shot then we pulled aboard the schooner and doctored up  seventeen years we were together he made me i should today be a supercargo a recruiter or a memory if it had not been for him  you spend your money and you go out and get more he said one day it is easy to get money now but when you get old your money will be spent and you will not be able to go out and get more i know master i have studied the way of white men on the beaches are many old men who were young once and who could get money just like you now they are old and they have nothing and they wait about for the young men like you to come ashore and buy drinks for them  the black boy is a slave on the plantations he gets twenty dollars a year he works hard the overseer does not work hard he rides a horse and watches the black boy work he gets twelve hundred dollars a year i am a sailor on the schooner i get fifteen dollars a month that is because i am a good sailor i work hard the captain has a double awning and drinks beer out of long bottles i have never seen him haul a rope or pull an oar he gets one hundred and fifty dollars a month i am a sailor he is a navigator master i think it would be very good for you to know navigation  otoo spurred me on to it he sailed with me as second mate on my first schooner and he was far prouder of my command than i was myself later on it was  the captain is well paid master but the ship is in his keeping and he is never free from the burden it is the owner who is better paidthe owner who sits ashore with many servants and turns his money over  true but a schooner costs five thousand dollarsan old schooner at that i objected i should be an old man before i saved five thousand dollars  there be short ways for white men to make money he went on pointing ashore at the cocoanutfringed beach  we were in the solomons at the time picking up a cargo of ivorynuts along the east coast of guadalcanar  between this river mouth and the next it is two miles he said the flat land runs far back it is worth nothing now next yearwho knowsor the year after men will pay much money for that land the anchorage is good big steamers can lie close up you can buy the land four miles deep from the old chief for ten thousand sticks of tobacco ten bottles of squareface and a snider which will cost you maybe one hundred dollars then you place the deed with the commissioner and the next year or the year after you sell and become the owner of a ship  i followed his lead and his words came true though in three years instead of two next came the grasslands deal on guadalcanartwenty thousand acres on a governmental nine hundred and ninetynine years lease at a nominal sum i owned the lease for precisely ninety days when i sold it to a company for half a fortune always it was otoo who looked ahead and saw the opportunity he was responsible for the salving of the doncasterbought in at auction for a hundred pounds and clearing three thousand after every expense was paid he led me into the savaii plantation and the cocoa venture on upolu  we did not go seafaring so much as in the old days i was too well off i married and my standard of living rose but otoo remained the same oldtime otoo moving about the house or trailing through the office his wooden pipe in his mouth a shilling undershirt on his back and a fourshilling lavalava about his loins i could not get him to spend money there was no way of repaying him except with love and god knows he got that in full measure from all of us the children worshipped him and if he had been spoilable my wife would surely have been his undoing  the children he really was the one who showed them the way of their feet in the world practical he began by teaching them to walk he sat up with them when they were sick one by one when they were scarcely toddlers he took them down to the lagoon and made them into amphibians he taught them more than i ever knew of the habits of fish and the ways of catching them in the bush it was the same thing at seven tom knew more woodcraft than i ever dreamed existed at six mary went over the sliding rock without a quiver and i have seen strong men balk at that feat and when frank had just turned six he could bring up shillings from the bottom in three fathoms  my people in bora bora do not like heathenthey are all christians and i do not like bora bora christians he said one day when i with the idea of getting him to spend some of the money that was rightfully his had been trying to persuade him to make a visit to his own island in one of our schoonersa special voyage which i had hoped to make a record breaker in the matter of prodigal expense  i say one of our schooners though legally at the time they belonged to me i struggled long with him to enter into partnership  we have been partners from the day the petite jeanne went down he said at last but if your heart so wishes then shall we become partners by the law i have no work to do yet are my expenses large i drink and eat and smoke in plentyit costs much i know i do not pay for the playing of billiards for i play on your table but still the money goes fishing on the reef is only a rich mans pleasure it is shocking the cost of hooks and cotton line yes it is necessary that we be partners by the law i need the money i shall get it from the head clerk in the office  so the papers were made out and recorded a year later i was compelled to complain  charley said i you are a wicked old fraud a miserly skinflint a miserable landcrab behold your share for the year in all our partnership has been thousands of dollars the head clerk has given me this paper it says that in the year you have drawn just eightyseven dollars and twenty cents  is there any owing me he asked anxiously  i tell you thousands and thousands i answered  his face brightened as with an immense relief  it is well he said see that the head clerk keeps good account of it when i want it i shall want it and there must not be a cent missing  if there is he added fiercely after a pause it must come out of the clerks wages  and all the time as i afterward learned his will drawn up by carruthers and making me sole beneficiary lay in the american consuls safe  but the end came as the end must come to all human associations it occurred in the solomons where our wildest work had been done in the wild young days and where we were once moreprincipally on a holiday incidentally to look after our holdings on florida island and to look over the pearling possibilities of the mboli pass we were lying at savo having run in to trade for curios  now savo is alive with sharks the custom of the woollyheads of burying their dead in the sea did not tend to discourage the sharks from making the adjacent waters a hangout it was my luck to be coming aboard in a tiny overloaded native canoe when the thing capsized there were four woollyheads and myself in it or rather hanging to it the schooner was a hundred yards away i was just hailing for a boat when one of the woollyheads began to scream holding on to the end of the canoe both he and that portion of the canoe were dragged under several times then he loosed his clutch and disappeared a shark had got him  the three remaining savages tried to climb out of the water upon the bottom of the canoe i yelled and struck at the nearest with my fist but it was no use they were in a blind funk the canoe could barely have supported one of them under the three it upended and rolled sidewise throwing them back into the water  i abandoned the canoe and started to swim toward the schooner expecting to be picked up by the boat before i got there one of the savages elected to come with me and we swam along silently side by side now and again putting our faces into the water and peering about for sharks the screams of the man who stayed by the canoe informed us that he was taken i was peering into the water when i saw a big shark pass directly beneath me he was fully sixteen feet in length i saw the whole thing he got the woollyhead by the middle and away he went the poor devil head shoulders and arms out of water all the time screeching in a heartrending way he was carried along in this fashion for several hundred feet when he was dragged beneath the surface  i swam doggedly on hoping that that was the last unattached shark but there was another whether it was the one that had attacked the natives earlier or whether it was one that had made a good meal elsewhere i do not know at any rate he was not in such haste as the others i could not swim so rapidly now for a large part of my effort was devoted to keeping track of him i was watching him when he made his first attack by good luck i got both hands on his nose and though his momentum nearly shoved me under i managed to keep him off he veered clear and began circling about again a second time i escaped him by the same maneuver the third rush was a miss on both sides he sheered at the moment my hands should have landed on his nose but his sandpaper hide i had on a sleeveless undershirt scraped the skin off one arm from elbow to shoulder  by this time i was played out and gave up hope the schooner was still two hundred feet away my face was in the water and i was watching him maneuver for another attempt when i saw a brown body pass between us it was otoo  swim for the schooner master he said and he spoke gayly as though the affair was a mere lark i know sharks the shark is my brother  i obeyed swimming slowly on while otoo swam about me keeping always between me and the shark foiling his rushes and encouraging me  the davit tackle carried away and they are rigging the falls he explained a minute or so later and then went under to head off another attack  by the time the schooner was thirty feet away i was about done for i could scarcely move they were heaving lines at us from on board but they continually fell short the shark finding that it was receiving no hurt had become bolder several times it nearly got me but each time otoo was there just the moment before it was too late of course otoo could have saved himself any time but he stuck by me  goodbye charley im finished i just managed to gasp  i knew that the end had come and that the next moment i should throw up my hands and go down  but otoo laughed in my face saying  i will show you a new trick i will make that shark feel sick  he dropped in behind me where the shark was preparing to come at me  a little more to the left he next called out there is a line there on the water to the left masterto the left  i changed my course and struck out blindly i was by that time barely conscious as my hand closed on the line i heard an exclamation from on board i turned and looked there was no sign of otoo the next instant he broke surface both hands were off at the wrist the stumps spouting blood  otoo he called softly and i could see in his gaze the love that thrilled in his voice  then and then only at the very last of all our years he called me by that name  goodby otoo he called  then he was dragged under and i was hauled aboard where i fainted in the captains arms  and so passed otoo who saved me and made me a man and who saved me in the end we met in the maw of a hurricane and parted in the maw of a shark with seventeen intervening years of comradeship the like of which i dare to assert has never befallen two men the one brown and the other white if jehovah be from his high place watching every sparrow fall not least in his kingdom shall be otoo the one heathen of bora bora  illustration     the hobo and the fairy   he lay on his back so heavy was his sleep that the stamp of hoofs and cries of the drivers from the bridge that crossed the creek did not rouse him wagon after wagon loaded high with grapes passed the bridge on the way up the valley to the winery and the coming of each wagon was like the explosion of sound and commotion in the lazy quiet of the afternoon  but the man was undisturbed his head had slipped from the folded newspaper and the straggling unkempt hair was matted with the foxtails and burrs of the dry grass on which it lay he was not a pretty sight his mouth was open disclosing a gap in the upper row where several teeth at some time had been knocked out he breathed stertorously at times grunting and moaning with the pain of his sleep also he was very restless tossing his arms about making jerky halfconvulsive movements and at times rolling his head from side to side in the burrs this restlessness seemed occasioned partly by some internal discomfort and partly by the sun that streamed down on his face and by the flies that buzzed and lighted and crawled upon the nose and cheeks and eyelids there was no other place for them to crawl for the rest of the face was covered with matted beard slightly grizzled but greatly dirtstained and weatherdiscolored  the cheekbones were blotched with the blood congested by the debauch that was evidently being slept off this too accounted for the persistence with which the flies clustered around the mouth lured by the alcoholladen exhalations he was a powerfully built man thicknecked broadshouldered with sinewy wrists and toildistorted hands yet the distortion was not due to recent toil nor were the callouses other than ancient that showed under the dirt of the one palm upturned from time to time this hand clenched tightly and spasmodically into a fist large heavyboned and wickedlooking  the man lay in the dry grass of a tiny glade that ran down to the treefringed bank of the stream on either side of the glade was a fence of the old stakeandrider type though little of it was to be seen so thickly was it overgrown by wild blackberry bushes scrubby oaks and young madrono trees in the rear a gate through a low paling fence led to a snug squat bungalow built in the california spanish style and seeming to have been compounded directly from the landscape of which it was so justly a part neat and trim and modestly sweet was the bungalow redolent of comfort and repose telling with quiet certitude of some one that knew and that had sought and found  through the gate and into the glade came as dainty a little maiden as ever stepped out of an illustration made especially to show how dainty little maidens may be eight years she might have been and possibly a trifle more or less her little waist and little blackstockinged calves showed how delicately fragile she was but the fragility was of mould only there was no hint of anemia in the clear healthy complexion nor in the quick tripping step she was a little delicious blond with hair spun of gossamer gold and wide blue eyes that were but slightly veiled by the long lashes her expression was of sweetness and happiness it belonged by right to any face that sheltered in the bungalow  she carried a childs parasol which she was careful not to tear against the scrubby branches and bramble bushes as she sought for wild poppies along the edge of the fence they were late poppies a third generation which had been unable to resist the call of the warm october sun  having gathered along one fence she turned to cross to the opposite fence midway in the glade she came upon the tramp her startle was merely a startle there was no fear in it she stood and looked long and curiously at the forbidding spectacle and was about to turn back when the sleeper moved restlessly and rolled his hand among the burrs she noted the sun on his face and the buzzing flies her face grew solicitous and for a moment she debated with herself then she tiptoed to his side interposed the parasol between him and the sun and brushed away the flies after a time for greater ease she sat down beside him  an hour passed during which she occasionally shifted the parasol from one tired hand to the other at first the sleeper had been restless but shielded from the flies and the sun his breathing became gentler and his movements ceased several times however he really frightened her the first was the worst coming abruptly and without warning christ how deep how deep the man murmured from some profound of dream the parasol was agitated but the little girl controlled herself and continued her selfappointed ministrations  another time it was a gritting of teeth as of some intolerable agony so terribly did the teeth crunch and grind together that it seemed they must crush into fragments a little later he suddenly stiffened out the hands clenched and the face set with the savage resolution of the dream the eyelids trembled from the shock of the fantasy seemed about to open but did not instead the lips muttered  no no and once more no i wont peach the lips paused then went on you might as well tie me up warden and cut me to pieces thats all you can get outa meblood thats all any of youuns has ever got outa me in this hole  after this outburst the man slept gently on while the little girl still held the parasol aloft and looked down with a great wonder at the frowsy unkempt creature trying to reconcile it with the little part of life that she knew to her ears came the cries of men the stamp of hoofs on the bridge and the creak and groan of wagons heavy laden it was a breathless california indian summer day light fleeces of cloud drifted in the azure sky but to the west heavy cloud banks threatened with rain a bee droned lazily by from farther thickets came the calls of quail and from the fields the songs of meadow larks and oblivious to it all slept ross shanklinross shanklin the tramp and outcast exconvict 4379 the bitter and unbreakable one who had defied all keepers and survived all brutalities  texasborn of the old pioneer stock that was always tough and stubborn he had been unfortunate at seventeen years of age he had been apprehended for horse stealing also he had been convicted of stealing seven horses which he had not stolen and he had been sentenced to fourteen years imprisonment this was severe under any circumstances but with him it had been especially severe because there had been no prior convictions against him the sentiment of the people who believed him guilty had been that two years was adequate punishment for the youth but the county attorney paid according to the convictions he secured had made seven charges against him and earned seven fees which goes to show that the county attorney valued twelve years of ross shanklins life at less than a few dollars  young ross shanklin had toiled terribly in jail he had escaped more than once and he had been caught and sent back to toil in other and various jails he had been triced up and lashed till he fainted had been revived and lashed again he had been in the dungeon ninety days at a time he had experienced the torment of the straightjacket he knew what the humming bird was he had been farmed out as a chattel by the state to the contractors he had been trailed through swamps by bloodhounds twice he had been shot for six years on end he had cut a cord and a half of wood each day in a convict lumber camp sick or well he had cut that cord and a half or paid for it under a whiplash knotted and pickled  and ross shanklin had not sweetened under the treatment he had sneered and raved and defied he had seen convicts after the guards had manhandled them crippled in body for life or left to maunder in mind to the end of their days he had seen convicts even his own cell mate goaded to murder by their keepers go to the gallows reviling god he had been in a break in which eleven of his kind were shot down he had been through a mutiny where in the prison yard with gatling guns trained upon them three hundred convicts had been disciplined with pick handles wielded by brawny guards  he had known every infamy of human cruelty and through it all he had never been broken he had resented and fought to the last until embittered and bestial the day came when he was discharged five dollars were given him in payment for the years of his labor and the flower of his manhood and he had worked little in the years that followed work he hated and despised he tramped begged and stole lied or threatened as the case might warrant and drank to besottedness whenever he got the chance  the little girl was looking at him when he awoke like a wild animal all of him was awake the instant he opened his eyes the first he saw was the parasol strangely obtruded between him and the sky he did not start nor move though his whole body seemed slightly to tense his eyes followed down the parasol handle to the tightclutched little fingers and along the arm to the childs face straight and unblinking he looked into her eyes and she returning the look was chilled and frightened by his glittering eyes cold and harsh withal bloodshot and with no hint in them of the warm humanness she had been accustomed to see and feel in human eyes they were the true prison eyesthe eyes of a man who had learned to talk little who had forgotten almost how to talk  hello he said finally making no effort to change his position what game are you up to  his voice was gruff and husky and at first it had been harsh but it had softened queerly in a feeble attempt at forgotten kindliness  how do you do she said im not playing the sun was on your face and mamma says one oughtnt to sleep in the sun  the sweet clearness of her childs voice was pleasant to him and he wondered why he had never noticed it in childrens voices before he sat up slowly and stared at her he felt that he ought to say something but speech with him was a reluctant thing  i hope you slept well she said gravely  i sure did he answered never taking his eyes from her amazed at the fairness and delicacy of her how long was you holdin that contraption up over me  ooh she debated with herself a long long time i thought you would never wake up  and i thought you was a fairy when i first seen you  he felt elated at his contribution to the conversation  no not a fairy she smiled  he thrilled in a strange numb way at the immaculate whiteness of her small even teeth  i was just the good samaritan she added  i reckon i never heard of that party  he was cudgelling his brains to keep the conversation going never having been at close quarters with a child since he was mangrown he found it difficult  what a funny man not to know about the good samaritan dont you remember a certain man went down to jericho  i reckon ive been there he interrupted  i knew you were a traveler she cried clapping her hands maybe you saw the exact spot  what spot  why where he fell among thieves and was left half dead and then the good samaritan went to him and bound up his wounds and poured in oil and winewas that olive oil do you think  he shook his head slowly  i reckon you got me there olive oil is something the dagoes cooks with i never heard of it for busted heads  she considered his statement for a moment  well she announced we use olive oil in our cooking so we must be dagoes i never knew what they were before i thought it was slang  and the samaritan dumped oil on his head the tramp muttered reminiscently seems to me i recollect a sky pilot sayin something about that old gent dye know ive been looking for him off n on all my life and never scared up hide nor hair of him they aint no more samaritans  wasnt i one she asked quickly  he looked at her steadily with a great curiosity and wonder her ear by a movement exposed to the sun was transparent it seemed he could almost see through it he was amazed at the delicacy of her coloring at the blue of her eyes at the dazzle of the suntouched golden hair and he was astounded by her fragility it came to him that she was easily broken his eye went quickly from his huge gnarled paw to her tiny hand in which it seemed to him he could almost see the blood circulate he knew the power in his muscles and he knew the tricks and turns by which men use their bodies to illtreat men in fact he knew little else and his mind for the time ran in its customary channel it was his way of measuring the beautiful strangeness of her he calculated a grip and not a strong one that could grind her little fingers to pulp he thought of fist blows he had given to mens heads and received on his own head and felt that the least of them could shatter hers like an eggshell he scanned her little shoulders and slim waist and knew in all certitude that with his two hands he could rend her to pieces  wasnt i one she insisted again  he came back to himself with a shockor away from himself as the case happened he was loath that the conversation should cease  what he answered oh yes you bet you was a samaritan even if you didnt have no olive oil he remembered what his mind had been dwelling on and asked but aint you afraid  of  of me he added lamely  she laughed merrily  mamma says never to be afraid of anything she says that if youre good and you think good of other people theyll be good too  and you was thinkin good of me when you kept the sun off he marveled  but its hard to think good of bees and nasty crawly things she confessed  but theres men that is nasty and crawly things he argued  mamma says no she says theres good in everyone  i bet you she locks the house up tight at night just the same he proclaimed triumphantly  but she doesnt mamma isnt afraid of anything thats why she lets me play out here alone when i want why we had a robber once mamma got right up and found him and what do you think he was only a poor hungry man and she got him plenty to eat from the pantry and afterward she got him work to do  ross shanklin was stunned the vista shown him of human nature was unthinkable it had been his lot to live in a world of suspicion and hatred of evilbelieving and evildoing it had been his experience slouching along village streets at nightfall to see little children screaming with fear run from him to their mothers he had even seen grown women shrink aside from him as he passed along the sidewalk  he was aroused by the girl clapping her hands as she cried out  i know what you are youre an open air crank thats why you were sleeping here in the grass  he felt a grim desire to laugh but repressed it  and thats what tramps areopen air cranks she continued i often wondered mamma believes in the open air i sleep on the porch at night so does she this is our land you must have climbed the fence mamma lets me when i put on my climberstheyre bloomers you know but you ought to be told something a person doesnt know when they snore because theyre asleep but you do worse than that you grit your teeth thats bad whenever you are going to sleep you must think to yourself i wont grit my teeth i wont grit my teeth over and over just like that and by and by youll get out of the habit  all bad things are habits and so are all good things and it depends on us what kind our habits are going to be i used to pucker my eyebrowswrinkle them all up but mamma said i must overcome that habit she said that when my eyebrows were wrinkled it was an advertisement that my brain was wrinkled inside and that it wasnt good to have wrinkles in the brain and then she smoothed my eyebrows with her hand and said i must always think smoothsmooth inside and smooth outside and do you know it was easy i havent wrinkled my brows for ever so long ive heard about filling teeth by thinking but i dont believe that neither does mamma  she paused rather out of breath nor did he speak her flow of talk had been too much for him also sleeping drunkenly with open mouth had made him very thirsty but rather than lose one precious moment he endured the torment of his scorching throat and mouth he licked his dry lips and struggled for speech  what is your name he managed at last  joan  she looked her own question at him and it was not necessary to voice it  mine is ross shanklin he volunteered for the first time in forgotten years giving his real name  i suppose youve traveled a lot  i sure have but not as much as i might have wanted to  papa always wanted to travel but he was too busy at the office he never could get much time he went to europe once with mamma that was before i was born it takes money to travel  ross shanklin did not know whether to agree with this statement or not  but it doesnt cost tramps much for expenses she took the thought away from him is that why you tramp  he nodded and licked his lips  mamma says its too bad that men must tramp to look for work but theres lots of work now in the country all the farmers in the valley are trying to get men have you been working  he shook his head angry with himself that he should feel shame at the confession when his savage reasoning told him he was right in despising work but this was followed by another thought this beautiful little creature was some mans child she was one of the rewards of work  i wish i had a little girl like you he blurted out stirred by a sudden consciousness of passion for paternity id work my hands off i  id do anything  she considered his case with fitting gravity  then you arent married  nobody would have me  yes they would if   she did not turn up her nose but she favored his dirt and rags with a look of disapprobation he could not mistake  go on he halfshouted shoot it into me if i was washedif i wore good clothesif i was respectableif i had a job and worked regularif i wasnt what i am  to each statement she nodded  well i aint that kind he rushed on im no good im a tramp i dont want to work thats what and i like dirt  her face was eloquent with reproach as she said then you were only making believe when you wished you had a little girl like me  this left him speechless for he knew in all the depths of his newfound passion that that was just what he did want  with ready tact noting his discomfort she sought to change the subject  what do you think of god she asked i aint never met him what do you think about him  his reply was evidently angry and she was frank in her disapproval  you are very strange she said you get angry so easily i never saw anybody before that got angry about god or work or being clean  he never done anything for me he muttered resentfully he cast back in quick review of the long years of toil in the convict camps and mines and work never done anything for me neither  an embarrassing silence fell  he looked at her numb and hungry with the stir of the fatherlove sorry for his ill temper puzzling his brain for something to say she was looking off and away at the clouds and he devoured her with his eyes he reached out stealthily and rested one grimy hand on the very edge of her little dress it seemed to him that she was the most wonderful thing in the world the quail still called from the coverts and the harvest sounds seemed abruptly to become very loud a great loneliness oppressed him  im  im no good he murmured huskily and repentantly  but beyond a glance from her blue eyes she took no notice the silence was more embarrassing than ever he felt that he could give the world just to touch with his lips that hem of her dress where his hand rested but he was afraid of frightening her he fought to find something to say licking his parched lips and vainly attempting to articulate something anything  this aint sonoma valley he declared finally this is fairy land and youre a fairy mebbe im asleep and dreaming i dont know you and me dont know how to talk together because you see youre a fairy and dont know nothing but good things and im a man from the bad wicked world  having achieved this much he was left gasping for ideas like a stranded fish  and youre going to tell me about the bad wicked world she cried clapping her hands im just dying to know  he looked at her startled remembering the wreckage of womanhood he had encountered on the sunken ways of life she was no fairy she was flesh and blood and the possibilities of wreckage were in her as they had been in him even when he lay at his mothers breast and there was in her eagerness to know  nope he said lightly this man from the bad wicked world aint going to tell you nothing of the kind hes going to tell you of the good things in that world hes going to tell you how he loved hosses when he was a shaver and about the first hoss he straddled and the first hoss he owned hosses aint like men theyre better theyre cleanclean all the way through and back again and little fairy i want to tell you one thingthere sure aint nothing in the world like when youre settin a tired hoss at the end of a long day and when you just speak and that tired animal lifts under you willing and hustles along hosses theyre my long suit i sure dote on hosses yep i used to be a cowboy once  she clapped her hands in the way that tore so delightfully to his heart and her eyes were dancing as she exclaimed  a texas cowboy i always wanted to see one i heard papa say once that cowboys are bowlegged are you  i sure was a texas cowboy he answered but it was a long time ago and im sure bowlegged you see you cant ride much when youre young and soft without getting the legs bent some why i was only a threeyearold when i begun he was a threeyearold too freshbroken i led him up alongside the fence dumb to the top rail and dropped on he was a pinto and a real devil at bucking but i could do anything with him i reckon he knowed i was only a little shaver some hosses knows lots more n you think  for half an hour ross shanklin rambled on with his horse reminiscences never unconscious for a moment of the supreme joy that was his through the touch of his hand on the hem of her dress the sun dropped slowly into the cloud bank the quail called more insistently and empty wagon after empty wagon rumbled back across the bridge then came a womans voice  joan joan it called where are you dear  the little girl answered and ross shanklin saw a woman clad in a soft clinging gown come through the gate from the bungalow she was a slender graceful woman and to his charmed eyes she seemed rather to float along than walk like ordinary flesh and blood  what have you been doing all afternoon the woman asked as she came up  talking mamma the little girl replied ive had a very interesting time  ross shanklin scrambled to his feet and stood watchfully and awkwardly the little girl took the mothers hand and she in turn looked at him frankly and pleasantly with a recognition of his humanness that was a new thing to him in his mind ran the thought the woman who aint afraid not a hint was there of the timidity he was accustomed to seeing in womens eyes and he was quite aware and never more so of his blearyeyed forbidding appearance  how do you do she greeted him sweetly and naturally  how do you do maam he responded unpleasantly conscious of the huskiness and rawness of his voice  and did you have an interesting time too she smiled  yes maam i sure did i was just telling your little girl about bosses  he was a cowboy once mamma she cried  the mother smiled her acknowledgment to him and looked fondly down at the little girl the thought that came into ross shanklins mind was the awfulness of the crime if any one should harm either of the wonderful pair this was followed by the wish that some terrible danger should threaten so that he could fight as he well knew how with all his strength and life to defend them  youll have to come along dear the mother said its growing late she looked at ross shanklin hesitantly would you care to have something to eat  no maam thanking you kindly just the same i  i aint hungry  then say goodbye joan she counselled  goodbye the little girl held out her hand and her eyes lighted roguishly goodbye mr man from the bad wicked world  to him the touch of her hand as he pressed it in his was the capstone of the whole adventure  goodbye little fairy he mumbled i reckon i got to be pullin along  but he did not pull along he stood staring after his vision until it vanished through the gate the day seemed suddenly empty he looked about him irresolutely then climbed the fence crossed the bridge and slouched along the road he was in a dream he did not note his feet nor the way they led him at times he stumbled in the dustfilled ruts  a mile farther on he aroused at the crossroads before him stood the saloon he came to a stop and stared at it licking his lips he sank his hand into his pants pocket and fumbled a solitary dime god he muttered god then with dragging reluctant feet went on along the road  he came to a big farm he knew it must be big because of the bigness of the house and the size and number of the barns and outbuildings on the porch in shirt sleeves smoking a cigar keeneyed and middleaged was the farmer  whats the chance for a job ross shanklin asked  the keen eyes scarcely glanced at him  a dollar a day and grub was the answer  ross shanklin swallowed and braced himself  ill pick grapes all right or anything but whats the chance for a steady job youve got a big ranch here i know hosses i was born on one i can drive team ride plough break do anything that anybody ever done with hosses  the other looked him over with an appraising incredulous eye  you dont look it was the judgment  i know i dont give me a chance thats all ill prove it  the farmer considered casting an anxious glance at the cloud bank into which the sun had sunk  im short a teamster and ill give you the chance to make good go and get supper with the hands  ross shanklins voice was very husky and he spoke with an effort  all right ill make good where can i get a drink of water and wash up  illustration     just meat   he strolled to the corner and glanced up and down the intersecting street but saw nothing save the oases of light shed by the street lamps at the successive crossings then he strolled back the way he had come he was a shadow of a man sliding noiselessly and without undue movement through the semi darkness also he was very alert like a wild animal in the jungle keenly perceptive and receptive the movement of another in the darkness about him would need to have been more shadowy than he to have escaped him  in addition to the running advertisement of the state of affairs carried to him by his senses he had a subtler perception a feel of the atmosphere around him he knew that the house in front of which he paused for a moment contained children yet by no willed effort of perception did he have this knowledge for that matter he was not even aware that he knew so occult was the impression yet did a moment arise in which action in relation to that house were imperative he would have acted on the assumption that it contained children he was not aware of all that he knew about the neighborhood  in the same way he knew not how he knew that no danger threatened in the footfalls that came up the cross street before he saw the walker he knew him for a belated pedestrian hurrying home the walker came into view at the crossing and disappeared on up the street the man that watched noted a light that flared up in the window of a house on the corner and as it died down he knew it for an expiring match this was conscious identification of familiar phenomena and through his mind flitted the thought wanted to know what time in another house one room was lighted the light burned dimly and steadily and he had the feel that it was a sick room  he was especially interested in a house across the street in the middle of the block to this house he paid most attention no matter what way he looked nor what way he walked his looks and his steps always returned to it except for an open window above the porch there was nothing unusual about the house nothing came in nor out nothing happened there were no lighted windows nor had lights appeared and disappeared in any of the windows yet it was the central point of his consideration he rallied to it each time after a divination of the state of the neighborhood  despite his feel of things he was not confident he was supremely conscious of the precariousness of his situation though unperturbed by the footfalls of the chance pedestrian he was as keyed up and sensitive and ready to be startled as any timorous deer he was aware of the possibility of other intelligences prowling about in the darknessintelligences similar to his own in movement perception and divination  far down the street he caught a glimpse of something that moved and he knew it was no late homegoer but menace and danger he whistled twice to the house across the street then faded away shadowlike to the corner and around the corner here he paused and looked about him carefully reassured he peered back around the corner and studied the object that moved and that was coming nearer he had divined aright it was a policeman  the man went down the cross street to the next corner from the shelter of which he watched the corner he had just left he saw the policeman pass by going straight on up the street he paralleled the policemans course and from the next corner again watched him go by then he returned the way he had come he whistled once to the house across the street and after a time whistled once again there was reassurance in the whistle just as there had been warning in the previous double whistle  he saw a dark bulk outline itself on the roof of the porch and slowly descend a pillar then it came down the steps passed through the small iron gate and went down the sidewalk taking on the form of a man he that watched kept on his own side the street and moved on abreast to the corner where he crossed over and joined the other he was quite small alongside the man he accosted  howd you make out matt he asked  the other grunted indistinctly and walked on in silence a few steps  i reckon i landed the goods he said  jim chuckled in the darkness and waited for further information the blocks passed by under their feet and he grew impatient  well how about them goods he asked what kind of a haul did you make anyway  i was too busy to figger it out but its fat i can tell you that much jim its fat i dont dast to think how fat it is wait till we get to the room  jim looked at him keenly under the street lamp of the next crossing and saw that his face was a trifle grim and that he carried his left arm peculiarly  whats the matter with your arm he demanded  the little cuss bit me hope i dont get hydrophoby folks gets hydrophoby from manbite sometimes dont they  gave you a fight eh jim asked encouragingly  the other grunted  youre certainly bard to get information from jim burst out irritably tell us about it you aint goin to lose money just atellin a guy  i guess i choked him some came the answer then by way of explanation he woke up on me  you did it neat i never heard a sound  jim the other said with seriousness its a hangin matter i fixed m i had to he woke up on me you an mes got to do some layin low for a spell  jim gave a low whistle of comprehension  did you hear me whistle he asked suddenly  sure i was all done i was just comin out  it was a bull but he wasnt on a little bit went right by an kept apaddin the hoof outa sight then i came back an gave you the whistle what made you take so long after that  i was waitin to make sure matt explained  i was mighty glad when i heard you whistle again its hard work waitin i just sat there an thought an thought  oh all kinds of things its remarkable what a fellowll think about and then there was a darn cat that kept movin around the house an botherin me with its noises  an its fat jim exclaimed irrelevantly and with joy  im sure tellin you jim its fat im plum anxious for another look at em  unconsciously the two men quickened their pace yet they did not relax from their caution twice they changed their course in order to avoid policemen and they made very sure that they were not observed when they dived into the dark hallway of a cheap rooming house down town  not until they had gained their own room on the top floor did they scratch a match while jim lighted a lamp matt locked the door and threw the bolts into place as he turned he noticed that his partner was waiting expectantly matt smiled to himself at the others eagerness  them searchlights is all right he said drawing forth a small pocket electric lamp and examining it but we got to get a new battery its runnin pretty weak i thought once or twice itd leave me in the dark funny arrangements in that house i near got lost his room was on the left an that fooled me some  i told you it was on the left jim interrupted  you told me it was on the right matt went on i guess i know what you told me an theres the map you drew  fumbling in his vest pocket he drew out a folded slip of paper as he unfolded it jim bent over and looked  i did make a mistake he confessed  you sure did it got me guessin some for a while  but it dont matter now jim cried lets see what you got  it does matter matt retorted it matters a lot  to me ive got to run all the risk i put my head in the trap while you stay on the street you got to get on to yourself an be more careful all right ill show you  he dipped loosely into his trousers pocket and brought out a handful of small diamonds he spilled them out in a blazing stream on the greasy table jim let out a great oath  thats nothing matt said with triumphant complacence i aint begun yet  from one pocket after another he continued bringing forth the spoil there were many diamonds wrapped in chamois skin that were larger than those in the first handful from one pocket he brought out a handful of very small cut gems  sun dust he remarked as he spilled them on the table in a space by themselves  jim examined them  just the same they retail for a couple of dollars each he said is that all  aint it enough the other demanded in an aggrieved tone  sure it is jim answered with unqualified approval bettern i expected i wouldnt take a cent less than ten thousan for the bunch  ten thousan matt sneered theyre worth twict that an i dont know anything about joolery either look at that big boy  he picked it out from the sparkling heap and held it near to the lamp with the air of an expert weighing and judging  worth a thousan all by its lonely was jims quicker judgment  a thousan your grandmother was matts scornful rejoinder you couldnt buy it for three  wake me up im dreamin the sparkle of the gems was in jims eyes and he began sorting out the larger diamonds and examining them were rich men mattwell be regular swells  itll take years to get rid of em was matts more practical thought  but think how well live nothin to do but spend the money an go on gettin rid of em  matts eyes were beginning to sparkle though sombrely as his phlegmatic nature woke up  i told you i didnt dast think how fat it was he murmured in a low voice  what a killin what a killin was the others more ecstatic utterance  i almost forgot matt said thrusting his hand into his inside coat pocket  a string of large pearls emerged from wrappings of tissue paper and chamois skin jim scarcely glanced at them  theyre worth money he said and returned to the diamonds  a silence fell on the two men jim played with the gems running them through his fingers sorting them into piles and spreading them out flat and wide he was a slender weazened man nervous irritable highstrung and anaemica typical child of the gutter with unbeautiful twisted features small eyes with face and mouth perpetually and feverishly hungry brutish in a catlike way stamped to the core with degeneracy  matt did not finger the diamonds he sat with chin on hands and elbows on table blinking heavily at the blazing array he was in every way a contrast to the other no city had bred him he was heavy muscled and hairy gorillalike in strength and aspect for him there was no unseen world his eyes were full and wide apart and there seemed in them a certain bold brotherliness they inspired confidence but a closer inspection would have shown that his eyes were just a trifle too full just a shade too wide apart he exceeded spilled over the limits of normality and his features told lies about the man beneath  the bunch is worth fifty thousan jim remarked suddenly  a hundred thousan matt said  the silence returned and endured a long time to be broken again by jim  what in blazes was he doin with em all at the housethats what i want to know id athought hed kept em in the safe down at the store  matt had just been considering the vision of the throttled man as he had last looked upon him in the dim light of the electric lantern but he did not start at the mention of him  theres no tellin he answered he might abeen getting ready to chuck his pardner he might apulled out in the mornin for parts unknown if we hadnt happened along i guess theres just as many thieves among honest men as there is among thieves you read about such things in the papers jim pardners is always knifin each other  a queer nervous look came in the others eyes matt did not betray that he noted it though he said  what was you thinkin about jim  jim was a trifle awkward for the moment  nothin he answered only i was thinkin just how funny it wasall them jools at his house what made you ask  nothin i was just wonderin that was all  the silence settled down broken by an occasional low and nervous giggle on the part of jim he was overcome by the spread of gems it was not that he felt their beauty he was unaware that they were beautiful in themselves but in them his swift imagination visioned the joys of life they would buy and all the desires and appetites of his diseased mind and sickly flesh were tickled by the promise they extended he builded wondrous orgyhaunted castles out of their brilliant fires and was appalled at what he builded then it was that he giggled it was all too impossible to be real and yet there they blazed on the table before him fanning the flame of the lust of him and he giggled again  i guess we might as well count em matt said suddenly tearing himself away from his own visions you watch me an see that its square because you an me has got to be on the square jim understand  jim did not like this and betrayed it in his eyes while matt did not like what he saw in his partners eyes  understand matt repeated almost menacingly  aint we always been square the other replied on the defensive what of the treachery already whispering in him  it dont cost nothin bein square in hard times matt retorted its bein square in prosperity that counts when we aint got nothin we cant help bein square were prosperous now an weve got to be business menhonest business men understand  thats the talk for me jim approved but deep down in the meagre soul of himand in spite of himwanton and lawless thoughts were stirring like chained beasts  matt stepped to the food shelf behind the twoburner kerosene cooking stove he emptied the tea from a paper bag and from a second bag emptied some red peppers returning to the table with the bags he put into them the two sizes of small diamonds then he counted the large gems and wrapped them in their tissue paper and chamois skin  hundred an fortyseven goodsized ones was his inventory twenty real big ones two big boys and one whopper an a couple of fistfuls of teeny ones an dust  he looked at jim  correct was the response  he wrote the count out on a slip of memorandum paper and made a copy of it giving one slip to his partner and retaining the other  just for reference he said  again he had recourse to the food shelf where he emptied the sugar from a large paper bag into this he thrust the diamonds large and small wrapped it up in a bandana handkerchief and stowed it away under his pillow then he sat down on the edge of the bed and took off his shoes  an you think theyre worth a hundred thousan jim asked pausing and looking up from the unlacing of his shoe  sure was the answer i seen a dancer down in arizona once with some big sparklers on her they wasnt real she said if they was she wouldnt be dancin said theyd be worth all of fifty thousan an she didnt have a dozen of em all told  whod work for a livin jim triumphantly demanded pick an shovel work he sneered work like a dog all my life an save all my wages an i wouldnt have half as much as we got tonight  dish washins about your measure an you couldnt get moren twenty a month an board your figgers is way off but your point is well taken let them that likes it work i rode range for thirty a month when i was young an foolish well im older an i aint ridin range  he got into bed on one side jim put out the light and followed him in on the other side  hows your arm feel jim queried amiably  such concern was unusual and matt noted it and replied  i guess theres no danger of hydrophoby what made you ask  jim felt in himself a guilty stir and under his breath he cursed the others way of asking disagreeable questions but aloud he answered nothin only you seemed scared of it at first what are you goin to do with your share matt  buy a cattle ranch in arizona an set down an pay other men to ride range for me theres some several id like to see askin a job from me blast them an now you shut your face jim itll be some time before i buy that ranch just now im goin to sleep  but jim lay long awake nervous and twitching rolling about restlessly and rolling himself wide awake every time he dozed the diamonds still blazed under his eyelids and the fire of them hurt matt in spite of his heavy nature slept lightly like a wild animal alert in its sleep and jim noticed every time he moved that his partners body moved sufficiently to show that it had received the impression and that it was trembling on the verge of awakening for that matter jim did not know whether or not frequently the other was awake once quietly betokening complete consciousness matt said to him aw go to sleep jim dont worry about them jools theyll keep and jim had thought that at that particular moment matt had been surely asleep  in the late morning matt was awake with jims first movement and thereafter he awoke and dozed with him until midday when they got up together and began dressing  im goin out to get a paper an some bread matt said you boil the coffee  as jim listened unconsciously his gaze left matts face and roved to the pillow beneath which was the bundle wrapped in the bandana handkerchief on the instant matts face became like a wild beasts  look here jim he snarled youve got to play square if you do me dirt ill fix you understand id eat you jim you know that id bite right into your throat an eat you like that much beefsteak  his sunburned skin was black with the surge of blood in it and his tobaccostained teeth were exposed by the snarling lips jim shivered and involuntarily cowered there was death in the man he looked at only the night before that blackfaced man had killed another with his hands and it had not hurt his sleep and in his own heart jim was aware of a sneaking guilt of a train of thought that merited all that was threatened  matt passed out leaving him still shivering then a hatred twisted his own face and he softly hurled savage threats at the door he remembered the jewels and hastened to the bed feeling under the pillow for the bandana bundle he crushed it with his fingers to make certain that it still contained the diamonds assured that matt had not carried them away he looked toward the kerosene stove with a guilty start then he hurriedly lighted it filled the coffee pot at the sink and put it over the flame  the coffee was boiling when matt returned and while the latter cut the bread and put a slice of butter on the table jim poured out the coffee it was not until he sat down and had taken a few sips of the coffee that matt pulled out the morning paper from his pocket  we was way off he said i told you i didnt dast figger out how fat it was look at that  he pointed to the head lines on the first page swift nemesis on bujannoffs track they read murdered in his sleep after robbing his partner  there you have it matt cried he robbed his partnerrobbed him like a dirty thief  half a million of jewels missin jim read aloud he put the paper down and stared at matt  thats what i told you the latter said what in thunder do we know about jools half a millionan the best i could figger it was a hundred thousan go on an read the rest of it  they read on silently their heads side by side the untouched coffee growing cold and ever and anon one or the other burst forth with some salient printed fact  id like to seen metzners face when he opened the safe at the store this mornin jim gloated  he hit the high places right away for bujannoffs house matt explained go on an read  was to have sailed last night at ten on the sajoda for the south seassteamship delayed by extra freight  thats why we caught m in bed matt interrupted it was just lucklike pickin a fiftytoone winner  sajoda sailed at six this mornin  he didnt catch her matt said i saw his alarm clock was set at five thatd given m plenty of time  only i come along an put the kibosh on his time go on  adolph metzner in despairthe famous haythorne pearl necklacemagnificently assorted pearlsvalued by experts at from fifty to seventy thousan dollars  jim broke off to say solemnly those oystereggs worth all that money  he licked his lips and added they was beauties an no mistake  big brazilian gem he read on eighty thousan dollarsmany valuable gems of the first waterseveral thousan small diamonds well worth forty thousan  what you dont know about jools is worth knowin matt smiled good humoredly  theory of the sleuths jim read thieves must have knowncleverly kept watch on bujannoffs actionsmust have learned his plan and trailed him to his house with the fruits of his robbery  clever matt broke out thats the way reputations is made  in the noospapers howd we know he was robbin his pardner  anyway weve got the goods jim grinned lets look at em again  he assured himself that the door was locked and bolted while matt brought out the bundle in the bandana and opened it on the table  aint they beauties though jim exclaimed at sight of the pearls and for a time he had eyes only for them accordin to the experts worth from fifty to seventy thousan dollars  an women like them things matt commented an theyll do everything to get emsell themselves commit murder anything  just like you an me  not on your life matt retorted ill commit murder for em but not for their own sakes but for the sake of what theyll get me thats the difference women want the jools for themselves an i want the jools for the women an such things theyll get me  lucky that men an women dont want the same things jim remarked  thats what makes commerce matt agreed people wantin different things  in the middle of the afternoon jim went out to buy food while he was gone matt cleared the table of the jewels wrapping them up as before and putting them under the pillow then he lighted the kerosene stove and started to boil water for the coffee a few minutes later jim returned  most surprising he remarked streets an stores an people just like they always was nothin changed an me walkin along through it all a millionnaire nobody looked at me an guessed it  matt grunted unsympathetically he had little comprehension of the lighter whims and fancies of his partners imagination  did you get a porterhouse he demanded  sure an an inch thick its a peach look at it  he unwrapped the steak and held it up for the others inspection then he made the coffee and set the table while matt fried the steak  dont put on too much of them red peppers jim warned i aint used to your mexican cookin you always season too hot  matt grunted a laugh and went on with his cooking jim poured out the coffee but first into the nicked china cup he emptied a powder he had carried in his vest pocket wrapped in a ricepaper he had turned his back for the moment on his partner but he did not dare to glance around at him matt placed a newspaper on the table and on the newspaper set the hot frying pan he cut the steak in half and served jim and himself  eat her while shes hot he counselled and with knife and fork set the example  shes a dandy was jims judgment after his first mouthful but i tell you one thing straight im never goin to visit you on that arizona ranch so you neednt ask me  whats the matter now matt asked  the mexican cookin on your ranchd be too much for me if ive got blue blazes acomin in the next life im not goin to torment my insides in this one  he smiled expelled his breath forcibly to cool his burning mouth drank some coffee and went on eating the steak  what do you think about the next life anyway matt he asked a little later while secretly he wondered why the other had not yet touched his coffee  aint no next life matt answered pausing from the steak to take his first sip of coffee nor heaven nor hell nor nothin you get all thats comin right here in this life  an afterward jim queried out of his morbid curiosity for he knew that he looked upon a man that was soon to die an afterward he repeated  did you ever see a man two weeks dead the other asked  jim shook his head  well i have he was like this beefsteak you an me is eatin it was once steer cavortin over the landscape but now its just meat thats all just meat an thats what you an me an all people

lyin an snivellin through another life an go on that way forever an ever an ever matt sneered  maybe ill improve jim suggested hopefully maybe stealin wont be necessary in the life to come  he ceased abruptly and stared straight before him a frightened expression on his face  whats the matter matt demanded  nothin i was just wonderinjim returned to himself with an effortabout this dyin that was all  but he could not shake off the fright that had startled him it was as if an unseen thing of gloom had passed him by casting upon him the intangible shadow of its presence he was aware of a feeling of foreboding something ominous was about to happen calamity hovered in the air he gazed fixedly across the table at the other man he could not understand was it that he had blundered and poisoned himself no matt had the nicked cup and he had certainly put the poison in the nicked cup  it was all his own imagination was his next thought it had played him tricks before fool of course it was of course something was about to happen but it was about to happen to matt had not matt drunk the whole cup of coffee  jim brightened up and finished his steak sopping bread in the gravy when the meat was gone  when i was a kid he began but broke off abruptly  again the unseen thing of gloom had fluttered and his being was vibrant with premonition of impending misfortune he felt a disruptive influence at work in the flesh of him and in all his muscles there was a seeming that they were about to begin to twitch he sat back suddenly and as suddenly leaned forward with his elbows on the table a tremor ran dimly through the muscles of his body it was like the first rustling of leaves before the oncoming of wind he clenched his teeth it came again a spasmodic tensing of his muscles he knew panic at the revolt within his being his muscles no longer recognized his mastery over them again they spasmodically tensed despite the will of him for he had willed that they should not tense this was revolution within himself this was anarchy and the terror of impotence rushed up in him as his flesh gripped and seemed to seize him in a clutch chills running up and down his back and sweat starting on his brow he glanced about the room and all the details of it smote him with a strange sense of familiarity it was as though he had just returned from a long journey he looked across the table at his partner matt was watching him and smiling an expression of horror spread over jims face  matt he screamed you aint doped me  matt smiled and continued to watch him in the paroxysm that followed jim did not become unconscious his muscles tensed and twitched and knotted hurting him and crushing him in their savage grip and in the midst of it all it came to him that matt was acting queerly he was traveling the same road the smile had gone from his face and there was on it an intense expression as if he were listening to some inner tale of himself and trying to divine the message matt got up and walked across the room and back again then sat down  you did this jim he said quietly  but i didnt think youd try to fix me jim answered reproachfully  oh i fixed you all right matt said with teeth close together and shivering body what did you give me  strychnine  same as i gave you matt volunteered its some mess aint it  youre lyin matt jim pleaded you aint doped me have you  i sure did jim an i didnt overdose you neither i cooked it in as neat as you please in your half the porterhousehold on wherere you goin  jim had made a dash for the door and was throwing back the bolts matt sprang in between and shoved him away  drug store jim panted drug store  no you dont youll stay right here there aint goin to be any runnin out an makin a poison play on the streetnot with all them jools reposin under the pillow savve even if you didnt die youd be in the hands of the police with a lot of explanations comin emetics is the stuff for poison im just as bad bit as you an im goin to take a emetic thats all theyd give you at a drug store anyway  he thrust jim back into the middle of the room and shot the bolts into place as he went across the floor to the food shelf he passed one hand over his brow and flung off the beaded sweat it spattered audibly on the floor jim watched agonizedly as matt got the mustard can and a cup and ran for the sink he stirred a cupful of mustard and water and drank it down jim had followed him and was reaching with trembling hands for the empty cup again matt shoved him away as he mixed a second cupful he demanded  dyou think one cupll do for me you can wait till im done  jim started to totter toward the door but matt checked him  if you monkey with that door ill twist your neck savve you can take yours when im done an if it saves you ill twist your neck anyway you aint got no chance nohow i told you many times what youd get if you did me dirt  but you did me dirt too jim articulated with an effort  matt was drinking the second cupful and did not answer the sweat had got into jims eyes and he could scarcely see his way to the table where he got a cup for himself but matt was mixing a third cupful and as before thrust him away  i told you to wait till i was done matt growled get outa my way  and jim supported his twitching body by holding on to the sink the while he yearned toward the yellowish concoction that stood for life it was by sheer will that he stood and clung to the sink his flesh strove to double him up and bring him to the floor matt drank the third cupful and with difficulty managed to get to a chair and sit down his first paroxysm was passing the spasms that afflicted him were dying away this good effect he ascribed to the mustard and water he was safe at any rate he wiped the sweat from his face and in the interval of calm found room for curiosity he looked at his partner  a spasm had shaken the mustard can out of jims hands and the contents were spilled upon the floor he stooped to scoop some of the mustard into the cup and the succeeding spasm doubled him up on the floor matt smiled  stay with it he encouraged its the stuff all right its fixed me up  jim heard him and turned toward him with a stricken face twisted with suffering and pleading spasm now followed spasm till he was in convulsions rolling on the floor and yellowing his face and hair in the mustard  matt laughed hoarsely at the sight but the laugh broke midway a tremor had run through his body a new paroxysm was beginning he arose and staggered across to the sink where with probing forefinger he vainly strove to assist the action of the emetic in the end he clung to the sink as jim had clung filled with the horror of going down to the floor  the others paroxysm had passed and he sat up weak and fainting too weak to rise his forehead dripping his lips flecked with a foam made yellow by the mustard in which he had rolled he rubbed his eyes with his knuckles and groans that were like whines came from his throat  what are you snifflin about matt demanded out of his agony all you got to do is die an when you die youre dead  i  aint  snifflin  its  the  mustard  stingin  my  eyes jim panted with desperate slowness  it was his last successful attempt at speech thereafter he babbled incoherently pawing the air with shaking arms till a fresh convulsion stretched him on the floor  matt struggled back to the chair and doubled up on it with his arms clasped about his knees he fought with his disintegrating flesh he came out of the convulsion cool and weak he looked to see how it went with the other and saw him lying motionless  he tried to soliloquize to be facetious to have his last grim laugh at life but his lips made only incoherent sounds the thought came to him that the emetic had failed and that nothing remained but the drug store he looked toward the door and drew himself to his feet there he saved himself from falling by clutching the chair another paroxysm had begun and in the midst of the paroxysm with his body and all the parts of it flying apart and writhing and twisting back again into knots he clung to the chair and shoved it before him across the floor the last shreds of his will were leaving him when he gained the door he turned the key and shot back one bolt he fumbled for the second bolt but failed then he leaned his weight against the door and slid down gently to the floor  illustration     a nose for the king   in the morning calm of korea when its peace and tranquility truly merited its ancient name chosen there lived a politician by name yi chin ho he was a man of parts andwho shall sayperhaps in no wise worse than politicians the world over but unlike his brethren in other lands yi chin ho was in jail not that he had inadvertently diverted to himself public moneys but that he had inadvertently diverted too much excess is to be deplored in all things even in grafting and yi chin hos excess had brought him to most deplorable straits  ten thousand strings of cash he owed the government and he lay in prison under sentence of death there was one advantage to the situationhe had plenty of time in which to think and he thought well then called he the jailer to him  most worthy man you see before you one most wretched he began yet all will be well with me if you will but let me go free for one short hour this night and all will be well with you for i shall see to your advancement through the years and you shall come at length to the directorship of all the prisons of chosen  how now demanded the jailer what foolishness is this one short hour and you but waiting for your head to be chopped off and i with an aged and muchtoberespected mother not to say anything of a wife and several children of tender years out upon you for the scoundrel that you are  from the sacred city to the ends of all the eight coasts there is no place for me to hide yi chin ho made reply i am a man of wisdom but of what worth my wisdom here in prison were i free well i know i could seek out and obtain the money wherewith to repay the government i know of a nose that will save me from all my difficulties  a nose cried the jailer  a nose said yi chin ho a remarkable nose if i may say so a most remarkable nose  the jailer threw up his hands despairingly ah what a wag you are what a wag he laughed to think that that very admirable wit of yours must go the way of the choppingblock  and so saying he turned and went away but in the end being a man soft of head and heart when the night was well along he permitted yi chin ho to go  straight he went to the governor catching him alone and arousing him from his sleep  yi chin ho or im no governor cried the governor what do you here who should be in prison waiting on the choppingblock  i pray your excellency to listen to me said yi chin ho squatting on his hams by the bedside and lighting his pipe from the firebox a dead man is without value it is true i am as a dead man without value to the government to your excellency or to myself but if so to say your excellency were to give me my freedom  impossible cried the governor besides you are condemned to death  your excellency well knows that if i can repay the ten thousand strings of cash the government will pardon me yi chin ho went on so as i say if your excellency were to give me my freedom for a few days being a man of understanding i should then repay the government and be in position to be of service to your excellency i should be in position to be of very great service to your excellency  have you a plan whereby you hope to obtain this money asked the governor  i have said yi chin ho  then come with it to me tomorrow night i would now sleep said the governor taking up his snore where it had been interrupted  on the following night having again obtained leave of absence from the jailer yi chin ho presented himself at the governors bedside  is it you yi chin ho asked the governor and have you the plan  it is i your excellency answered yi chin ho and the plan is here  speak commanded the governor  the plan is here repeated yi chin ho here in my hand  the governor sat up and opened his eyes yi chin ho proffered in his hand a sheet of paper the governor held it to the light  nothing but a nose said he  a bit pinched so and so your excellency said yi chin ho  yes a bit pinched here and there as you say said the governor  withal it is an exceeding corpulent nose thus and so all in one place at the end proceeded yi chin ho your excellency would seek far and wide and many a day for that nose and find it not  an unusual nose admitted the governor  there is a wart upon it said yi chin ho  a most unusual nose said the governor never have i seen the like but what do you with this nose yi chin ho  i seek it whereby to repay the money to the government said yi chin ho i seek it to be of service to your excellency and i seek it to save my own worthless head further i seek your excellencys seal upon this picture of the nose  and the governor laughed and affixed the seal of state and yi chin ho departed for a month and a day he traveled the kings road which leads to the shore of the eastern sea and there one night at the gate of the largest mansion of a wealthy city he knocked loudly for admittance  none other than the master of the house will i see said he fiercely to the frightened servants i travel upon the kings business  straightway was he led to an inner room where the master of the house was roused from his sleep and brought blinking before him  you are pak chung chang head man of this city said yi chin ho in tones that were allaccusing i am upon the kings business  pak chung chang trembled well he knew the kings business was ever a terrible business his knees smote together and he near fell to the floor  the hour is late he quavered were it not well to  the kings business never waits thundered yi chin ho come apart with me and swiftly i have an affair of moment to discuss with you  it is the kings affair he added with even greater fierceness so that pak chung changs silver pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers and clattered on the floor  know then said yi chin ho when they had gone apart that the king is troubled with an affliction a very terrible affliction in that he failed to cure the court physician has had nothing else than his head chopped off from all the eight provinces have the physicians come to wait upon the king wise consultation have they held and they have decided that for a remedy for the kings affliction nothing else is required than a nose a certain kind of nose a very peculiar certain kind of nose  then by none other was i summoned than his excellency the prime minister himself he put a paper into my hand upon this paper was the very peculiar kind of nose drawn by the physicians of the eight provinces with the seal of state upon it  go said his excellency the prime minister seek out this nose for the kings affliction is sore and wheresoever you find this nose upon the face of a man strike it off forthright and bring it in all haste to the court for the king must be cured go and come not back until your search is rewarded  and so i departed upon my quest said yi chin ho i have sought out the remotest corners of the kingdom i have traveled the eight highways searched the eight provinces and sailed the seas of the eight coasts and here i am  with a great flourish he drew a paper from his girdle unrolled it with many snappings and cracklings and thrust it before the face of pak chung chang upon the paper was the picture of the nose  pak chung chang stared upon it with bulging eyes  never have i beheld such a nose he began  there is a wart upon it said yi chin ho  never have i beheld pak chung chang began again  bring your father before me yi chin ho interrupted sternly  my ancient and verymuchtoberespected ancestor sleeps said pak chung chang  why dissemble demanded yi chin ho you know it is your fathers nose bring him before me that i may strike it off and be gone hurry lest i make bad report of you  mercy cried pak chung chang falling on his knees it is impossible it is impossible you cannot strike off my fathers nose he cannot go down without his nose to the grave he will become a laughter and a byword and all my days and nights will be filled with woe o reflect report that you have seen no such nose in your travels you too have a father  pak chung chang clasped yi chin hos knees and fell to weeping on his sandals  my heart softens strangely at your tears said yi chin ho i too know filial piety and regard but he hesitated then added as though thinking aloud it is as much as my head is worth  how much is your head worth asked pak chung chang in a thin small voice  a not remarkable head said yi chin ho an absurdly unremarkable head but such is my great foolishness i value it at nothing less than one hundred thousand strings of cash  so be it said pak chung chang rising to his feet  i shall need horses to carry the treasure said yi chin ho and men to guard it well as i journey through the mountains there are robbers abroad in the land  there are robbers abroad in the land said pak chung chang sadly but it shall be as you wish so long as my ancient and verymuchtoberespected ancestors nose abide in its appointed place  say nothing to any man of this occurrence said yi chin ho else will other and more loyal servants than i be sent to strike off your fathers nose  and so yi chin ho departed on his way through the mountains blithe of heart and gay of song as he listened to the jingling bells of his treasureladen ponies  there is little more to tell yi chin ho prospered through the years by his efforts the jailer attained at length to the directorship of all the prisons of chosen the governor ultimately betook himself to the sacred city to be prime minister to the king while yi chin ho became the kings boon companion and sat at table with him to the end of a round fat life but pak chung chang fell into a melancholy and ever after he shook his head sadly with tears in his eyes whenever he regarded the expensive nose of his ancient and verymuchtoberespected ancestor
