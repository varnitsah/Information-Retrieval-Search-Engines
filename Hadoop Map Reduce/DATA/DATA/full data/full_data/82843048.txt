which is only divided from the      managing clerks room by a   partition of wood and clear glass      and when the door into this outer office is opened there can be      seen the wide outer door leading out on to the stone stairway of      the building  the other of these two   centre doors leads to      the junior clerks room  the third door is that leading to the      partners room

woman twentysix years      old unpretentiously dressed with black hair and eyes and an      ivorywhite clearcut face  she stands very still having a      natural dignity of pose and gesture       sweedle goes out into the partners room with the passbook  cokeson  looking round at ruth  the young mans out suspiciously  state your business please  ruth  who speaks in a matteroffact voice and with a slight westcountry accent  its a personal matter sir  cokeson  we dont allow private callers here  will you leave a message  ruth  id rather see him please       she narrows her dark eyes and gives him a honeyed look  cokeson  expanding  its all against the rules  suppose i had my friends here to see me  itd never do  ruth  no sir  cokeson  a little taken aback  exactly  and here you are wanting to see a junior clerk  ruth  yes sir i must see him  cokeson  turning full round to her with a sort of outraged interest  but this is a lawyers office  go to his private address  ruth  hes not

cant tell you that       sweedle comes back  he crosses to the outer office and passes      through into it with a quizzical look at cokeson carefully      leaving the door an inch or two open  cokeson  fortified by this look  this wont do you know this wont do at all  suppose one of the partners came in       an incoherent knocking and chuckling is heard from the outer      door of the outer office  sweedle  putting his head in  theres some children outside here  ruth  theyre mine please  sweedle  shall i hold them in check  ruth  theyre quite small sir she takes a step towards

falder has entered through the outer office  he is a pale      goodlooking young man with quick rather scared eyes  he      moves towards the door of the clerks office and stands there      irresolute  cokeson  well ill give you a minute  its not regular       taking up a bundle of papers he goes out into the partners      room  ruth  in a low hurried voice  hes on the drink again will  he tried to

outer office  cokeson advances deliberately to his chair and      seats himself  cokeson  this isnt right falder  falder  it shant occur again sir  cokeson  its an improper use of these premises  falder  yes sir  cokeson  you quite understandthe party was in some distress and having children with her i allowed my feelingshe opens a drawer and produces from it a tract  just take this  purity in

hand before he left  falder  i shall have done with it tomorrow sirfor good  cokeson  its over a week since davis went  now it wont do falder  youre neglecting your work for private life  i shant mention about the party having called but  falder  passing into his room thank you sir       cokeson stares at the door through which falder has gone out      then shakes his head and is just settling down to write when      walter how comes in through the outer office  he is a rather      refinedlooking man of thirtyfive with a pleasant almost      apologetic voice  walter  goodmorning cokeson  cokeson  morning mr walter  walter  my father here  cokeson  always with a certain patronage as to a young man who might be doing better  mr james has been here since eleven oclock  walter  ive been

dont want the responsibility  cokeson  with an indescribable air of compassion  just as you like  this rightofway caseweve got em on the deeds  walter  i know but the intention was obviously to exclude that bit of common ground  cokeson  we neednt worry about that  were the right side of the law  walter  i dont like it  cokeson  with an indulgent smile  we shant want to set ourselves up against the law  your father wouldnt waste his time doing that       as he speaks james how comes in from the partners room  he is      a shortish man with white sidewhiskers plentiful grey hair      shrewd eyes and gold pincenez  james  morning walter  walter  how are you father  cokeson  looking down his nose at the papers in his hand as though deprecating their size ill just take boulters lease in to young falder to draft the instructions he goes out into falders room  walter  about that rightofway case  james  oh well we must go forward there  i thought you told me yesterday the firms

james  you gave it to davis and davis sailed for australia on monday  looks black cokeson  cokeson  puzzled and upset  why thisd be a felony  no no theres some mistake  james  i hope so  cokeson  theres never been anything of that sort in the office the twentynine years ive been here  james  looking at cheque and counterfoil  this is a very clever bit of work a warning to you not to leave space after your figures walter  walter  vexed  yes i knowi was in such a tearing hurry that afternoon  cokeson  suddenly  this has upset me  james  the counterfoil altered toovery deliberate piece of swindling  what was daviss ship  walter  city of rangoon  james  we ought to wire and have him arrested at naples he cant be there yet  cokeson  his poor young wife  i liked the young man  dear oh dear  in this office  walter  shall i go to the bank and ask the cashier  james  grimly  bring him round here  and ring up scotland yard  walter  really       he goes out through the outer office  james paces the room  he      stops and looks at cokeson who is disconsolately rubbing the      knees of his trousers  james  well cokeson  theres something in character isnt there  cokeson  looking at him over his spectacles  i dont quite take you sir  james  your story would sound dd thin to any one who didnt know you  cokeson  yees  he laughs  then with a sudden gravity  im sorry for that young man  i feel it as if it was my own son mr james  james  a nasty business  cokeson  it unsettles you  all goes on regular and then a thing like this happens  shant relish my lunch today  james  as bad as that cokeson  cokeson  it makes you think  confidentially  he must have had temptation  james  not so fast  we havent convicted him yet  cokeson  id sooner have lost a months salary than had this happen     he broods  james  i hope that fellow will hurry up  cokeson  keeping things pleasant for the cashier  it isnt fifty yards mr james  he wont be a minute  james  the idea of dishonesty about this office it hits me hard cokeson       he goes towards the door of the partners room  sweedle  entering quietly to cokeson in a low voice  shes popped up again sirsomething she forgot to say to falder  cokeson  roused from his abstraction  eh  impossible  send her away  james  whats that  cokeson  nothing mr james  a private matter  here ill come myself  he goes into the outer office as

walter  your fathers in there       walter crosses and goes into the partners room  cokeson  its a nahsty unpleasant little matter mr cowley  im quite ashamed to have to trouble you  cowley  i remember the cheque quite well  as if it were a liver seemed in perfect order  cokeson  sit down wont you  im not a sensitive man but a thing like this about the placeits not nice  i like people to be open and jolly together  cowley  quite so  cokeson  buttonholing him and glancing toward the partners room of course hes a young man  ive told him about it before now leaving space after his figures but he will do it  cowley  i should remember the persons facequite a youth  cokeson  i dont think we shall be able to show him to you as a matter of fact       james and walter have come back from the partners room  james  goodmorning mr cowley  youve seen my son and myself youve seen mr cokeson and youve seen sweedle my officeboy  it was none of us i take it       the cashier shakes his head with a smile  james  be so good as to sit there  cokeson engage mr cowley in conversation will you       he goes toward falders room  cokeson  just a word mr james  james  well  cokeson  you dont want to upset the young man in there do you hes a nervous young feller  james  this must be thoroughly cleared up cokeson for the sake of falders name to say nothing of yours  cokeson  with some dignity thatll look after itself sir  hes been upset once this morning i dont want him startled again  james  its a matter of form but i cant stand upon niceness over a thing like thistoo serious  just talk to mr cowley       he opens the door of falders room  james  bring in the papers in boulters lease will you falder  cokeson  bursting into voice  do you keep dogs       the cashier with his eyes fixed on the door does not answer  cokeson  you havent such a thing as a bulldog pup you could spare me i suppose       at the look on the cashiers face his jaw drops and he turns to      see falder standing in the doorway with his eyes fixed on      cowley like the eyes of a rabbit fastened on a snake  falder  advancing with the papers here they are sir  james  taking them thank you  falder  do you want me sir  james  no thanks       falder turns and goes back into his own room  as he shuts the      door james gives the cashier an interrogative look and the      cashier nods  james  sure  this isnt as we suspected  cowley  quite  he knew me  i suppose he cant slip out of that room  cokeson  gloomily  theres only the windowa whole floor and a basement       the door of falders room is quietly opened and falder with      his hat in his hand moves towards the door of the outer office  james  quietly  where are you going falder  falder  to have my lunch sir  james  wait a few minutes would you  i want to speak to you about this lease  falder  yes sir  he goes back into his room  cowley  if im wanted i can swear thats the young man who cashed the cheque  it was the last cheque i handled that morning before my lunch  these are the numbers of the notes he had  he puts a slip of paper on the table then brushing his hat round  goodmorning  james  goodmorning mr cowley  cowley  to cokeson  goodmorning  cokeson  with stupefaction  goodmorning       the cashier goes out through the outer office cokeson sits down      in his chair as though it were the only place left in the      morass of his feelings  walter  what are you going to do  james  have him in  give me the cheque and the counterfoil  cokeson  i dont understand  i thought young davis  james  we shall see  walter  one moment father have you thought it out  james  call him in  cokeson  rising with difficulty and opening falders door hoarsely  step in here a minute  falder  impassively  yes sir  james  turning to him suddenly with the cheque held out  you know this cheque falder  falder  no sir  jades  look at it  you cashed it last friday week  falder  oh yes sir that onedavis gave it me  james  i know and you gave davis the cash  falder  yes sir  james  when davis gave you the cheque was it exactly like this  falder  yes i think so sir  james  you know that mr walter drew that cheque for nine pounds  falder  no sirninety  james  nine falder  falder  faintly  i dont understand sir  james  the suggestion of course is that the cheque was altered whether by you or davis is the question  falder  ii  cokeson  take your time take your time  falder  regaining his impassivity  not by me sir  james  the cheque was handed tocokeson by mr walter at one oclock we know that because mr cokesons lunch had just arrived  cokeson  i couldnt leave it  james  exactly he therefore gave the cheque to davis  it was cashed by you at 115  we know that because the cashier recollects it for the last cheque he handled before his lunch  falder  yes sir davis gave it to me because some friends were giving him a farewell luncheon  james  puzzled you accuse davis then  falder  i dont know sirits very funny       walter who has come close to his father says something to him      in a low voice  james  davis was not here again after that saturday was he  cokeson  anxious to be of assistance to the young man and seeing faint signs of their all being jolly once more no he sailed on the monday  james  was he falder  falder  very faintly  no sir  james  very well then how do you account for the fact that this nought was added to the nine in the counterfoil on or after tuesday  cokeson  surprised  hows that       falder gives a sort of lurch he tries to pull himself together      but he has gone all to pieces  james  very grimly  out im afraid cokeson  the chequebook remained in mr walters pocket till he came back from trenton on tuesday morning  in the face of this falder do you still deny that you altered both cheque and counterfoil  falder  no sirno mr how  i did it sir i did it  cokeson  succumbing to his feelings  dear dear what a thing to do  falder  i wanted the money so badly sir  i didnt know what i was doing  cokeson  however such a thing could have come into your head  falder  grasping at the words  i cant think sir really  it was just a minute of madness  james  a long minute falder  tapping the counterfoil four days at least  falder  sir i swear i didnt know what id done till afterwards and then i hadnt the pluck  oh  sir look over it  ill pay the money backi will i promise  james  go into your room       falder with a swift imploring look goes back into his room      there is silence  james  about as bad a case as there could be  cokeson  to break the law like thatin here  walter  whats to be done  james  nothing for it  prosecute  walter  its his first offence  james  shaking his head  ive grave doubts of that  too neat a piece of swindling altogether  cokeson  i shouldnt be surprised if he was tempted  james  lifes one long temptation cokeson  cokeson  yees but im speaking of the flesh and the devil mr james  there was a woman come to see him this morning  walter  the woman we passed as we came in just now  is it his wife  cokeson  no no relation  restraining what in jollier circumstances would have been a wink  a married person though  walter  how do you know  cokeson  brought her children  scandalised  there they were outside the office  james  a real bad egg  walter  i should like to give him a chance  james  i cant forgive him for the sneaky way he went to work counting on our suspecting young davis if the matter came to light it was the merest accident the chequebook stayed in your pocket  walter  it must have been the temptation of a moment  he hadnt time  james  a man doesnt succumb like that in a moment if hes a clean mind and habits  hes rotten got the eyes of a man who cant keep his hands off when theres money about  walter  dryly we hadnt noticed that before  james  brushing the remark aside ive seen lots of those fellows in my time  no doing anything with them except to keep em out of harms way  theyve got a blind spat  walter  its penal servitude  cokeson  theyre nahsty placesprisons  james  hesitating i dont see how its possible to spare him  out of the question to keep him in this officehonestys the sine qua non  cokeson  hypnotised of course it is  james  equally out of the question to send him out amongst people whove no knowledge of his character  one must think of society  walter  but to brand him like this  james  if it had been a straightforward case id give him another chance  its far from that  he has dissolute habits  cokeson  i didnt say thatextenuating circumstances  james  same thing  hes gone to work in the most coldblooded way to defraud his employers and cast the blame on an innocent man  if thats not a case for the law to take its course i dont know what is  walter  for the sake of his future though  james  sarcastically  according to you no one would ever prosecute  walter  nettled  i hate the idea of it  cokeson  thats rather ex parte mr walter  we must have protection  james  this is degenerating into talk       he moves towards the partners room  walter  put yourself in his place father  james  you ask too much of me  walter  we cant possibly tell the pressure there was on him  james  you may depend on it my boy if a man is going to do this sort of thing hell do it pressure or no pressure if he isnt nothingll make him  walter  hell never do it again  cokeson  fatuously spose i were to have a talk with him  we dont want to be hard on the young man  james  thatll do cokeson  ive made up my mind  he passes into the partners room  cokeson  after a doubtful moment  we must excuse your father  i dont want to go against your father if he thinks it right  walter  confound it cokeson why dont you back me up  you know you feel  cokeson  on his dignity  i really cant say what i feel  walter  we shall regret it  cokeson  he must have known what he was doing  walter  bitterly  the quality of mercy is not strained  cokeson  looking at him askance  come come mr walter  we must try and see it sensible  sweedle  entering with a tray your lunch sir  cokeson  put it down       while sweedle is putting it down on cokesons table the      detective wister enters the outer office and finding no one      there comes to the inner doorway  he is a square mediumsized      man cleanshaved in a serviceable blue serge suit and strong      boots  cokeson  hoarsely  here  here  what are we doing  wister  to walter  from scotland yard sir  detectivesergeant blister  walter  askance very well  ill speak to my father       he goes into the partners room  james enters  james  morning  in answer to an appealing gesture from cokeson im sorry id stop short of this if i felt i could  open that door sweedle wondering and scared opens it come here mr falder       as falder comes shrinkingly out the detective in obedience to a      sign from james slips his hand out and grasps his arm  falder  recoiling oh nooh no  walter  come come theres a good lad  james  i charge him with felony  falter  oh sir  theres some onei did it for her  let me be till tomorrow       james motions with his hand  at that sign of hardness falder      becomes rigid  then turning he goes out quietly in the      detectives grip  james follows stiff and erect  sweedle      rushing to the door with open mouth pursues them through the      outer office into the corridor  when they have all disappeared      cokeson spins completely round and makes a rush for the outer      office  cokeson hoarsely here  what are we doing       there is silence  he takes out his handkerchief and mops the      sweat from his face  going back blindly to his table sits      down and stares blankly at his lunch                            the curtain falls      act ii  a court of justice on a foggy october afternoon crowded with barristers solicitors reporters ushers and jurymen  sitting in the large solid dock is falder with a warder on either side of him placed there for his safe custody but seemingly indifferent to and unconscious of his presence  falder is sitting exactly opposite to the judge who raised above the clamour of the court also seems unconscious of and indifferent to everything  harold cleaver the counsel for the crown is a dried yellowish man of more than middle age in a wig worn almost to the colour of his face  hector frome the counsel for the defence is a young tall man clean shaved in a very white wig  among the spectators  having already given their evidence are james and walter how and cowley the cashier  wister the detective is just leaving the witnessbox  cleaver  that is the case for the crown me lud       gathering his robes together he sits down  frome  rising and bowing to the judge if it please your lordship and gentlemen of the jury  i am not going to dispute the fact that the prisoner altered this cheque but i am going to put before you evidence as to the condition of his mind and to submit that you would not be justified in finding that he was responsible for his actions at the time  i am going to show you in fact that he did this in a moment of aberration amounting to temporary insanity caused by the violent distress under which he was labouring gentlemen the prisoner is only twentythree years old  i shall call before you a woman from whom you will learn the events that led up to this act  you will hear from her own lips the tragic circumstances of her life the still more tragic infatuation with which she has inspired the prisoner  this woman gentlemen has been leading a miserable existence with a husband who habitually illuses her from whom she actually goes in terror of her life  i am not of course saying that its either right or desirable for a young man to fall in love with a married woman or that its his business to rescue her from an ogrelike husband  im not saying anything of the sort  but we all know the power of the passion of love and i would ask you to remember gentlemen in listening to her evidence that married to a drunken and violent husband she has no power to get rid of him for as you know another offence besides violence is necessary to enable a woman to obtain a divorce and of this offence it does not appear that her husband is guilty  judge  is this relevant mr frome  frome  my lord i submit extremelyi shall be able to show your lordship that directly  judge  very well  frome  in these circumstances what alternatives were left to her she could either go on living with this drunkard in terror of her life or she could apply to the court for a separation order  well gentlemen my experience of such cases assures me that this would have given her very insufficient protection from the violence of such a man and even if effectual would very likely have reduced her either to the workhouse or the streetsfor its not easy as she is now finding for an unskilled woman without means of livelihood to support herself and her children without resorting either to the poor law orto speak quite plainlyto the sale of her body  judge  you are ranging rather far mr frome  frome  i shall fire pointblank in a minute my lord  judge  let us hope so  frome  now gentlemen markand this is what i have been leading up tothis woman will tell you and the prisoner will confirm her that confronted with such alternatives she set her whole hopes on himself knowing the feeling with which she had inspired him  she saw a way out of her misery by going with him to a new country where they would both be unknown and might pass as husband and wife  this was a desperate and as my friend mr cleaver will no doubt call it an immoral resolution but as a fact the minds of both of them were constantly turned towards it  one wrong is no excuse for another and those who are never likely to be faced by such a situation possibly have the right to hold up their handsas to that i prefer to say nothing  but whatever view you take gentlemen of this part of the prisoners storywhatever opinion you form of the right of these two young people under such circumstances to take the law into their own handsthe fact remains that this young woman in her distress and this young man little more than a boy who was so devotedly attached to her did conceive thisif you like reprehensible design of going away together  now for that of course they required money andthey had none  as to the actual events of the morning of july 7th on which this cheque was altered the events on which i rely to prove the defendants irresponsibility i shall allow those events to speak for themselves through the lips of my witness  robert cokeson  he turns looks round takes up a sheet of paper and waits       cokeson is summoned into court and goes into the witnessbox      holding his hat before him  the oath is administered to him  frome  what is your name  cokeson  robert cokeson  frome  are you managing clerk to the firm of solicitors who employ the prisoner  cokeson  yees  frome  how long had the prisoner been in their employ  cokeson  two years  no im wrong thereall but seventeen days  frome  had you him under your eye all that time  cokeson  except sundays and holidays  frome  quite so  let us hear please what you have to say about his general character during those two years  cokeson  confidentially to the jury and as if a little surprised at being asked  he was a nice pleasantspoken young man  id no fault to find with himquite the contrary  it was a great surprise to me when he did a thing like that  frome  did he ever give you reason to suspect his honesty  cokeson  no  to have dishonesty in our office thatd never do  frome  im sure the jury fully appreciate that mr cokeson  cokeson  every man of business knows that honestys the sign qua non  frome  do you give him a good character all round or do you not  cokeson  turning to the judge  certainly  we were all very jolly and pleasant together until this happened  quite upset me  frome  now coming to the morning of the 7th of july the morning on which the cheque was altered  what have you to say about his demeanour that morning  cokeson  to the jury  if you ask me i dont think he was quite compos when he did it  the judge  sharply  are you suggesting that he was insane  cokeson  not compos  the judge  a little more precision please  frome  smoothly  just tell us mr cokeson  cokeson  somewhat outraged  well in my opinionlooking at the judgesuch as it ishe was jumpy at the time  the jury will understand my meaning  frome  will you tell us how you came to that conclusion  cokeson  yees i will  i have my lunch in from the restaurant a chop and a potatosaves time  that day it happened to come just as mr walter how handed me the cheque  well i like it hot so i went into the clerks office and i handed the cheque to davis the other clerk and told him to get change  i noticed young falder walking up and down  i said to him this is not the zoological gardens falder  frome  do you remember what he answered  cokeson  yees i wish to god it were  struck me as funny  frome  did you notice anything else peculiar  cokeson  i did  frome  what was that  cokeson  his collar was unbuttoned  now i like a young man to be neat  i said to him your collars unbuttoned  frome  and what did he answer  cokeson  stared at me  it wasnt nice  the judge  stared at you  isnt that a very common practice  cokeson  yees but it was the look in his eyes  i cant explain my meaningit was funny  frome  had you ever seen such a look in his eyes before  cokeson  no  if i had i should have spoken to the partners  we cant have anything eccentric in our profession  the judge  did you speak to them on that occasion  cokeson  confidentially  well i didnt like to trouble them about prime facey evidence  frome  but it made a very distinct impression on your mind  cokeson  yees  the clerk davis could have told you the same  frome  quite so  its very unfortunate that weve not got him here now can you tell me of the morning on which the discovery of the forgery was made  that would be the 18th  did anything happen that morning  cokeson  with his hand to his ear  im a little deaf  frome  was there anything in the course of that morningi mean before the discoverythat caught your attention  cokeson  yeesa woman  the judge  how is this relevant mr frome  frome  i am trying to establish the state of mind in which the prisoner committed this act my lord  the judge  i quite appreciate that  but this was long after the act  frome  yes my lord but it contributes to my contention  the judge  well  frome  you say a woman  do you mean that she came to the office  cokeson  yees  frome  what for  cokeson  asked to see young falder he was out at the moment  frome  did you see her  cokeson  i did  frome  did she come alone  cokeson  confidentially  well there you put me in a difficulty i mustnt tell you what the officeboy told me  frome  quite so mr cokeson quite so  cokeson  breaking in with an air of you are youngleave it to me  but i think we can get round it  in answer to a question put to her by a third party the woman said to me theyre mine sir  the judge  what are  what were  cokeson  her children  they were outside  the judge  how do you know  cokeson  your lordship mustnt ask me that or i shall have to tell you what i was toldand thatd never do  the judge  smiling  the officeboy made a statement  cokeson  eggzactly  frome  what i want to ask you mr cokeson is this  in the course of her appeal to see falder did the woman say anything that you specially remember  cokeson  looking at him as if to encourage him to complete the sentence  a leetle more sir  frome  or did she not  cokeson  she did  i shouldnt like you to have led me to the answer  frome  with an irritated smile  will you tell the jury what it was  cokeson  its a matter of life and death  foreman of the jury  do you mean the woman said that  cokeson  nodding  its not the sort of thing you like to have said to you  frome  a little impatiently  did falder come in while she was there  cokeson nods  and she saw him and went away  cokeson  ah  there i cant follow you  i didnt see her go  frome  well is she there now  cokeson  with an indulgent smile  no  frome  thank you mr cokeson  he sits down  cleaver  rising you say that on the morning of the forgery the prisoner was jumpy  well now sir what precisely do you mean by that word  cokeson  indulgently  i want you to understand  have you ever seen a dog thats lost its master  he was kind of everywhere at once with his eyes  cleaver  thank you i was coming to his eyes  you called them funny  what are we to understand by that  strange or what  cokeson  yees funny  cokeson  sharply  yes sir but what may be funny to you may not be funny to me or to the jury  did they look frightened or shy or fierce or what  cokeson  you make it very hard for me  i give you the word and you want me to give you another  cleaver  rapping his desk does funny mean mad  cleaver  not mad fun  cleaver  very well  now you say he had his collar unbuttoned  was it a hot day  cokeson  yees i think it was  cleaver  and did he button it when you called his attention to it  cokeson  yees i think he did  cleaver  would you say that that denoted insanity       he sits downs  cokeson who has opened his mouth to reply is      left gaping  frome  rising hastily have you ever caught him in that dishevelled state before  cokeson  no  he was always clean and quiet  frome  that will do thank you       cokeson turns blandly to the judge as though to rebuke counsel      for not remembering that the judge might wish to have a chance      arriving at the conclusion that he is to be asked nothing      further he turns and descends from the box and sits down next      to james and walter  frome  ruth honeywill       ruth comes into court and takes her stand stoically in the      witnessbox  she is sworn  frome  what is your name please  ruth  ruth honeywill  frome  how old are you  ruth  twentysix  frome  you are a married woman living with your husband  a little louder  ruth  no sir not since july  frome  have you any children  ruth  yes sir two  frome  are they living with you  ruth  yes sir  frome  you know the prisoner  ruth looking at him  yes  frome  what was the nature of your relations with him  ruth  we were friends  the judge  friends  ruth  simply  lovers sir  the judge  sharply  in what sense do you use that word  ruth  we love each other  the judge  yes but  ruth  shaking her head  no your lordshipnot yet  the judge  not yet  hm  he looks from ruth to falder  well  frome  what is your husband  ruth  traveller  frome  and what was the nature of your married life  ruth  shaking her head  it dont bear talking about  frome  did he illtreat you or what  ruth  ever since my first was born  frome  in what way  ruth  id rather not say  all sorts of ways  the judge  i am afraid i must stop this you know  ruth  pointing to falder  he offered to take me out of it sir we were going to south america  frome  hastily  yes quiteand what prevented you  ruth  i was outside his office when he was taken away  it nearly broke my heart  frome  you knew then that he had been arrested  ruth  yes sir  i called at his office afterwards and  pointing to cokeson that gentleman told me all about it  frome  now do you remember the morning of friday july 7th  ruth  yes  frome  why  ruth  my husband nearly strangled me that morning  the judge  nearly strangled you  ruth  bowing her head yes my lord  frome  with his hands or  ruth  yes i just managed to get away from him  i went straight to my friend  it was eight oclock  the judge  in the morning  your husband was not under the influence of liquor then  ruth  it wasnt always that  frome  in what condition were you  ruth  in very bad condition sir  my dress was torn and i was half choking  frome  did you tell your friend what had happened  ruth  yes  i wish i never had  frome  it upset him  ruth  dreadfully  frome  did he ever speak to you about a cheque  ruth  never  froze  did he ever give you any money  ruth  yes  frome  when was that  ruth  on saturday  frome  the 8th  ruth  to buy an outfit for me and the children and get all ready to start  frome  did that surprise you or not  ruth  what sir  frome  that he had money to give you  ring  yes because on the morning when my husband nearly killed me my friend cried because he hadnt the money to get me away  he told me afterwards hed come into a windfall  frome  and when did you last see him  ruth  the day he was taken away sir  it was the day we were to have started  frome  oh yes the morning of the arrest  well did you see him at all between the friday and that morning  ruth nods  what was his manner then  ruth  dumblikesometimes he didnt seem able to say a word  frome  as if something unusual had happened to him  ruth  yes  frome  painful or pleasant or what  ruth  like a fate hanging over him  frome  hesitating  tell me did you love the prisoner very much  ruth  bowing her head  yes  frome  and had he a very great affection for you  ruth  looking at falder  yes sir  frome  now maam do you or do you not think that your danger and unhappiness would seriously affect his balance his control over his actions  ruth  yes  frome  his reason even  ruth  for a moment like i think it would  frome  was he very much upset that friday morning or was he fairly calm  ruth  dreadfully upset  i could hardly bear to let him go from me  frome  do you still love him  ruth  with her eyes on falder  hes ruined himself for me  frome  thank you       he sits down  ruth remains stoically upright in the witnessbox  cleaver  in a considerate voice  when you left him on the morning of friday the 7th you would not say that he was out of his mind i suppose  ruth  no sir  cleaver  thank you ive no further questions to ask you  ruth  bending a little forward to the jury  i would have done the same for him i would indeed  the judge  please please  you say your married life is an unhappy one  faults on both sides  ruth  only that i never bowed down to him  i dont see why i should sir not to a man like that  the judge  you refused to obey him  ruth  avoiding the question  ive always studied him to keep things nice  the judge  until you met the prisonerwas that it  ruth  no even after that  the judge  i ask you know because you seem to me to glory in this affection of yours for the prisoner  ruth  hesitating  ii do  its the only thing in my life now  the judge  staring at her hard well step down please       ruth looks at falder then passes quietly down and takes her      seat among the witnesses  frome  i call the prisoner my lord       falder leaves the dock goes into the witnessbox and is duly      sworn  frome  what is your name  falder  william falder  frome  and age  falder  twentythree  frome  you are not married       falder shakes his head  frome  how long have you known the last witness  falder  six months  frome  is her account of the relationship between you a correct one  falder  yes  frome  you became devotedly attached to her however  falder  yes  the judge  though you knew she was a married woman  falder  i couldnt help it your lordship  the judge  couldnt help it  falder  i didnt seem able to       the judge slightly shrugs his shoulders  frome  how did you come to know her  falder  through my married sister  frome  did you know whether she was happy with her husband  falder  it was trouble all the time  frome  you knew her husband  falder  only through herhes a brute  the judge  i cant allow indiscriminate abuse of a person not present  frome  bowing  if your lordship pleases  to falder  you admit altering this cheque  falder bows his head  frome  carry your mind please to the morning of friday july the 7th and tell the jury what happened  falder  turning to the jury  i was having my breakfast when she came  her dress was all torn and she was gasping and couldnt seem to get her breath at all there were the marks of his fingers round her throat her arm was bruised and the blood had got into her eyes dreadfully  it frightened me and then when she told me i felti feltwellit was too much for me  hardening suddenly  if youd seen it having the feelings for her that i had youd have felt the same i know  frome  yes  falder  when she left mebecause i had to go to the officei was out of my senses for fear that hed do it again and thinking what i could do  i couldnt workall the morning i was like thatsimply couldnt fix my mind on anything  i couldnt think at all  i seemed to have to keep moving  when davisthe other clerkgave me the chequehe said itll do you good will to have a run with this you seem half off your chump this morning  then when i had it in my handi dont know how it came but it just flashed across me that if i put the ty and the nought there would be the money to get her away  it just came and wenti never thought of it again  then davis went out to his luncheon and i dont really remember what i did till id pushed the cheque through to the cashier under the rail i remember his saying gold or notes  then i suppose i knew what id done  anyway when i got outside i wanted to chuck myself under a bus i wanted to throw the money away but it seemed i was in for it so i thought at any rate id save her  of course the tickets i took for the passage and the little i gave hers been wasted and all except what i was obliged to spend myself ive restored  i keep thinking over and over however it was i came to do it and how i cant have it all again to do differently       falder is silent twisting his hands before him  frome  how far is it from your office to the bank  falder  not more than fifty yards sir  frome  from the time davis went out to lunch to the time you cashed the cheque how long do you say it must have been  falder  it couldnt have been four minutes sir because i ran all the way  frome  during those four minutes you say you remember nothing  falder  no sir only that i ran  frome  not even adding the ty and the nought  falder  no sir  i dont really       frome sits down and cleaver rises  cleaver  but you remember running do you  falder  i was all out of breath when i got to the bank  cleaver  and you dont remember altering the cheque  falder  faintly  no sir  cleaver  divested of the romantic glamour which my friend is casting over the case is this anything but an ordinary forgery  come  falder  i was half frantic all that morning sir  cleaver  now now  you dont deny that the ty and the nought were so like the rest of the handwriting as to thoroughly deceive the cashier  falder  it was an accident  cleaver  cheerfully  queer sort of accident wasnt it  on which day did you alter the counterfoil  falder  hanging his head  on the wednesday morning  cleaver  was that an accident too  falder  faintly  no  cleaver  to do that you had to watch your opportunity i suppose  falder  almost inaudibly yes  cleaver  you dont suggest that you were suffering under great excitement when you did that  falder  i was haunted  cleaver  with the fear of being found out  falder  very low yes  the judge  didnt it occur to you that the only thing for you to do was to confess to your employers and restore the money  falder  i was afraid there is silence  cleaver  you desired too no doubt to complete your design of taking this woman away  falder  when i found id done a thing like that to do it for nothing seemed so dreadful  i might just as well have chucked myself into the river  cleaver  you knew that the clerk davis was about to leave england didnt it occur to you when you altered this cheque that suspicion would fall on him  falder  it was all done in a moment  i thought of it afterwards  cleaver  and that didnt lead you to avow what youd done  falder  sullenly  i meant to write when i got out therei would have repaid the money  the judge  but in the meantime your innocent fellow clerk might have been prosecuted  falder  i knew he was a long way off your lordship  i thought thered be time  i didnt think theyd find it out so soon  frome  i might remind your lordship that as mr walter how had the chequebook in his pocket till after davis had sailed if the discovery had been made only one day later falder himself would have left and suspicion would have attached to him and not to davis from the beginning  the judge  the question is whether the prisoner knew that suspicion would light on himself and not on davis  to falder sharply did you know that mr walter how had the chequebook till after davis had sailed  falder  iithoughthe  the judge  now speak the truthyes or no  falder  very low  no my lord  i had no means of knowing  the judge  that disposes of your point mr frome       frome bows to the judge  cleaver  has any aberration of this nature ever attacked you before  falder  faintly  no sir  cleaver  you had recovered sufficiently to go back to your work that afternoon  falder  yes i had to take the money back  cleaver  you mean the nine pounds  your wits were sufficiently keen for you to remember that  and you still persist in saying you dont remember altering this cheque  he sits down  falder  if i hadnt been mad i should never have had the courage  frome  rising  did you have your lunch before going back  falder  i never ate a thing all day and at night i couldnt sleep  frome  now as to the four minutes that elapsed between daviss going out and your cashing the cheque do you say that you recollect nothing during those four minutes  falder  after a moment i remember thinking of mr cokesons face  frome  of mr cokesons face  had that any connection with what you were doing  falder  no sir  frome  was that in the office before you ran out  falder  yes and while i was running  frome  and that lasted till the cashier said will you have gold or notes  falder  yes and then i seemed to come to myselfand it was too late  frome  thank you  that closes the evidence for the defence my lord       the judge nods and falder goes back to his seat in the dock  frome  gathering up notes  if it please your lordshipgentlemen of the jurymy friend in crossexamination has shown a disposition to sneer at the defence which has been set up in this case and i am free to admit that nothing i can say will move you if the evidence has not already convinced you that the prisoner committed this act in a moment when to all practical intents and purposes he was not responsible for his actions a moment of such mental and moral vacuity arising from the violent emotional agitation under which he had been suffering as to amount to temporary madness  my friend has alluded to the romantic glamour with which i have sought to invest this case  gentlemen i have done nothing of the kind  i have merely shown you the background of lifethat palpitating life which believe mewhatever my friend may sayalways lies behind the commission of a crime  now gentlemen we live in a highly civilized age and the sight of brutal violence disturbs us in a very strange way even when we have no personal interest in the matter  but when we see it inflicted on a woman whom we lovewhat then  just think of what your own feelings would have been each of you at the prisoners age and then look at him  well  he is hardly the comfortable shall we say bucolic person likely to contemplate with equanimity marks of gross violence on a woman to whom he was devotedly attached  yes gentlemen look at him  he has not a strong face but neither has he a vicious face  he is just the sort of man who would easily become the prey of his emotions  you have heard the description of his eyes  my friend may laugh at the word funnyi think it better describes the peculiar uncanny look of those who are strained to breakingpoint than any other word which could have been used  i dont pretend mind you that his mental irresponsibilitywas more than a flash of darkness in which all sense of proportion became lost but to contend that just as a man who destroys himself at such a moment may be and often is absolved from the stigma attaching to the crime of selfmurder so he may and frequently does commit other crimes while in this irresponsible condition and that he may as justly be acquitted of criminal intent and treated as a patient  i admit that this is a plea which might well be abused  it is a matter for discretion  but here you have a case in which there is every reason to give the benefit of the doubt you heard me ask the prisoner what he thought of during those four fatal minutes  what was his answer  i thought of mr cokesons face  gentlemen no man could invent an answer like that it is absolutely stamped with truth  you have seen the great affection legitimate or not existing between him and this woman who came here to give evidence for him at the risk of her life  it is impossible for you to doubt his distress on the morning when he committed this act  we well know what terrible havoc such distress can make in weak and highly nervous people  it was all the work of a moment  the rest has followed as death follows a stab to the heart or water drops if you hold up a jug to empty it  believe me gentlemen there is nothing more tragic in life than the utter impossibility of changing what you have done  once this cheque was altered and presented the work of four minutesfour mad minutes the rest has been silence  but in those four minutes the boy before you has slipped through a door hardly opened into that great cage which never again quite lets a man gothe cage of the law  his further acts his failure to confess the alteration of the counterfoil his preparations for flight are all evidencenot of deliberate and guilty intention when he committed the prime act from which these subsequent acts arose nothey are merely evidence of the weak character which is clearly enough his misfortune  but is a man to be lost because he is bred and born with a weak character gentlemen men like the prisoner are destroyed daily under our law for want of that human insight which sees them as they are patients and not criminals  if the prisoner be found guilty and treated as though he were a criminal type he will as all experience shows in all probability become one  i beg you not to return a verdict that may thrust him back into prison and brand him for ever  gentlemen justice is a machine that when some one has once given it the starting push rolls on of itself  is this young man to be ground to pieces under this machine for an act which at the worst was one of weakness  is he to become a member of the luckless crews that man those dark illstarred ships called prisons  is that to be his voyagefrom which so few return  or is he to have another chance to be still looked on as one who has gone a little astray but who will come back  i urge you gentlemen do not ruin this young man  for as a result of those four minutes ruin utter and irretrievable stares him in the face  he can be saved now  imprison him as a criminal and i affirm to you that he will be lost  he has neither the face nor the manner of one who can survive that terrible ordeal weigh in the scales his criminality and the suffering he has undergone  the latter is ten times heavier already  he has lain in prison under this charge for more than two months  is he likely ever to forget that  imagine the anguish of his mind during that time he has had his punishment gentlemen you may depend  the rolling of the chariotwheels of justice over this boy began when it was decided to prosecute him  we are now already at the second stage  if you permit it to go on to the third i would not givethat for him       he holds up finger and thumb in the form of a circle drops his      hand and sits dozen  the jury stir and consult each others faces then they turn towards the counsel for the crown who rises and fixing his eyes on a spot that seems to give him satisfaction slides them every now and then towards the jury  cleaver  may it please your lordshiprising on his toes gentlemen of the jurythe facts in this case are not disputed and the defence if my friend will allow me to say so is so thin that i dont propose to waste the time of the court by taking you over the evidence  the plea is one of temporary insanity  well gentlemen i daresay it is clearer to me than it is to you why this ratherwhat shall we call itbizarre defence has been set up  the alternative would have been to plead guilty  now gentlemen if the prisoner had pleaded guilty my friend would have had to rely on a simple appeal to his lordship  instead of that he has gone into the byways and hedges and found thiserpeculiar plea which has enabled him to show you the proverbial woman to put her in the boxto give in fact a romantic glow to this affair  i compliment my friend i think it highly ingenious of him  by these means he hasto a certain extentgot round the law  he has brought the whole story of motive and stress out in court at first hand in a way that he would not otherwise have been able to do  but when you have once grasped that fact gentlemen you have grasped everything  with goodhumoured contempt  for look at this plea of insanity we cant put it lower than that  you have heard the woman  she has every reason to favour the prisoner but what did she say  she said that the prisoner was not insane when she left him in the morning  if he were going out of his mind through distress that was obviously the moment when insanity would have shown itself  you have heard the managing clerk another witness for the defence  with some difficulty i elicited from him the admission that the prisoner though jumpy a word that he seemed to think you would understand gentlemen and im sure i hope you do was not mad when the cheque was handed to davis  i agree with my friend that its unfortunate that we have not got davis here but the prisoner has told you the words with which davis in turn handed him the cheque he obviously therefore was not mad when he received it or he would not have remembered those words  the cashier has told you that he was certainly in his senses when he cashed it  we have therefore the plea that a man who is sane at ten minutes past one and sane at fifteen minutes past may for the purposes of avoiding the consequences of a crime call himself insane between those points of time  really gentlemen this is so peculiar a proposition that i am not disposed to weary you with further argument  you will form your own opinion of its value  my friend has adopted this way of saying a great deal to youand very eloquentlyon the score of youth temptation and the like  i might point out however that the offence with which the prisoner is charged is one of the most serious known to our law and there are certain features in this case such as the suspicion which he allowed to rest on his innocent fellowclerk and his relations with this married woman which will render it difficult for you to attach too much importance to such pleading i ask you in short gentlemen for that verdict of guilty which in the circumstances i regard you as unfortunately bound to record       letting his eyes travel from the judge and the jury to frome he      sits down  the judge  bending a little towards the jury and speaking in a businesslike voice  gentlemen you have heard the evidence and the comments on it  my only business is to make clear to you the issues you have to try  the facts are admitted so far as the alteration of this cheque and counterfoil by the prisoner  the defence set up is that he was not in a responsible condition when he committed the crime  well you have heard the prisoners story and the evidence of the other witnessesso far as it bears on the point of insanity if you think that what you have heard establishes the fact that the prisoner was insane at the time of the forgery you will find him guilty but insane  if on the other hand you conclude from what you have seen and heard that the prisoner was saneand nothing short of insanity will countyou will find him guilty  in reviewing the testimony as to his mental condition you must bear in mind very carefully the evidence as to his demeanour and conduct both before and after the act of forgerythe evidence of the prisoner himself of the woman of the witnessercokeson anderof the cashier and in regard to that i especially direct your attention to the prisoners admission that the idea of adding the ty and the nought did come into his mind at the moment when the cheque was handed to him and also to the alteration of the counterfoil and to his subsequent conduct generally  the bearing of all this on the question of premeditation and premeditation will imply sanity is very obvious  you must not allow any considerations of age or temptation to weigh with you in the finding of your verdict  before you can come to a verdict of guilty but insane you must be well and thoroughly convinced that the condition of his mind was such as would have qualified him at the moment for a lunatic asylum  he pauses then seeing that the jury are doubtful whether to retire or no adds you may retire gentlemen if you wish to do so       the jury retire by a door behind the judge  the judge bends      over his notes  falder leaning from the dock speaks excitedly      to his solicitor pointing dawn at ruth  the solicitor in turn      speaks to frome  frome  rising my lord  the prisoner is very anxious that i should ask you if your lordship would kindly request the reporters not to disclose the name of the woman witness in the press reports of these proceedings  your lordship will understand that the consequences might be extremely serious to her  the judge  pointedlywith the suspicion of a smile  well mr frome you deliberately took this course which involved bringing her here  frome with an ironic bow  if your lordship thinks i could have brought out the full facts in any other way  the judge  hm  well  frome  there is very real danger to her your lordship  the judge  you see i have to take your word for all that  frome  if your lordship would be so kind  i can assure your lordship that i am not exaggerating  the judge  it goes very much against the grain with me that the name of a witness should ever be suppressed  with a glance at falder who is gripping and clasping his hands before him and then at ruth who is sitting perfectly rigid with her eyes fixed on falder  ill consider your application  it must depend  i have to remember that she may have come here to commit perjury on the prisoners behalf  frome  your lordship i really  the judge  yes yesi dont suggest anything of the sort mr frome  leave it at that for the moment       as he finishes speaking the jury return and file back into the      box  clerk of assize  gentlemen are you agreed on your verdict  foreman  we are  clerk of assize  is it guilty or guilty but insane  foreman  guilty       the judge nods then gathering up his notes sits looking at      falder who stands motionless  frome  rising if your lordship would allow me to address you in mitigation of sentence  i dont know if your lordship thinks i can add anything to what i have said to the jury on the score of the prisoners youth and the great stress under which he acted  the judge  i dont think you can mr frome  frome  if your lordship says soi do most earnestly beg your lordship to give the utmost weight to my plea  he sits down  the judge  to the clerk call upon him  the clerk  prisoner at the bar you stand convicted of felony  have you anything to say for yourself why the court should not give you judgment according to law  falder shakes his head  the judge  william falder you have been given fair trial and found guilty in my opinion rightly found guilty of forgery  he pauses then consulting his notes goes on  the defence was set up that you were not responsible for your actions at the moment of committing this crime  there is no doubt i think that this was a device to bring out at first hand the nature of the temptation to which you succumbed  for throughout the trial your counsel was in reality making an appeal for mercy  the setting up of this defence of course enabled him to put in some evidence that might weigh in that direction  whether he was well advised to so is another matter  he claimed that you should be treated rather as a patient than as a criminal  and this plea of his which in the end amounted to a passionate appeal he based in effect on an indictment of the march of justice which he practically accused of confirming and completing the process of criminality  now in considering how far i should allow weight to his appeal i have a number of factors to take into account  i have to consider on the one hand the grave nature of your offence the deliberate way in which you subsequently altered the counterfoil the danger you caused to an innocent manand that to my mind is a very grave pointand finally i have to consider the necessity of deterring others from following your example  on the other hand i have to bear in mind that you are young that you have hitherto borne a good character that you were if i am to believe your evidence and that of your witnesses in a state of some emotional excitement when you committed this crime  i have every wish consistently with my dutynot only to you but to the communityto treat you with leniency  and this brings me to what are the determining factors in my mind in my consideration of your case  you are a clerk in a lawyers officethat is a very serious element in this case there can be no possible excuse made for you on the ground that you were not fully conversant with the nature of the crime you were committing and the penalties that attach to it  it is said however that you were carried away by your emotions  the story has been told here today of your relations with thisermrs honeywill on that story both the defence and the plea for mercy were in effect based  now what is that story  it is that you a young man and she a young woman unhappily married had formed an attachment which you both saywith what truth i am unable to gauge had not yet resulted in immoral relations but which you both admit was about to result in such relationship  your counsel has made an attempt to palliate this on the ground that the woman is in what he describes i think as a hopeless position  as to that i can express no opinion  she is a married woman and the fact is patent that you committed this crime with the view of furthering an immoral design  now however i might wish i am not able to justify to my conscience a plea for mercy which has a basis inimical to morality it is vitiated ab initio and would if successful free you for the completion of this immoral project  your counsel has made an attempt to trace your offence back to what he seems to suggest is a defect in the marriage law he has made an attempt also to show that to punish you with further imprisonment would be unjust  i do not follow him in these flights  the law is what it isa majestic edifice sheltering all of us each stone of which rests on another i am concerned only with its administration  the crime you have committed is a very serious one  i cannot feel it in accordance with my duty to society to exercise the powers i have in your favour  you will go to penal servitude for three years       falder who throughout the judges speech has looked at him      steadily lets his head fall forward on his breast  ruth starts      up from her seat as he is taken out by the warders  there is a      bustle in court  the judge  speaking to the reporters gentlemen of the press i think that the name of the female witness should not be reported       the reporters bow their acquiescence  the judge  to ruth who      is staring in the direction in which falder has disappeared do      you understand your name will not be mentioned  cokeson  pulling her sleeve  the judge is speaking to you       ruth turns stares at the judge and turns away  the judge  i shall sit rather late today  call the next case  clerk of assize  to a warder  put up john booley       to cries of witnesses in the case of booley                       the curtain falls     act iii  scene i       a prison  a plainly furnished room with two large barred      windows overlooking the prisoners exercise yard where men in      yellow clothes marked with arrows and yellow brimless caps are      seen in single file at a distance of four yards from each other      walking rapidly on serpentine white lines marked on the concrete      floor of the yard  two warders in blue uniforms with peaked      caps and swords are stationed amongst them  the room has      distempered walls a bookcase with numerous officiallooking      books a cupboard between the windows a plan of the prison on      the wall a writingtable covered with documents  it is      christmas eve       the governor a neat gravelooking man with a trim fair      moustache the eyes of a theorist and grizzled hair receding      from the temples is standing close to this writingtable      looking at a sort of rough saw made out of a piece of metal      the hand in which he holds it is gloved for two fingers      are missing  the chief warder wooder a tall thin      militarylooking man of sixty with grey moustache and      melancholy monkeylike eyes stands very upright two paces      from him  the governor  with a faint abstracted smile  queerlooking affair mr wooder  where did you find it  wooder  in his mattress sir  havent come across such a thing for two years now  the governor  with curiosity had he any set plan  wooder  hed sawed his windowbar about that much  he holds up his thumb and finger a quarter of an inch apart  the governor  ill see him this afternoon  whats his name moaney  an old hand i think  wooder  yes sirfourth spell of penal  youd think an old lag like him would have had more sense by now  with pitying contempt occupied his mind he said  breaking in and breaking outthats all they think about  the governor  whos next him  wooder  ocleary sir  the governor  the irishman  wooder  next him again theres that young fellow falderstar classand next him old clipton  the governor  ah yes  the philosopher  i want to see him about his eyes  wooder  curious thing sir they seem to know when theres one of these tries at escape going on  it makes them restivetheres a regular wave going through them just now  the governor  meditatively  odd thingsthose waves  turning to look at the prisoners exercising  seem quiet enough out here  wooder  that irishman ocleary began banging on his door this morning  little thing like thats quite enough to upset the whole lot  theyre just like dumb animals at times  the governor  ive seen it with horses before thunderitll run right through cavalry lines       the prison chaplain has entered  he is a darkhaired ascetic      man in clerical undress with a peculiarly steady tightlipped      face and slow cultured speech  the governor  holding up the saw  seen this miller  the chaplain  usefullooking specimen  the governor  do for the museum eh  he goes to the cupboard and opens it displaying to view a number of quaint ropes hooks and metal tools with labels tied on them  thatll do thanks mr wooder  wooder  saluting  thank you sir  he goes out  the governor  account for the state of the men last day or two miller  seems going through the whole place  the chaplain  no  i dont know of anything  the governor  by the way will you dine with us on christmas day  the chaplain  tomorrow  thanks very much  the governor  worries me to feel the men discontented  gazing at the saw  have to punish this poor devil  cant help liking a man who tries to escape  he places the saw in his pocket and locks the cupboard again  the chaplain  extraordinary perverted willpowersome of them nothing to be done till its broken  the governor  and not much afterwards im afraid  ground too hard for golf       wooder comes in again  wooder  visitor whos been seeing q 3007 asks to speak to you sir i told him it wasnt usual  the governor  what about  wooder  shall i put him off sir  the governor  resignedly  no no  lets see him  dont go miller  wooder motions to some one without and as the visitor comes in withdraws       the visitor is cokeson who is attired in a thick overcoat to      the knees woollen gloves and carries a top hat  cokeson  im sorry to trouble you  ive been talking to the young man  the governor  we have a good many here  cokeson  name of falder forgery  producing a card and handing it to the governor  firm of james and walter how  well known in the law  the governor  receiving the cardwith a faint smile  what do you want to see me about sir  cokeson  suddenly seeing the prisoners at exercise  why what a sight  the governor  yes we have that privilege from here my office is being done up  sitting down at his table  now please  cokeson  dragging his eyes with difficulty from the window i wanted to say a word to you i shant keep you long confidentially  fact is i oughtnt to be here by rights  his sister came to mehes got no father and motherand she was in some distress  my husband wont let me go and see him she said says hes disgraced the family  and his other sister she said is an invalid  and she asked me to come  well i take an interest in him  he was our juniori go to the same chapeland i didnt like to refuse  and what i wanted to tell you was he seems lonely here  the governor  not unnaturally  cokeson  im afraid itll prey on my mind  i see a lot of them about working together  the governor  those are local prisoners  the convicts serve their three months here in separate confinement sir  cokeson  but we dont want to be unreasonable  hes quite downhearted  i wanted to ask you to let him run about with the others  the governor  with faint amusement  ring the bellwould you miller  to cokeson  youd like to hear what the doctor says about him perhaps  the chaplain  ringing the bell  you are not accustomed to prisons it would seem sir  cokeson  no  but its a pitiful sight  hes quite a young fellow i said to him before a months up i said youll be out and about with the others itll be a nice change for you  a month he said like that  come i said we mustnt exaggerate  whats a month  why its nothing  a day he said shut up in your cell thinking and brooding as i do its longer than a year outside  i cant help it he said i trybut im built that way mr cokeson  and he held his hand up to his face  i could see the tears trickling through his fingers  it wasnt nice  the chaplain  hes a young man with large rather peculiar eyes isnt he  not church of england i think  cokeson  no  the chaplain  i know  the governor  to wooder who has come in  ask the doctor to be good enough to come here for a minute  wooder salutes and goes out  lets see hes not married  cokeson  no  confidentially  but theres a party hes very much attached to not altogether comilfa  its a sad story  the chaplain  if it wasnt for drink and women sir this prison might be closed  cokeson  looking at the chaplain over his spectacles yees but i wanted to tell you about that special  he had hopes theyd have let her come and see him but they havent  of course he asked me questions  i did my best but i couldnt tell the poor young fellow a lie with him in hereseemed like hitting him  but im afraid its made him worse  the governor  what was this news then  cokeson  like this  the woman had a nahsty spiteful feller for a husband and shed left him  fact is she was going away with our young friend  its not nicebut ive looked over it  well when he was put in here she said shed earn her living apart and wait for him to come out  that was a great consolation to him  but after a month she came to mei dont know her personallyand she said i cant earn the childrens living let alone my ownive got no friends  im obliged to keep out of everybodys way else my husbandd get to know where i was  im very much reduced she said and she has lost flesh  ill have to go in the workhouse its a painful story  i said to her no i said not that  ive got a wife an family but sooner than you should do that ill spare you a little myself  really she saidshes a nice creaturei dont like to take it from you  i think id better go back to my husband well i know hes a nahsty spiteful fellerdrinksbut i didnt like to persuade her not to  the chaplain  surely no  cokeson  yees but im sorry now its upset the poor young fellow dreadfully  and what i wanted to say was hes got his three years to serve  i want things to be pleasant for him  the chaplain  with a touch of impatience the law hardly shares your view im afraid  cokeson  but i cant help thinking that to shut him up there by himselfll turn him silly  and nobody wants that i spose  i dont like to see a man cry  the chaplain  its a very rare thing for them to give way like that  cokeson  looking at himin a tone of sudden dogged hostility i keep dogs  the chaplain  indeed  cokeson  yees  and i say this i wouldnt shut one of them up all by himself month after month not if hed bit me all over  the chaplain  unfortunately the criminal is not a dog he has a sense of right and wrong  cokeson  but thats not the way to make him feel it  the chaplain  ah  there im afraid we must differ  cokeson  its the same with dogs  if you treat em with kindness theyll do anything for you but to shut em up alone it only makes em savage  the chaplain  surely you should allow those who have had a little more experience than yourself to know what is best for prisoners  cokeson  doggedly  i know this young feller ive watched him for years  hes euroticgot no stamina  his father died of consumption  im thinking of his future  if hes to be kept there shut up by himself without a cat to keep him company itll do him harm  i said to him where do you feel it  i cant tell you mr cokeson he said but sometimes i could beat my head against the wall  its not nice       during this speech the doctor has entered  he is a      mediumsized rather goodlooking man with a quick eye      he stands leaning against the window  the governor  this gentleman thinks the separate is telling on q 3007falder young thin fellow star class  what do you say doctor clements  the doctor  he doesnt like it but its not doing him any harm  cokeson  but hes told me  the doctor  of course hed say so but we can always tell  hes lost no weight since hes been here  cokeson  its his state of mind im speaking of  the doctor  his minds all right so far  hes nervous rather melancholy  i dont see signs of anything more  im watching him carefully  cokeson  nonplussed  im glad to hear you say that  the chaplain  more suavely its just at this period that we are able to make some impression on them sir  i am speaking from my special standpoint  cokeson  turning bewildered to the governor i dont want to be unpleasant but having given him this news i do feel its awkward  the governor  ill make a point of seeing him today  cokeson  im much obliged to you  i thought perhaps seeing him every day you wouldnt notice it  the governor  rather sharply  if any sign of injury to his health shows itself his case will be reported at once  thats fully provided for  he rises  cokeson  following his own thoughts  of course what you dont see doesnt trouble you but having seen him i dont want to have him on my mind  the governor  i think you may safely leave it to us sir  cokeson  mollified and apologetic  i thought youd understand me im a plain mannever set myself up against authority  expanding to the chaplain  nothing personal meant  goodmorning       as he goes out the three officials do not look at each other      but their faces wear peculiar expressions  the chaplain  our friend seems to think that prison is a hospital  cokeson  returning suddenly with an apologetic air  theres just one little thing  this womani suppose i mustnt ask you to let him see her  itd be a rare treat for them both  hes thinking about her all the time  of course shes not his wife  but hes quite safe in here  theyre a pitiful couple  you couldnt make an exception  the governor  wearily as you say my dear sir i couldnt make an exception he wont be allowed another visit of any sort till he goes to a convict prison  cokeson  i see  rather coldly sorry to have troubled you he again goes out  the chaplain  shrugging his shoulders  the plain man indeed poor fellow  come and have some lunch clements        he and the doctor go out talking       the governor with a sigh sits down at his table and takes up a      pen                            the curtain falls    scene ii       part of the ground corridor of the prison  the walls are      coloured with greenish distemper up to a stripe of deeper green      about the height of a mans shoulder and above this line are      whitewashed  the floor is of blackened stones  daylight is      filtering through a heavily barred window at the end  the doors      of four cells are visible  each cell door has a little round      peephole at the level of a mans eye covered by a little round      disc which raised upwards affords a view o f the cell  on      the wall close to each cell door hangs a little square board      with the prisoners name number and record       overhead can be seen the iron structures of the firstfloor and      secondfloor corridors       the warder instructor a bearded man in blue uniform with an      apron and some dangling keys is just emerging from one of the      cells  instructor  speaking from the door into the cell  ill have another bit for you when thats finished  ocleary  unseenin an irish voice little doubt o that sirr  instructor  gossiping  well youd rather have it than nothing i spose  ocleary  an thats the blessed truth       sounds are heard of a cell door being closed and locked and of      approaching footsteps  instructor  in a sharp changed voice  look alive over it       he shuts the cell door and stands at attention       the governor comes walking down the corridor followed by      wooder  the governor  anything to report  instructor  saluting  q 3007  he points to a cell  is behind with his work sir  hell lose marks today       the governor nods and passes on to the end cell  the instructor      goes away  the governor  this is our maker of saws

stands in      the middle of the cell  he is a rawboned fellow about      fiftysix years old with outstanding bats ears and fierce      staring steelcoloured eyes  wooder  cap off  moaney removes his cap out here moaney comes to the door  the governor  beckoning him out into the corridor and holding up the sawwith the manner of an officer speaking to a private anything to say about this my man  moaney is silent  come  moaney  it passed the time  the governor  pointing into the cell  not enough to do eh  moaney  it dont occupy your mind  the governor  tapping the saw  you might find a better way than this  moaney  sullenly  well  what way  i must keep my hand in against the time i get out  whats the good of anything else to me at my time of life  with a gradual change to civility as his tongue warms  ye know that sir  ill be in again within a year or two after ive done this lot  i dont want to disgrace meself when im out  youve got your pride keeping the prison smart well ive got

got another six weeks to do in here alone  i cant do it and think o nothing  i must have something to interest me  youve made me a sporting offer sir but i cant pass my word about it  i shouldnt like to deceive a gentleman  pointing into the cell another four hours steady work would have done it  the governor  yes and what then  caught brought back punishment five weeks hard work to make this and cells at the end of it while they put anew bar to your window  is it worth it moaney  moaney  with a sort of fierceness yes it is  the governor  putting his hand to his brow oh well  two days

door  the governor  open cliptons cell       wooder opens the door of cliptons cell   clipton is sitting on      a stool just inside the door at work on a pair of trousers  he      is a small thick oldish man with an almost shaven head and      smouldering little dark eyes behind smoked spectacles  he gets      up and stands motionless in the doorway peering at his      visitors  the governor  beckoning come out here a minute clipton       clipton with a sort of dreadful quietness comes into the      corridor the needle and thread in his hand  the governor signs      to wooder who goes into the cell and inspects it carefully  the governor  how are your eyes  clifton  i dont complain of them  i dont see the sun here  he makes a stealthy movement protruding his neck a little  theres just

the governor nods  the door is closed and locked  the governor  which is the man who banged on his door this morning  wooder  going towards oclearys cell  this one sir ocleary       he lifts the disc and glances through the peephole  the governor  open       wooder throws open the door  ocleary who is seated at a      little table by the door as if listening springs up and stands      at attention jest inside the doorway  he is a broadfaced      middleaged man with a wide thin flexible mouth and little      holes under his high cheekbones  the governor  wheres the joke ocleary  ocleary  the

with a smile well no more conversation on your door  ocleary  no sirr i wud not have the little wit to repeat meself  the governor  turning  goodnight  ocleary  goodnight your honour       he turns into his cell  the governor shuts the door  the governor  looking at the record card  cant help liking the poor blackguard  wooder  hes an amiable man sir  the governor  pointing down the corridor ask the doctor to come here mr wooder       wooder salutes and goes away down the corridor       the governor goes to the door of falders cell  he raises his      uninjured hand to uncover the peephole but without uncovering      it shakes his head and drops his hand then after scrutinising      the record board he opens the cell door  falder who is      standing against it lurches forward  the governor  beckoning him out  now tell me cant you settle down falder  falder  in a breathless voice  yes sir  the governor  you know what i mean  its no good running your head against a stone wall is

a visitor  bad news  falder  yes  the governor  you mustnt think about it  falder  looking back at his cell  how can i help it sir       he suddenly becomes motionless as wooder and the doctor      approach  the governor motions to him to go back into his cell  falder  quick and low  im quite right in my head sir  he goes back into his cell  the governor  to the doctor  just go in and see him clements       the doctor goes into the cell  the governor pushes the door to      nearly closing it and walks towards the window  wooder  following  sorry you should be troubled like this sir very contented lot of men on the whole  the governor  shortly  you think so  wooder  yes sir  its christmas doing it in my opinion  the governor  to himself  queer that  wooder  beg pardon sir  the governor  christmas       he turns towards the window leaving wooder looking at him with      a sort of pained anxiety  wooder  suddenly  do you think we make show enough sir  if youd like us to have more holly  the governor  not at all mr wooder  wooder  very good sir       the doctor has come out of falders cell and the governor      beckons to him  the governor  well  the doctor  i cant make

tangible  that fellow there pointing to oclearys cell for instancefeels it just as much in his way  if i once get away from physical factsi shant know where i am  conscientiously sir i dont know how to differentiate him  he hasnt lost weight  nothing wrong with his eyes  his pulse is good  talks all right  the governor  it doesnt amount to melancholia  the doctor  shaking his head  i can report

wooder  beg pardon sir       for answer the governor stares at him turns on his heel and      walks away  there is a sound as of beating on metal  the governor  stopping  mr wooder  wooder  banging on his door sir  i thought we should have more of that       he hurries forward passing the governor who follows closely                            the curtain falls    scene iii       falders cell a whitewashed space thirteen feet broad by seven      deep and nine feet high with a rounded  ceiling  the floor is      of shiny blackened bricks  the barred window of opaque glass      with a ventilator is high up in the middle of the end wall  in      the middle of the opposite end wall is the narrow door  in a      corner are the mattress and bedding rolled up two blankets two      sheets and a coverlet  above them is a quartercircular      wooden shelf on which is a bible and several little devotional      books piled in a symmetrical pyramid there are also a black      hair brush toothbrush and a bit of soap  in another corner      is the wooden frame of a bed standing on end  there is a dark      ventilator under the window and another over the door      falders work a shirt to which he is putting buttonholes is      hung to a nail on the wall over a small wooden table on which      the novel lorna doone lies open  low down in the corner by      the door is a thick glass screen about a foot square covering      the gasjet let into the wall there is also a wooden stool and      a pair of shoes beneath it  three bright round tins are set      under the window       in fastfailing daylight falder in his stockings is seen      standing motionless with his head inclined towards the door      listening  he moves a little closer to the door his stockinged      feet making no noise  he stops at the door  he is trying      harder and harder to hear something any little thing that is      going on outside  he springs suddenly uprightas if at a      soundand remains perfectly motionless  then with a heavy      sigh he moves to his work and stands looking at it with his      head doom he does a stitch or two having the air of a man so      lost in sadness that each stitch is as it were a coming to      life  then turning abruptly he begins pacing the cell moving      his head like an animal pacing its cage  he stops again at the      door listens and placing the palms of hip hands against it      with his fingers spread out leans his forehead against the      iron  turning from it presently he moves slowly back towards      the window tracing his way with his finger along the top line      of the distemper that runs round the wall  he stops under the      window and picking up the lid of one of the tins peers into      it  it has grown very nearly dark  suddenly the lid falls out      of his hand with a clatterthe only sound that has broken the      silenceand he stands staring intently at the wall where the      stuff of the shirt is hanging rather white in the darknesshe      seems to be seeing somebody or something there  there is a      sharp tap and click the cell light behind the glass screen has      been turned up  the cell is brightly lighted  falder is seen      gasping for breath       a sound from far away as of distant dull beating on thick      metal is suddenly audible  falder shrinks back not able to      bear this sudden clamour  but the sound grows as though some      great tumbril were rolling towards the cell  and gradually it      seems to hypnotise him  he begins creeping inch by inch      nearer to the door  the banging sound travelling from cell to      cell draws closer and closer falders hands are seen moving as      if his spirit had already joined in this beating and the sound      swells till it seems to have entered the very cell  he suddenly      raises his clenched fists  panting violently he flings himself      at his door and beats on it                            the curtain falls     act iv       the scene is again cokesons room at a few minutes to ten of a      march morning two years later  the doors are all open      sweedle now blessed with a sprouting moustache is getting the      offices ready  he arranges papers on cokesons table then goes      to a covered washstand raises the lid and looks at himself in      the mirror  while he is gazing his full ruth honeywill comes in      through the outer office and stands in the doorway  there seems      a kind of exultation and excitement behind her habitual      impassivity  sweedle  suddenly seeing her and dropping the lid of the washstand with a bang hello  its you  ruth  yes  sweedle  theres only me here  they dont waste their time hurrying down in the morning  why it must be two years since we had the pleasure of seeing you  nervously  what have you been doing with yourself  ruth  sardonically living  sweedle  impressed  if you want to see him he points to cokesons chair hell be here directlynever missesnot much  delicately i hope our friends back from the country  his times been up these three months if i remember  ruth nods i was awful sorry about that  the governor made a mistakeif you ask me  ruth  he did  sweedle  he ought to have given him a chanst  and i say the judge ought to ha let him go after that  theyve forgot what human natures like  whereas we know ruth gives him a honeyed smile  sweedle  they come down on you like a cartload of bricks flatten you out and when you dont swell up again they complain of it  i know emseen a lot of that sort of thing in my time  he shakes his head in the plenitude of wisdom  why only the other day the governor       but cokeson has come in through the outer office brisk with      east wind and decidedly greyer  cokeson  drawing off his coat and gloves  why its you  then motioning sweedle out and closing the door  quite a stranger  must be two years  dyou want to see me  i can give you a minute  sit down  family well  ruth  yes  im not living where i was  cokeson  eyeing her askance i hope things are more comfortable at home  ruth  i couldnt stay with honeywill after all  cokeson  you havent done anything rash i hope  i should be sorry if youd done anything rash  ruth  ive kept the children with me  cokeson  beginning to feel that things are not so jolly as ha had hoped  well im glad to have seen you  youve not heard from the young man i suppose since he came out  ruth  yes i ran across him yesterday  cokeson  i hope hes well  ruth  with sudden fierceness  he cant get anything to do  its dreadful to see him  hes just skin and bone  cokeson  with genuine concern dear me  im sorry to hear that on his guard again  didnt they find him a place when his time was up  ruth  he was only there three weeks  it got out  cokeson  im sure i dont know what i can do for you  i dont like to be snubby  ruth  i cant bear his being like that  cokeson  scanning her not unprosperous figure i know his relations arent very forthy about him  perhaps you can do something for him till he finds his feet  ruth  not now  i could havebut not now  cokeson  i dont understand  ruth  proudly  ive seen him againthats all over  cokeson  staring at herdisturbed  im a family mani dont want to hear anything unpleasant  excuse meim very busy  ruth  id have gone home to my people in the country long ago but theyve never got over me marrying honeywill  i never was waywise mr cokeson but im proud  i was only a girl you see when i married him  i thought the world of him of course  he used to come travelling to our farm  cokeson  regretfully  i did hope youd have got on better after you saw me  ruth  he used me worse than ever  he couldnt break my nerve but i lost my health and then he began knocking the children about  i couldnt stand that  i wouldnt go back now if he were dying  cokeson  who has risen and is shifting about as though dodging a stream of lava we mustnt be violent must we  ruth  smouldering  a man that cant behave better than that there is silence  cokeson  fascinated in spite of himself  then there you were  and what did you do then  ruth  with a shrug  tried the same as when i left him before making skirts cheap things  it was the best i could get but i never made more than ten shillings a week buying my own cotton and working all day i hardly ever got to bed till past twelve  i kept at it for nine months  fiercely  well im not fit for that i wasnt made for it  id rather die  cokeson  my dear woman  we mustnt talk like that  ruth  it was starvation for the children tooafter what theyd always had  i soon got not to care  i used to be too tired she is silent  cokeson  with fearful curiosity  why what happened then  ruth  with a laugh my employer happened thenhes happened ever since  cokeson  dear  oh dear  i never came across a thing like this  ruth  dully hes treated me all right  but ive done with that suddenly her lips begin to quiver and she hides them with the back of her hand i never thought id see him again you see  it was just a chance i met him by hyde park  we went in there and sat down and he told me all about himself  oh  mr cokeson give him another chance  cokeson  greatly disturbed  then youve both lost your livings what a horrible position  ruth  if he could only get herewhere theres nothing to find out about him  cokeson  we cant have anything derogative to the firm  ruth  ive no one else to go to  cokeson  ill speak to the partners but i dont think theyll take him under the circumstances  i dont really  ruth  he came with me hes down there in the street she points to the window  cokeson  on his dignity he shouldnt have done that until hes sent for  then softening at the look on her face  weve got a vacancy as it happens but i cant promise anything  ruth  it would be the saving of him  cokeson  well ill do what i can but im not sanguine  now tell him that i dont want him till i see how things are  leave your address  repeating her 83 mullingar street  he notes it on blottingpaper goodmorning  ruth  thank you       she moves towards the door turns as if to speak but does not      and goes away  cokeson  wiping his head and forehead with a large white cotton handkerchief what a business  then looking amongst his papers he sounds his bell  sweedle answers it  cokeson  was that young richards coming here today after the clerks place  sweedle  yes  cokeson  well keep him in the air i dont want to see him yet  sweedle  what shall i tell him sir  cokeson  with asperity invent something  use your brains  dont stump him off altogether  sweedle  shall i tell him that weve got illness sir  cokeson  no  nothing untrue  say im not here today  sweedle  yes sir  keep him hankering  cokeson  exactly  and look here  you remember falder  i may be having him round to see me  now treat him like youd have him treat you in a similar position  sweedle  i naturally should do  cokeson  thats right  when a mans down never hit im  tisnt necessary  give him a hand up  thats a metaphor i recommend to you in life  its sound policy  sweedle  do you think the governors will take him on again sir  cokeson  cant say anything about that  at the sound of some one having entered the outer office  whos there  sweedle  going to the door and looking its falder sir  cokeson  vexed  dear me  thats very naughty of her  tell him to call again  i dont want       he breaks off as falder comes in  falder is thin pale older      his eyes have grown more restless  his clothes are very worn      and loose       sweedle nodding cheerfully withdraws  cokeson  glad to see you  youre rather previous  trying to keep things pleasant  shake hands  shes striking while the irons hot he wipes his forehead i dont blame her  shes anxious       falder  timidly takes cokesons hand and glances towards the      partners door  cokeson  nonot yet  sit down  falder sits in the chair at the aide of cokesons table on which he places his cap  now you are here id like you to give me a little account of yourself  looking at him over his spectacles  hows your health  falder  im alive mr cokeson  cokeson  preoccupied  im glad to hear that  about this matter i dont like doing anything out of the ordinary its not my habit im a plain man and i want everything smooth and straight  but i promised your friend to speak to the partners and i always keep my word  falder  i just want a chance mr cokeson  ive paid for that job a thousand times and more  i have sir  no one knows  they say i weighed more when i came out than when i went in  they couldnt weigh me here he touches his head  or here he toucheshis heart and gives a sort of laugh  till last night id have thought there was nothing in here at all  cokeson  concerned youve not got heart disease  falder  oh  they passed me sound enough  cokeson  but they got you a place didnt they  falser  yes very good people knew all about itvery kind to me i thought i was going to get on first rate  but one day all of a sudden the other clerks got wind of it  i couldnt stick it mr cokeson i couldnt sir  cokeson easy my dear fellow easy  falder  i had one small job after that but it didnt last  cokeson  how was that  falder  its no good deceiving you mr cokeson  the fact is i seem to be struggling against a thing thats all round me  i cant explain it its as if i was in a net as fast as i cut it here it grows up there  i didnt act as i ought to have about references but what are you to do  you must have them  and that made me afraid and i left  in fact imim afraid all the time now       he bows his head and leans dejectedly silent over the table  cokeson  i feel for youi do really  arent your sisters going to do anything for you  falder  ones in consumption  and the other  cokeson  yees  she told me her husband wasnt quite pleased with you  falder  when i went therethey were at suppermy sister wanted to give me a kissi know  but he just looked at her and said what have you come for  well i pocketed my pride and i said arent you going to give me your hand jim  cis is i know i said  look here he said thats all very well but wed better come to an understanding  ive been expecting you and ive made up my mind ill give you fifteen pounds to go to canada with  i see i saidgood riddance  no thanks keep your fifteen pounds friendships a queer thing when youve been where i have  cokeson  i understand  will you take the fifteen pound from me flustered as falder regards him with a queer smile  quite without prejudice i meant it kindly  falder  im not allowed to leave the country  cokeson  oh  yeesticketofleave  you arent looking the thing  falder  ive slept in the park three nights this week  the dawns arent all poetry there  but meeting heri feel a different man this morning  ive often thought the being fond of hers the best thing about me its sacred somehowand yet it did for me  thats queer isnt it  cokeson  im sure were all very sorry for you  falder  thats what ive found mr cokeson  awfully sorry for me with quiet bitterness  but it doesnt do to associate with criminals  cokeson  come come its no use calling yourself names  that never did a man any good  put a face on it  falder  its easy enough to put a face on it sir when youre independent  try it when youre down like me  they talk about giving you your deserts  well i think ive had just a bit over  cokeson  eyeing him askance over his spectacles  i hope they havent made a socialist of you       falder is suddenly still as if brooding over his past self he      utters a peculiar laugh  cokeson  you must give them credit for the best intentions  really you must  nobody wishes you harm im sure  falder  i believe that mr cokeson  nobody wishes you harm but they down you all the same  this feelinghe stares round him as though at something closing in  its crushing me  with sudden impersonality  i know it is  cokeson  horribly disturbed theres nothing there  we must try and take it quiet  im sure ive often had you in my prayers  now leave it to me  ill use my gumption and take em when theyre jolly  as he speaks the two partners come in  cokeson  rather disconcerted but trying to put them all at ease i didnt expect you quite so soon  ive just been having a talk with this young man  i think youll remember him  james  with a grave keen look quite well  how are you falder  walter  holding out his hand almost timidly very glad to see you again falder  falder  who has recovered his selfcontrol takes the hand thank you sir  cokeson  just a word mr james  to falder pointing to the clerks office you might go in there a minute  you know your way our junior wont be coming this morning  his wifes just had a little family       falder goes uncertainly out into the clerks office  cokeson  confidentially im bound to tell you all about it  hes quite penitent  but theres a prejudice against him  and youre not seeing him to advantage this morning hes undernourished  its very trying to go without your dinner  james  is that so cokeson  cokeson  i wanted to ask you  hes had his lesson  now we know all about him and we want a clerk  there is a young fellow applying but im keeping him in the air  james  a gaolbird in the office cokeson  i dont see it  walter  the rolling of the chariotwheels of justice  ive never got that out of my head  james  ive nothing to reproach myself with in this affair  whats he been doing since he came out  cokeson  hes had one or two places but he hasnt kept them  hes sensitivequite natural  seems to fancy everybodys down on him  james  bad sign  dont like the fellownever did from the first weak characters written all over him  walter  i think we owe him a leg up  james  he brought it all on himself  walter  the doctrine of full responsibility doesnt quite hold in these days  james  rather grimly  youll find it safer to hold it for all that my boy  walter  for oneself yesnot for other people thanks  james  well  i dont want to be hard  cokeson  im glad to hear you say that  he seems to see something spreading his arms round him  tisnt healthy  james  what about that woman he was mixed up with  i saw some one uncommonly like her outside as we came in  cokeson  that  well i cant keep anything from you  he has met her  james  is she with her husband  cokeson  no  james  falder living with her i suppose  cokeson  desperately trying to retain the newfound jollity i dont know that of my own knowledge  tisnt my business  james  its our business if were going to engage him cokeson  cokeson  reluctantly i ought to tell you perhaps  ive had the party here this morning  james  i thought so  to walter no my dear boy it wont do  too shady altogether  cokeson  the two things together make it very awkward for youi see that  walter  tentatively  i dont quite know what we have to do with his private life  james  no no  he must make a clean sheet of it or he cant come here  walter  poor devil  cokeson  will youhave him in  and as james nods i think i can get him to see reason  james  grimly you can leave that to me cokeson  walter  to james in a low voice while cokeson is summoning falder  his whole future may depend on what we do dad  falder comes in  he has pulled himself together and presents a steady front  james  now look here falder  my son and i want to give you another chance but there are two things i must say to you  in the first place its no good coming here as a victim  if youve any notion that youve been unjustly treatedget rid of it  you cant play fast and loose with morality and hope to go scotfree  if society didnt take care of itself nobody wouldthe sooner you realise that the better  falder  yes sir butmay i say something  james  well  falder  i had a lot of time to think it over in prison  he stops  cokeson  encouraging him im sure you did  falder  there were all sorts there  and what i mean sir is that if wed been treated differently the first time and put under somebody that could look after us a bit and not put in prison not a quarter of us would ever have got there  james  shaking his head im afraid ive very grave doubts of that falder  falder  with a gleam of malice yes sir so i found  james  my good fellow dont forget that you began it  falder  i never wanted to do wrong  james  perhaps not  but you did  falder  with all the bitterness of his past suffering its knocked me out of time  pulling himself up  that is i mean im not what i was  james  this isnt encouraging for us falder  cokeson  hes putting it awkwardly mr james  falder  throwing over his caution from the intensity of his feeling  i mean it mr cokeson  james  now lay aside all those thoughts falder and look to the future  falder  almost eagerly yes sir but you dont understand what prison is  its here it gets you       he grips his chest  cokeson  in a whisper to james i told you he wanted nourishment  walter  yes but my dear fellow thatll pass away  times merciful  falder  with his face twitching  i hope so sir  james  much more gently  now my boy what youve got to do is to put all the past behind you and build yourself up a steady reputation  and that brings me to the second thing  this woman you were mixed up with you must give us your word you know to have done with that  theres no chance of your keeping straight if youre going to begin your future with such a relationship  falder  looking from one to the other with a hunted expression but sir  but sir  its the one thing i looked forward to all that time  and she too  i couldnt find her before last night       during this and what follows cokeson becomes more and more      uneasy  james  this is painful falder  but you must see for yourself that its impossible for a firm like this to close its eyes to everything give us this proof of your resolve to keep straight and you can come backnot otherwise  falder  after staring at james suddenly stiffens himself  i couldnt give her up  i couldnt  oh sir       im all shes got to look to  and im sure shes all ive got  james  im very sorry falder but i must be firm  its for the benefit of you both in the long run  no good can come of this connection  it was the cause of all your disaster  falder  but sir it meanshaving gone through all thatgetting broken upmy nerves are in an awful statefor nothing  i did it for her  james  come  if shes anything of a woman shell see it for herself  she wont want to drag you down further  if there were a prospect of your being able to marry herit might be another thing  falder  its not my fault sir that she couldnt get rid of him she would have if she could  thats been the whole trouble from the beginning  looking suddenly at walter  if anybody would help her  its only money wants now im sure  cokeson  breaking in as walter hesitates and is about to speak i dont think we need consider thatits rather farfetched  falder  to walter appealing  he must have given her full cause since she could prove that he drove her to leave him  walter  im inclined to do what you say falder if it can be managed  falder  oh sir  he goes to the window and looks down into the street  cokeson  hurriedly  you dont take me mr walter  i have my reasons  falder  from the window  shes down there sir  will you see her i can beckon to her from here       walter hesitates and looks from cokeson to james  james  with a sharp nod yes let her come  falder beckons from the window  cokeson  in a low fluster to james and walter  no mr james shes not been quite what she ought to ha been while this young mans been away  shes lost her chance  we cant consult how to swindle the law       falder has come from the window  the three men look at him in a      sort of awed silence  falder  with instinctive apprehension of some changelooking from one to the other  theres been nothing between us sir to prevent it  what i said at the trial was true  and last night we only just sat in the park  sweedle comes in from the outer office  cokeson  what is it  sweedle  mrs honeywill   there is silence  james  show her in       ruth comes slowly in and stands stoically with falder on one      side and the three men on the other  no one speaks  cokeson      turns to his table bending over his papers as though the burden      of the situation were forcing him back into his accustomed      groove  james  sharply  shut the door there  sweedle shuts the door weve asked you to come up because there are certain facts to be faced in this matter  i understand you have only just met falder again  ruth  yesonly yesterday  james  hes told us about himself and were very sorry for him ive promised to take him back here if hell make a fresh start looking steadily at ruth this is a matter that requires courage maam  ruth who is looking at falder begins to twist her hands in front of her as though prescient of disaster  falder  mr walter how is good enough to say that hell help us to get you a divorce       ruth flashes a startled glance at james and walter  james  i dont think thats practicable falder  falder  but sir  james  steadily  now mrs honeywill  youre fond of him  ruth  yes sir i love him       she looks miserably at falder  james  then you dont want to stand in his way do you  ruth  in a faint voice i could take care of him  james  the best way you can take care of him will be to give him up  falder  nothing shall make me give you up  you can get a divorce theres been nothing between us has there  ruth  mournfully shaking her headwithout looking at him  no  falder  well keep apart till its over sir if youll only help uswe promise  james  to ruth  you see the thing plainly dont you  you see what i mean  ruth  just above a whisper  yes  cokeson  to himself theres a dear woman  james  the situation is impossible  ruth  must i sir  james  forcing himself to look at her i put it to you maam  his future is in your hands  ruth  miserably i want to do the best for him  james  a little huskily thats right thats right  falder  i dont understand  youre not going to give me upafter all this  theres somethingstarting forward to james sir i swear solemnly theres been nothing between us  james  i believe you falder  come my lad be as plucky as she is  falder  just now you were going to help us  he starts at ruth who is standing absolutely still his face and hands twitch and quiver as the truth dawns on him  what is it  youve not been  walter  father  james  hurriedly  there there  thatll do thatll do  ill give you your chance falder  dont let me know what you do with yourselves thats all  falder  as if he has not heard ruth       ruth looks at him and falder covers his face with his hands      there is silence  cokeson  suddenly  theres some one out there  to ruth  go in here  youll feel better by yourself for a minute       he points to the clerks room and moves towards the outer      office  falder does not move  ruth puts out her hand timidly      he shrinks back from the touch  she turns and goes miserably      into the clerks room  with a brusque movement he follows      seizing her by the shoulder just inside the doorway  cokeson      shuts the door  james  pointing to the outer office  get rid of that whoever it is  sweedle  opening the office door in a scared voice detectivesergeant blister       the detective enters and closes the door behind him  wister  sorry to disturb you sir  a clerk you had here two years and a half ago i arrested him in this room  james  what about him  wister  i thought perhaps i might get his whereabouts from you there is an awkward silence  cokeson  pleasantly coming to the rescue were not responsible for his movements you know that  james  what do you want with him  wister  hes failed to report himself this last four weeks  walter  how dyou mean  wister  ticketofleave wont be up for another six months sir  walter  has he to keep in touch with the police till then  wister  were bound to know where he sleeps every night  i dare say we shouldnt interfere sir even though he hasnt reported himself but weve just heard theres a serious matter of obtaining employment with a forged reference  what with the two things togetherwe must have him       again there is silence  walter and cokeson steal glances at      james who stands staring steadily at the detective  cokeson  expansively  were very busy at the moment  if you could make it convenient to call again we might be able to tell you then  james  decisively im a servant of the law but i dislike peaching  in fact i cant do such a thing  if you want him you must find him without us       as he speaks his eye falls on falders cap still lying on the      table and his face contracts  wister  noting the gesturequietly  very good sir  i ought to warn you that having broken the terms of his licence hes still a convict and sheltering a convict  james  i shelter no one  but you mustnt come here and ask questions which its not my business to answer  wister  dryly i wont trouble you further then gentlemen  cokeson  im sorry we couldnt give you the information  you quite understand dont you  goodmorning       wister turns to go but instead of going to the door of the      outer office he goes to the door of the clerks room  cokeson  the other door  the other door       wister opens the clerks door  ruthss voice is heard oh      do and falders i cant  there is a little pause then      with sharp fright ruth says whos that       wister has gone in       the three men look aghast at the door  wister  from within  keep back please       he comes swiftly out with his arm twisted in falders  the      latter gives a white staring look at the three men  walter  let him go this time for gods sake  wister  i couldnt take the responsibility sir  falder  with a queer desperate laugh  good       flinging a look back at ruth he throws up his head and goes      out through the outer office half dragging wister after him  walter  with despair  that finishes him  itll go on for ever now       sweedle can be seen staring through the outer door  there are      sounds of footsteps descending the stone stairs suddenly a dull      thud a faint my god in wisters voice  james  whats that       sweedle dashes forward  the door swings to behind him  there      is dead silence  walter  starting forward to the inner room the womanshes fainting       he and cokeson support the fainting ruth from the doorway of the      clerks room  cokeson  distracted  here my dear  there there  walter  have you any brandy  cokeson  ive got sherry  walter  get it then  quick       he places ruth in a chairwhich james has dragged forward  cokeson  with sherry here  its good strong sherry  they try to force the sherry between her lips       there is the sound of feet and they stop to listen       the outer door is reopenedwister and sweedle are seen carrying      some burden  james  hurrying forward  what is it       they lay the burden doom in the outer office out of sight and      all but ruth cluster round it speaking in hushed voices  wister  he jumpednecks broken  walter  good god  wister  he must have been mad to think he could give me the slip like that  and what was itjust a few months  walter  bitterly was that all  james  what a desperate thing  then in a voice unlike his own run for a doctoryou  sweedle rushes from the outer office an ambulance       wister goes out  on ruths face an expression of fear and      horror has been seen growing as if she dared not turn towards      the voices  she now rises and steals towards them  walter  turning suddenly look       the three men shrink back out of her way one by one into      cokesons room  ruth drops on her knees by the body  ruth  in a whisper  what is it  hes not breathing  she crouches over him  my dear  my pretty       in the outer office doorway the figures of men am seen standing  ruth  leaping to her feet no no  no no  hes dead       the figures of the men shrink back  cokeson  stealing forward  in a hoarse voice there there poor dear woman       at the sound behind her ruth faces round at him  cokeson  no onell touch him now  never again  hes safe with gentle jesus       ruth stands as though turned to stone in the doorway staring at      cokeson who bending humbly before her holds out his hand as      one would to a lost dog    the curtain falls
