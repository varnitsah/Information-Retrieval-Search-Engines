87975430	i say no  by wilkie collins     book the firstat school    chapter i the smuggled supper  outside the bedroom the night was black and still  the small rain fell too softly to be heard in the garden not a leaf stirred in the airless calm the watchdog was asleep the cats were indoors far or near under the murky heaven not a sound was stirring  inside the bedroom the night was black and still  miss ladd knew her business as a schoolmistress too well to allow nightlights and miss ladds young ladies were supposed to be fast asleep in accordance with the rules of the house only at intervals the silence was faintly disturbed when the restless turning of one of the girls in her bed betrayed itself by a gentle rustling between the sheets in the long intervals of stillness not even the softly audible breathing of young creatures asleep was to be heard  the first sound that told of life and movement revealed the mechanical movement of the clock speaking from the lower regions the tongue of father time told the hour before midnight  a soft voice rose wearily near the door of the room it counted the strokes of the clockand reminded one of the girls of the lapse of time  emily eleven oclock  there was no reply after an interval the weary voice tried again in louder tones  emily  a girl whose bed was at the inner end of the room sighed under the heavy heat of the nightand said in peremptory tones is that cecilia  yes  what do you want  im getting hungry emily is the new girl asleep  the new girl answered promptly and spitefully no she isnt  having a private object of their own in view the five wise virgins of miss ladds first class had waited an hour in wakeful anticipation of the falling asleep of the strangerand it had ended in this way a ripple of laughter ran round the room the new girl mortified and offended entered her protest in plain words  you are treating me shamefully you all distrust me because i am a stranger  say we dont understand you emily answered speaking for her schoolfellows and you will be nearer the truth  who expected you to understand me when i only came here today i have told you already my name is francine de sor if want to know more im nineteen years old and i come from the west indies  emily still took the lead why do you come here she asked who ever heard of a girl joining a new school just before the holidays you are nineteen years old are you im a year younger than youand i have finished my education the next big girl in the room is a year younger than meand she has finished her education what can you possibly have left to learn at your age  everything cried the stranger from the west indies with an outburst of tears im a poor ignorant creature your education ought to have taught you to pity me instead of making fun of me i hate you all for shame for shame  some of the girls laughed one of themthe hungry girl who had counted the strokes of the clocktook francines part  never mind their laughing miss de sor you are quite right you have good reason to complain of us  miss de sor dried her eyes thank youwhoever you are she answered briskly  my name is cecilia wyvil the other proceeded it was not perhaps quite nice of you to say you hated us all at the same time we have forgotten our good breedingand the least we can do is to beg your pardon  this expression of generous sentiment appeared to have an irritating effect on the peremptory young person who took the lead in the room perhaps she disapproved of free trade in generous sentiment  i can tell you one thing cecilia she said you shant beat me in generosity strike a light one of you and lay the blame on me if miss ladd finds us out i mean to shake hands with the new girland how can i do it in the dark miss de sor my names brown and im queen of the bedroom inot ceciliaoffer our apologies if we have offended you cecilia is my dearest friend but i dont allow her to take the lead in the room oh what a lovely nightgown  the sudden flow of candlelight had revealed francine sitting up in her bed and displaying such treasures of real lace over her bosom that the queen lost all sense of royal dignity in irrepressible admiration seven and sixpence emily remarked looking at her own nightgown and despising it one after another the girls yielded to the attraction of the wonderful lace slim and plump fair and dark they circled round the new pupil in their flowing white robes and arrived by common consent at one and the same conclusion how rich her father must be  favored by fortune in the matter of money was this enviable person possessed of beauty as well  in the disposition of the beds miss de sor was placed between cecilia on the right hand and emily on the left if by some fantastic turn of events a mansay in the interests of propriety a married doctor with miss ladd to look after himhad been permitted to enter the room and had been asked what he thought of the girls when he came out he would not even have mentioned francine blind to the beauties of the expensive nightgown he would have noticed her long upper lip her obstinate chin her sallow complexion her eyes placed too close togetherand would have turned his attention to her nearest neighbors on one side his languid interest would have been instantly roused by cecilias glowing auburn hair her exquisitely pure skin and her tender blue eyes on the other he would have discovered a bright little creature who would have fascinated and perplexed him at one and the same time if he had been questioned about her by a stranger he would have been at a loss to say positively whether she was dark or light he would have remembered how her eyes had held him but he would not have known of what color they were and yet she would have remained a vivid picture in his memory when other impressions derived at the same time had vanished there was one little witch among them who was worth all the rest put together and i cant tell you why they called her emily if i wasnt a married man there he would have thought of his wife and would have sighed and said no more  while the girls were still admiring francine the clock struck the halfhour past eleven  cecilia stole on tiptoe to the doorlooked out and listenedclosed the door againand addressed the meeting with the irresistible charm of her sweet voice and her persuasive smile  are none of you hungry yet she inquired the teachers are safe in their rooms we have set ourselves right with francine why keep the supper waiting under emilys bed  such reasoning as this with such personal attractions to recommend it admitted of but one reply the queen waved her hand graciously and said pull it out  is a lovely girlwhose face possesses the crowning charm of expression whose slightest movement reveals the supple symmetry of her figureless lovely because she is blessed with a good appetite and is not ashamed to acknowledge it with a grace all her own cecilia dived under the bed and produced a basket of jam tarts a basket of fruit and sweetmeats a basket of sparkling lemonade and a superb cakeall paid for by general subscriptions and smuggled into the room by kind connivance of the servants on this occasion the feast was especially plentiful and expensive in commemoration not only of the arrival of the midsummer holidays but of the coming freedom of miss ladds two leading young ladies with widely different destinies before them emily and cecilia had completed their school life and were now to go out into the world  the contrast in the characters of the two girls showed itself even in such a trifle as the preparations for supper  gentle cecilia sitting on the floor surrounded by good things left it to the ingenuity of others to decide whether the baskets should be all emptied at once or handed round from bed to bed one at a time in the meanwhile her lovely blue eyes rested tenderly on the tarts  emilys commanding spirit seized on the reins of government and employed each of her schoolfellows in the occupation which she was fittest to undertake miss de sor let me look at your hand ah i thought so you have got the thickest wrist among us you shall draw the corks if you let the lemonade pop not a drop of it goes down your throat effie annis priscilla you are three notoriously lazy girls its doing you a true kindness to set you to work effie clear the toilettable for supper away with the combs the brushes and the lookingglass annis tear the leaves out of your book of exercises and set them out for plates no ill unpack nobody touches the baskets but me priscilla you have the prettiest ears in the room you shall act as sentinel my dear and listen at the door cecilia when you have done devouring those tarts with your eyes take that pair of scissors miss de sor allow me to apologize for the mean manner in which this school is carried on the knives and forks are counted and locked up every nighti say take that pair of scissors cecilia and carve the cake and dont keep the largest bit for yourself are we all ready very well now take example by me talk as much as you like so long as you dont talk too loud there is one other thing before we begin the men always propose toasts on these occasions lets be like the men can any of you make a speech ah it falls on me as usual i propose the first toast down with all schools and teachersespecially the new teacher who came this half year oh mercy how it stings the fixed gas in the lemonade took the orator at that moment by the throat and effectually checked the flow of her eloquence it made no difference to the girls excepting the ease of feeble stomachs who cares for eloquence in the presence of a suppertable there were no feeble stomachs in that bedroom with what inexhaustible energy miss ladds young ladies ate and drank how merrily they enjoyed the delightful privilege of talking nonsense andalas alashow vainly they tried in after life to renew the once unalloyed enjoyment of tarts and lemonade  in the unintelligible scheme of creation there appears to be no human happinessnot even the happiness of schoolgirlswhich is ever complete just as it was drawing to a close the enjoyment of the feast was interrupted by an alarm from the sentinel at the door  put out the candle priscilla whispered somebody on the stairs    chapter ii biography in the bedroom  the candle was instantly extinguished in discreet silence the girls stole back to their beds and listened  as an aid to the vigilance of the sentinel the door had been left ajar through the narrow opening a creaking of the broad wooden stairs of the old house became audible in another moment there was silence an interval passed and the creaking was heard again this time the sound was distant and diminishing on a sudden it stopped the midnight silence was disturbed no more  what did this mean  had one among the many persons in authority under miss ladds roof heard the girls talking and ascended the stairs to surprise them in the act of violating one of the rules of the house so far such a proceeding was by no means uncommon but was it within the limits of probability that a teacher should alter her opinion of her own duty halfway up the stairs and deliberately go back to her own room again the bare idea of such a thing was absurd on the face of it what more rational explanation could ingenuity discover on the spur of the moment  francine was the first to offer a suggestion she shook and shivered in her bed and said for heavens sake light the candle again its a ghost  clear away the supper you fools before the ghost can report us to miss ladd  with this excellent advice emily checked the rising panic the door was closed the candle was lit all traces of the supper disappeared for five minutes more they listened again no sound came from the stairs no teacher or ghost of a teacher appeared at the door  having eaten her supper cecilias immediate anxieties were at an end she was at leisure to exert her intelligence for the benefit of her schoolfellows in her gentle ingratiating way she offered a composing suggestion when we heard the creaking i dont believe there was anybody on the stairs in these old houses there are always strange noises at nightand they say the stairs here were made more than two hundred years since  the girls looked at each other with a sense of reliefbut they waited to hear the opinion of the queen emily as usual justified the confidence placed in her she discovered an ingenious method of putting cecilias suggestion to the test  lets go on talking she said if cecilia is right the teachers are all asleep and we have nothing to fear from them if shes wrong we shall sooner or later see one of them at the door dont be alarmed miss de sor catching us talking at night in this school only means a reprimand catching us with a light ends in punishment blow out the candle  francines belief in the ghost was too sincerely superstitious to be shaken she started up in bed oh dont leave me in the dark ill take the punishment if we are found out  on your sacred word of honor emily stipulated  yesyes  the queens sense of humor was tickled  theres something funny she remarked addressing her subjects in a big girl like this coming to a new school and beginning with a punishment may i ask if you are a foreigner miss de sor  my papa is a spanish gentleman francine answered with dignity  and your mamma  my mamma is english  and you have always lived in the west indies  i have always lived in the island of st domingo  emily checked off on her fingers the different points thus far discovered in the character of mr de sors daughter shes ignorant and superstitious and foreign and rich my dear forgive the familiarity you are an interesting girland we must really know more of you entertain the bedroom what have you been about all your life and what in the name of wonder brings you here before you begin i insist on one condition in the name of all the young ladies in the room no useful information about the west indies  francine disappointed her audience  she was ready enough to make herself an object of interest to her companions but she was not possessed of the capacity to arrange events in their proper order necessary to the recital of the simplest narrative emily was obliged to help her by means of questions in one respect the result justified the trouble taken to obtain it a sufficient reason was discovered for the extraordinary appearance of a new pupil on the day before the school closed for the holidays  mr de sors elder brother had left him an estate in st domingo and a fortune in money as well on the one easy condition that he continued to reside in the island the question of expense being now beneath the notice of the family francine had been sent to england especially recommended to miss ladd as a young lady with grand prospects sorely in need of a fashionable education the voyage had been so timed by the advice of the schoolmistress as to make the holidays a means of obtaining this object privately francine was to be taken to brighton where excellent masters could be obtained to assist miss ladd with six weeks before her she might in some degree make up for lost time and when the school opened again she would avoid the mortification of being put down in the lowest class along with the children  the examination of miss de sor having produced these results was pursued no further her character now appeared in a new and not very attractive light she audaciously took to herself the whole credit of telling her story  i think its my turn now she said to be interested and amused may i ask you to begin miss emily all i know of you at present is t hat your family name is brown  emily held up her hand for silence  was the mysterious creaking on the stairs making itself heard once more no the sound that had caught emilys quick ear came from the beds on the opposite side of the room occupied by the three lazy girls with no new alarm to disturb them effie annis and priscilla had yielded to the composing influences of a good supper and a warm night they were fast asleepand the stoutest of the three softly as became a young lady was snoring  the unblemished reputation of the bedroom was dear to emily in her capacity of queen she felt herself humiliated in the presence of the new pupil  if that fat girl ever gets a lover she said indignantly i shall consider it my duty to warn the poor man before he marries her her ridiculous name is euphemia i have christened her far more appropriately boiled veal no color in her hair no color in her eyes no color in her complexion in short no flavor in euphemia you naturally object to snoring pardon me if i turn my back on youi am going to throw my slipper at her  the soft voice of ceciliasuspiciously drowsy in toneinterposed in the interests of mercy  she cant help it poor thing and she really isnt loud enough to disturb us  she wont disturb you at any rate rouse yourself cecilia we are wide awake on this side of the roomand francine says its our turn to amuse her  a low murmur dying away gently in a sigh was the only answer sweet cecilia had yielded to the somnolent influences of the supper and the night the soft infection of repose seemed to be in some danger of communicating itself to francine her large mouth opened luxuriously in a longcontinued yawn  goodnight said emily  miss de sor became wide awake in an instant  no she said positively you are quite mistaken if you think i am going to sleep please exert yourself miss emilyi am waiting to be interested  emily appeared to be unwilling to exert herself she preferred talking of the weather  isnt the wind rising she said  there could be no doubt of it the leaves in the garden were beginning to rustle and the pattering of the rain sounded on the windows  francine as her straight chin proclaimed to all students of physiognomy was an obstinate girl determined to carry her point she tried emilys own system on emily herselfshe put questions  have you been long at this school  more than three years  have you got any brothers and sisters  i am the only child  are your father and mother alive  emily suddenly raised herself in bed  wait a minute she said i think i hear it again  the creaking on the stairs  yes  either she was mistaken or the change for the worse in the weather made it not easy to hear slight noises in the house the wind was still rising the passage of it through the great trees in the garden began to sound like the fall of waves on a distant beach it drove the raina heavy downpour by this timerattling against the windows  almost a storm isnt it emily said  francines last question had not been answered yet she took the earliest opportunity of repeating it  never mind the weather she said tell me about your father and mother are they both alive  emilys reply only related to one of her parents  my mother died before i was old enough to feel my loss  and your father  emily referred to another relativeher fathers sister since i have grown up she proceeded my good aunt has been a second mother to me my story is in one respect the reverse of yours you are unexpectedly rich and i am unexpectedly poor my aunts fortune was to have been my fortune if i outlived her she has been ruined by the failure of a bank in her old age she must live on an income of two hundred a yearand i must get my own living when i leave school  surely your father can help you francine persisted  his property is landed property her voice faltered as she referred to him even in that indirect manner it is entailed his nearest male relative inherits it  the delicacy which is easily discouraged was not one of the weaknesses in the nature of francine  do i understand that your father is dead she asked  our thickskinned fellowcreatures have the rest of us at their mercy only give them time and they carry their point in the end in sad subdued tonestelling of deeplyrooted reserves of feeling seldom revealed to strangersemily yielded at last  yes she said my father is dead  long ago  some people might think it long ago i was very fond of my father its nearly four years since he died and my heart still aches when i think of him im not easily depressed by troubles miss de sor but his death was suddenhe was in his grave when i first heard of itandoh he was so good to me he was so good to me  the gay highspirited little creature who took the lead among them allwho was the life and soul of the schoolhid her face in her hands and burst out crying  startled andto do her justiceashamed francine attempted to make excuses emilys generous nature passed over the cruel persistency that had tortured her no no i have nothing to forgive it isnt your fault other girls have not mothers and brothers and sistersand get reconciled to such a loss as mine dont make excuses  yes but i want you to know that i feel for you francine insisted without the slightest approach to sympathy in face voice or manner when my uncle died and left us all the money papa was much shocked he trusted to time to help him  time has been long about it with me francine i am afraid there is something perverse in my nature the hope of meeting again in a better world seems so faint and so far away no more of it now let us talk of that good creature who is asleep on the other side of you did i tell you that i must earn my own bread when i leave school well cecilia has written home and found an employment for me not a situation as governesssomething quite out of the common way you shall hear all about it  in the brief interval that had passed the weather had begun to change again the wind was as high as ever but to judge by the lessening patter on the windows the rain was passing away  emily began  she was too grateful to her friend and schoolfellow and too deeply interested in her story to notice the air of indifference with which francine settled herself on her pillow to hear the praises of cecilia the most beautiful girl in the school was not an object of interest to a young lady with an obstinate chin and unfortunatelyplaced eyes pouring warm from the speakers heart the story ran smoothly on to the monotonous accompaniment of the moaning wind by fine degrees francines eyes closed opened and closed again toward the latter part of the narrative emilys memory became for the moment only confused between two events she stopped to considernoticed francines silence in an interval when she might have said a word of encouragementand looked closer at her miss de sor was asleep  she might have told me she was tired emily said to herself quietly well the best thing i can do is to put out the light and follow her example  as she took up the extinguisher the bedroom door was suddenly opened from the outer side a tall woman robed in a black dressinggown stood on the threshold looking at emily     chapter iii the late mr brown  the womans lean longfingered hand pointed to the candle  dont put it out saying those words she looked round the room and satisfied herself that the other girls were asleep  emily laid down the extinguisher you mean to report us of course she said i am the only one awake miss jethro lay the blame on me  i have no intention of reporting you but i have something to say  she paused and pushed her thick black hair already streaked with gray back from her temples her eyes large and dark and dim rested on emily with a sorrowful interest when your young friends wake tomorrow morning she went on you can tell them that the new teacher whom nobody likes has left the school  for once even quickwitted emily was bewildered going away she said when you have only been here since easter  miss jethro advanced not noticing emilys expression of surprise i am not very strong at the best of times she continued may i sit down on your bed remarkable on other occasions for her cold composure her voice trembled as she made that requesta strange request surely when there were chairs at her disposal  emily made room for her with the dazed look of a girl in a dream i beg your pardon miss jethro one of the things i cant endure is being puzzled if you dont mean to report us why did you come in and catch me with the light  miss jethros explanation was far from relieving the perplexity which her conduct had caused  i have been mean enough she answered to listen at the door and i heard you talking of your father i want to hear more about him that is why i came in  you knew my father emily exclaimed  i believe i knew him but his name is so commonthere are so many thousands of james browns in englandthat i am in fear of making a mistake i heard you say that he died nearly four years since can you mention any particulars which might help to enlighten me if you think i am taking a liberty  emily stopped her i would help you if i could she said but i was in poor health at the time and i was staying with friends far away in scotland to try change of air the news of my fathers death brought on a relapse weeks passed before i was strong enough to travelweeks and weeks before i saw his grave i can only tell you what i know from my aunt he died of heartcomplaint  miss jethro started  emily looked at her for the first time with eyes that betrayed a feeling of distrust what have i said to startle you she asked  nothing i am nervous in stormy weatherdont notice me she went on abruptly with her inquiries will you tell me the date of your fathers death  the date was the thirtieth of september nearly four years since  she waited after that reply  miss jethro was silent  and this emily continued is the thirtieth of june eighteen hundred and eightyone you can now judge for yourself did you know my father  miss jethro answered mechanically using the same words  i did know your father  emilys feeling of distrust was not set at rest i never heard him speak of you she said  in her younger days the teacher must have been a handsome woman her grandlyformed features still suggested the idea of imperial beautyperhaps jewish in its origin when emily said i never heard him speak of you the color flew into her pallid cheeks her dim eyes became alive again with a momentary light she left her seat on the bed and turning away mastered the emotion that shook her  how hot the night is she said and sighed and resumed the subject with a steady countenance i am not surprised that your father never mentioned meto you she spoke quietly but her face was paler than ever she sat down again on the bed is there anything i can do for you she asked before i go away oh i only mean some trifling service that would lay you under no obligation and would not oblige you to keep up your acquaintance with me  her eyesthe dim black eyes that must once have been irresistibly beautifullooked at emily so sadly that the generous girl reproached herself for having doubted her fathers friend are you thinking of him she said gently when you ask if you can be of service to me  miss jethro made no direct reply you were fond of your father she added in a whisper you told your schoolfellow that your heart still aches when you speak of him  i only told her the truth emily answered simply  miss jethro shudderedon that hot nightshuddered as if a chill had struck her  emily held out her hand the kind feeling that had been roused in her glittered prettily in her eyes i am afraid i have not done you justice she said will you forgive me and shake hands  miss jethro rose and drew back look at the light she exclaimed  the candle was all burned out emily still offered her handand still miss jethro refused to see it  there is just light enough left she said to show me my way to the door goodnightand goodby  emily caught at her dress and stopped her why wont you shake hands with me she asked  the wick of the candle fell over in the socket and left them in the dark emily resolutely held the teachers dress with or without light she was still bent on making miss jethro explain herself  they had throughout spoken in guarded tones fearing to disturb the sleeping girls the sudden darkness had its inevitable effect their voices sank to whispers now my fathers friend emily pleaded is surely my friend  drop the subject  why  you can never be my friend  why not  let me go  emilys sense of selfrespect forbade her to persist any longer i beg your pardon for having kept you here against your will she saidand dropped her hold on the dress  miss jethro instantly yielded on her side i am sorry to have been obstinate she answered if you do despise me it is after all no more than i have deserved her hot breath beat on emilys face the unhappy woman must have bent over the bed as she made her confession i am not a fit person for you to associate with  i dont believe it  miss jethro sighed bitterly young and warm heartedi was once like you she controlled that outburst of despair her next words were spoken in steadier tones you will have ityou shall have it she said some one in this house or out of it i dont know which has betrayed me to the mistress of the school a wretch in my situation suspects everybody and worse still does it without reason or excuse i heard you girls talking when you ought to have been asleep you all dislike me how did i know it mightnt be one of you absurd to a person with a wellbalanced mind i went halfway up the stairs and felt ashamed of myself and went back to my room if i could only have got some rest ah well it was not to be done my own vile suspicions kept me awake i left my bed again you know what i heard on the other side of that door and why i was interested in hearing it your father never told me he had a daughter miss brown at this school was any miss brown to me i had no idea of who you really were until tonight im wandering what does all this matter to you miss ladd has been merciful she lets me go without exposing me you can guess what has happened no not even yet is it innocence or kindness that makes you so slow to understand my dear i have obtained admission to this respectable house by means of false references and i have been discovered now you know why you must not be the friend of such a woman as i am once more goodnightand goodby  emily shrank from that miserable farewell  bid me goodnight she said but dont bid me goodby let me see you again  never  the sound of the softlyclosed door was just audible in the darkness she had spokenshe had gonenever to be seen by emily again  miserable interesting unfathomable creaturethe problem that night of emilys waking thoughts the phantom of her dreams bad or good she asked herself false for she listened at the door true for she told me the tale of her own disgrace a friend of my father and she never knew that he had a daughter refined accomplished ladylike and she stoops to use a false reference who is to reconcile such contradictions as these  dawn looked in at the windowdawn of the memorable day which was for emily the beginning of a new life the years were before her and the years in their course reveal baffling mysteries of life and death     chapter iv miss ladds drawingmaster  francine was awakened the next morning by one of the housemaids bringing up her breakfast on a tray astonished at this concession to laziness in an institution devoted to the practice of all virtues she looked round the bedroom was deserted  the other young ladies are as busy as bees miss the housemaid explained they were up and dressed two hours ago and the breakfast has been cleared away long since its miss emilys fault she wouldnt allow them to wake you she said you could be of no possible use downstairs and you had better be treated like a visitor miss cecilia was so distressed at your missing your breakfast that she spoke to the housekeeper and i was sent up to you please to excuse it if the teas cold this is grand day and we are all topsyturvy in consequence  inquiring what grand day meant and why it produced this extraordinary result in a ladies school francine discovered that the first day of the vacation was devoted to the distribution of prizes in the presence of parents guardians and friends an entertainment was added comprising those merciless tests of human endurance called recitations light refreshments and musical performances being distributed at intervals to encourage the exhausted audience the local newspaper sent a reporter to describe the proceedings and some of miss ladds young ladies enjoyed the intoxicating luxury of seeing their names in print  it begins at three oclock the housemaid went on and what with practicing and rehearsing and ornamenting the schoolroom theres a hubbub fit to make a persons head spin besides which said the girl lowering her voice and approaching a little nearer to francine we have all been taken by surprise the first thing in the morning miss jethro left us without saying goodby to anybody  who is miss jethro  the new teacher miss we none of us liked her and we all suspect theres something wrong miss ladd and the clergyman had a long talk together yesterday in private you know and they sent for miss jethrowhich looks bad doesnt it is there anything more i can do for you miss its a beautiful day after the rain if i was you i should go and enjoy myself in the garden  having finished her breakfast francine decided on profiting by this sensible suggestion  the servant who showed her the way to the garden was not favorably impressed by the new pupil francines temper asserted itself a little too plainly in her face to a girl possessing a high opinion of her own importance it was not very agreeable to feel herself excluded as an illiterate stranger from the one absorbing interest of her schoolfellows will the time ever come she wondered bitterly when i shall win a prize and sing and play before all the company how i should enjoy making the girls envy me  a broad lawn overshadowed at one end by fine old treesflower beds and shrubberies and winding paths prettily and invitingly laid outmade the garden a welcome refuge on that fine summer morning the novelty of the scene after her experience in the west indies the delicious breezes cooled by the rain of the night exerted their cheering influence even on the sullen disposition of francine she smiled in spite of herself as she followed the pleasant paths and heard the birds singing their summer songs over her head  wandering among the trees which occupied a considerable extent of ground she passed into an open space beyond and discovered an old fishpond overgrown by aquatic plants driblets of water trickled from a dilapidated fountain in the middle on the further side of the pond the ground sloped downward toward the south and revealed over a low paling a pretty view of a village and its church backed by fir woods mounting the heathy sides of a range of hills beyond a fanciful little wooden building imitating the form of a swiss cottage was placed so as to command the prospect near it in the shadow of the building stood a rustic chair and tablewith a colorbox on one and a portfolio on the other fluttering over the grass at the mercy of the capricious breeze was a neglected sheet of drawingpaper francine ran round the pond and picked up the paper just as it was on the point of being tilted into the water it contained a sketch in water colors of the village and the woods and francine had looked at the view itself with indifferencethe picture of the view interested her ordinary visitors to galleries of art which admit students show the same strange perversity the work of the copyist commands their whole attention they take no interest in the original picture  looking up from the sketch francine was startled she discovered a man at the window of the swiss summerhouse watching her  when you have done with that drawing he said quietly please let me have it back again  he was tall and thin and dark his finelyshaped intelligent facehidden as to the lower part of it by a curly black beardwould have been absolutely handsome even in the eyes of a schoolgirl but for the deep furrows that marked it prematurely between the eyebrows and at the sides of the mouth in the same way an underlying mockery impaired the attraction of his otherwise refined and gentle manner among his fellowcreatures children and dogs were the only critics who appreciated his merits without discovering the defects which lessened the favorable appreciation of him by men and women he dressed neatly but his morning coat was badly made and his picturesque felt hat was too old in short there seemed to be no good quality about him which was not perversely associated with a drawback of some kind he was one of those harmless and luckless men possessed of excellent qualities who fail nevertheless to achieve popularity in their social sphere  francine handed his sketch to him through the window doubtful whether the words that he had addressed to her were spoken in jest or in earnest  i only presumed to touch your drawing she said because it was in danger  what danger he inquired  francine pointed to the pond if i had not been in time to pick it up it would have been blown into the water  do you think it was worth picking up  putting that question he looked first at the sketchthen at the view which it representedthen back again at the sketch the corners of his mouth turned upward with a humorous expression of scorn madam nature he said i beg your pardon with those words he composedly tore his work of art into small pieces and scattered them out of the window  what a pity said francine  he joined her on the ground outside the cottage why is it a pity he asked  such a nice drawing  it isnt a nice drawing  youre not very polite sir  he looked at herand sighed as if he pitied so young a woman for having a temper so ready to take offense in his flattest contradictions he always preserved the character of a politelypositive man  put it in plain words miss he replied i have offended the predominant sense in your natureyour sense of selfesteem you dont like to be told even indirectly that you know nothing of art in these days everybody knows everythingand thinks nothing worth knowing after all but beware how you presume on an appearance of indifference which is nothing but conceit in disguise the ruling passion of civilized humanity is conceit you may try the regard of your dearest friend in any other way and be forgiven ruffle the smooth surface of your friends selfesteemand there will be an acknowledged coolness between you which will last for life excuse me for giving you the benefit of my trumpery experience this sort of smart talk is my form of conceit can i be of use to you in some better way are you looking for one of our young ladies  francine began to feel a certain reluctant interest in him when he spoke of our young ladies she asked if he belonged to the school  the corners of his mouth turned up again im one of the masters he said are you going to belong to the school too  francine bent her head with a gravity and condescension intended to keep him at his proper distance far from being discouraged he permitted his curiosity to take additional liberties are you to have the misfortune of being one of my pupils he asked  i dont know who you are  you wont be much wiser when you do know my name is alban morris  francine corrected herself i mean i dont know what you teach  alban morris pointed to the fragments of his sketch from nature i am a bad artist he said some bad artists become royal academicians some take to drink some get a pension and somei am one of themfind refuge in schools drawing is an extra at this school will you take my advice spare your good fathers pocket say you dont want to learn to draw  he was so gravely in earnest that francine burst out laughing you are a strange man she said  wrong again miss i am only an unhappy man  the furrows in his face deepened the latent humor died out of his eyes he turned to the summerhouse window and took up a pipe and tobacco pouch left on the ledge  i lost my only friend last year he said since the death of my dog my pipe is the one companion i have left naturally i am not allowed to enjoy the honest fellows society in the presence of ladies they have their own taste in perfumes their clothes and their letters reek with the foetid secretion of the musk deer the clean vegetable smell of tobacco is unendurable to them allow me to retireand let me thank you for the trouble you took to save my drawing  the tone of indifference in which he expressed his gratitude piqued francine she resented it by drawing her own conclusion from what he had said of the ladies and the musk deer i was wrong in admiring your drawing she remarked and wrong again in thinking you a strange man am i wrong for the third time in believing that you dislike women  i am sorry to say you are right alban morris answered gravely  is there not even one exception  the instant the words passed her lips she saw that there was some secretly sensitive feeling in him which she had hurt his black brows gathered into a frown his piercing eyes looked at her with angry surprise it was over in a moment he raised his shabby hat and made her a bow  there is a sore place still left in me he said and you have innocently hit it goodmorning  before she could speak again he had turned the corner of the summerhouse and was lost to view in a shrubbery on the westward side of the grounds     chapter v discoveries in the garden  left by herself miss de sor turned back again by way of the trees  so far her interview with the drawingmaster had helped to pass the time some girls might have found it no easy task to arrive at a true view of the character of alban morris francines essentially superficial observation set him down as a little mad and left him there judged and dismissed to her own entire satisfaction  arriving at the lawn she discovered emily pacing backward and forward with her head down and her hands behind her deep in thought francines high opinion of herself would have carried her past any of the other girls unless they had made special advances to her she stopped and looked at emily  it is the sad fate of little women in general to grow too fat and to be born with short legs emilys slim finelystrung figure spoke for itself as to the first of these misfortunes and asserted its happy freedom from the second if she only walked across a room nature had built her from head to foot on a skeletonscaffolding in perfect proportion tall or short matters little to the result in women who possess the first and foremost advantage of beginning well in their bones when they live to old age they often astonish thoughtless men who walk behind them in the street i give you my honor she was as easy and upright as a young girl and when you got in front of her and lookedwhite hair and seventy years of age  francine approached emily moved by a rare impulse in her naturethe impulse to be sociable you look out of spirits she began surely you dont regret leaving school  in her present mood emily took the opportunity in the popular phrase of snubbing francine you have guessed wrong i do regret she answered i have found in cecilia my dearest friend at school and school brought with it the change in my life which has helped me to bear the loss of my father if you must know what i was thinking of just now i was thinking or my aunt she has not answered my last letterand im beginning to be afraid she is ill  im very sorry said francine  why you dont know my aunt and you have only known me since yesterday afternoon why are you sorry  francine remained silent without realizing it she was beginning to feel the dominant influence that emily exercised over the weaker natures that came in contact with her to find herself irresistibly attracted by a stranger at a new schoolan unfortunate little creature whose destiny was to earn her own livingfilled the narrow mind of miss de sor with perplexity having waited in vain for a reply emily turned away and resumed the train of thought which her schoolfellow had interrupted    by an association of ideas of which she was not herself aware she now passed from thinking of her aunt to thinking of miss jethro the interview of the previous night had dwelt on her mind at intervals in the hours of the new day  acting on instinct rather than on reason she had kept that remarkable incident in her school life a secret from every one no discoveries had been made by other persons in speaking to her staff of teachers miss ladd had alluded to the affair in the most cautious terms circumstances of a private nature have obliged the lady to retire from my school when we meet after the holidays another teacher will be in her place there miss ladds explanation had begun and ended inquiries addressed to the servants had led to no result miss jethros luggage was to be forwarded to the london terminus of the railwayand miss jethro herself had baffled investigation by leaving the school on foot emilys interest in the lost teacher was not the transitory interest of curiosity her fathers mysterious friend was a person whom she honestly desired to see again perplexed by the difficulty of finding a means of tracing miss jethro she reached the shady limit of the trees and turned to walk back again approaching the place at which she and francine had met an idea occurred to her it was just possible that miss jethro might not be unknown to her aunt  still meditating on the cold reception that she had encountered and still feeling the influence which mastered her in spite of herself francine interpreted emilys return as an implied expression of regret she advanced with a constrained smile and spoke first  how are the young ladies getting on in the schoolroom she asked by way of renewing the conversation  emilys face assumed a look of surprise which said plainly cant you take a hint and leave me to myself  francine was constitutionally impenetrable to reproof of this sort her thick skin was not even tickled why are you not helping them she went on you who have the clearest head among us and take the lead in everything  it may be a humiliating confession to make yet it is surely true that we are all accessible to flattery different tastes appreciate different methods of burning incensebut the perfume is more or less agreeable to all varieties of noses francines method had its tranquilizing effect on emily she answered indulgently miss de sor i have nothing to do with it  nothing to do with it no prizes to win before you leave school  i won all the prizes years ago  but there are recitations surely you recite  harmless words in themselves pursuing the same smooth course of flattery as beforebut with what a different result emilys face reddened with anger the moment they were spoken having already irritated alban morris unlucky francine by a second mischievous interposition of accident had succeeded in making emily smart next who has told you she burst out i insist on knowing  nobody has told me anything francine declared piteously  nobody has told you how i have been insulted  no indeed oh miss brown who could insult you  in a man the sense of injury does sometimes submit to the discipline of silence in a womannever suddenly reminded of her past wrongs by the pardonable error of a polite schoolfellow emily committed the startling inconsistency of appealing to the sympathies of francine  would you believe it i have been forbidden to recitei the head girl of the school oh not today it happened a month agowhen we were all in consultation making our arrangements miss ladd asked me if i had decided on a piece to recite i said i have not only decided i have learned the piece and what may it be the daggerscene in macbeth there was a howli can call it by no other namea howl of indignation a mans soliloquy and worse still a murdering mans soliloquy recited by one of miss ladds young ladies before an audience of parents and guardians that was the tone they took with me i was as firm as a rock the daggerscene or nothing the result isnothing an insult to shakespeare and an insult to me i felt iti feel it still i was prepared for any sacrifice in the cause of the drama if miss ladd had met me in a proper spirit do you know what i would have done i would have played macbeth in costume just hear me and judge for yourself i begin with a dreadful vacancy in my eyes and a hollow moaning in my voice is this a dagger that i see before me  reciting with her face toward the trees emily started dropped the character of macbeth and instantly became herself again herself with a rising color and an angry brightening of the eyes excuse me i cant trust my memory i must get the play with that abrupt apology she walked away rapidly in the direction of the house  in some surprise francine turned and looked at the trees she discoveredin full retreat on his sidethe eccentric drawingmaster alban morris  did he too admire the daggerscene and was he modestly desirous of hearing it recited without showing himself in that case why should emily whose besetting weakness was certainly not want of confidence in her own resources leave the garden the moment she caught sight of him francine consulted her instincts she had just arrived at a conclusion which expressed itself outwardly by a malicious smile when gentle cecilia appeared on the lawna lovable object in a broad straw hat and a white dress with a nosegay in her bosomsmiling and fanning herself  its so hot in the schoolroom she said and some of the girls poor things are so illtempered at rehearsali have made my escape i hope you got your breakfast miss de sor what have you been doing here all by yourself  i have been making an interesting discovery francine replied  an interesting discovery in our garden what can it be  the drawingmaster my dear is in love with emily perhaps she doesnt care about him or perhaps i have been an innocent obstacle in the way of an appointment between them  cecilia had breakfasted to her hearts content on her favorite dishbuttered eggs she was in such good spirits that she was inclined to be coquettish even when there was no man present to fascinate we are not allowed to talk about love in this school she saidand hid her face behind her fan besides if it came to miss ladds ears poor mr morris might lose his situation  but isnt it true asked francine  it may be true my dear but nobody knows emily hasnt breathed a word about it to any of us and mr morris keeps his own secret now and then we catch him looking at herand we draw our own conclusions  did you meet emily on your way here  yes and she passed without speaking to me  thinking perhaps of mr morris  cecilia shook her head thinking francine of the new life before herand regretting i am afraid that she ever confided her hopes and wishes to me did she tell you last night what her prospects are when she leaves school  she told me you had been very kind in helping her i daresay i should have heard more if i had not fallen asleep what is she going to do  to live in a dull house far away in the north cecilia answered with only old people in it she will have to write and translate for a great scholar who is studying mysterious inscriptionshieroglyphics i think they are calledfound among the ruins of central america its really no laughing matter francine emily made a joke of it too ill take anything but a situation as a governess she said the children who have me to teach them would be to be pitied indeed she begged and prayed me to help her to get an honest living what could i do i could only write home to papa he is a member of parliament and everybody who wants a place seems to think he is bound to find it for them as it happened he had heard from an old friend of his a certain sir jervis redwood who was in search of a secretary being in favor of letting the women compete for employment with the men sir jervis was willing to try what he calls a female isnt that a horrid way of speaking of us and miss ladd says its ungrammatical besides papa had written back to say he knew of no lady whom he could recommend when he got my letter speaking of emily he kindly wrote again in the interval sir jervis had received two applications for the vacant place they were both from old ladiesand he declined to employ them  because they were old francine suggested maliciously  you shall hear him give his own reasons my dear papa sent me an extract from his letter it made me rather angry and perhaps for that reason i think i can repeat it word for wordwe are four old people in this house and we dont want a fifth let us have a young one to cheer us if your daughters friend likes the terms and is not encumbered with a sweetheart i will send for her when the school breaks up at midsummer coarse and selfishisnt it however emily didnt agree with me when i showed her the extract she accepted the place very much to her aunts surprise and regret when that excellent person heard of it now that the time has come though emily wont acknowledge it i believe she secretly shrinks poor dear from the prospect  very likely francine agreedwithout even a pretense of sympathy but tell me who are the four old people  first sir jervis himselfseventy last birthday next his unmarried sisternearly eighty next his manservant mr rookwell past sixty and last his manservants wife who considers herself young being only a little over forty that is the household mrs rook is coming today to attend emily on the journey to the north and i am not at all sure that emily will like her  a disagreeable woman i suppose  nonot exactly that rather odd and flighty the fact is mrs rook has had her troubles and perhaps they have a little unsettled her she and her husband used to keep the village inn close to our park we know all about them at home i am sure i pity these poor people what are you looking at francine  feeling no sort of interest in mr and mrs rook francine was studying her schoolfellows lovely face in search of defects she had already discovered that cecilias eyes were placed too widely apart and that her chin wanted size and character  i was admiring your complexion dear she answered coolly well and why do you pity the rooks  simple cecilia smiled and went on with her story  they are obliged to go out to service in their old age through a misfortune for which they are in no way to blame their customers deserted the inn and mr rook became bankrupt the inn got what they call a bad namein a very dreadful way there was a murder committed in the house  a murder cried francine oh this is exciting you provoking girl why didnt you tell me about it before  i didnt think of it said cecilia placidly  do go on were you at home when it happened  i w as here at school  you saw the newspapers i suppose  miss ladd doesnt allow us to read newspapers i did hear of it however in letters from home not that there was much in the letters they said it was too horrible to be described the poor murdered gentleman  francine was unaffectedly shocked a gentleman she exclaimed how dreadful  the poor man was a stranger in our part of the country cecilia resumed and the police were puzzled about the motive for a murder his pocketbook was missing but his watch and his rings were found on the body i remember the initials on his linen because they were the same as my mothers initial before she was marriedj b really francine thats all i know about it  surely you know whether the murderer was discovered  oh yesof course i know that the government offered a reward and clever people were sent from london to help the county police nothing came of it the murderer has never been discovered from that time to this  when did it happen  it happened in the autumn  the autumn of last year  no no nearly four years since     chapter vi on the way to the village  alban morrisdiscovered by emily in concealment among the treeswas not content with retiring to another part of the grounds he pursued his retreat careless in what direction it might take him to a footpath across the fields which led to the highroad and the railway station  miss ladds drawingmaster was in that state of nervous irritability which seeks relief in rapidity of motion public opinion in the neighborhood especially public opinion among the women had long since decided that his manners were offensive and his temper incurably bad the men who happened to pass him on the footpath said goodmorning grudgingly the women took no notice of himwith one exception she was young and saucy and seeing him walking at the top of his speed on the way to the railway station she called after him dont be in a hurry sir youre in plenty of time for the london train  to her astonishment he suddenly stopped his reputation for rudeness was so well established that she moved away to a safe distance before she ventured to look at him again he took no notice of herhe seemed to be considering with himself the frolicsome young woman had done him a service she had suggested an idea  suppose i go to london he thought why notthe school is breaking up for the holidaysand she is going away like the rest of them he looked round in the direction of the schoolhouse if i go back to wish her goodby she will keep out of my way and part with me at the last moment like a stranger after my experience of women to be in love againin love with a girl who is young enough to be my daughterwhat a fool what a driveling degraded fool i must be  hot tears rose in his eyes he dashed them away savagely and went on again faster than everresolved to pack up at once at his lodgings in the village and to take his departure by the next train  at the point where the footpath led into the road he came to a standstill for the second time  the cause was once more a person of the sex associated in his mind with a bitter sense of injury on this occasion the person was only a miserable little child crying over the fragments of a broken jug  alban morris looked at her with his grimly humorous smile so youve broken a jug he remarked  and spilt fathers beer the child answered her frail little body shook with terror motherll beat me when i go home she said  what does mother do when you bring the jug back safe and sound alban asked  gives me brenbutter  very well now listen to me mother shall give you bread and butter again this time  the child stared at him with the tears suspended in her eyes he went on talking to her as seriously as ever  you understand what i have just said to you  yes sir  have you got a pockethandkerchief  no sir  then dry your eyes with mine  he tossed his handkerchief to her with one hand and picked up a fragment of the broken jug with the other this will do for a pattern he said to himself the child stared at the handkerchiefstared at albantook courageand rubbed vigorously at her eyes the instinct which is worth all the reason that ever pretended to enlighten mankindthe instinct that never deceivestold this little ignorant creature that she had found a friend she returned the handkerchief in grave silence alban took her up in his arms  your eyes are dry and your face is fit to be seen he said will you give me a kiss the child gave him a resolute kiss with a smack in it now come and get another jug he said as he put her down her red round eyes opened wide in alarm have you got money enough she asked alban slapped his pocket yes i have he answered thats a good thing said the child come along  they went together hand in hand to the village and bought the new jug and had it filled at the beershop the thirsty father was at the upper end of the fields where they were making a drain alban carried the jug until they were within sight of the laborer you havent far to go he said mind you dont drop it againwhats the matter now  im frightened  why  oh give me the jug  she almost snatched it out of his hand if she let the precious minutes slip away there might be another beating in store for her at the drain her father was not of an indulgent disposition when his children were late in bringing his beer on the point of hurrying away without a word of farewell she remembered the laws of politeness as taught at the infant schooland dropped her little curtseyand said thank you sir that bitter sense of injury was still in albans mind as he looked after her what a pity she should grow up to be a woman he said to himself  the adventure of the broken jug had delayed his return to his lodgings by more than half an hour when he reached the road once more the cheap uptrain from the north had stopped at the station he heard the ringing of the bell as it resumed the journey to london  one of the passengers judging by the handbag that she carried had not stopped at the village  as she advanced toward him along the road he remarked that she was a small wiry active womandressed in bright colors combined with a deplorable want of taste her aquiline nose seemed to be her most striking feature as she came nearer it might have been fairly proportioned to the rest of her face in her younger days before her cheeks had lost flesh and roundness being probably nearsighted she kept her eyes halfclosed there were cunning little wrinkles at the corners of them in spite of appearances she was unwilling to present any outward acknowledgment of the march of time her hair was palpably dyedher hat was jauntily set on her head and ornamented with a gay feather she walked with a light tripping step swinging her bag and holding her head up smartly her manner like her dress said as plainly as words could speak no matter how long i may have lived i mean to be young and charming to the end of my days to albans surprise she stopped and addressed him  oh i beg your pardon could you tell me if i am in the right road to miss ladds school  she spoke with nervous rapidity of articulation and with a singularly unpleasant smile it parted her thin lips just widely enough to show her suspiciously beautiful teeth and it opened her keen gray eyes in the strangest manner the higher lid rose so as to disclose for a moment the upper part of the eyeball and to give her the appearancenot of a woman bent on making herself agreeable but of a woman staring in a panic of terror careless to conceal the unfavorable impression that she had produced on him alban answered roughly straight on and tried to pass her  she stopped him with a peremptory gesture i have treated you politely she said and how do you treat me in return well i am not surprised men are all brutes by natureand you are a man straight on she repeated contemptuously i should like to know how far that helps a person in a strange place perhaps you know no more where miss ladds school is than i do or perhaps you dont care to take the trouble of addressing me just what i should have expected from a person of your sex goodmorning  alban felt the reproof she had appealed to his most readilyimpressible sensehis sense of humor he rather enjoyed seeing his own prejudice against women grotesquely reflected in this flighty strangers prejudice against men as the best excuse for himself that he could make he gave her all the information that she could possibly wantthen tried again to pass onand again in vain he had recovered his place in her estimation she had not done with him yet  you know all about the way there she said i wonder whether you know anything about the school  no change in her voice no change in her manner betrayed any special motive for putting this question alban was on the point of suggesting that she should go on to the school and make her inquiries therewhen he happened to notice her eyes she had hitherto looked him straight in the face she now looked down on the road it was a trifling change in all probability it meant nothingand yet merely because it was a change it roused his curiosity i ought to know something about the school he answered i am one of the masters  then youre just the man i want may i ask your name  alban morris  thank you i am mrs rook i presume you have heard of sir jervis redwood  no  bless my soul you are a scholar of courseand you have never heard of one of your own trade very extraordinary you see i am sir jerviss housekeeper and i am sent here to take one of your young ladies back with me to our place dont interrupt me dont be a brute again sir jervis is not of a communicative disposition at least not to me a manthat explains ita man he is always poring over his books and writings and miss redwood at her great age is in bed half the day not a thing do i know about this new inmate of ours except that i am to take her back with me you would feel some curiosity yourself in my place wouldnt you now do tell me what sort of girl is miss emily brown  the name that he was perpetually thinking ofon this womans lips alban looked at her  well said mrs rook am i to have no answer ah you want leading so like a man again is she pretty  still examining the housekeeper with mingled feelings of interest and distrust alban answered ungraciously  yes  goodtempered  alban again said yes  so much about herself mrs rook remarked about her family now she shifted her bag restlessly from one hand to another perhaps you can tell me if miss emilys father she suddenly corrected herselfif miss emilys parents are living  i dont know  you mean you wont tell me  i mean exactly what i have said  oh it doesnt matter mrs rook rejoined i shall find out at the school the first turning to the left i think you saidacross the fields  he was too deeply interested in emily to let the housekeeper go without putting a question on his side  is sir jervis redwood one of miss emilys old friends he asked  he what put that into your head he has never even seen miss emily shes going to our houseah the women are getting the upper hand now and serve the men right i sayshes going to our house to be sir jerviss secretary you would like to have the place yourself wouldnt you you would like to keep a poor girl from getting her own living oh you may look as fierce as you pleasethe times gone by when a man could frighten me i like her christian name i call emily a nice name enough but brown goodmorning mr morris you and i are not cursed with such a contemptibly common name as that brown oh lord  she tossed her head scornfully and walked away humming a tune  alban stood rooted to the spot the effort of his later life had been to conceal the hopeless passion which had mastered him in spite of himself knowing nothing from emilywho at once pitied and avoided himof her family circumstances or of her future plans he had shrunk from making inquiries of others in the fear that they too might find out his secret and that their contempt might be added to the contempt which he felt for himself in this position and with these obstacles in his way the announcement of emilys proposed journeyunder the care of a stranger to fill an employment in the house of a strangernot only took him by surprise but inspired him with a strong feeling of distrust he looked after sir jervis redwoods flighty housekeeper completely forgetting the purpose which had brought him thus far on the way to his lodgings before mrs rook was out of sight alban morris was following her back to the school     chapter vii coming events cast their shadows before  miss de sor and miss wyvil were still sitting together under the trees talking of the murder at the inn  and is that really all you can tell me said francine  that is all cecilia answered  is there no love in it  none that i know of  its the most uninteresting murder that ever was committed what shall we do with ourselves im tired of being here in the garden when do the performances in the schoolroom begin  not for two hours yet  francine yawned and what part do you take in it she asked  no part my dear i tried onceonly to sing a simple little song when i found myself standing before all the company and saw rows of ladies and gentlemen waiting for me to begin i was so frightened that miss ladd had to make an apology for me i didnt get over it for the rest of the day for the first time in my life i had no appetite for my dinner horrible said cecilia shuddering over the remembrance of it i do assure you i thought i was going to die  perfectly unimpressed by this harrowing narrative francine turned her head lazily toward the house the door was thrown open at the same moment a lithe little person rapidly descended the steps that led to the lawn  its emily come back again said francine  and she seems to be rather in a hurry cecilia remarked  francines satirical smile showed itself for a moment did this appearance of hurry in emilys movements denote impatience to resume the recital of the daggerscene she had no book in her hand she never even looked toward francine sorrow became plainly visible in her face as she approached the two girls  cecilia rose in alarm she had been the first person to whom emily had confided her domestic anxieties bad news from your aunt she asked  no my dear no news at all emily put her arms tenderly round her friends neck the time has come cecilia she said we must wish each other goodby  is mrs rook here already  its you dear who are going emily answered sadly they have sent the governess to fetch you miss ladd is too busy in the schoolroom to see herand she has told me all about it dont be alarmed there is no bad news from home your plans are altered thats all  altered cecilia repeated in what way  in a very agreeable wayyou are going to travel your father wishes you to be in london in time for the evening mail to france  cecilia guessed what had happened my sister is not getting well she said and the doctors are sending her to the continent  to the baths at st moritz emily added there is only one difficulty in the way and you can remove it your sister has the good old governess to take care of her and the courier to relieve her of all trouble on the journey they were to have started yesterday you know how fond julia is of you at the last moment she wont hear of going away unless you go too the rooms are waiting at st moritz and your father is annoyed the governess says by the delay that has taken place already  she paused cecilia was silent surely you dont hesitate emily said  i am too happy to go wherever julia go es cecilia answered warmly i was thinking of you dear her tender nature shrinking from the hard necessities of life shrank from the cruellyclose prospect of parting i thought we were to have had some hours together yet she said why are we hurried in this way there is no second train to london from our station till late in the afternoon  there is the express emily reminded her and there is time to catch it if you drive at once to the town she took cecilias hand and pressed it to her bosom thank you again and again dear for all you have done for me whether we meet again or not as long as i live i shall love you dont cry she made a faint attempt to resume her customary gayety for cecilias sake try to be as hardhearted as i am think of your sisterdont think of me only kiss me  cecilias tears fell fast oh my love i am so anxious about you i am so afraid that you will not be happy with that selfish old manin that dreary house give it up emily i have got plenty of money for both of us come abroad with me why not you always got on well with julia when you came to see us in the holidays oh my darling my darling what shall i do without you  all that longed for love in emilys nature had clung round her schoolfriend since her fathers death turning deadly pale under the struggle to control herself she made the effortand bore the pain of it without letting a cry or a tear escape her our ways in life lie far apart she said gently there is the hope of meeting again dearif there is nothing more  the clasp of cecilias arm tightened round her she tried to release herself but her resolution had reached its limits her hands dropped trembling she could still try to speak cheerfully and that was all  there is not the least reason cecilia to be anxious about my prospects i mean to be sir jervis redwoods favorite before i have been a week in his service  she stopped and pointed to the house the governess was approaching them one more kiss darling we shall not forget the happy hours we have spent together we shall constantly write to each other she broke down at last oh cecilia cecilia leave me for gods sakei cant bear it any longer  the governess parted them emily dropped into the chair that her friend had left even her hopeful nature sank under the burden of life at that moment  a hard voice speaking close at her side startled her  would you rather be me the voice asked without a creature to care for you  emily raised her head francine the unnoticed witness of the parting interview was standing by her idly picking the leaves from a rose which had dropped out of cecilias nosegay  had she felt her own isolated position she had felt it resentfully  emily looked at her with a heart softened by sorrow there was no answering kindness in the eyes of miss de sorthere was only a dogged endurance sad to see in a creature so young  you and cecilia are going to write to each other she said i suppose there is some comfort in that when i left the island they were glad to get rid of me they said telegraph when you are safe at miss ladds school you see we are so rich the expense of telegraphing to the west indies is nothing to us besides a telegram has an advantage over a letterit doesnt take long to read i daresay i shall write home but they are in no hurry and i am in no hurry the schools breaking up you are going your way and i am going mineand who cares what becomes of me only an ugly old schoolmistress who is paid for caring i wonder why i am saying all this because i like you i dont know that i like you any better than you like me when i wanted to be friends with you you treated me coolly i dont want to force myself on you i dont particularly care about you may i write to you from brighton  under all this bitternessthe first exhibition of francines temper at its worst which had taken place since she joined the schoolemily saw or thought she saw distress that was too proud or too shy to show itself how can you ask the question she answered cordially  francine was incapable of meeting the sympathy offered to her even half way never mind how she said yes or no is all i want from you  oh francine francine what are you made of flesh and blood or stone and iron write to me of courseand i will write back again  thank you are you going to stay here under the trees  yes  all by yourself  all by myself  with nothing to do  i can think of cecilia  francine eyed her with steady attention for a moment  didnt you tell me last night that you were very poor she asked  i did  so poor that you are obliged to earn your own living  yes  francine looked at her again  i daresay you wont believe me she said i wish i was you  she turned away irritably and walked back to the house  were there really longings for kindness and love under the surface of this girls perverse nature or was there nothing to be hoped from a better knowledge of herin place of tender remembrances of cecilia these were the perplexing and unwelcome thoughts which the more potent personality of francine forced upon emilys mind  she rose impatiently and looked at her watch when would it be her turn to leave the school and begin the new life  still undecided what to do next her interest was excited by the appearance of one of the servants on the lawn the woman approached her and presented a visitingcard bearing on it the name of sir jervis redwood beneath the name there was a line written in pencil mrs rook to wait on miss emily brown the way to the new life was open before her at last  looking again at the commonplace announcement contained in the line of writing she was not quite satisfied was it claiming a deference toward herself to which she was not entitled to expect a letter either from sir jervis or from miss redwood giving her some information as to the journey which she was about to undertake and expressing with some little politeness the wish to make her comfortable in her future home at any rate her employer had done her one service he had reminded her that her station in life was not what it had been in the days when her father was living and when her aunt was in affluent circumstances  she looked up from the card the servant had gone alban morris was waiting at a little distancewaiting silently until she noticed him     chapter viii master and pupil  emilys impulse was to avoid the drawingmaster for the second time the moment afterward a kinder feeling prevailed the farewell interview with cecilia had left influences which pleaded for alban morris it was the day of parting good wishes and general separations he had only perhaps come to say goodby she advanced to offer her hand when he stopped her by pointing to sir jervis redwoods card  may i say a word miss emily about that woman he asked  do you mean mrs rook  yes you know of course why she comes here  she comes here by appointment to take me to sir jervis redwoods house are you acquainted with her  she is a perfect stranger to me i met her by accident on her way here if mrs rook had been content with asking me to direct her to the school i should not be troubling you at this moment but she forced her conversation on me and she said something which i think you ought to know have you heard of sir jervis redwoods housekeeper before today  i have only heard what my friendmiss cecilia wyvilhas told me  did miss cecilia tell you that mrs rook was acquainted with your father or with any members of your family  certainly not  alban reflected it was natural enough he resumed that mrs rook should feel some curiosity about you what reason had she for putting a question to me about your fatherand putting it in a very strange manner  emilys interest was instantly excited she led the way back to the seats in the shade tell me mr morris exactly what the woman said as she spoke she signed to him to be seated  alban observed the natural grace of her action when she set him the example of taking a chair and the little heightening of her color caused by anxiety to hear what he had still to tell her forgetting the restraint that he had hitherto imposed on himself he enjoyed the luxury of silently admiring her her manner betrayed none of the conscious confusion which would have shown itself if her heart had been secretly inclined toward him she saw the man looking at her in simple perplexity she looked at the man  are you hesitating on my account she asked did mrs rook say something of my father which i mustnt hear  no no nothing of the sort  you seem to be confused  her innocent indifference tried his patience sorely his memory went back to the past timerecalled the illplaced passion of his youth and the cruel injury inflicted on himhis pride was roused was he making himself ridiculous the vehement throbbing of his heart almost suffocated him and there she sat wondering at his odd behavior even this girl is as coldblooded as the rest of her sex that angry thought gave him back his selfcontrol he made his excuses with the easy politeness of a man of the world  i beg your pardon miss emily i was considering how to put what i have to say in the fewest and plainest words let me try if i can do it if mrs rook had merely asked me whether your father and mother were living i should have attributed the question to the commonplace curiosity of a gossiping woman and have thought no more of it what she actually did say was this perhaps you can tell me if miss emilys father there she checked herself and suddenly altered the question in this way if miss emilys parents are living i may be making mountains out of molehills but i thought at the time and think still that she had some special interest in inquiring after your father and not wishing me to notice it for reasons of her own changed the form of the question so as to include your mother does this strike you as a farfetched conclusion  whatever it may be emily said it is my conclusion too how did you answer her  quite easily i could give her no informationand i said so  let me offer you the information mr morris before we say anything more i have lost both my parents  albans momentary outbreak of irritability was at an end he was earnest and yet gentle again he forgave her for not understanding how dear and how delightful to him she was will it distress you he said if i ask how long it is since your father died  nearly four years she replied he was the most generous of men mrs rooks interest in him may surely have been a grateful interest he may have been kind to her in past yearsand she may remember him thankfully dont you think so  alban was unable to agree with her if mrs rooks interest in your father was the harmless interest that you have suggested he said why should she have checked herself in that unaccountable manner when she first asked me if he was living the more i think of it now the less sure i feel that she knows anything at all of your family history it may help me to decide if you will tell me at what time the death of your mother took place  so long ago emily replied that i cant even remember her death i was an infant at the time  and yet mrs rook asked me if your parents were living one of two things alban concluded either there is some mystery in this matter which we cannot hope to penetrate at presentor mrs rook may have been speaking at random on the chance of discovering whether you are related to some mr brown whom she once knew  besides emily added its only fair to remember what a common family name mine is and how easily people may make mistakes i should like to know if my dear lost father was really in her mind when she spoke to you do you think i could find it out  if mrs rook has any reasons for concealment i believe you would have no chance of finding it outunless indeed you could take her by surprise  in what way mr morris  only one way occurs to me just now he said do you happen to have a miniature or a photograph of your father  emily held out a handsome locket with a monogram in diamonds attached to her watch chain i have his photograph here she rejoined given to me by my dear old aunt in the days of her prosperity shall i show it to mrs rook  yesif she happens by good luck to offer you an opportunity  impatient to try the experiment emily rose as he spoke i mustnt keep mrs rook waiting she said  alban stopped her on the point of leaving him the confusion and hesitation which she had already noticed began to show themselves in his manner once more  miss emily may i ask you a favor before you go i am only one of the masters employed in the school but i dont thinklet me say i hope i am not guilty of presumptionif i offer to be of some small service to one of my pupils  there his embarrassment mastered him he despised himself not only for yielding to his own weakness but for faltering like a fool in the expression of a simple request the next words died away on his lips  this time emily understood him  the subtle penetration which had long since led her to the discovery of his secretoverpowered thus far by the absorbing interest of the momentnow recovered its activity in an instant she remembered that albans motive for cautioning her in her coming intercourse with mrs rook was not the merely friendly motive which might have actuated him in the case of one of the other girls at the same time her quickness of apprehension warned her not to risk encouraging this persistent lover by betraying any embarrassment on her side he was evidently anxious to be present in her interests at the interview with mrs rook why not could he reproach her with raising false hope if she accepted his services under circumstances of doubt and difficulty which he had himself been the first to point out he could do nothing of the sort without waiting until he had recovered himself she answered him to all appearances as composedly as if he had spoken to her in the plainest terms  after all that you have told me she said i shall indeed feel obliged if you will be present when i see mrs rook  the eager brightening of his eyes the flush of happiness that made him look young on a sudden were signs not to be mistaken the sooner they were in the presence of a third person emily privately concluded the better it might be for both of them she led the way rapidly to the house     chapter ix mrs rook and the locket  as mistress of a prosperous school bearing a widelyextended reputation miss ladd prided herself on the liberality of her household arrangements at breakfast and dinner not only the solid comforts but the elegant luxuries of the table were set before the young ladies other schools may and no doubt do offer to pupils the affectionate care to which they have been accustomed under the parents roof miss ladd used to say at my school that care extends to their meals and provides them with a cuisine which i flatter myself equals the most successful efforts of the cooks at home fathers mothers and friends when they paid visits to this excellent lady brought away with them the most gratifying recollections of her hospitality the men in particular seldom failed to recognize in their hostess the rarest virtue that a single lady can possessthe virtue of putting wine on the table which may be gratefully remembered by her guests the next morning  an agreeable surprise awaited mrs rook when she entered the house of bountiful miss ladd  luncheon was ready for sir jervis redwoods confidential emissary in the waitingroom detained at the final rehearsals of music and recitation miss ladd was worthily represented by cold chicken and ham a fruit tart and a pint decanter of generous sherry your mistress is a perfect lady mrs rook said to the servant with a burst of enthusiasm i can carve for myself thank you and i dont care how long miss emily keeps me waiting  as they ascended the steps leading into the house alban asked emily if he might look again at her locket  shall i open it for you she suggested  no i only want to look at the outside of it  he examined the side on which the monogram appeared inlaid with diamonds an inscription was engraved beneath  may i read it he said  certainly  the inscription ran thus in loving memory of my father died 30th september 1877  can you arrange the locket alban asked so that the side on which the diamonds appear hangs outward  she understood him the diamonds might attract mrs rooks notice and in that case she might ask to see the locket of her own accord you are beginning to be of use to me already emily said as they turned into the corridor which led to the waitingroom  they found sir jerviss housekeeper luxuriously recumbent in the easiest chair in the room  of the eatable part of the lunch some relics were yet left in the pint decanter of sherry not a drop remained the genial influence of the wine hastened by the hot weather was visible in mrs rooks flushed face and in a special development of her ugly smile her widening lips stretched to new lengths and the white upper line of her eyeballs were more freely and horribly visible than ever  and this is the dear young lady she said lifting her hands in overacted admiration at the first greetings alban perceived that the impression produced was in emilys case as in his case instantly unfavorable  the servant came in to clear the table emily stepped aside for a minute to give some directions about her luggage in that interval mrs rooks cunning little eyes turned on alban with an expression of malicious scrutiny  you were walking the other way she whispered when i met you she stopped and glanced over her shoulder at emily i see what attraction has brought you back to the school steal your way into that poor little fools heart and then make her miserable for the rest of her lifeno need miss to hurry she said shifting the polite side of her toward emily who returned at the moment the visits of the trains to your station here are like the visits of the angels described by the poet few and far between please excuse the quotation you wouldnt think it to look at meim a great reader  is it a long journey to sir jervis redwoods house emily asked at a loss what else to say to a woman who was already becoming unendurable to her  mrs rook looked at the journey from an oppressively cheerful point of view  oh miss emily you shant feel the time hang heavy in my company i can converse on a variety of topics and if there is one thing more than another that i like its amusing a pretty young lady you think me a strange creature dont you its only my high spirits nothing strange about meunless its my queer christian name you look a little dull my dear shall i begin amusing you before we are on the railway shall i tell you how i came by my queer name  thus far alban had controlled himself this last specimen of the housekeepers audacious familiarity reached the limits of his endurance  we dont care to know how you came by your name he said  rude mrs rook remarked composedly but nothing surprises me coming from a man  she turned to emily my father and mother were a wicked married couple she continued before i was born they got religion as the saying is at a methodist meeting in a field when i came into the worldi dont know how you feel miss i protest against being brought into the world without asking my leave firstmy mother was determined to dedicate me to piety before i was out of my long clothes what name do you suppose she had me christened by she chose it or made it herselfthe name of righteous righteous rook was there ever a poor baby degraded by such a ridiculous name before its needless to say when i write letters i sign r rookand leave people to think its rosamond or rosabelle or something sweetly pretty of that kind you should have seen my husbands face when he first heard that his sweethearts name was righteous he was on the point of kissing me and he stopped i daresay he felt sick perfectly natural under the circumstances  alban tried to stop her again what time does the train go he asked  emily entreated him to restrain himself by a look mrs rook was still too inveterately amiable to take offense she opened her travelingbag briskly and placed a railway guide in albans hands  ive heard that the women do the mens work in foreign parts she said but this is england and i am an englishwoman find out when the train goes my dear sir for yourself  alban at once consulted the guide if there proved to be no immediate need of starting for the station he was determined that emily should not be condemned to pass the interval in the housekeepers company in the meantime mrs rook was as eager as ever to show her dear young lady what an amusing companion she could be  talking of husbands she resumed dont make the mistake my dear that i committed beware of letting anybody persuade you to marry an old man mr rook is old enough to be my father i bear with him of course i bear with him at the same time i have not as the poet says passed through the ordeal unscathed my spiriti have long since ceased to believe in anything of the sort i only use the word for want of a bettermy spirit i say has become embittered i was once a pious young woman i do assure you i was nearly as good as my name dont let me shock you i have lost faith and hope i have becomewhats the last new name for a freethinker oh i keep up with the times thanks to old miss redwood she takes in the newspapers and makes me read them to her what is the new name something ending in ic bombastic no agnosticthats it i have become an agnostic the inevitable result of marrying an old man if theres any blame it rests on my husband  theres more than an hour yet before the train starts alban interposed i am sure miss emily you would find it pleasanter to wait in the garden  not at all a bad notion mrs rook declared heres a man who can make himself useful for once lets go into the garden  she rose and led the way to the door alban seized the opportunity of whispering to emily  did you notice the empty decanter when we first came in that horrid woman is drunk  emily pointed significantly to the locket dont let her go the garden will distract her attention keep her near me here  mrs rook gayly opened the door take me to the flowerbeds she said i believe in nothingbut i adore flowers  mrs rook waited at the door with her eye on emily what do you say miss  i think we shall be more comfortable if we stay where we are  whatever pleases you my dear pleases me with this reply the compliant housekeeperas amiable as ever on the surfacereturned to her chair  would she notice the locket as she sat down emily turned toward the window so as to let the light fall on the diamonds  no mrs rook was absorbed at the moment in her own reflections miss emily having prevented her from seeing the garden she was maliciously bent on disappointing miss emily in return sir jerviss secretary being young took a hopeful view no doubt of her future prospects mrs rook decided on darkening that view in a mischievouslysuggestive manner peculiar to herself  you will naturally feel some curiosity about your new home she began and i havent said a word about it yet how very thoughtless of me inside and out dear miss emily our house is just a little dull i say our house and why notwhen the management of it is all thrown on me we are built of stone and we are much too long and are not half high enough our situation is on the coldest side of the county away in the west we are close to the cheviot hills and if you fancy there is anything to see when you look out of window except sheep you will find yourself woefully mistaken as for walks if you go out on one side of the house you may or may not be gored by cattle on the other side if the darkness overtakes you you may or may not tumble down a deserted lead mine but the company inside the house makes amends for it all mrs rook proceeded enjoying the expression of dismay which was beginning to show itself on emilys face plenty of excitement for you my dear in our small family sir jervis will introduce you to plaster casts of hideous indian idols he will keep you writing for him without mercy from morning to night and when he does let you go old miss redwood will find she cant sleep and will send for the pretty young ladysecretary to read to her my husband i am sure you will like he is a respectable man and bears the highest character next to the idols hes the most hideous object in the house if you are good enough to encourage him i dont say that he wont amuse you he will tell you for instance he never in his life hated any human being as he hates his wife by the way i must not forgetin the interests of truth you knowto mention one drawback that does exist in our domestic circle one of these days we shall have our brains blown out or our throats cut sir jerviss mother left him ten thousand pounds worth of precious stones all contained in a little cabinet with drawers he wont let the banker take care of his jewels he wont sell them he wont even wear one of the rings on his finger or one of the pins at his breast he keeps his cabinet on his dressingroom table and he says i like to gloat over my jewels every night before i go to bed ten thousand pounds worth of diamonds rubies emeralds sapphires and what notat the mercy of the first robber who happens to hear of them oh my dear he would have no choice i do assure you but to use his pistols we shouldnt quietly submit to be robbed sir jervis inherits the spirit of his ancestors my husband has the temper of a game cock i myself in defense of the property of my employers am capable of becoming a perfect fiend and we none of us understand the use of firearms  while she was in full enjoyment of this last aggravation of the horrors of the prospect emily tried another change of positionand this time with success greedy admiration suddenly opened mrs rooks little eyes to their utmost width my heart alive miss what do i see at your watchchain how they sparkle might i ask for a closer view  emilys fingers trembled but she succeeded in detaching the locket from the chain alban handed it to mrs rook  she began by admiring the diamondswith a certain reserve nothing like so large as sir jerviss diamonds but choice specimens no doubt might i ask what the value  she stopped the inscription had attracted her notice she began to read it aloud in loving memory of my father died  her face instantly became rigid the next words were suspended on her lips  alban seized the chance of making her betray herselfunder pretense of helping her perhaps you find the figures not easy to read he said the date is thirtieth september eighteen hundred and seventysevennearly four years since  not a word not a movement escaped mrs rook she held the locket before her as she had held it from the first alban looked at emily her eyes were riveted on the housekeeper she was barely capable of preserving the appearance of composure seeing the necessity of acting for her he at once said the words which she was unable to say for herself  perhaps mrs rook you would like to look at the portrait he suggested shall i open the locket for you  without speaking without looking up she handed the locket to alban  he opened it and offered it to her she neither accepted nor refused it her hands remained hanging over the arms of the chair he put the locket on her lap  the portrait produced no marked effect on mrs rook had the date prepared her to see it she sat looking at itstill without moving still without saying a word alban had no mercy on her that is the portrait of miss emilys father he said does it represent the same mr brown whom you had in your mind when you asked me if miss emilys father was still living  that question roused her she looked up on the instant she answered loudly and insolently no  and yet alban persisted you broke down in reading the inscription and considering what talkative woman you are the portrait has had a strange effect on youto say the least of it  she eyed him steadily while he was speakingand turned to emily when he had done you mentioned the heat just now miss the heat has overcome me i shall soon get right again  the insolent futility of that excuse irritated emily into answering her you will get right again perhaps all the sooner she said if we trouble you with no more questions and leave you to recover by yourself  the first change of expression which relaxed the iron tensity of the housekeepers face showed itself when she heard that reply at last there was a feeling in mrs rook which openly declared itselfa feeling of impatience to see alban and emily leave the room  they left her without a word more     chapter x guesses at the truth  what are we to do next oh mr morris you must have seen all sorts of people in your timeyou know human nature and i dont help me with a word of advice  emily forgot that he was in love with herforgot everything but the effect produced by the locket on mrs rook and the vaguely alarming conclusion to which it pointed in the fervor of her anxiety she took albans arm as familiarly as if he had been her brother he was gentle he was considerate he tried earnestly to compose her we can do nothing to any good purpose he said unless we begin by thinking quietly pardon me for saying soyou are needlessly exciting yourself  there was a reason for her excitement of which he was necessarily ignorant her memory of the night interview with miss jethro had inevitably intensified the suspicion inspired by the conduct of mrs rook in less than twentyfour hours emily had seen two women shrinking from secret remembrances of her fatherwhich might well be guilty remembrancesinnocently excited by herself how had they injured him of what infamy on their parts did his beloved and stainless memory remind them who could fathom the mystery of it what does it mean she cried looking wildly in albans compassionate face you must have formed some idea of your own what does it mean  come and sit down miss emily we will try if we can find out what it means together  they returned to the shady solitude under the trees away in front of the house the distant grating of carriage wheels told of the arrival of miss ladds guests and of the speedy beginning of the ceremonies of the day  we must help each other alban resumed  when we first spoke of mrs rook you mentioned miss cecilia wyvil as a person who knew something about her have you any objection to tell me what you may have heard in that way  in complying with his request emily necessarily repeated what cecilia had told francine when the two girls had met that morning in the garden  alban now knew how emily had obtained employment as sir jerviss secretary how mr and mrs rook had been previously known to cecilias father as respectable people keeping an inn in his own neighborhood and finally how they had been obliged to begin life again in domestic service because the terrible event of a murder had given the inn a bad name and had driven away the customers on whose encouragement their business depended  listening in silence alban remained silent when emilys narrative had come to an end  have you nothing to say to me she asked  i am thinking over what i have just heard he answered  emily noticed a certain formality in his tone and manner which disagreeably surprised her he seemed to have made his reply as a mere concession to politeness while he was thinking of something else which really interested him  have i disappointed you in any way she asked  on the contrary you have interested me i want to be quite sure that i remember exactly what you have said you mentioned i think that your friendship with miss cecilia wyvil began here at the school  yes  and in speaking of the murder at the village inn you told me that the crime was committedi have forgotten how long ago  his manner still suggested that he was idly talking about what she had told him while some more important subject for reflection was in possession of his mind  i dont know that i said anything about the time that had passed since the crime was committed she answered sharply what does the murder matter to us i think cecilia told me it happened about four years since excuse me for noticing it mr morrisyou seem to have some interests of your own to occupy your attention why couldnt you say so plainly when we came out here i should not have asked you to help me in that case since my poor fathers death i have been used to fight through my troubles by myself  she rose and looked at him proudly the next moment her eyes filled with tears  in spite of her resistance alban took her hand dear miss emily he said you distress me you have not done me justice your interests only are in my mind  answering her in those terms he had not spoken as frankly as usual he had only told her a part of the truth  hearing that the woman whom they had just left had been landlady of an inn and that a murder had been committed under her roof he was led to ask himself if any explanation might be found in these circumstances of the otherwise incomprehensible effect produced on mrs rook by the inscription on the locket  in the pursuit of this inquiry there had arisen in his mind a monstrous suspicion which pointed to mrs rook it impelled him to ascertain the date at which the murder had been committed and if the discovery encouraged further investigation to find out next the manner in which mr brown had died  thus far what progress had he made he had discovered that the date of mr browns death inscribed on the locket and the date of the crime committed at the inn approached each other nearly enough to justify further investigation  in the meantime had he succeeded in keeping his object concealed from emily he had perfectly succeeded hearing him declare that her interests only had occupied his mind the poor girl innocently entreated him to forgive her little outbreak of temper if you have any more questions to ask me mr morris pray go on i promise never to think unjustly of you again  he went on with an uneasy consciencefor it seemed cruel to deceive her even in the interests of truthbut still he went on  suppose we assume that this woman had injured your father in some way he said am i right in believing that it was in his character to forgive injuries  entirely right  in that case his death may have left mrs rook in a position to be called to account by those who owe a duty to his memoryi mean the surviving members of his family  there are but two of us mr morris my aunt and myself  there are his executors  my aunt is his only executor  your fathers sisteri presume  yes  he may have left instructions with her which might be of the greatest use to us  i will write today and find out emily replied i had already planned to consult my aunt she added thinking again of miss jethro  if your aunt has not received any positive instructions alban continued she may remember some allusion to mrs rook on your fathers part at the time of his last illness  emily stopped him you dont know how my dear father died she said he was struck downapparently in perfect healthby disease of the heart  struck down in his own house  yesin his own house  those words closed albans lips the investigation so carefully and so delicately conducted had failed to serve any useful purpose he had now ascertained the manner of mr browns death and the place of mr browns deathand he was as far from confirming his suspicions of mrs rook as ever     chapter xi the drawingmasters confession  is there nothing else you can suggest emily asked  nothingat present  if my aunt fails us have we no other hope  i have hope in mrs rook alban answered i see i surprise you but i really mean what i say sir jerviss housekeeper is an excitable woman and she is fond of wine there is always a weak side in the character of such a person as that if we wait for our chance and turn it to the right use when it comes we may yet succeed in making her betray herself  emily listened to him in bewilderment  you talk as if i was sure of your help in the future she said have you forgotten that i leave school today never to return in half an hour more i shall be condemned to a long journey in the company of that horrible creaturewith a life to look forward to in the same house with her among strangers a miserable prospect and a hard trial of a girls courageis it not mr morris  you will at least have one person miss emily who will try with all his heart and soul to encourage you  what do you mean  i mean said alban quietly that the midsummer vacation begins today and that the drawingmaster is going to spend his holidays in the north  emily jumped up from her chair you she exclaimed you are going to northumberland with me  why not alban asked the railway is open to all travelers alike if they have money enough to buy a ticket  mr morris what can you be thinking of indeed indeed i am not ungrateful i know you mean kindlyyou are a good generous man but do remember how completely a girl in my position is at the mercy of appearances you traveling in the same carriage with me and that woman putting her own vile interpretation on it and degrading me in sir jervis redwoods estimation on the day when i enter his house oh its worse than thoughtlessits madness downright madness  you are quite right alban gravely agreed it is madness i lost whatever little reason i once possessed miss emily on the day when i first met you out walking with the young ladies of the school  emily turned away in significant silence alban followed her  you promised just now he said never to think unjustly of me again i respect and admire you far too sincerely to take a base advantage of this occasionthe only occasion on which i have been permitted to speak with you alone wait a little before you condemn a man whom you dont understand i will say nothing to annoy youi only ask leave to explain myself will you take your chair again  she returned unwillingly to her seat it can only end she thought sadly in my disappointing him  i have had the worst possible opinion of women for years past alban resumed and the only reason i can give for it condemns me out of my own mouth i have been infamously treated by one woman and my wounded selfesteem has meanly revenged itself by reviling the whole sex wait a little miss emily my fault has received its fit punishment i have been thoroughly humiliatedand you have done it  mr morris  take no offense pray where no offense is meant some few years since it was the great misfortune of my life to meet with a jilt you know what i mean  yes  she was my equal by birth i am a younger son of a country squire and my superior in rank i can honestly tell you that i was fool enough to love her with all my heart and soul she never allowed me to doubti may say this without conceit remembering the miserable end of itthat my feeling for her was returned her father and mother excellent people approved of the contemplated marriage she accepted my presents she allowed all the customary preparations for a wedding to proceed to completion she had not even mercy en ough or shame enough to prevent me from publicly degrading myself by waiting for her at the altar in the presence of a large congregation the minutes passedand no bride appeared the clergyman waiting like me was requested to return to the vestry i was invited to follow him you foresee the end of the story of course she had run away with another man but can you guess who the man was her groom  emilys face reddened with indignation she suffered for it oh mr morris surely she suffered for it  not at all she had money enough to reward the groom for marrying her and she let herself down easily to her husbands level it was a suitable marriage in every respect when i last heard of them they were regularly in the habit of getting drunk together i am afraid i have disgusted you we will drop the subject and resume my precious autobiography at a later date one showery day in the autumn of last year you young ladies went out with miss ladd for a walk when you were all trotting back again under your umbrellas did you in particular notice an illtempered fellow standing in the road and getting a good look at you on the high footpath above him  emily smiled in spite of herself i dont remember it she said  you wore a brown jacket which fitted you as if you had been born in itand you had the smartest little straw hat i ever saw on a womans head it was the first time i ever noticed such things i think i could paint a portrait of the boots you wore mud included from memory alone that was the impression you produced on me after believing honestly believing that love was one of the lost illusions of my lifeafter feeling honestly feeling that i would as soon look at the devil as look at a womanthere was the state of mind to which retribution had reduced me using for his instrument miss emily brown oh dont be afraid of what i may say next in your presence and out of your presence i am man enough to be ashamed of my own folly i am resisting your influence over me at this moment with the strongest of all resolutionsthe resolution of despair lets look at the humorous side of the story again what do you think i did when the regiment of young ladies had passed by me  emily declined to guess  i followed you back to the school and on pretense of having a daughter to educate i got one of miss ladds prospectuses from the porter at the lodge gate i was in your neighborhood you must know on a sketching tour i went back to my inn and seriously considered what had happened to me the result of my cogitations was that i went abroad only for a changenot at all because i was trying to weaken the impression you had produced on me after a while i returned to england only because i was tired of travelingnot at all because your influence drew me back another interval passed and luck turned my way for a wonder the drawingmasters place became vacant here miss ladd advertised i produced my testimonials and took the situation only because the salary was a welcome certainty to a poor mannot at all because the new position brought me into personal association with miss emily brown do you begin to see why i have troubled you with all this talk about myself apply the contemptible system of selfdelusion which my confession has revealed to that holiday arrangement for a tour in the north which has astonished and annoyed you i am going to travel this afternoon by your train only because i feel an intelligent longing to see the northernmost county of englandnot at all because i wont let you trust yourself alone with mrs rook not at all because i wont leave you to enter sir jervis redwoods service without a friend within reach in case you want him mad oh yesperfectly mad but tell me this what do all sensible people do when they find themselves in the company of a lunatic they humor him let me take your ticket and see your luggage labeled i only ask leave to be your traveling servant if you are proudi shall like you all the better if you arepay me wages and keep me in my proper place in that way  some girls addressed with this reckless intermingling of jest and earnest would have felt confused and some would have felt flattered with a goodtempered resolution which never passed the limits of modesty and refinement emily met alban morris on his own ground  you have said you respect me she began i am going to prove that i believe you the least i can do is not to misinterpret you on my side am i to understand mr morrisyou wont think the worse of me i hope if i speak plainlyam i to understand that you are in love with me  yes miss emilyif you please  he had answered with the quaint gravity which was peculiar to him but he was already conscious of a sense of discouragement her composure was a bad signfrom his point of view  my time will come i daresay she proceeded at present i know nothing of love by experience i only know what some of my schoolfellows talk about in secret judging by what they tell me a girl blushes when her lover pleads with her to favor his addresses am i blushing  must i speak plainly too alban asked  if you have no objection she answered as composedly as if she had been addressing her grandfather  then miss emily i must sayyou are not blushing  she went on another token of loveas i am informedis to tremble am i trembling  no  am i too confused to look at you  no  do i walk away with dignityand then stop and steal a timid glance at my lover over my shoulder  i wish you did  a plain answer mr morris yes or no  noof course  in one last word do i give you any sort of encouragement to try again  in one last word i have made a fool of myselfand you have taken the kindest possible way of telling me so  this time she made no attempt to reply in his own tone the goodhumored gayety of her manner disappeared she was in earnesttruly sadly in earnestwhen she said her next words  is it not best in your own interests that we should bid each other goodby she asked in the time to comewhen you only remember how kind you once were to mewe may look forward to meeting again after all that you have suffered so bitterly and so undeservedly dont pray dont make me feel that another woman has behaved cruelly to you and that iso grieved to distress youam that heartless creature  never in her life had she been so irresistibly charming as she was at that moment her sweet nature showed all its innocent pity for him in her face  he saw ithe felt ithe was not unworthy of it in silence he lifted her hand to his lips he turned pale as he kissed it  say that you agree with me she pleaded  i obey you  as he answered he pointed to the lawn at their feet look he said at that dead leaf which the air is wafting over the grass is it possible that such sympathy as you feel for me such love as i feel for you can waste wither and fall to the ground like that leaf i leave you emilywith the firm conviction that there is a time of fulfillment to come in our two lives happen what may in the intervali trust the future    the words had barely passed his lips when the voice of one of the servants reached them from the house miss emily are you in the garden  emily stepped out into the sunshine the servant hurried to meet her and placed a telegram in her hand she looked at it with a sudden misgiving in her small experience a telegram was associated with the communication of bad news she conquered her hesitationopened itread it the color left her face she shuddered the telegram dropped on the grass  read it she said faintly as alban picked it up  he read these words come to london directly miss letitia is dangerously ill  your aunt he asked  yesmy aunt     book the secondin london    chapter xii mrs ellmother  the metropolis of great britain is in certain respects like no other metropolis on the face of the earth in the population that throngs the streets the extremes of wealth and the extremes of poverty meet as they meet nowhere else in the streets themselves the glory and the shame of architecturethe mansion and the hovelare neighbors in situation as they are neighbors nowhere else london in its social aspect is the city of contrasts  toward the close of evening emily left the railway terminus for the place of residence in which loss of fortune had compelled her aunt to take refuge as she approached her destination the cab passedby merely crossing a roadfrom a spacious and beautiful park with its surrounding houses topped by statues and cupolas to a row of cottages hard by a stinking ditch miscalled a canal the city of contrasts north and south east and west the city of social contrasts  emily stopped the cab before the garden gate of a cottage at the further end of the row the bell was answered by the one servant now in her aunts employmiss letitias maid  personally this good creature was one of the illfated women whose appearance suggests that nature intended to make men of them and altered her mind at the last moment miss letitias maid was tall and gaunt and awkward the first impression produced by her face was an impression of bones they rose high on her forehead they projected on her cheeks and they reached their boldest development in her jaws in the cavernous eyes of this unfortunate person rigid obstinacy and rigid goodness looked out together with equal severity on all her fellowcreatures alike her mistress whom she had served for a quarter of a century and more called her bony she accepted this cruelly appropriate nickname as a mark of affectionate familiarity which honored a servant no other person was allowed to take liberties with her to every one but her mistress she was known as mrs ellmother  how is my aunt emily asked  bad  why have i not heard of her illness before  because shes too fond of you to let you be distressed about her dont tell emily those were her orders as long as she kept her senses  kept her senses good heavens what do you mean  feverthats what i mean  i must see her directly i am not afraid of infection  theres no infection to be afraid of but you mustnt see her for all that  i insist on seeing her  miss emily i am disappointing you for your own good dont you know me well enough to trust me by this time  i do trust you  then leave my mistress to meand go and make yourself comfortable in your own room  emilys answer was a positive refusal mrs ellmother driven to her last resources raised a new obstacle  its not to be done i tell you how can you see miss letitia when she cant bear the light in her room do you know what color her eyes are red poor soulred as a boiled lobster  with every word the woman uttered emilys perplexity and distress increased  you told me my aunts illness was fever she saidand now you speak of some complaint in her eyes stand out of the way if you please and let me go to her  mrs ellmother still keeping her place looked through the open door  heres the doctor she announced it seems i cant satisfy you ask him whats the matter come in doctor she threw open the door of the parlor and introduced emily this is the mistresss niece sir please try if you can keep her quiet i cant she placed chairs with the hospitable politeness of the old schooland returned to her post at miss letitias bedside  doctor allday was an elderly man with a cool manner and a ruddy complexionthoroughly acclimatized to the atmosphere of pain and grief in which it was his destiny to live he spoke to emily without any undue familiarity as if he had been accustomed to see her for the greater part of her life  thats a curious woman he said when mrs ellmother closed the door the most headstrong person i think i ever met with but devoted to her mistress and making allowance for her awkwardness not a bad nurse i am afraid i cant give you an encouraging report of your aunt the rheumatic fever aggravated by the situation of this housebuilt on clay you know and close to stagnant water has been latterly complicated by delirium  is that a bad sign sir  the worst possible sign it shows that the disease has affected the heart yes she is suffering from inflammation of the eyes but that is an unimportant symptom we can keep the pain under by means of cooling lotions and a dark room ive often heard her speak of youespecially since the illness assumed a serious character what did you say will she know you when you go into her room this is about the time when the delirium usually sets in ill see if theres a quiet interval  he opened the doorand came back again  by the way he resumed i ought perhaps to explain how it was that i took the liberty of sending you that telegram mrs ellmother refused to inform you of her mistresss serious illness that circumstance according to my view of it laid the responsibility on the doctors shoulders the form taken by your aunts deliriumi mean the apparent tendency of the words that escape her in that stateseems to excite some incomprehensible feeling in the mind of her crabbed servant she wouldnt even let me go into the bedroom if she could possibly help it did mrs ellmother give you a warm welcome when you came here  far from it my arrival seemed to annoy her  ahjust what i expected these faithful old servants always end by presuming on their fidelity did you ever hear what a witty poeti forget his name he lived to be ninetysaid of the man who had been his valet for more than half a century for thirty years he was the best of servants and for thirty years he has been the hardest of masters quite truei might say the same of my housekeeper rather a good story isnt it  the story was completely thrown away on emily but one subject interested her now my poor aunt has always been fond of me she said perhaps she might know me when she recognizes nobody else  not very likely the doctor answered but theres no laying down any rule in cases of this kind i have sometimes observed that circumstances which have produced a strong impression on patients when they are in a state of health give a certain direction to the wandering of their minds when they are in a state of fever you will say i am not a circumstance i dont see how this encourages me to hopeand you will be quite right instead of talking of my medical experience i shall do better to look at miss letitia and let you know the result you have got other relations i suppose no very distressingvery distressing  who has not suffered as emily suffered when she was left alone are there not momentsif we dare to confess the truthwhen poor humanity loses its hold on the consolations of religion and the hope of immortality and feels the cruelty of creation that bids us live on the condition that we die and leads the first warm beginnings of love with merciless certainty to the cold conclusion of the grave  shes quiet for the time being dr allday announced on his return remember please that she cant see you in the inflamed state of her eyes and dont disturb the bedcurtains the sooner you go to her the better perhapsif you have anything to say which depends on her recognizing your voice ill call tomorrow morning very distressing he repeated taking his hat and making his bowvery distressing  emily crossed the narrow little passage which separated the two rooms and opened the bedchamber door mrs ellmother met her on the threshold no said the obstinate old servant you cant come in  the faint voice of miss letitia made itself heard calling mrs ellmother by her familiar nickname  bony who is it  never mind  who is it  miss emily if you must know  oh poor dear why does she come here who told her i was ill  the doctor told her  dont come in emily it will only distress youand it will do me no good god bless you my love dont come in  there said mrs ellmother do you hear that go back to the sittingroom  thus far the hard necessity of controlling herself had kept emily silent she was now able to speak without tears remember the old times aunt she pleaded gently dont keep me out of your room when i have come here to nurse you  im her nurse go back to the sittingroom mrs ellmother repeated  true love lasts while life lasts the dying woman relented  bony bony i cant be unkind to emily let her in  mrs ellmother still insisted on having her way  youre contradicting your own orders she said to her mistress you dont know how soon you may begin wandering in your mind again think miss letitiathink  this remonstrance was received in silence mrs ellmothers great gaunt figure still blocked up the doorway  if you force me to it emily said quietly i must go to the doctor and ask him to interfere  do you mean that mrs ellmother said quietly on her side  i do mean it was the answer  the old servant suddenly submittedwith a look which took emily by surprise she had expected to see anger the face that now confronted her was a face subdued by sorrow and fear  i wash my hands of it mrs ellmother said go inand take the consequences    chapter xiii miss letitia  emily entered the room the door was immediately closed on her from the outer side mrs ellmothers heavy steps were heard retreating along the passage then the banging of the door that led into the kitchen shook the flimsilybuilt cottage then there was silence  the dim light of a lamp hidden away in a corner and screened by a dingy green shade just revealed the closelycurtained bed and the table near it bearing medicinebottles and glasses the only objects on the chimneypiece were a clock that had been stopped in mercy to the sufferers irritable nerves and an open case containing a machine for pouring drops into the eyes the smell of fumigating pastilles hung heavily on the air to emilys excited imagination the silence was like the silence of death she approached the bed trembling wont you speak to me aunt  is that you emily who let you come in  you said i might come in dear are you thirsty i see some lemonade on the table shall i give it to you  no if you open the bedcurtains you let in the light my poor eyes why are you here my dear why are you not at the school  its holidaytime aunt besides i have left school for good  left school miss letitias memory made an effort as she repeated those words you were going somewhere when you left school she said and cecilia wyvil had something to do with it oh my love how cruel of you to go away to a stranger when you might live here with me she pausedher sense of what she had herself just said began to grow confused what stranger she asked abruptly was it a man what name oh my mind has death got hold of my mind before my body  hush hush ill tell you the name sir jervis redwood  i dont know him i dont want to know him do you think he means to send for you perhaps he has sent for you i wont allow it you shant go  dont excite yourself dear i have refused to go i mean to stay here with you  the fevered brain held to its last idea has he sent for you she said again louder than before  emily replied once more in terms carefully chosen with the one purpose of pacifying her the attempt proved to be useless and worseit seemed to make her suspicious i wont be deceived she said i mean to know all about it he did send for you whom did he send  his housekeeper  what name the tone in which she put the question told of excitement that was rising to its climax dont you know that im curious about names she burst out why do you provoke me who is it  nobody you know or need care about dear aunt mrs rook  instantly on the utterance of that name there followed an unexpected result silence ensued  emily waitedhesitatedadvanced to part the curtains and look in at her aunt she was stopped by a dreadful sound of laughterthe cheerless laughter that is heard among the mad it suddenly ended in a dreary sigh  afraid to look in she spoke hardly knowing what she said is there anything you wish for shall i call  miss letitias voice interrupted her dull low rapidly muttering it was unlike shockingly unlike the familiar voice of her aunt it said strange words  mrs rook what does mrs rook matter or her husband either bony bony youre frightened about nothing wheres the danger of those two people turning up do you know how many miles away the village is oh you foola hundred miles and more never mind the coroner the coroner must keep in his own districtand the jury too a risky deception i call it a pious fraud and i have a tender conscience and a cultivated mind the newspaper how is our newspaper to find its way to her i should like to know you poor old bony upon my word you do me goodyou make me laugh  the cheerless laughter broke out againand died away again drearily in a sigh  accustomed to decide rapidly in the ordinary emergencies of her life emily felt herself painfully embarrassed by the position in which she was now placed  after what she had already heard could she reconcile it to her sense of duty to her aunt to remain any longer in the room  in the hopeless selfbetrayal of delirium miss letitia had revealed some act of concealment committed in her past life and confided to her faithful old servant under these circumstances had emily made any discoveries which convicted her of taking a base advantage of her position at the bedside most assuredly not the nature of the act of concealment the causes that had led to it the person or persons affected by itthese were mysteries which left her entirely in the dark she had found out that her aunt was acquainted with mrs rook and that was literally all she knew  blameless so far in the line of conduct that she had pursued might she still remain in the bedchamberon this distinct understanding with herself that she would instantly return to the sittingroom if she heard anything which could suggest a doubt of miss letitias claim to her affection and respect after some hesitation she decided on leaving it to her conscience to answer that question does conscience ever say nowhen inclination says yes emilys conscience sided with her reluctance to leave her aunt  throughout the time occupied by these reflections the silence had remained unbroken emily began to feel uneasy she timidly put her hand through the curtains and took miss letitias hand the contact with the burning skin startled her she turned away to the door to call the servantwhen the sound of her aunts voice hurried her back to the bed  are you there bony the voice asked  was her mind getting clear again emily tried the experiment of making a plain reply your niece is with you she said shall i call the servant  miss letitias mind was still far away from emily and from the present time  the servant she repeated all the servants but you bony have been sent away londons the place for us no gossiping servants and no curious neighbors in london bury the horrid truth in london ah you may well say i look anxious and wretched i hate deceptionand yet it must be done why do you waste time in talking why dont you find out where the vile woman lives only let me get at herand ill make sara ashamed of herself  emilys heart beat fast when she heard the womans name sara as she and her schoolfellows knew was the baptismal name of miss jethro had her aunt alluded to the disgraced teacher or to some other woman  she waited eagerly to hear more there was nothing to be heard at this most interesting moment the silence remained undisturbed  in the fervor of her anxiety to set her doubts at rest emilys faith in her own good resolutions began to waver the temptation to say something which might set her aunt talking again was too strong to be resistedif she remained at the bedside despairing of herself she rose and turned to the door in the moment that passed while she crossed the room the very words occurred to her that would suit her purpose her cheeks were hot with shameshe hesitatedshe looked back at the bedthe words passed her lips  sara is only one of the womans names she said do you like her other name  the rapidlymuttering tones broke out again instantlybut not in answer to emily the sound of a voice had encouraged miss letitia to pursue her own confused train of thought and had stimulated the fastfailing capacity of speech to exert itself once more  no no hes too cunning for you and too cunning for me he doesnt leave letters about he destroys them all did i say he was too cunning for us its false we are too cunning for him who found the morsels of his letter in the basket who stuck them together ah we know dont read it bony dear miss jethrodont read it again miss jethro in his letter and sara when he talks to himself in the garden oh who would have believed it of him if we hadnt seen and heard it ourselves  there was no more doubt now  but who was the man so bitterly and so regretfully alluded to  no this time emily held firmly by the resolution which bound her to respect the helpless position of her aunt the speediest way of summoning mrs ellmother would be to ring the bell as she touched the handle a faint cry of suffering from the bed called her back  oh so thirsty murmured the failing voiceso thirsty  she parted the curtains the shrouded lamplight just showed her the green shade over miss letitias eyesthe hollow cheeks below itthe arms laid helplessly on the bedclothes oh aunt dont you know my voice dont you know emily let me kiss you dear useless to plead with her useless to kiss her she only reiterated the words so thirsty so thirsty emily raised the poor tortured body with a patient caution which spared it pain and put the glass to her aunts lips she drank the lemonade to the last drop refreshed for the moment she spoke againspoke to the visionary servant of her delirious fancy while she rested in emilys arms  for gods sake take care how you answer if she questions you if she knew what we know are men ever ashamed ha the vile woman the vile woman  her voice sinking gradually dropped to a whisper the next few words that escaped her were muttered inarticulately little by little the false energy of fever was wearing itself out she lay silent and still to look at her now was to look at the image of death once more emily kissed herclosed the curtainsand rang the bell mrs ellmother failed to appear emily left the room to call her  arrived at the top of the kitchen stairs she noted a slight change the door below which she had heard banged on first entering her aunts room now stood open she called to mrs ellmother a strange voice answered her its accent was soft and courteous presenting the strongest imaginable contrast to the harsh tones of miss letitias crabbed old maid  is there anything i can do for you miss  the person making this polite inquiry appeared at the foot of the stairsa plump and comely woman of middle age she looked up at the young lady with a pleasant smile  i beg your pardon emily said i had no intention of disturbing you i called to mrs ellmother  the stranger advanced a little way up the stairs and answered mrs ellmother is not here  do you expect her back soon  excuse me missi dont expect her back at all  do you mean to say that she has left the house  yes miss she has left the house     chapter xiv mrs mosey  emilys first actafter the discovery of mrs ellmothers incomprehensible disappearancewas to invite the new servant to follow her into the sittingroom  can you explain this she began  no miss  may i ask if you have come here by mrs ellmothers invitation  by mrs ellmothers request miss  can you tell me how she came to make the request  with pleasure miss perhapsas you find me here a stranger to yourself in place of the customary servanti ought to begin by giving you a reference  and perhaps if you will be so kind by mentioning your name emily added  thank you for reminding me miss my name is elizabeth mosey i am well known to the gentleman who attends miss letitia dr allday will speak to my character and also to my experience as a nurse if it would be in any way satisfactory to give you a second reference  quite needless mrs mosey  permit me to thank you again miss i was at home this evening when mrs ellmother called at my lodgings says she i have come here elizabeth to ask a favor of you for old friendships sake says i my dear pray command me whatever it may be if this seems rather a hasty answer to make before i knew what the favor was might i ask you to bear in mind that mrs ellmother put it to me for old friendships sakealluding to my late husband and to the business which we carried on at that time through no fault of ours we got into difficulties persons whom we had trusted proved unworthy not to trouble you further i may say at once we should have been ruined if our old friend mrs ellmother had not come forward and trusted us with the savings of her lifetime the money was all paid back again before my husbands death but i dont considerand i think you wont considerthat the obligation was paid back too prudent or not prudent there is nothing mrs ellmother can ask of me that i am not willing to do if i have put myself in an awkward situation and i dont deny that it looks so this is the only excuse miss that i can make for my conduct  mrs mosey was too fluent and too fond of hearing the sound of her own eminently persuasive voice making allowance for these little drawbacks the impression that she produced was decidedly favorable and however rashly she might have acted her motive was beyond reproach having said some kind words to this effect emily led her back to the main interest of her narrative  did mrs ellmother give no reason for leaving my aunt at such a time as this she asked  the very words i said to her miss  and what did she say by way of reply  she burst out cryinga thing i have never known her to do before in an experience of twenty years  and she really asked you to take her place here at a moments notice  that was just what she did mrs mosey answered i had no need to tell her i was astonished my lips spoke for me no doubt shes a hard woman in speech and manner i admit but theres more feeling in her than you would suppose if you are the good friend i take you for she says dont ask me for reasons i am doing what is forced on me and doing it with a heavy heart in my place miss would you have insisted on her explaining herself after that the one thing i naturally wanted to know was if i could speak to some lady in the position of mistress here before i ventured to intrude mrs ellmother understood that it was her duty to help me in this particular your poor aunt being out of the question she mentioned you  how did she speak of me in an angry way  no indeedquite the contrary she says you will find miss emily at the cottage she is miss letitias niece everybody likes herand everybody is right  she really said that  those were her words and what is more she gave me a message for you at parting if miss emily is surprised that was how she put it give her my duty and good wishes and tell her to remember what i said when she took my place at her aunts bedside i dont presume to inquire what this means said mrs mosey respectfully ready to hear what it meant if emily would only be so good as to tell her i deliver the message miss as it was delivered to me after which mrs ellmother went her way and i went mine  do you know where she went  no miss  have you nothing more to tell me  nothing more except that she gave me my directions of course about the nursing i took them down in writingand you will find them in their proper place with the prescriptions and the medicines  acting at once on this hint emily led the way to her aunts room  miss letitia was silent when the new nurse softly parted the curtainslooked inand drew them together again consulting her watch mrs mosey compared her written directions with the medicinebottles on the table and set one apart to be used at the appointed time nothing so far to alarm us she whispered you look sadly pale and tired miss might i advise you to rest a little  if there is any change mrs moseyeither for the better or the worseof course you will let me know  certainly miss  emily returned to the sittingroom not to rest after all that she had heard but to think   amid much that was unintelligible certain plain conclusions presented themselves to her mind  after what the doctor had already said to emily on the subject of delirium generally mrs ellmothers proceedings became intelligible they proved that she knew by experience the perilous course taken by her mistresss wandering thoughts when they expressed themselves in words this explained the concealment of miss letitias illness from her niece as well as the reiterated efforts of the old servant to prevent emily from entering the bedroom  but the event which had just happenedthat is to say mrs ellmothers sudden departure from the cottagewas not only of serious importance in itself but pointed to a startling conclusion  the faithful maid had left the mistress whom she had loved and served sinking under a fatal illnessand had put another woman in her place careless of what that woman might discover by listening at the bedsiderather than confront emily after she had been within hearing of her aunt while the brain of the suffering woman was deranged by fever there was the state of the case in plain words  in what frame of mind had mrs ellmother adopted this desperate course of action  to use her own expression she had deserted miss letitia with a heavy heart to judge by her own language addressed to mrs mosey she had left emily to the mercy of a strangeranimated nevertheless by sincere feelings of attachment and respect that her fears had taken for granted suspicion which emily had not felt and discoveries which emily had as yet not made in no way modified the serious nature of the inference which her conduct justified the disclosure which this woman dreadedwho could doubt it nowdirectly threatened emilys peace of mind there was no disguising it the innocent niece was associated with an act of deception which had been until that day the undetected secret of the aunt and the aunts maid  in this conclusion and in this only was to be found the rational explanation of mrs ellmothers choiceplaced between the alternatives of submitting to discovery by emily or of leaving the house   poor miss letitias writingtable stood near the window of the sittingroom shrinking from the further pursuit of thoughts which might end in disposing her mind to distrust of her dying aunt emily looked round in search of some employment sufficiently interesting to absorb her attention the writingtable reminded her that she owed a letter to cecilia that helpful friend had surely the first claim to know why she had failed to keep her engagement with sir jervis redwood  after mentioning the telegram which had followed mrs rooks arrival at the school emilys letter proceeded in these terms  as soon as i had in some degree recovered myself i informed mrs rook of my aunts serious illness  although she carefully confined herself to commonplace expressions of sympathy i could see that it was equally a relief to both of us to feel that we were prevented from being traveling companions dont suppose that i have taken a capricious dislike to mrs rookor that you are in any way to blame for the unfavorable impression which she has produced on me i will make this plain when we meet in the meanwhile i need only tell you that i gave her a letter of explanation to present to sir jervis redwood i also informed him of my address in london adding a request that he would forward your letter in case you have written to me before you receive these lines  kind mr alban morris accompanied me to the railwaystation and arranged with the guard to take special care of me on the journey to london we used to think him rather a heartless man we were quite wrong i dont know what his plans are for spending the summer holidays go where he may i remember his kindness my best wishes go with him  my dear i must not sadden your enjoyment of your pleasant visit to the engadine by writing at any length of the sorrow that i am suffering you know how i love my aunt and how gratefully i have always felt her motherly goodness to me the doctor does not conceal the truth at her age there is no hope my fathers lastleft relation my one dearest friend is dying  no i must not forget that i have another friendi must find some comfort in thinking of you  i do so long in my solitude for a letter from my dear cecilia nobody comes to see me when i most want sympathy i am a stranger in this vast city the members of my mothers family are settled in australia they have not even written to me in all the long years that have passed since her death you remember how cheerfully i used to look forward to my new life on leaving school goodby my darling while i can see your sweet face in my thoughts i dont despairdark as it looks nowof the future that is before me  emily had closed and addressed her letter and was just rising from her chair when she heard the voice of the new nurse at the door     chapter xv emily  may i say a word mrs mosey inquired she entered the roompale and trembling seeing that ominous change emily dropped back into her chair  dead she said faintly  mrs mosey looked at her in vacant surprise  i wish to say miss that your aunt has frightened me  even that vague allusion was enough for emily  you need say no more she replied i know but too well how my aunts mind is affected by the fever  confused and frightened as she was mrs mosey still found relief in her customary flow of words  many and many a person have i nursed in fever she announced many and many a person have i heard say strange things never yet miss in all my experience  dont tell me of it emily interposed  oh but i must tell you in your own interests miss emilyin your own interests i wont be inhuman enough to leave you alone in the house tonight but if this delirium goes on i must ask you to get another nurse shocking suspicions are lying in wait for me in that bedroom as it were i cant resist them as i ought if i go back again and hear your aunt saying what she has been saying for the last half hour and more mrs ellmother has expected impossibilities of me and mrs ellmother must take the consequences i dont say she didnt warn mespeaking you will please to understand in the strictest confidence elizabeth she says you know how wildly people talk in miss letitias present condition pay no heed to it she says let it go in at one ear and out at the other she says if miss emily asks questionsyou know nothing about it if shes frightenedyou know nothing about it if she bursts into fits of crying that are dreadful to see pity her poor thing but take no notice all very well and sounds like speaking out doesnt it nothing of the sort mrs ellmother warns me to expect this that and the other but there is one horrid thing which i heard mind over and over again at your aunts bedside that she does not prepare me for and that horrid thing ismurder  at that last word mrs mosey dropped her voice to a whisperand waited to see what effect she had produced  sorely tried already by the cruel perplexities of her position emilys courage failed to resist the first sensation of horror aroused in her by the climax of the nurses hysterical narrative encouraged by her silence mrs mosey went on she lifted one hand with theatrical solemnityand luxuriously terrified herself with her own horrors  an inn miss emily a lonely inn somewhere in the country and a comfortless room at the inn with a makeshift bed at one end of it and a makeshift bed at the otheri give you my word of honor that was how your aunt put it she spoke of two men next two men asleep you understand in the two beds i think she called them gentlemen but i cant be sure and i wouldnt deceive youyou know i wouldnt deceive you for the world miss letitia muttered and mumbled poor soul i own i was getting tired of listeningwhen she burst out plain again in that one horrid wordoh miss dont be impatient dont interrupt me  emily did interrupt nevertheless in some degree at least she had recovered herself no more of it she saidi wont hear a word more  but mrs mosey was too resolutely bent on asserting her own importance by making the most of the alarm that she had suffered to be repressed by any ordinary method of remonstrance without paying the slightest attention to what emily had said she went on again more loudly and more excitably than ever  listen misslisten the dreadful part of it is to come you havent heard about the two gentlemen yet one of them was murderedwhat do you think of thatand the other i heard your aunt say it in so many words committed the crime did miss letitia fancy she was addressing a lot of people when you were nursing her she called out like a person making public proclamation when i was in her room whoever you are good people she says a hundred pounds reward if you find the runaway murderer search everywhere for a poor weak womanish creature with rings on his little white hands theres nothing about him like a man except his voicea fine round voice youll know him my friendsthe wretch the monsteryoull know him by his voice that was how she put it i tell you again that was how she put it did you hear her scream ah my dear young lady so much the better for you o the horrid murder she sayshush it up ill take my bible oath before the magistrate cried mrs mosey starting out of her chair your aunt said hush it up  emily crossed the room the energy of her character was roused at last she seized the foolish woman by the shoulders forced her back in the chair and looked her straight in the face without uttering a word  for the moment mrs mosey was petrified she had fully expectedhaving reached the end of her terrible storyto find emily at her feet entreating her not to carry out her intention of leaving the cottage the next morning and she had determined after her sense of her own importance had been sufficiently flattered to grant the prayer of the helpless young lady those were her anticipationsand how had they been fulfilled she had been treated like a mad woman in a state of revolt  how dare you assault me she asked piteously you ought to be ashamed of yourself god knows i meant well  you are not the first person emily answered quietly releasing her who has done wrong with the best intentions  i did my duty miss when i told you what your aunt said  you forgot your duty when you listened to what my aunt said  allow me to explain myself  no not a word more on that subject shall pass between us remain here if you please i have something to suggest in your own interests wait and compose yourself  the purpose which had taken a foremost place in emilys mind rested on the firm foundation of her love and pity for her aunt  now that she had regained the power to think she felt a hateful doubt pressed on her by mrs moseys disclosures having taken for granted that there was a foundation in truth for what she herself had heard in her aunts room could she reasonably resist the conclusion that there must be a foundation in truth for what mrs mosey had heard under similar circumstances  there was but one way of escaping from this dilemmaand emily deliberately took it she turned her back on her own convictions and persuaded herself that she had been in the wrong when she had attached importance to anything that her aunt had said under the influence of delirium having adopted this conclusion she resolved to face the prospect of a nights solitude by the deathbedrather than permit mrs mosey to have a second opportunity of drawing her own inferences from what she might hear in miss letitias room  do you mean to keep me waiting much longer miss  not a moment longer now you are composed again emily answered i have been thinking of what has happened and i fail to see any necessity for putting off your departure until the doctor comes tomorrow morning there is really no objection to your leaving me tonight  i beg your pardon miss there is an objection i have already told you i cant reconcile it to my conscience to leave you here by yourself i am not an inhuman woman said mrs mosey putting her handkerchief to her eyessmitten with pity for herself  emily tried the effect of a conciliatory reply i am grateful for your kindness in offering to stay with me she said  very good of you im sure mrs mosey answered ironically but for all that you persist in sending me away  i persist in thinking that there is no necessity for my keeping you here until tomorrow  oh have it your own way i am not reduced to forcing my company on anybody  mrs mosey put her handkerchief in her pocket and asserted her dignity with head erect and slowlymarching steps she walked out of the room emily was left in the cottage alone with her dying aunt     chapter xvi miss jethro  a fortnight after the disappearance of mrs ellmother and the dismissal of mrs mosey doctor allday entered his consultingroom punctual to the hour at which he was accustomed to receive patients  an occasional wrinkling of his eyebrows accompanied by an intermittent restlessness in his movements appeared to indicate some disturbance of this worthy mans professional composure his mind was indeed not at ease even the inexcitable old doctor had felt the attraction which had already conquered three such dissimilar people as alban morris cecilia wyvil and francine de sor he was thinking of emily  a ring at the doorbell announced the arrival of the first patient  the servant introduced a tall lady dressed simply and elegantly in dark apparel noticeable features of a jewish castworn and haggard but still preserving their grandeur of formwere visible through her veil she moved with grace and dignity and she stated her object in consulting doctor allday with the ease of a wellbred woman  i come to ask your opinion sir on the state of my heart she said and i am recommended by a patient who has consulted you with advantage to herself she placed a card on the doctors writingdesk and added i have become acquainted with the lady by being one of the lodgers in her house  the doctor recognized the nameand the usual proceedings ensued after careful examination he arrived at a favorable conclusion i may tell you at once he saidthere is no reason to be alarmed about the state of your heart  i have never felt any alarm about myself she answered quietly a sudden death is an easy death if ones affairs are settled it seems on that account to be the death to prefer my object was to settle my affairssuch as they areif you had considered my life to be in danger is there nothing the matter with me  i dont say that the doctor replied the action of your heart is very feeble take the medicine that i shall prescribe pay a little more attention to eating and drinking than ladies usually do dont run upstairs and dont fatigue yourself by violent exerciseand i see no reason why you shouldnt live to be an old woman  god forbid the lady said to herself she turned away and looked out of the window with a bitter smile  doctor allday wrote his prescription are you likely to make a long stay in london he asked  i am here for a little while only do you wish to see me again  i should like to see you once more before you go awayif you can make it convenient what name shall i put on the prescription  miss jethro  a remarkable name the doctor said in his matteroffact way  miss jethros bitter smile showed itself again  without otherwise noticing what doctor allday had said she laid the consultation fee on the table at the same moment the footman appeared with a letter from miss emily brown he said no answer required  he held the door open as he delivered the message seeing that miss jethro was about to leave the room she dismissed him by a gesture and returning to the table pointed to the letter  was your correspondent lately a pupil at miss ladds school she inquired  my correspondent has just left miss ladd the doctor answered are you a friend of hers  i am acquainted with her  you would be doing the poor child a kindness if you would go and see her she has no friends in london  pardon meshe has an aunt  her aunt died a week since  are there no other relations  none a melancholy state of things isnt it she would have been absolutely alone in the house if i had not sent one of my women servants to stay with her for the present did you know her father  miss jethro passed over the question as if she had not heard it has the young lady dismissed her aunts servants she asked  her aunt kept but one servant maam the woman has spared miss emily the trouble of dismissing her he briefly alluded to mrs ellmothers desertion of her mistress i cant explain it he said when he had done can you  what makes you think sir that i can help you i have never even heard of the servantand the mistress was a stranger to me  at doctor alldays age a man is not easily discouraged by reproof even when it is administered by a handsome woman i thought you might have known miss emilys father he persisted  miss jethro rose and wished him goodmorning i must not occupy any more of your valuable time she said  suppose you wait a minute the doctor suggested  impenetrable as ever he rang the bell any patients in the waitingroom he inquired you see i have time to spare he resumed when the man had replied in the negative i take an interest in this poor girl and i thought  if you think that i take an interest in her too miss jethro interposed you are perfectly righti knew her father she added abruptly the allusion to emily having apparently reminded her of the question which she had hitherto declined to notice  in that case doctor allday proceeded i want a word of advice wont you sit down  she took a chair in silence an irregular movement in the lower part of her veil seemed to indicate that she was breathing with difficulty the doctor observed her with close attention let me see my prescription again he said having added an ingredient he handed it back with a word of explanation your nerves are more out of order than i supposed the hardest disease to cure that i know of isworry  the hint could hardly have been plainer but it was lost on miss jethro whatever her troubles might be her medical adviser was not made acquainted with them quietly folding up the prescription she reminded him that he had proposed to ask her advice  in what way can i be of service to you she inquired  i am afraid i must try your patience the doctor acknowledged if i am to answer that question plainly  with these prefatory words he described the events that had followed mrs moseys appearance at the cottage i am only doing justice to this foolish woman he continued when i tell you that she came here after she had left miss emily and did her best to set matters right i went to the poor girl directlyand i felt it my duty after looking at her aunt not to leave her alone for that night when i got home the next morning whom do you think i found waiting for me mrs ellmother  he stoppedin the expectation that miss jethro would express some surprise not a word passed her lips  mrs ellmothers object was to ask how her mistress was going on the doctor proceeded every day while miss letitia still lived she came here to make the same inquirywithout a word of explanation on the day of the funeral there she was at the church dressed in deep mourning and as i can personally testify crying bitterly when the ceremony was overcan you believe itshe slipped away before miss emily or i could speak to her we have seen nothing more of her and heard nothing more from that time to this  he stopped again the silent lady still listening without making any remark  have you no opinion to express the doctor asked bluntly  i am waiting miss jethro answered  waitingfor what  i havent heard yet why you want my advice  doctor alldays observation of humanity had hitherto reckoned want of caution among the deficient moral qualities in the natures of women he set down miss jethro as a remarkable exception to a general rule  i want you to advise me as to the right course to take with miss emily he said she has assured me she attaches no serious importance to her aunts wanderings when the poor old ladys fever was at its worst i dont doubt that she speaks the truthbut i have my own reasons for being afraid that she is deceiving herself will you bear this in mind  yesif its necessary  in plain words miss jethro you think i am still wandering from the point i have got to the point yesterday miss emily told me that she hoped to be soon composed enough to examine the papers left by her aunt  miss jethro suddenly turned in her chair and looked at doctor allday  are you beginning to feel interested the doctor asked mischievously  she neither acknowledged nor denied it go onwas all she said  i dont know how you feel he proceeded i am afraid of the discoveries which she may make and i am strongly tempted to advise her to leave the proposed examination to her aunts lawyer is there anything in your knowledge of miss emilys late father which tells you that i am right  before i reply said miss jethro it may not be amiss to let the young lady speak for herself  how is she to do that the doctor asked  miss jethro pointed to the writing table look there she said you have not yet opened miss emilys letter     chapter xvii doctor allday  absorbed in the effort to overcome his patients reserve the doctor had forgotten emilys letter he opened it immediately  after reading the first sentence he looked up with an expression of annoyance she has begun the examination of the papers already he said  then i can be of no further use to you miss jethro rejoined she made a second attempt to leave the room  doctor allday turned to the next page of the letter stop he cried she has found somethingand here it is  he held up a small printed handbill which had been placed between the first and second pages suppose you look at it he said  whether i am interested in it or not miss jethro asked  you may be interested in what miss emily says about it in her letter  do you propose to show me her letter  i propose to read it to you  miss jethro took the handbill without further objection it was expressed in these words  murder 100 pounds rewardwhereas a murder was committed on the thirtieth september 1877 at the handinhand inn in the village of zeeland hampshire the above reward will be paid to any person or persons whose exertions shall lead to the arrest and conviction of the suspected murderer name not known supposed age between twenty and thirty years a wellmade man of small stature fair complexion delicate features clear blue eye s hair light and cut rather short clean shaven with the exception of narrow halfwhiskers small white wellshaped hands wore valuable rings on the two last fingers of the left hand dressed neatly in a darkgray touristsuit carried a knapsack as if on a pedestrian excursion remarkably good voice smooth full and persuasive ingratiating manners apply to the chief inspector metropolitan police office london  miss jethro laid aside the handbill without any visible appearance of agitation the doctor took up emilys letter and read as follows  you will be as much relieved as i was my kind friend when you look at the paper inclosed i found it loose in a blank book with cuttings from newspapers and odd announcements of lost property and other curious things all huddled together between the leaves which my aunt no doubt intended to set in order and fix in their proper places she must have been thinking of her book poor soul in her last illness here is the origin of those terrible words which frightened stupid mrs mosey is it not encouraging to have discovered such a confirmation of my opinion as this i feel a new interest in looking over the papers that still remain to be examined  before he could get to the end of the sentence miss jethros agitation broke through her reserve  do what you proposed to do she burst out vehemently stop her at once from carrying her examination any further if she hesitates insist on it  at last doctor allday had triumphed it has been a long time coming he remarked in his cool way and its all the more welcome on that account you dread the discoveries she may make miss jethro as i do and you know what those discoveries may be  what i do know or dont know is of no importance she answered sharply  excuse me it is of very serious importance i have no authority over this poor girli am not even an old friend you tell me to insist help me to declare honestly that i know of circumstances which justify me and i may insist to some purpose  miss jethro lifted her veil for the first time and eyed him searchingly  i believe i can trust you she said now listen the one consideration on which i consent to open my lips is consideration for miss emilys tranquillity promise me absolute secrecy on your word of honor  he gave the promise  i want to know one thing first miss jethro proceeded did she tell youas she once told methat her father had died of heartcomplaint  yes  did you put any questions to her  i asked how long ago it was  and she told you  she told me  you wish to know doctor allday what discoveries miss emily may yet make among her aunts papers judge for yourself when i tell you that she has been deceived about her fathers death  do you mean that he is still living  i mean that she has been deceivedpurposely deceivedabout the manner of his death  who was the wretch who did it  you are wronging the dead sir the truth can only have been concealed out of the purest motives of love and pity i dont desire to disguise the conclusion at which i have arrived after what i have heard from yourself the person responsible must be miss emilys auntand the old servant must have been in her confidence remember you are bound in honor not to repeat to any living creature what i have just said  the doctor followed miss jethro to the door you have not yet told me he said how her father died  i have no more to tell you  with those words she left him  he rang for his servant to wait until the hour at which he was accustomed to go out might be to leave emilys peace of mind at the mercy of an accident i am going to the cottage he said if anybody wants me i shall be back in a quarter of an hour  on the point of leaving the house he remembered that emily would probably expect him to return the handbill as he took it up the first lines caught his eye he read the date at which the murder had been committed for the second time on a sudden the ruddy color left his face  good god he cried her father was murderedand that woman was concerned in it  following the impulse that urged him he secured the handbill in his pocketbooksnatched up the card which his patient had presented as her introductionand instantly left the house he called the first cab that passed him and drove to miss jethros lodgings  gonewas the servants answer when he inquired for her he insisted on speaking to the landlady hardly ten minutes have passed he said since she left my house  hardly ten minutes have passed the landlady replied since that message was brought here by a boy  the message had been evidently written in great haste i am unexpectedly obliged to leave london a bank note is inclosed in payment of my debt to you i will send for my luggage  the doctor withdrew  unexpectedly obliged to leave london he repeated as he got into the cab again her flight condemns her not a doubt of it now as fast as you can he shouted to the man directing him to drive to emilys cottage     chapter xviii miss ladd  arriving at the cottage doctor allday discovered a gentleman who was just closing the garden gate behind him  has miss emily had a visitor he inquired when the servant admitted him  the gentleman left a letter for miss emily sir  did he ask to see her  he asked after miss letitias health when he heard that she was dead he seemed to be startled and went away immediately  did he give his name  no sir  the doctor found emily absorbed over her letter his anxiety to forestall any possible discovery of the deception which had concealed the terrible story of her fathers death kept doctor alldays vigilance on the watch he doubted the gentleman who had abstained from giving his name he even distrusted the other unknown person who had written to emily  she looked up her face relieved him of his misgivings before she could speak  at last i have heard from my dearest friend she said you remember what i told you about cecilia here is a lettera long delightful letterfrom the engadine left at the door by some gentleman unknown i was questioning the servant when you rang the bell  you may question me if you prefer it i arrived just as the gentleman was shutting your garden gate  oh tell me what was he like  tall and thin and dark wore a vile republicanlooking felt hat had nasty illtempered wrinkles between his eyebrows the sort of man i distrust by instinct  why  because he doesnt shave  do you mean that he wore a beard  yes a curly black beard  emily clasped her hands in amazement can it be alban morris she exclaimed  the doctor looked at her with a sardonic smile he thought it likely that he had discovered her sweetheart  who is mr alban morris he asked  the drawingmaster at miss ladds school  doctor allday dropped the subject masters at ladies schools were not persons who interested him he returned to the purpose which had brought him to the cottageand produced the handbill that had been sent to him in emilys letter  i suppose you want to have it back again he said  she took it from him and looked at it with interest  isnt it strange she suggested that the murderer should have escaped with such a careful description of him as this circulated all over england  she read the description to the doctor  name not known supposed age between twentyfive and thirty years a wellmade man of small stature fair complexion delicate features clear blue eyes hair light and cut rather short clean shaven with the exception of narrow halfwhiskers small white wellshaped hands wore valuable rings on the two last fingers of the left hand dressed neatly  that part of the description is useless the doctor remarked he would change his clothes  but could he change his voice emily objected listen to this remarkably good voice smooth full and persuasive and here again ingratiating manners perhaps you will say he could put on an appearance of rudeness  i will say this my dear he would be able to disguise himself so effectually that ninetynine people out of a hundred would fail to identify him either by his voice or his manner  how  look back at the description hair cut rather short clean shaven with the exception of narrow halfwhiskers the wretch was safe from pursuit he had ample time at his disposaldont you see how he could completely alter the appearance of his head and face no more my dear of this disagreeable subject let us get to something interesting have you found anything else among your aunts papers  i have met with a great disappointment emily replied did i tell you how i discovered the handbill  no  i found it with the scrapbook and the newspaper cuttings under a collection of empty boxes and bottles in a drawer of the washhandstand and i naturally expected to make far more interesting discoveries in this room my search was over in five minutes nothing in the cabinet there in the corner but a few books and some china nothing in the writingdesk on that sidetable but a packet of notepaper and some sealingwax nothing here in the drawers but tradesmens receipts materials for knitting and old photographs she must have destroyed all her papers poor dear before her last illness and the handbill and the other things can only have escaped because they were left in a place which she never thought of examining isnt it provoking  with a mind inexpressibly relieved good doctor allday asked permission to return to his patients leaving emily to devote herself to her friends letter  on his way out he noticed that the door of the bedchamber on the opposite side of the passage stood open since miss letitias death the room had not been used well within view stood the washhandstand to which emily had alluded the doctor advanced to the house doorreflectedhesitatedand looked toward the empty room  it had struck him that there might be a second drawer which emily had overlooked would he be justified in setting this doubt at rest if he passed over ordinary scruples it would not be without excuse miss letitia had spoken to him of her affairs and had asked him to act in emilys interest as coexecutor with her lawyer the rapid progress of the illness had made it impossible for her to execute the necessary codicil but the doctor had been morally if not legally taken into her confidenceand for that reason he decided that he had a right in this serious matter to satisfy his own mind  a glance was enough to show him that no second drawer had been overlooked  there was no other discovery to detain the doctor the wardrobe only contained the poor old ladys clothes the one cupboard was open and empty on the point of leaving the room he went back to the washhandstand while he had the opportunity it might not be amiss to make sure that emily had thoroughly examined those old boxes and bottles which she had alluded to with some little contempt  the drawer was of considerable length when he tried to pull it completely out from the grooves in which it ran it resisted him in his present frame of mind this was a suspicious circumstance in itself he cleared away the litter so as to make room for the introduction of his hand and arm into the drawer in another moment his fingers touched a piece of paper jammed between the inner end of the drawer and the bottom of the flat surface of the washhandstand with a little care he succeeded in extricating the paper only pausing to satisfy himself that there was nothing else to be found and to close the drawer after replacing its contents he left the cottage  the cab was waiting for him on the drive back to his own house he opened the crumpled paper it proved to be a letter addressed to miss letitia and it was signed by no less a person than emilys schoolmistress looking back from the end to the beginning doctor allday discovered in the first sentence the name ofmiss jethro  but for the interview of that morning with his patient he might have doubted the propriety of making himself further acquainted with the letter as things were he read it without hesitation  dear madami cannot but regard it as providential circumstance that your niece in writing to you from my house should have mentioned among other events of her school life the arrival of my new teacher miss jethro  to say that i was surprised is to express very inadequately what i felt when i read your letter informing me confidentially that i had employed a woman who was unworthy to associate with the young persons placed under my care it is impossible for me to suppose that a lady in your position and possessed of your high principles would make such a serious accusation as this without unanswerable reasons for doing so at the same time i cannot consistently with my duty as a christian suffer my opinion of miss jethro to be in any way modified until proofs are laid before me which it is impossible to dispute  placing the same confidence in your discretion which you have placed in mine i now inclose the references and testimonials which miss jethro submitted to me when she presented herself to fill the vacant situation in my school  i earnestly request you to lose no time in instituting the confidential inquiries which you have volunteered to make whatever the result may be pray return to me the inclosures which i have trusted to your care and believe me dear madam in much suspense and anxiety sincerely yours  amelia ladd   it is needless to describe at any length the impression which these lines produced on the doctor  if he had heard what emily had heard at the time of her aunts last illness he would have called to mind miss letitias betrayal of her interest in some man unknown whom she believed to have been beguiled by miss jethroand he would have perceived that the vindictive hatred thus produced must have inspired the letter of denunciation which the schoolmistress had acknowledged he would also have inferred that miss letitias inquiries had proved her accusation to be well foundedif he had known of the new teachers sudden dismissal from the school as things were he was merely confirmed in his bad opinion of miss jethro and he was induced on reflection to keep his discovery to himself  if poor miss emily saw the old lady exhibited in the character of an informer he thought what a blow would be struck at her innocent respect for the memory of her aunt     chapter xix sir jervis redwood  in the meantime emily left by herself had her own correspondence to occupy her attention besides the letter from cecilia directed to the care of sir jervis redwood she had received some lines addressed to her by sir jervis himself the two inclosures had been secured in a sealed envelope directed to the cottage  if alban morris had been indeed the person trusted as messenger by sir jervis the conclusion that followed filled emily with overpowering emotions of curiosity and surprise  having no longer the motive of serving and protecting her alban must nevertheless have taken the journey to northumberland he must have gained sir jervis redwoods favor and confidenceand he might even have been a guest at the baronets country seatwhen cecilias letter arrived what did it mean  emily looked back at her experience of her last day at school and recalled her consultation with alban on the subject of mrs rook was he still bent on clearing up his suspicions of sir jerviss housekeeper and with that end in view had he followed the woman on her return to her masters place of abode  suddenly almost irritably emily snatched up sir jerviss letter before the doctor had come in she had glanced at it and had thrown it aside in her impatience to read what cecilia had written in her present altered frame of mind she was inclined to think that sir jervis might be the more interesting correspondent of the two  on returning to his letter she was disappointed at the outset  in the first place his handwriting was so abominably bad that she was obliged to guess at his meaning in the second place he never hinted at the circumstances under which cecilias letter had been confided to the gentleman who had left it at her door  she would once more have treated the baronets communication with contemptbut for the discovery that it contained an offer of employment in london addressed to herself  sir jervis had necessarily been obliged to engage another secretary in emilys absence but he was still in want of a person to serve his literary interests in london he had reason to believe that discoveries made by modern travelers in central america had been reported from time to time by the english press and he wished copies to be taken of any notices of this sort which might be found on referring to the files of newspapers kept in the readingroom of the british museum if emily considered herself capable of contributing in this way to the completeness of his great work on the ruined cities she had only to apply to his bookseller in london who would pay her the customary remuneration and give her every assistance of which she might stand in need the booksellers name and address followed with nothing legible but the two words bond street and there was an end of sir jerviss proposal  emily laid it aside deferring her answer until she had read cecilias letter     chapter xx the reverend miles mirabel  i am making a little excursion from the engadine my dearest of all dear friends two charming fellowtravelers take care of me and we may perhaps get as far as the lake of como  my sister already much improved in health remains at st moritz with the old governess the moment i know what exact course we are going to take i shall write to julia to forward any letters which arrive in my absence my life in this earthly paradise will be only complete when i hear from my darling emily  in the meantime we are staying for the night at some interesting place the name of which i have unaccountably forgotten and here i am in my room writing to you at lastdying to know if sir jervis has yet thrown himself at your feet and offered to make you lady redwood with magnificent settlements  but you are waiting to hear who my new friends are my dear one of them is next to yourself the most delightful creature in existence society knows her as lady janeaway i love her already by her christian name she is my friend doris and she reciprocates my sentiments  you will now understand that union of sympathies made us acquainted with each other  if there is anything in me to be proud of i think it must be my admirable appetite and if i have a passion the name of it is pastry here again lady doris reciprocates my sentiments we sit next to each other at the table dhote  good heavens i have forgotten her husband they have been married rather more than a month did i tell you that she is just two years older than i am  i declare i am forgetting him again he is lord janeaway such a quiet modest man and so easily amused he carries with him everywhere a dirty little tin case with air holes in the cover he goes softly poking about among bushes and brambles and under rocks and behind old wooden houses when he has caught some hideous insect that makes one shudder he blushes with pleasure and looks at his wife and me and says with the prettiest lisp this is what i call enjoying the day to see the manner in which he obeys her is between ourselves to feel proud of being a woman  where was i oh at the table dhote  never emilyi say it with a solemn sense of the claims of truthnever have i eaten such an infamous abominable maddeningly bad dinner as the dinner they gave us on our first day at the hotel i ask you if i am not patient i appeal to your own recollection of occasions when i have exhibited extraordinary selfcontrol my dear i held out until they brought the pastry round i took one bite and committed the most shocking offense against good manners at table that you can imagine my handkerchief my poor innocent handkerchief received the horridplease suppose the rest my hair stands on end when i think of it our neighbors at the table saw me the coarse men laughed the sweet young bride sincerely feeling for me said will you allow me to shake hands i did exactly what you have done the day before yesterday such was the beginning of my friendship with lady doris janeaway  we are two resolute womeni mean that she is resolute and that i follow herand we have asserted our right of dining to our own satisfaction by means of an interview with the chief cook  this interesting person is an exzouave in the french army instead of making excuses he confessed that the barbarous tastes of the english and american visitors had so discouraged him that he had lost all pride and pleasure in the exercise of his art as an example of what he meant he mentioned his experience of two young englishmen who could speak no foreign language the waiters reported that they objected to their breakfasts and especially to the eggs thereupon to translate the frenchmans own way of putting it he exhausted himself in exquisite preparations of eggs eggs a la tripe au gratin a laurore a la dauphine a la poulette a la tartare a la venitienne a la bordelaise and so on and so on still the two young gentlemen were not satisfied the exzouave infuriated wounded in his honor disgraced as a professor insisted on an explanation what in heavens name did they want for breakfast they wanted boiled eggs and a fish which they called a bloaterre it was impossible he said to express his contempt for the english idea of a breakfast in the presence of ladies you know how a cat expresses herself in the presence of a dogand you will understand the allusion oh emily what dinners we have had in our own room since we spoke to that noble cook  have i any more news to send you are you interested my dear in eloquent young clergymen  on our first appearance at the public table we noticed a remarkable air of depression among the ladies had some adventurous gentleman tried to climb a mountain and failed had disastrous political news arrived from england a defeat of the conservatives for instance had a revolution in the fashions broken out in paris and had all our best dresses become of no earthly value to us i applied for information to the only lady present who shone on the company with a cheerful facemy friend doris of course what day was yesterday she asked  sunday i answered  of all melancholy sundays she continued the most melancholy in the calendar mr miles mirabel preached his farewell sermon in our temporary chapel upstairs  and you have not recovered it yet  we are all heartbroken miss wyvil  this naturally interested me i asked what sort of sermons mr mirabel preached lady janeaway said come up to our room after dinner the subject is too distressing to be discussed in public  she began by making me personally acquainted with the reverend gentlemanthat is to say she showed me the photographic portraits of him they were two in number one only presented his face the other exhibited him at full length adorned in his surplice every lady in the congregation had received the two photographs as a farewell present my portraits lady doris remarked are the only complete specimens the others have been irretrievably ruined by tears  you will now expect a personal description of this fascinating man what the photographs failed to tell me my friend was so kind as to complete from the resources of her own experience here is the result presented to the best of my ability  he is youngnot yet thirty years of age his complexion is fair his features are delicate his eyes are clear blue he has pretty hands and rings prettier still and such a voice and such manners you will say there are plenty of pet parsons who answer to this description wait a littlei have kept his chief distinction till the last his beautiful light hair flows in profusion over his shoulders and his glossy beard waves at apostolic length down to the lower buttons of his waistcoat  what do you think of the reverend miles mirabel now  the life and adventures of our charming young clergyman bear eloquent testimony to the saintly patience of his disposition under trials which would have overwhelmed an ordinary man lady doris please notice quotes in this place the language of his admirers and i report lady doris  he has been clerk in a lawyers officeunjustly dismissed he has given readings from shakespeareinfamously neglected he has been secretary to a promenade concert companydeceived by a penniless manager he has been employed in negotiations for making foreign railwaysrepudiated by an unprincipled government he has been translator to a publishing housedeclared incapable by envious newspapers and reviews he has taken refuge in dramatic criticismdismissed by a corrupt editor through all these means of purification for the priestly career he passed at last into the one sphere that was worthy of him he entered the church under the protection of influential friends oh happy change from that moment his labors have been blessed twice already he has been presented with silver teapots filled with sovereigns go where he may precious sympathies environ him and domestic affection places his knife and fork at innumerable family tables after a continental career which will leave undying recollections he is now recalled to englandat the suggestion of a person of distinction in the church who prefers a mild climate it will now be his valued privilege to represent an absent rector in a country living remote from cities secluded in pastoral solitude among simple breeders of sheep may the shepherd prove worthy of the flock  here again my dear i must give the merit where the merit is due this memoir of mr mirabel is not of my writing it formed part of his farewell sermon preserved in the memory of lady dorisand it shows once more in the language of his admirers that the truest humility may be found in the character of the most gifted man  let me only add that you will have opportunities of seeing and hearing this popular preacher when circumstances permit him to address congregations in the large towns i am at the end of my news and i begin to feelafter this long long letterthat it is time to go to bed need i say that i have often spoken of you to doris and that she entreats you to be her friend as well as mine when we meet again in england  goodby darling for the present with fondest love  your cecilia  psi have formed a new habit in case of feeling hungry in the night i keep a box of chocolate under the pillow you have no idea what a comfort it is if i ever meet with the man who fulfills my ideal i shall make it a condition of the marriage settlement that i am to have chocolate under the pillow     chapter xxi polly and sally  without a care to trouble her abroad or at home finding inexhaustible varieties of amusement seeing new places making new acquaintanceswhat a disheartening contrast did cecilias happy life present to the life of her friend who in emilys position could have read that joyouslywritten letter from switzerland and not have lost heart and faith for the moment at least as the inevitable result  a buoyant temperament is of all moral qualities the most precious in this respect it is the one force in uswhen virtuous resolution proves insufficientwhich resists by instinct the stealthy approaches of despair i shall only cry emily thought if i stay at home better go out  observant persons accustomed to frequent the london parks can hardly have failed to notice the number of solitary strangers sadly endeavoring to vary their lives by taking a walk they linger about the flowerbeds they sit for hours on the benches they look with patient curiosity at other people who have companions they notice ladies on horseback and children at play with submissive interest some of the men find company in a pipe without appearing to enjoy it some of the women find a substitute for dinner in little dry biscuits wrapped in crumpled scraps of paper they are not sociable they are hardly ever seen to make acquaintance with each other perhaps they are shamefaced or proud or sullen perhaps they despair of others being accustomed to despair of themselves perhaps they have their reasons for never venturing to encounter curiosity or their vices which dread detection or their virtues which suffer hardship with the resignation that is sufficient for itself the one thing certain is that these unfortunate people resist discovery we know that they are strangers in londonand we know no more  and emily was one of them  among the other forlorn wanderers in the parks there appeared latterly a trim little figure in black with the face protected from notice behind a crape veil which was beginning to be familiar day after day to nursemaids and children and to rouse curiosity among harmless solitaries meditating on benches and idle vagabonds strolling over the grass the womanservant whom the considerate doctor had provided was the one person in emilys absence left to take care of the house there was no other creature who could be a companion to the friendless girl mrs ellmother had never shown herself again since the funeral mrs mosey could not forget that she had been no matter how politely requested to withdraw to whom could emily say let us go out for a walk she had communicated the news of her aunts death to miss ladd at brighton and had heard from francine the worthy schoolmistress had written to her with the truest kindness choose your own time my poor child and come and stay with me at brighton the sooner the better emily shranknot from accepting the invitationbut from encountering francine the hard west indian heiress looked harder than ever with a pen in her hand her letter announced that she was getting on wretchedly with her studies which she hated she found the masters appointed to instruct her ugly and disagreeable and loathed the sight of them she had taken a dislike to miss ladd and time only confirmed that unfavorable impression brighton was always the same the sea was always the same the drives were always the same francine felt a presentiment that she should do something desperate unless emily joined her and made brighton endurable behind the horrid schoolmistresss back solitude in london was a privilege and a pleasure viewed as the alternative to such companionship as this  emily wrote gratefully to miss ladd and asked to be excused  other days had passed drearily since that time but the one day that had brought with it cecilias letter set past happiness and present sorrow together so vividly and so cruelly that emilys courage sank she had forced back the tears in her lonely home she had gone out to seek consolation and encouragement under the sunny skyto find comfort for her sore heart in the radiant summer beauty of flowers and grass in the sweet breathing of the air in the happy heavenward soaring of the birds no mother nature is stepmother to the sick at heart soon too soon she could hardly see where she went again and again she resolutely cleared her eyes under the shelter of her veil when passing strangers noticed her and again and again the tears found their way back oh if the girls at the school were to see her nowthe girls who used to say in their moments of sadness let us go to emily and be cheeredwould they know her again she sat down to rest and recover herself on the nearest bench it was unoccupied no passing footsteps were audible on the remote path to which she had strayed solitude at home solitude in the park where was cecilia at that moment in italy among the lake s and mountains happy in the company of her lighthearted friend  the lonely interval passed and persons came near two sisters girls like herself stopped to rest on the bench  they were full of their own interests they hardly looked at the stranger in mourning garments the younger sister was to be married and the elder was to be bridesmaid they talked of their dresses and their presents they compared the dashing bridegroom of one with the timid lover of the other they laughed over their own small sallies of wit over their joyous dreams of the future over their opinions of the guests invited to the wedding too joyfully restless to remain inactive any longer they jumped up again from the seat one of them said polly im too happy and danced as she walked away the other cried sally for shame and laughed as if she had hit on the most irresistible joke that ever was made  emily rose and went home  by some mysterious influence which she was unable to trace the boisterous merriment of the two girls had roused in her a sense of revolt against the life that she was leading change speedy change to some occupation that would force her to exert herself presented the one promise of brighter days that she could see to feel this was to be inevitably reminded of sir jervis redwood here was a man who had never seen her transformed by the incomprehensible operation of chance into the friend of whom she stood in needthe friend who pointed the way to a new world of action the busy world of readers in the library of the museum  early in the new week emily had accepted sir jerviss proposal and had so interested the bookseller to whom she had been directed to apply that he took it on himself to modify the arbitrary instructions of his employer  the old gentleman has no mercy on himself and no mercy on others he explained where his literary labors are concerned you must spare yourself miss emily it is not only absurd its cruel to expect you to ransack old newspapers for discoveries in yucatan from the time when stephens published his travels in central americanearly forty years since begin with back numbers published within a few yearssay five years from the present dateand let us see what your search over that interval will bring forth  accepting this friendly advice emily began with the newspapervolume dating from new years day 1876  the first hour of her search strengthened the sincere sense of gratitude with which she remembered the booksellers kindness to keep her attention steadily fixed on the one subject that interested her employer and to resist the temptation to read those miscellaneous items of news which especially interest women put her patience and resolution to a merciless test happily for herself her neighbors on either side were no idlers to see them so absorbed over their work that they never once looked at her after the first moment when she took her place between them was to find exactly the example of which she stood most in need as the hours wore on she pursued her weary way down one column and up another resigned at least if not quite reconciled yet to her task her labors ended for the day with such encouragement as she might derive from the conviction of having thus far honestly pursued a useless search  news was waiting for her when she reached home which raised her sinking spirits  on leaving the cottage that morning she had given certain instructions relating to the modest stranger who had taken charge of her correspondencein case of his paying a second visit during her absence at the museum the first words spoken by the servant on opening the door informed her that the unknown gentleman had called again this time he had boldly left his card there was the welcome name that she had expected to seealban morris     chapter xxii alban morris  having looked at the card emily put her first question to the servant  did you tell mr morris what your orders were she asked  yes miss i said i was to have shown him in if you had been at home perhaps i did wrong i told him what you told me when you went out this morningi said you had gone to read at the museum  what makes you think you did wrong  well miss he didnt say anything but he looked upset  do you mean that he looked angry  the servant shook her head not exactly angrypuzzled and put out  did he leave any message  he said he would call later if you would be so good as to receive him  in half an hour more alban and emily were together again the light fell full on her face as she rose to receive him  oh how you have suffered  the words escaped him before he could restrain himself he looked at her with the tender sympathy so precious to women which she had not seen in the face of any human creature since the loss of her aunt even the good doctors efforts to console her had been efforts of professional routinethe inevitable result of his lifelong familiarity with sorrow and death while albans eyes rested on her emily felt her tears rising in the fear that he might misinterpret her reception of him she made an effort to speak with some appearance of composure  i lead a lonely life she said and i can well understand that my face shows it you are one of my very few friends mr morristhe tears rose again it discouraged her to see him standing irresolute with his hat in his hand fearful of intruding on her indeed indeed you are welcome she said very earnestly  in those sad days her heart was easily touched she gave him her hand for the second time he held it gently for a moment every day since they had parted she had been in his thoughts she had become dearer to him than ever he was too deeply affected to trust himself to answer that silence pleaded for him as nothing had pleaded for him yet in her secret self she remembered with wonder how she had received his confession in the school garden it was a little hard on him surely to have forbidden him even to hope  conscious of her own weaknesseven while giving way to itshe felt the necessity of turning his attention from herself in some confusion she pointed to a chair at her side and spoke of his first visit when he had left her letters at the door having confided to him all that she had discovered and all that she had guessed on that occasion it was by an easy transition that she alluded next to the motive for his journey to the north  i thought it might be suspicion of mrs rook she said was i mistaken  no you were right  they were serious suspicions i suppose  certainly i should not otherwise have devoted my holidaytime to clearing them up  may i know what they were  i am sorry to disappoint you he began  but you would rather not answer my question she interposed  i would rather hear you tell me if you have made any other guess  one more mr morris i guessed that you had become acquainted with sir jervis redwood  for the second time miss emily you have arrived at a sound conclusion my one hope of finding opportunities for observing sir jerviss housekeeper depended on my chance of gaining admission to sir jerviss house  how did you succeed perhaps you provided yourself with a letter of introduction  i knew nobody who could introduce me alban replied as the event proved a letter would have been needless sir jervis introduced himselfand more wonderful still he invited me to his house at our first interview  sir jervis introduced himself emily repeated in amazement from cecilias description of him i should have thought he was the last person in the world to do that  alban smiled and you would like to know how it happened he suggested  the very favor i was going to ask of you she replied  instead of at once complying with her wishes he pausedhesitatedand made a strange request will you forgive my rudeness if i ask leave to walk up and down the room while i talk i am a restless man walking up and down helps me to express myself freely  her f ace brightened for the first time how like you that is she exclaimed  alban looked at her with surprise and delight she had betrayed an interest in studying his character which he appreciated at its full value i should never have dared to hope he said that you knew me so well already  you are forgetting your story she reminded him  he moved to the opposite side of the room where there were fewer impediments in the shape of furniture with his head down and his hands crossed behind him he paced to and fro habit made him express himself in his usual quaint waybut he became embarrassed as he went on was he disturbed by his recollections or by the fear of taking emily into his confidence too freely  different people have different ways of telling a story he said mine is the methodical wayi begin at the beginning we will start if you please in the railwaywe will proceed in a onehorse chaiseand we will stop at a village situated in a hole it was the nearest place to sir jerviss house and it was therefore my destination i picked out the biggest of the cottagesi mean the hutsand asked the woman at the door if she had a bed to let she evidently thought me either mad or drunk i wasted no time in persuasion the right person to plead my cause was asleep in her arms i began by admiring the baby and i ended by taking the babys portrait from that moment i became a member of the familythe member who had his own way besides the room occupied by the husband and wife there was a sort of kennel in which the husbands brother slept he was dismissed with five shillings of mine to comfort him to find shelter somewhere else and i was promoted to the vacant place it is my misfortune to be tall when i went to bed i slept with my head on the pillow and my feet out of the window very cool and pleasant in summer weather the next morning i set my trap for sir jervis  your trap emily repeated wondering what he meant  i went out to sketch from nature alban continued can anybody with or without a title i dont care living in a lonely country house see a stranger hard at work with a colorbox and brushes and not stop to look at what he is doing three days passed and nothing happened i was quite patient the grand open country all round me offered lessons of inestimable value in what we call aerial perspective on the fourth day i was absorbed over the hardest of all hard tasks in landscape art studying the clouds straight from nature the magnificent moorland silence was suddenly profaned by a mans voice speaking or rather croaking behind me the worst curse of human life the voice said is the detestable necessity of taking exercise i hate losing my time i hate fine scenery i hate fresh air i hate a pony go on you brute being too deeply engaged with the clouds to look round i had supposed this pretty speech to be addressed to some second person nothing of the sort the croaking voice had a habit of speaking to itself in a minute more there came within my range of view a solitary old man mounted on a rough pony  was it sir jervis  alban hesitated  it looked more like the popular notion of the devil he said  oh mr morris  i give you my first impression miss emily for what it is worth he had his highpeaked hat in his hand to keep his head cool his wiry irongray hair looked like hair standing on end his bushy eyebrows curled upward toward his narrow temples his horrid old globular eyes stared with a wicked brightness his pointed beard hid his chin he was covered from his throat to his ankles in a loose black garment something between a coat and a cloak and to complete him he had a club foot i dont doubt that sir jervis redwood is the earthly alias which he finds convenientbut i stick to that first impression which appeared to surprise you ha an artist you seem to be the sort of man i want in those terms he introduced himself observe if you please that my trap caught him the moment he came my way who wouldnt be an artist  did he take a liking to you emily inquired  not he i dont believe he ever took a liking to anybody in his life  then how did you get your invitation to his house  thats the amusing part of it miss emily give me a little breathing time and you shall hear     chapter xxiii miss redwood  i got invited to sir jerviss house alban resumed by treating the old savage as unceremoniously as he had treated me thats an idle trade of yours he said looking at my sketch other ignorant people have made the same remark i answered he rode away as if he was not used to be spoken to in that manner and then thought better of it and came back do you understand wood engraving he asked yes and etching i have practiced etching myself are you a royal academician im a drawingmaster at a ladies school whose school miss ladds damn it you know the girl who ought to have been my secretary i am not quite sure whether you will take it as a complimentsir jervis appeared to view you in the light of a reference to my respectability at any rate he went on with his questions how long do you stop in these parts i havent made up my mind look here i want to consult youare you listening no im sketching he burst into a horrid scream i asked if he felt himself taken ill ill he saidim laughing it was a diabolical laugh in one syllablenot ha ha ha only haand it made him look wonderfully like that eminent person whom i persist in thinking he resembles youre an impudent dog he said where are you living he was so delighted when he heard of my uncomfortable position in the kennelbedroom that he offered his hospitality on the spot i cant go to you in such a pigstye as that he said you must come to me whats your name alban morris whats yours jervis redwood pack up your traps when youve done your job and come and try my kennel there it is in a corner of your drawing and devilish like too i packed up my traps and i tried his kennel and now you have had enough of sir jervis redwood  not half enough emily answered your story leaves off just at the interesting moment i want you to take me to sir jerviss house  and i want you miss emily to take me to the british museum dont let me startle you when i called here earlier in the day i was told that you had gone to the readingroom is your reading a secret  his manner when he made that reply suggested to emily that there was some foregone conclusion in his mind which he was putting to the test she answered without alluding to the impression which he had produced on her  my reading is no secret i am only consulting old newspapers  he repeated the last words to himself old newspapers he saidas if he was not quite sure of having rightly understood her  she tried to help him by a more definite reply  i am looking through old newspapers she resumed beginning with the year eighteen hundred and seventysix  and going back from that time he asked eagerly to earlier dates still  nojust the contraryadvancing from seventysix to the present time  he suddenly turned paleand tried to hide his face from her by looking out of the window for a moment his agitation deprived him of his presence of mind in that moment she saw that she had alarmed him  what have i said to frighten you she asked  he tried to assume a tone of commonplace gallantry there are limits even to your power over me he replied whatever else you may do you can never frighten me are you searching those old newspapers with any particular object in view  yes  may i know what it is  may i know why i frightened you  he began to walk up and down the room againthen checked himself abruptly and appealed to her mercy  dont be hard on me he pleaded i am so fond of youoh forgive me i only mean that it distresses me to have any concealments from you if i could open my whole heart at this moment i should be a happier man  she understood him and believed him my curiosity shall never embarrass you again she answered warmly i wont even remember that i wanted to hear how you got on in sir jerviss house  his gratitude seized the opportunity of taking her harmlessly into his confidence as sir jerviss guest he said my experience is at your service only tell me how i can interest you  she replied with some hesitation i should like to know what happened when you first saw mrs rook to her surprise and relief he at once complied with her wishes  we met he said on the evening when i first entered the house sir jervis took me into the diningroomand there sat miss redwood with a large black cat on her lap older than her brother taller than her brother leaner than her brotherwith strange stony eyes and a skin like parchmentshe looked if i may speak in contradictions like a living corpse i was presented and the corpse revived the last lingering relics of former good breeding showed themselves faintly in her brow and in her smile you will hear more of miss redwood presently in the meanwhile sir jervis made me reward his hospitality by professional advice he wished me to decide whether the artists whom he had employed to illustrate his wonderful book had cheated him by overcharges and bad workand mrs rook was sent to fetch the engravings from his study upstairs you remember her petrified appearance when she first read the inscription on your locket the same result followed when she found herself face to face with me i saluted her civillyshe was deaf and blind to my politeness her master snatched the illustrations out of her hand and told her to leave the room she stood stockstill staring helplessly sir jervis looked round at his sister and i followed his example miss redwood was observing the housekeeper too attentively to notice anything else her brother was obliged to speak to her try rook with the bell he said miss redwood took a fine old bronze handbell from the table at her side and rang it at the shrill silvery sound of the bell mrs rook put her hand to her head as if the ringing had hurt herturned instantly and left us nobody can manage rook but my sister sir jervis explained rook is crazy miss redwood differed with him no she said only one word but there were volumes of contradiction in it sir jervis looked at me slyly meaning perhaps that he thought his sister crazy too the dinner was brought in at the same moment and my attention was diverted to mrs rooks husband  what was he like emily asked  i really cant tell you he was one of those essentially commonplace persons whom one never looks at a second time his dress was shabby his head was bald and his hands shook when he waited on us at tableand that is all i remember sir jervis and i feasted on salt fish mutton and beer miss redwood had cold broth with a wineglass full of rum poured into it by mr rook shes got no stomach her brother informed me hot things come up again ten minutes after they have gone down her throat she lives on that beastly mixture and calls it brothgrog miss redwood sipped her elixir of life and occasionally looked at me with an appearance of interest which i was at a loss to understand dinner being over she rang her antique bell the shabby old manservant answered her call wheres your wife she inquired ill miss she took mr rooks arm to go out and stopped as she passed me come to my room if you please sir tomorrow at two oclock she said sir jervis explained again shes all to pieces in the morning he invariably called his sister she and gets patched up toward the middle of the day death has forgotten her thats about the truth of it he lighted his pipe and pondered over the hieroglyphics found among the ruined cities of yucatan i lighted my pipe and read the only book i could find in the diningrooma dreadful record of shipwrecks and disasters at sea when the room was full of tobaccosmoke we fell asleep in our chairsand when we awoke again we got up and went to bed there is the true story of my first evening at redwood hall  emily begged him to go on you have interested me in miss redwood she said you kept your appointment of course  i kept my appointment in no very pleasant humor encouraged by my favorable report of the illustrations which he had submitted to my judgment sir jervis proposed to make me useful to him in a new capacity you have nothing particular to do he said suppose you clean my pictures i gave him one of my black looks and made no other reply my interview with his sister tried my powers of selfcommand in another way miss redwood declared her purpose in sending for me the moment i entered the room without any preliminary remarksspeaking slowly and emphatically in a wonderfully strong voice for a woman of her ageshe said i have a favor to ask of you sir i want you to tell me what mrs rook has done i was so staggered that i stared at her like a fool she went on i suspected mrs rook sir of having guilty remembrances on her conscience before she had been a week in our service can you imagine my astonishment when i heard that miss redwoods view of mrs rook was my view finding that i still said nothing the old lady entered into details we arranged sir she persisted in calling me sir with the formal politeness of the old schoolwe arranged sir that mrs rook and her husband should occupy the bedroom next to mine so that i might have her near me in case of my being taken ill in the night she looked at the door between the two roomssuspicious she asked if there was any objection to her changing to another roomsuspicious suspicious pray take a seat sir and tell me which mrs rook is guilty oftheft or murder  what a dreadful old woman emily exclaimed how did you answer her  i told her with perfect truth that i knew nothing of mrs rooks secrets miss redwoods humor took a satirical turn allow me to ask sir whether your eyes were shut when our housekeeper found herself unexpectedly in your presence i referred the old lady to her brothers opinion sir jervis believes mrs rook to be crazy i reminded her do you refuse to trust me sir i have no information to give you madam she waved her skinny old hand in the direction of the door i made my bow and retired she called me back old women used to be prophets sir in the bygone time she said i will venture on a prediction you will be the means of depriving us of the services of mr and mrs rook if you will be so good as to stay here a day or two longer you will hear that those two people have given us notice to quit it will be her doing mindhe is a mere cypher i wish you goodmorning will you believe me when i tell you that the prophecy was fulfilled  do you mean that they actually left the house  they would certainly have left the house alban answered if sir jervis had not insisted on receiving the customary months warning he asserted his resolution by locking up the old husband in the pantry his sisters suspicions never entered his head the housekeepers conduct he said simply proved that she was what he had always considered her to be crazy a capital servant in spite of that drawback he remarked and you will see i shall bring her to her senses the impression produced on me was naturally of a very different kind while i was still uncertain how to entrap mrs rook into confirming my suspicions she herself had saved me the trouble she had placed her own guilty interpretation on my appearance in the housei had driven her away  emily remained true to her resolution not to let her curiosity embarrass alban again but the unexpressed question was in her thoughtsof what guilt does he suspect mrs rook and when he first felt his suspicions was my father in his mind  alban proceeded  i had only to consider next whether i could hope to make any further discoveries if i continued to be sir jerviss guest the object of my journey had been gained and i had no desire to be employed as picturecleaner miss redwood assisted me in arriving at a decision i was sent for to speak to her again the success of her prophecy had raised her spirits she asked with ironical humility if i proposed to honor them by still remaining their guest after the disturbance that i had provoked i answered that i proposed to leave by the first train the next morning will it be convenient for you to travel to some place at a good distance from this part of the world she asked i had my own reasons for going to london and said so will you mention that to my brother this evening just before we sit down to dinner she continued and will you tell him plainly that you have no intention of returning to the north i shall make use of mrs rooks arm as usual to help me downstairsand i will take care that she hears what you say without venturing on another prophecy i will only hint to you that i have my own idea of what will happen and i should like you to see for yourself sir whether my anticipations are realized need i tell you that this strange old woman proved to be right once more mr rook was released mrs rook made humble apologies and laid the whole blame on her husbands temper and sir jervis bade me remark that his method had succeeded in bringing the housekeeper to her senses such were the results produced by the announcement of my departure for londonpurposely made in mrs rooks hearing do you agree with me that my journey to northumberland has not been taken in vain  once more emily felt the necessity of controlling herself  alban had said that he had reasons of his own for going to london could she venture to ask him what those reasons were she could only persist in restraining her curiosity and conclude that he would have mentioned his motive if it had been as she had at one time supposed connected with herself it was a wise decision no earthly consideration would have induced alban to answer her if she had put the question to him  all doubt of the correctness of his own first impression was now at an end he was convinced that mrs rook had been an accomplice in the crime committed in 1877 at the village inn his object in traveling to london was to consult the newspaper narrative of the murder he too had been one of the readers at the museumhad examined the back numbers of the newspaperand had arrived at the conclusion that emilys father had been the victim of the crime unless he found means to prevent it her course of reading would take her from the year 1876 to the year 1877 and under that date she would see the fatal report heading the top of a column and printed in conspicuous type  in the meanwhile emily had broken the silence before it could lead to embarrassing results by asking if alban had seen mrs rook again on the morning when he left sir jerviss house  there was nothing to be gained by seeing her alban replied now that she and her husband had decided to remain at redwood hall i knew where to find her in case of necessity as it happened i saw nobody on the morning of my departure but sir jervis himself he still held to his idea of having his pictures cleaned for nothing if you cant do it yourself he said couldnt you teach my secretary he described the lady whom he had engaged in your place as a nasty middleaged woman with a perpetual cold in her head at the same time he remarked he was a friend to the women because he got them cheap i declined to teach the unfortunate secretary the art of picturecleaning finding me determined sir jervis was quite ready to say goodby but he made use of me to the last he employed me as postman and saved a stamp the letter addressed to you arrived at breakfasttime sir jervis said you are going to london suppose you take it with you  did he tell you that there was a letter of his own inclosed in the envelope  no when he gave me the envelope it was already sealed  emily at once handed to him sir jerviss letter that will tell you who employs me at the museum and what my work is she said  he looked through the letter and at once offeredeagerly offeredto help her  i have been a student in the readingroom at intervals for years past he said let me assist you and i shall have something to do in my holiday time he was so anxious to be of use that he interrupted her before she could thank him let us take alternate years he suggested did you not tell me you were searching the newspapers published in eighteen hundred and seventysix  yes  very well i will take the next year you will take the year after and so on  you are very kind she answeredbut i should like to propose an improvement on your plan  what improvement he asked rather sharply  if you will leave the five years from seventysix to eightyone entirely to me she resumed and take the next five years reckoning backward from seventysix you will help me to better purpose sir jervis expects me to look for reports of central american explorations through the newspapers of the last forty years and i have taken the liberty of limiting the heavy task imposed on me when i report my progress to my employer i should like to say that i have got through ten years of the examination instead of five do you see any objection to the arrangement i propose  he proved to be obstinateincomprehensibly obstinate  let us try my plan to begin with he insisted while you are looking through seventysix let me be at work on seventyseven if you still prefer your own arrangement after that i will follow your suggestion with pleasure is it agreed  her acute perceptionenlightened by his tone as wall as by his wordsdetected something under the surface already  it isnt agreed until i understand you a little better she quietly replied i fancy you have some object of your own in view  she spoke with her usual directness of look and manner he was evidently disconcerted what makes you think so he asked  my own experience of myself makes me think so she answered if i had some object to gain i should persist in carrying it outlike you  does that mean miss emily that you refuse to give way  no mr morris i have made myself disagreeable but i know when to stop i trust youand submit  if he had been less deeply interested in the accomplishment of his merciful design he might have viewed emilys sudden submission with some distrust as it was his eagerness to prevent her from discovering the narrative of the murder hurried him into an act of indiscretion he made an excuse to leave her immediately in the fear that she might change her mind  i have inexcusably prolonged my visit he said if i presume on your kindness in this way how can i hope that you will receive me again we meet tomorrow in the readingroom  he hastened away as if he was afraid to let her say a word in reply  emily reflected  is there something he doesnt want me to see in the news of the year seventyseven the one explanation which suggested itself to her mind assumed that form of expressionand the one method of satisfying her curiosity that seemed likely to succeed was to search the volume which alban had reserved for his own reading  for two days they pursued their task together seated at opposite desks on the third day emily was absent  was she ill  she was at the library in the city consulting the file of the times for the year 1877     chapter xxiv mr rook  emilys first day in the city library proved to be a day wasted  she began reading the back numbers of the newspaper at haphazard without any definite idea of what she was looking for conscious of the error into which her own impatience had led her she was at a loss how to retrace the false step that she had taken but two alternatives presented themselves either to abandon the hope of making any discoveryor to attempt to penetrate alban s motives by means of pure guesswork pursued in the dark  how was the problem to be solved this serious question troubled her all through the evening and kept her awake when she went to bed in despair of her capacity to remove the obstacle that stood in her way she decided on resuming her regular work at the museumturned her pillow to get at the cool side of itand made up her mind to go asleep  in the case of the wiser animals the person submits to sleep it is only the superior human being who tries the hopeless experiment of making sleep submit to the person wakeful on the warm side of the pillow emily remained wakeful on the cool sidethinking again and again of the interview with alban which had ended so strangely  little by little her mind passed the limits which had restrained it thus far albans conduct in keeping his secret in the matter of the newspapers now began to associate itself with albans conduct in keeping that other secret which concealed from her his suspicions of mrs rook  she started up in bed as the next possibility occurred to her  in speaking of the disaster which had compelled mr and mrs rook to close the inn cecilia had alluded to an inquest held on the body of the murdered man had the inquest been mentioned in the newspapers at the time and had alban seen something in the report which concerned mrs rook  led by the new light that had fallen on her emily returned to the library the next morning with a definite idea of what she had to look for incapable of giving exact dates cecilia had informed her that the crime was committed in the autumn the month to choose in beginning her examination was therefore the month of august  no discovery rewarded her she tried september nextwith the same unsatisfactory results on monday the first of october she met with some encouragement at last at the top of a column appeared a telegraphic summary of all that was then known of the crime in the number for the wednesday following she found a full report of the proceedings at the inquest  passing over the preliminary remarks emily read the evidence with the closest attention                         the jury having viewed the body and having visited an outhouse in which the murder had been committed the first witness called was mr benjamin rook landlord of the handinhand inn  on the evening of sunday september 30th 1877 two gentlemen presented themselves at mr rooks house under circumstances which especially excited his attention  the youngest of the two was short and of fair complexion he carried a knapsack like a gentleman on a pedestrian excursion his manners were pleasant and he was decidedly goodlooking his companion older taller and darkerand a finer man altogetherleaned on his arm and seemed to be exhausted in every respect they were singularly unlike each other the younger stranger excepting little halfwhiskers was clean shaved the elder wore his whole beard not knowing their names the landlord distinguished them at the coroners suggestion as the fair gentleman and the dark gentleman  it was raining when the two arrived at the inn there were signs in the heavens of a stormy night  on accosting the landlord the fair gentleman volunteered the following statement  approaching the village he had been startled by seeing the dark gentleman a total stranger to him stretched prostrate on the grass at the roadsideso far as he could judge in a swoon having a flask with brandy in it he revived the fainting man and led him to the inn  this statement was confirmed by a laborer who was on his way to the village at the time  the dark gentleman endeavored to explain what had happened to him he had as he supposed allowed too long a time to pass after an early breakfast that morning without taking food he could only attribute the fainting fit to that cause he was not liable to fainting fits what purpose if any had brought him into the neighborhood of zeeland he did not state he had no intention of remaining at the inn except for refreshment and he asked for a carriage to take him to the railway station  the fair gentleman seeing the signs of bad weather desired to remain in mr rooks house for the night and proposed to resume his walking tour the next day  excepting the case of supper which could be easily provided the landlord had no choice but to disappoint both his guests in his small way of business none of his customers wanted to hire a carriageeven if he could have afforded to keep one as for beds the few rooms which the inn contained were all engaged including even the room occupied by himself and his wife an exhibition of agricultural implements had been opened in the neighborhood only two days since and a public competition between rival machines was to be decided on the coming monday not only was the handinhand inn crowded but even the accommodation offered by the nearest town had proved barely sufficient to meet the public demand  the gentlemen looked at each other and agreed that there was no help for it but to hurry the supper and walk to the railway stationa distance of between five and six milesin time to catch the last train  while the meal was being prepared the rain held off for a while the dark man asked his way to the postoffice and went out by himself  he came back in about ten minutes and sat down afterward to supper with his companion neither the landlord nor any other person in the public room noticed any change in him on his return he was a grave quiet sort of person and unlike the other one not much of a talker  as the darkness came on the rain fell again heavily and the heavens were black  a flash of lightning startled the gentlemen when they went to the window to look out the thunderstorm began it was simply impossible that two strangers to the neighborhood could find their way to the station through storm and darkness in time to catch the train with or without bedrooms they must remain at the inn for the night having already given up their own room to their lodgers the landlord and landlady had no other place to sleep in than the kitchen next to the kitchen and communicating with it by a door was an outhouse used partly as a scullery partly as a lumberroom there was an old trucklebed among the lumber on which one of the gentlemen might rest a mattress on the floor could be provided for the other after adding a table and a basin for the purposes of the toilet the accommodation which mr rook was able to offer came to an end  the travelers agreed to occupy this makeshift bedchamber  the thunderstorm passed away but the rain continued to fall heavily soon after eleven the guests at the inn retired for the night there was some little discussion between the two travelers as to which of them should take possession of the trucklebed it was put an end to by the fair gentleman in his own pleasant way he proposed to toss up for itand he lost the dark gentleman went to bed first the fair gentleman followed after waiting a while mr rook took his knapsack into the outhouse and arranged on the table his appliances for the toiletcontained in a leather roll and including a razorready for use in the morning  having previously barred the second door of the outhouse which led into the yard mr rook fastened the other door the lock and bolts of which were on the side of the kitchen he then secured the house door and the shutters over the lower windows returning to the kitchen he noticed that the time was ten minutes short of midnight soon afterward he and his wife went to bed  nothing happened to disturb mr and mrs rook during the night  at a quarter to seven the next morning he got up his wife being still asleep he had been instructed to wake the gentlemen early and he knocked at their door receiving no answer after repeatedly knocking he opened the door and stepped into the outhouse  at this point in his evidence the witnesss recollections appeared to overpower him give me a moment gentlemen he said to the jury i have had a dreadful fright and i dont believe i shall get over it for the rest of my life  the coroner helped him by a question what did you see when you opened the door  mr rook answered i saw the dark man stretched out on his beddead with a frightful wound in his throat i saw an open razor stained with smears of blood at his side  did you notice the door leading into the yard  it was wide open sir when i was able to look round me the other traveleri mean the man with the fair complexion who carried the knapsackwas nowhere to be seen  what did you do after making these discoveries  i closed the yard door then i locked the other door and put the key in my pocket after that i roused the servant and sent him to the constablewho lived near to uswhile i ran for the doctor whose house was at the other end of our village the doctor sent his groom on horseback to the policeoffice in the town when i returned to the inn the constable was thereand he and the police took the matter into their own hands  you have nothing more to tell us  nothing more     chapter xxv j b  mr rook having completed his evidence the police authorities were the next witnesses examined  they had not found the slightest trace of any attempt to break into the house in the night the murdered mans gold watch and chain were discovered under his pillow on examining his clothes the money was found in his purse and the gold studs and sleeve buttons were left in his shirt but his pocketbook seen by witnesses who had not yet been examined was missing the search for visiting cards and letters had proved to be fruitless only the initials j b were marked on his linen he had brought no luggage with him to the inn nothing could be found which led to the discovery of his name or of the purpose which had taken him into that part of the country  the police examined the outhouse next in search of circumstantial evidence against the missing man  he must have carried away his knapsack when he took to flight but he had been probably in too great a hurry to look for his razoror perhaps too terrified to touch it if it had attracted his notice the leather roll and the other articles used for his toilet had been taken away mr rook identified the bloodstained razor he had noticed overnight the name of the belgian city liege engraved on it  the yard was the next place inspected footsteps were found on the muddy earth up to the wall but the road on the other side had been recently mended with stones and the trace of the fugitive was lost casts had been taken of the footsteps and no other means of discovery had been left untried the authorities in london had also been communicated with by telegraph  the doctor being called described a personal peculiarity which he had noticed at the postmortem examination and which might lead to the identification of the murdered man  as to the cause of death the witness said it could be stated in two words the internal jugular vein had been cut through with such violence judging by the appearances that the wound could not have been inflicted in the act of suicide by the hand of the deceased person no other injuries and no sign of disease was found on the body the one cause of death had been hemorrhage and the one peculiarity which called for notice had been discovered in the mouth two of the front teeth in the upper jaw were false they had been so admirably made to resemble the natural teeth on either side of them in form and color that the witness had only hit on the discovery by accidentally touching the inner side of the gum with one of his fingers  the landlady was examined when the doctor had retired mrs rook was able in answering questions put to her to give important information in reference to the missing pocketbook  before retiring to rest the two gentlemen had paid the billintending to leave the inn the first thing in the morning the traveler with the knapsack paid his share in money the other unfortunate gentleman looked into his purse and found only a shilling and a sixpence in it he asked mrs rook if she could change a banknote she told him it could be done provided the note was for no considerable sum of money upon that he opened his pocketbook which the witness described minutely and turned out the contents on the table after searching among many bank of england notes some in one pocket of the book and some in another he found a note of the value of five pounds he thereupon settled his bill and received the change from mrs rookher husband being in another part of the room attending to the guests she noticed a letter in an envelope and a few cards which looked to her judgment like visiting cards among the banknotes which he had turned out on the table when she returned to him with the change he had just put them back and was closing the pocketbook she saw him place it in one of the breast pockets of his coat  the fellowtraveler who had accompanied him to the inn was present all the time sitting on the opposite side of the table he made a remark when he saw the notes produced he said put all that money backdont tempt a poor man like me it was said laughing as if by way of a joke  mrs rook had observed nothing more that night had slept as soundly as usual and had been awakened when her husband knocked at the outhouse door according to instructions received from the gentlemen overnight  three of the guests in the public room corroborated mrs rooks evidence they were respectable persons well and widely known in that part of hampshire besides these there were two strangers staying in the house they referred the coroner to their employerseminent manufacturers at sheffield and wolverhamptonwhose testimony spoke for itself  the last witness called was a grocer in the village who kept the postoffice  on the evening of the 30th a dark gentleman wearing his beard knocked at the door and asked for a letter addressed to j b postoffice zeeland the letter had arrived by that mornings post but being sunday evening the grocer requested that application might be made for it the next morning the stranger said the letter contained news which it was of importance to him to receive without delay upon this the grocer made an exception to customary rules and gave him the letter he read it by the light of the lamp in the passage it must have been short for the reading was done in a moment he seemed to think over it for a while and then he turned round to go out there was nothing to notice in his look or in his manner the witness offered a remark on the weather and the gentleman said yes it looks like a bad nightand so went away  the postmasters evidence was of importance in one respect it suggested the motive which had brought the deceased to zeeland the letter addressed to j b was in all probability the letter seen by mrs rook among the contents of the pocketbook spread out on the table  the inquiry being so far at an end the inquest was adjournedon the chance of obtaining additional evidence when the reported proceedings were read by the public                        consulting a later number of the newspaper emily discovered that the deceased person had been identified by a witness from london  henry forth gentlemans valet being examined made the following statement  he had read the medical evidence contained in the report of the inquest and believing that he could identify the deceased had been sent by his present master to assist the object of the inquiry ten days since being then out of place he had answered an advertisement the next day he was instructed to call at traceys hotel london at six oclock in the evening and to ask for mr james brown arriving at the hotel he saw the gentleman for a few minutes only mr brown had a friend with him after glancing over the valets references he said i havent time enough to speak to you this evening call here tomorrow morning at nine oclock the gentleman who was present laughed and said you wont be up mr brown answered that wont matter the man can come to my bedroom and let me see how he understands his duties on trial at nine the next morning mr brown was reported to be still in bed and the witness was informed of the number of the room he knocked at the door a drowsy voice inside said something which he interpreted as meaning come in he went in the toilettable was on his left hand and the bed with the lower curtain drawn was on his right he saw on the table a tumbler with a little water in it and with two false teeth in the water mr brown started up in bedlooked at him furiouslyabused him for daring to enter the roomand shouted to him to get out the witness not accustomed to be treated in that way felt naturally indignant and at once withdrewbut not before he had plainly seen the vacant place which the false teeth had been made to fill perhaps mr brown had forgotten that he had left his teeth on the table or perhaps he the valet had misunderstood what had been said to him when he knocked at the door either way it seemed to be plain enough that the gentleman resented the discovery of his false teeth by a stranger  having concluded his statement the witness proceeded to identify the remains of the deceased  he at once recognized the gentleman named james brown whom he had twice seenonce in the evening and again the next morningat traceys hotel in answer to further inquiries he declared that he knew nothing of the family or of the place of residence of the deceased he complained to the proprietor of the hotel of the rude treatment that he had received and asked if mr tracey knew anything of mr james brown mr tracey knew nothing of him on consulting the hotel book it was found that he had given notice to leave that afternoon  before returning to london the witness produced references which gave him an excellent character he also left the address of the master who had engaged him three days since  the last precaution adopted was to have the face of the corpse photographed before the coffin was closed on the same day the jury agreed on their verdict willful murder against some person unknown                              two days later emily found a last allusion to the crimeextracted from the columns of the south hampshire gazette  a relative of the deceased seeing the report of the adjourned inquest had appeared accompanied by a medical gentleman had seen the photograph and had declared the identification by henry forth to be correct  among other particulars now communicated for the first time it was stated that the late mr james brown had been unreasonably sensitive on the subject of his false teeth and that the one member of his family who knew of his wearing them was the relative who now claimed his remains  the claim having been established to the satisfaction of the authorities the corpse was removed by railroad the same day no further light had been thrown on the murder the handbill offering the reward and describing the suspected man had failed to prove of any assistance to the investigations of the police  from that date no further notice of the crime committed at the handinhand inn appeared in the public journals                              emily closed the volume which she had been consulting and thankfully acknowledged the services of the librarian  the new reader had excited this gentlemans interest noticing how carefully she examined the numbers of the old newspaper he looked at her from time to time wondering whether it was good news or bad of which she was in search she read steadily and continuously but she never rewarded his curiosity by any outward sign of the impression that had been produced on her when she left the room there was nothing to remark in her manner she looked quietly thoughtfuland that was all  the librarian smiledamused by his own folly because a strangers appearance had attracted him he had taken it for granted that circumstances of romantic interest must be connected with her visit to the library far from misleading him as he supposed his fancy might have been employed to better purpose if it had taken a higher flight stilland had associated emily with the fateful gloom of tragedy in place of the brighter interest of romance  there among the ordinary readers of the day was a dutiful and affectionate daughter following the dreadful story of the death of her father by murder and believing it to be the story of a strangerbecause she loved and trusted the person whose shortsighted mercy had deceived her that very discovery the dread of which had shaken the good doctors firm nerves had forced alban to exclude from his confidence the woman whom he loved and had driven the faithful old servant from the bedside of her dying mistressthat very discovery emily had now made with a face which never changed color and a heart which beat at ease was the deception that had won this cruel victory over truth destined still to triumph in the days which were to come yesif the life of earth is a foretaste of the life of hell noif a lie is a lie be the merciful motive for the falsehood what it may noif all deceit contains in it the seed of retribution to be ripened inexorably in the lapse of time     chapter xxvi mother eve  the servant received emily on her return from the library with a sly smile here he is again miss waiting to see you  she opened the parlor door and revealed alban morris as restless as ever walking up and down the room  when i missed you at the museum i was afraid you might be ill he said ought i to have gone away when my anxiety was relieved shall i go away now  you must take a chair mr morris and hear what i have to say for myself when you left me after your last visit i suppose i felt the force of example at any rate i like you had my suspicions i have been trying to confirm themand i have failed  he paused with the chair in his hand suspicions of me he asked  certainly can you guess how i have been employed for the last two days nonot even your ingenuity can do that i have been hard at work in another readingroom consulting the same back numbers of the same newspaper which you have been examining at the british museum there is my confessionand now we will have some tea  she moved to the fireplace to ring the bell and failed to see the effect produced on alban by those lightlyuttered words the common phrase is the only phrase that can describe it he was thunderstruck  yes she resumed i have read the report of the inquest if i know nothing else i know that the murder at zeeland cant be the discovery which you are bent on keeping from me dont be alarmed for the preservation of your secret i am too much discouraged to try again  the servant interrupted them by answering the bell alban once more escaped detection emily gave her orders with an approach to the old gayety of her school days tea as soon as possibleand let us have the new cake are you too much of a man mr morris to like cake  in this state of agitation he was unreasonably irritated by that playful question there is one thing i like better than cake he said and that one thing is a plain explanation  his tone puzzled her have i said anything to offend you she asked surely you can make allowance for a girls curiosity oh you shall have your explanationand what is more you shall have it without reserve  she was as good as her word what she had thought and what she had planned when he left her after his last visit was frankly and fully told if you wonder how i discovered the library she went on i must refer you to my aunts lawyer he lives in the cityand i wrote to him to help me i dont consider that my time has been wasted mr m orris we owe an apology to mrs rook  albans astonishment when he heard this forced its way to expression in words what can you possibly mean he asked  the tea was brought in before emily could reply she filled the cups and sighed as she looked at the cake if cecilia was here how she would enjoy it with that complimentary tribute to her friend she handed a slice to alban he never even noticed it  we have both of us behaved most unkindly to mrs rook she resumed i can excuse your not seeing it for i should not have seen it either but for the newspaper while i was reading i had an opportunity of thinking over what we said and did when the poor womans behavior so needlessly offended us i was too excited to think at the timeand besides i had been upset only the night before by what miss jethro said to me  alban started what has miss jethro to do with it he asked  nothing at all emily answered she spoke to me of her own private affairs a long storyand you wouldnt be interested in it let me finish what i had to say mrs rook was naturally reminded of the murder when she heard that my name was brown and she must certainly have been struckas i wasby the coincidence of my fathers death taking place at the same time when his unfortunate namesake was killed doesnt this sufficiently account for her agitation when she looked at the locket we first took her by surprise and then we suspected her of heaven knows what because the poor creature didnt happen to have her wits about her and to remember at the right moment what a very common name james brown is dont you see it as i do  i see that you have arrived at a remarkable change of opinion since we spoke of the subject in the garden at school  in my place you would have changed your opinion too i shall write to mrs rook by tomorrows post  alban heard her with dismay pray be guided by my advice he said earnestly pray dont write that letter  why not  it was too late to recall the words which he had rashly allowed to escape him how could he reply  to own that he had not only read what emily had read but had carefully copied the whole narrative and considered it at his leisure appeared to be simply impossible after what he had now heard her peace of mind depended absolutely on his discretion in this serious emergency silence was a mercy and silence was a lie if he remained silent might the mercy be trusted to atone for the lie he was too fond of emily to decide that question fairly on its own merits in other words he shrank from the terrible responsibility of telling her the truth  isnt the imprudence of writing to such a person as mrs rook plain enough to speak for itself he suggested cautiously  not to me  she made that reply rather obstinately alban seemed in her view to be trying to prevent her from atoning for an act of injustice besides he despised her cake i want to know why you object she said taking back the neglected slice and eating it herself  i object alban answered because mrs rook is a coarse presuming woman she may pervert your letter to some use of her own which you may have reason to regret  is that all  isnt it enough  it may be enough for you when i have done a person an injury and wish to make an apology i dont think it necessary to inquire whether the persons manners happen to be vulgar or not  albans patience was still equal to any demands that she could make on it i can only offer you advice which is honestly intended for your own good he gently replied  you would have more influence over me mr morris if you were a little readier to take me into your confidence i daresay i am wrongbut i dont like following advice which is given to me in the dark  it was impossible to offend him very naturally he said i dont blame you  her color deepened and her voice rose albans patient adherence to his own viewso courteously and considerately urgedwas beginning to try her temper in plain words she rejoined i am to believe that you cant be mistaken in your judgment of another person  there was a ring at the door of the cottage while she was speaking but she was too warmly interested in confuting alban to notice it  he was quite willing to be confuted even when she lost her temper she was still interesting to him i dont expect you to think me infallible he said perhaps you will remember that i have had some experience i am unfortunately older than you are  oh if wisdom comes with age she smartly reminded him your friend miss redwood is old enough to be your motherand she suspected mrs rook of murder because the poor woman looked at a door and disliked being in the next room to a fidgety old maid  albans manner changed he shrank from that chance allusion to doubts and fears which he dare not acknowledge let us talk of something else he said  she looked at him with a saucy smile have i driven you into a corner at last and is that your way of getting out of it  even his endurance failed are you trying to provoke me he asked are you no better than other women i wouldnt have believed it of you emily  emily she repeated the name in a tone of surprise which reminded him that he had addressed her with familiarity at a most inappropriate timethe time when they were on the point of a quarrel he felt the implied reproach too keenly to be able to answer her with composure  i think of emilyi love emilymy one hope is that emily may love me oh my dear is there no excuse if i forget to call you miss when you distress me  all that was tender and true in her nature secretly took his part she would have followed that better impulse if he had only been calm enough to understand her momentary silence and to give her time but the temper of a gentle and generous man once roused is slow to subside alban abruptly left his chair i had better go he said  as you please she answered whether you go mr morris or whether you stay i shall write to mrs rook  the ring at the bell was followed by the appearance of a visitor doctor allday opened the door just in time to hear emilys last words her vehemence seemed to amuse him  who is mrs rook he asked  a most respectable person emily answered indignantly housekeeper to sir jervis redwood you neednt sneer at her doctor allday she has not always been in serviceshe was landlady of the inn at zeeland  the doctor about to put his hat on a chair paused the inn at zeeland reminded him of the handbill and of the visit of miss jethro  why are you so hot over it he inquired  because i detest prejudice with this assertion of liberal feeling she pointed to alban standing quietly apart at the further end of the room there is the most prejudiced man livinghe hates mrs rook would you like to be introduced to him youre a philosopher you may do him some good doctor alldaymr alban morris  the doctor recognized the man with the felt hat and the objectionable beard whose personal appearance had not impressed him favorably  although they may hesitate to acknowledge it there are respectable englishmen still left who regard a felt hat and a beard as symbols of republican disaffection to the altar and the throne doctor alldays manner might have expressed this curious form of patriotic feeling but for the associations which emily had revived in his present frame of mind he was outwardly courteous because he was inwardly suspicious mrs rook had been described to him as formerly landlady of the inn at zeeland were there reasons for mr morriss hostile feeling toward this woman which might be referable to the crime committed in her house that might threaten emilys tranquillity if they were made known it would not be amiss to see a little more of mr morris on the first convenient occasion  i am glad to make your acquaintance sir  you are very kind doctor allday  the exchange of polite conventionalities having been accomplished alban approached emily to take his leave with mingled feelings of regret and anxietyregret for having allowed himself to speak harshly anxiety to part with her in kindness  will you forgive me for differing from you it was all he could venture to say in the presence of a stranger  oh yes she said quietly  will you think again before you decide  certainly mr morris but it wont alter my opinion if i do  the doctor hearing what passed between them frowned on what subject had they been differing and what opinion did emily decline to alter  alban gave it up he took her hand gently shall i see you at the museum tomorrow he asked  she was politely indifferent to the last yesunless something happens to keep me at home  the doctors eyebrows still expressed disapproval for what object was the meeting proposed and why at a museum  goodafternoon doctor allday  goodafternoon sir  for a moment after albans departure the doctor stood irresolute arriving suddenly at a decision he snatched up his hat and turned to emily in a hurry  i bring you news my dear which will surprise you who do you think has just left my house mrs ellmother dont interrupt me she has made up her mind to go out to service again tired of leading an idle lifethats her own account of itand asks me to act as her reference  did you consent  consent if i act as her reference i shall be asked how she came to leave her last place a nice dilemma either i must own that she deserted her mistress on her deathbedor tell a lie when i put it to her in that way she walked out of the house in dead silence if she applies to you next receive her as i didor decline to see her which would be better still  why am i to decline to see her  in consequence of her behavior to your aunt to be sure no i have said all i wanted to sayand i have no time to spare for answering idle questions goodby  sociallyspeaking doctors try the patience of their nearest and dearest friends in this respectthey are almost always in a hurry doctor alldays precipitate departure did not tend to soothe emilys irritated nerves she began to find excuses for mrs ellmother in a spirit of pure contradiction the old servants behavior might admit of justification a friendly welcome might persuade her to explain herself if she applies to me emily determined i shall certainly receive her  having arrived at this resolution her mind reverted to alban  some of the sharp things she had said to him subjected to afterreflection in solitude failed to justify themselves her better sense began to reproach her she tried to silence that unwelcome monitor by laying the blame on alban why had he been so patient and so good what harm was there in his calling her emily if he had told her to call him by his christian name she might have done it how noble he looked when he got up to go away he was actually handsome women may say what they please and write what they please their natural instinct is to find their master in a manespecially when they like him sinking lower and lower in her own estimation emily tried to turn the current of her thoughts in another direction she took up a bookopened it looked into it threw it across the room  if alban had returned at that moment resolved on a reconciliationif he had said my dear i want to see you like yourself again will you give me a kiss and make it upwould he have left her crying when he went away she was crying now     chapter xxvii mentor and telemachus  if emilys eyes could have followed alban as her thoughts were following him she would have seen him stop before he reached the end of the road in which the cottage stood his heart was full of tenderness and sorrow the longing to return to her was more than he could resist it would be easy to wait within view of the gate until the doctors visit came to an end he had just decided to go back and keep watchwhen he heard rapid footsteps approaching there devil take him was the doctor himself  i have something to say to you mr morris which way are you walking  any way alban answerednot very graciously  then let us take the turning that leads to my house its not customary for strangers especially when they happen to be englishmen to place confidence in each other let me set the example of violating that rule i want to speak to you about miss emily may i take your arm thank you at my age girls in generalunless they are my patientsare not objects of interest to me but that girl at the cottagei daresay i am in my dotagei tell you sir she has bewitched me upon my soul i could hardly be more anxious about her if i was her father and mind i am not an affectionate man by nature are you anxious about her too  yes  in what way  in what way are you anxious doctor allday  the doctor smiled grimly  you dont trust me well i have promised to set the example keep your mask on sirmine is off come what may of it but observe if you repeat what i am going to say  alban would hear no more whatever you may say doctor allday is trusted to my honor if you doubt my honor be so good as to let go my armi am not walking your way  the doctors hand tightened its grasp that little flourish of temper my dear sir is all i want to set me at my ease i feel i have got hold of the right man now answer me this have you ever heard of a person named miss jethro  alban suddenly came to a standstill  all right said the doctor i couldnt have wished for a more satisfactory reply  wait a minute alban interposed i know miss jethro as a teacher at miss ladds school who left her situation suddenlyand i know no more  the doctors peculiar smile made its appearance again  speaking in the vulgar tone he said you seem to be in a hurry to wash your hands of miss jethro  i have no reason to feel any interest in her alban replied  dont be too sure of that my friend i have something to tell you which may alter your opinion that exteacher at the school sir knows how the late mr brown met his death and how his daughter has been deceived about it  alban listened with surpriseand with some little doubt which he thought it wise not to acknowledge  the report of the inquest alludes to a relative who claimed the body he said was that relative the person who deceived miss emily and was the person her aunt  i must leave you to take your own view doctor allday replied a promise binds me not to repeat the information that i have received setting that aside we have the same object in viewand we must take care not to get in each others way here is my house let us go in and make a clean breast of it on both sides  established in the safe seclusion of his study the doctor set the example of confession in these plain terms  we only differ in opinion on one point he said we both think it likely from our experience of the women that the suspected murderer had an accomplice i say the guilty person is miss jethro you saymrs rook  when you have read my copy of the report alban answered i think you will arrive at my conclusion mrs rook might have entered the outhouse in which the two men slept at any time during the night while her husband was asleep the jury believed her when she declared that she never woke till the morning i dont  i am open to conviction mr morris now about the future do you mean to go on with your inquiries  even if i had no other motive than mere curiosity alban answered i think i should go on but i have a more urgent purpose in view all that i have done thus far has been done in emilys interests my object from the first has been to preserve her from any associationin the past or in the futurewith the woman whom i believe to have been concerned in her fathers death as i have already told you she is innocently doing all she can poor thing to put obstacles in my way  yes yes said the doctor she means to write to mrs rookand you have nearly quarreled about it trust me to take that matter in hand i dont regard it as serious but i am mortally afraid of what you are doing in emilys interests i wish you would give it up  why  because i see a danger i dont deny that emily is as innocent of suspicion as ever but the chances next time may be against us how do you know to what lengths your curiosity may lead you or on what shocking discoveries you may not blunder with the best intentions some unforeseen accident may open her eyes to the truth before you can prevent it i seem to surprise you  you do indeed surprise me  in the old story my dear sir mentor sometimes surprised telemachus i am mentorwithout being i hope quite so longwinded as that respectable philosopher let me put it in two words emilys happiness is precious to you take care you are not made the means of wrecking it will you consent to a sacrifice for her sake  i will do anything for her sake  will you give up your inquiries  from this moment i have done with them  mr morris you are the best friend she has  the next best friend to you doctor  in that fond persuasion they now partedtoo eagerly devoted to emily to look at the prospect before them in its least hopeful aspect both clever men neither one nor the other asked himself if any human resistance has ever yet obstructed the progress of truthwhen truth has once begun to force its way to the light  for the second time alban stopped on his way home the longing to be reconciled with emily was not to be resisted he returned to the cottage only to find disappointment waiting for him the servant reported that her young mistress had gone to bed with a bad headache  alban waited a day in the hope that emily might write to him no letter arrived he repeated his visit the next morning fortune was still against him on this occasion emily was engaged  engaged with a visitor he asked  yes sir a young lady named miss de sor  where had he heard that name before he remembered immediately that he had heard it at the school miss de sor was the unattractive new pupil whom the girls called francine alban looked at the parlor window as he left the cottage it was of serious importance that he should set himself right with emily and mere gossip he thought contemptuously stands in my way  if he had been less absorbed in his own interests he might have remembered that mere gossip is not always to be despised it has worked fatal mischief in its time     chapter xxviii francine  youre surprised to see me of course saluting emily in those terms francine looked round the parlor with an air of satirical curiosity dear me what a little place to live in  what brings you to london emily inquired  you ought to know my dear without asking why did i try to make friends with you at school and why have i been trying ever since because i hate youi mean because i cant resist youno i mean because i hate myself for liking you oh never mind my reasons i insisted on going to london with miss laddwhen that horrid woman announced that she had an appointment with her lawyer i said i

making one learn ones lessons  are you not getting on any better francine  worse my sweet friendworse one of the masters i am happy to say has flatly refused to teach me any longer pupils without brains i am accustomed to he said in his broken english but a pupil with no heart is beyond my endurance ha ha the mouldy old refugee has an eye for character though no heartthere i am described in two words  and proud of it emily remarked  yesproud of it stop let me do myself justice you consider tears a sign that one has some heart dont you i was very near crying last sunday a popular preacher did it no less a person that mr mirabelyou look as if you had heard of him  i have heard of him from cecilia  is she at brighton then theres one fool more in a fashionable watering place oh shes in switzerland is she i dont care where she is i only care about mr mirabel we all heard he was at brighton for his health and was going to preach didnt we cram the church as to describing him i give it up he is the only little man i ever admiredhair as long as mine and the sort of beard you see in pictures i wish i had his fair complexion and his white hands we were all in love with himor with his voice which was itwhen he began to read the commandments i wish i could imitate him when he came to the fifth commandment he began in his deepest bass voice honor thy father he stopped and looked up to heaven as if he saw the rest of it there he went on with a tremendous emphasis on the next word and thy mother he said as if that was quite a different thing in a tearful fluty quivering voice which was a compliment to mothers in itself we all felt it mothers or not but the great sensation was when he got into the pulpit the manner in which he dropped on his knees and hid his face in his hands and showed his beautiful rings was as a young lady said behind me simply seraphic we understood his celebrity from that momenti wonder whether i can remember the sermon  you neednt attempt it on my account emily said  my dear dont be obstinate wait till you hear him  i am quite content to wait  ah youre just in the right state of mind to be converted youre in a fair way to become one of his greatest admirers they say he is so agreeable in private life i am dying to know himdo i hear a ring at the bell is somebody else coming to see you  the servant brought in a card and a message  the person will call again miss  emily looked at the name written on the card  mrs ellmother she exclaimed  what an extraordinary name cried francine who is she  my aunts old servant  does she want a situation  emily looked at some lines of writing at the back of the card doctor allday had rightly foreseen events rejected by the doctor mrs ellmother had no alternative but to ask emily to help her  if she is out of place francine went on she may be just the sort of person i am looking for  you emily asked in astonishment  francine refused to explain until she got an answer to her question tell me first she said is mrs ellmother engaged  no she wants an engagement and she asks me to be her reference  is she sober honest middleaged clean steady goodtempered industrious francine rattled on has she all the virtues and none of the vices is she not too goodlooking and has she no male followers in one terrible wordwill she satisfy miss ladd  what has miss ladd to do with it  how stupid you are emily do put the womans card down on the table and listen to me havent i told you that one of my masters has declined to have anything more to do with me doesnt that help you to understand how i get on with the rest of them i am no longer miss ladds pupil my dear thanks to my laziness and my temper i am to be raised to the dignity of a parlor boarder in other words i am to be a young lady who patronizes the school with a room of my own and a servant of my own all provided for by a private arrangement between my father and miss ladd before i left the west indies my mother was at the bottom of it i have not the least doubt you dont appear to understand me  i dont indeed  francine considered a little perhaps they were fond of you at home she suggested  say they loved me francineand i loved them  ah my position is just the reverse of yours now they have got rid of me they dont want me back again at home i know as well what my mother said to my father as if i had heard her francine will never get on at school at her age try her by all means but make some other arrangement with miss ladd in case of a failureor she will be returned on our hands like a bad shilling there is my mother my anxious affectionate mother hit off to a t  she is your mother francine dont forget that  oh no i wont forget it my cat is my kittens motherthere there i wont shock your sensibilities let us get back to matter of fact when i begin my new life miss ladd makes one condition my maid is to be a model of discretionan elderly woman not a skittish young person who will only encourage me i must submit to the elderly woman or i shall be sent back to the west indies after all how long did mrs ellmother live with your aunt  twentyfive years and more  good heavens its a lifetime why isnt this amazing creature living with you now your aunt is dead did you send her away  certainly not  then why did she go  i dont know  do you mean that she went away without a word of explanation  yes that is exactly what i mean  when did she go as soon as your aunt was dead  that doesnt matter francine  in plain english you wont tell me i am all on fire with curiosityand thats how you put me out my dear if you have the slightest regard for me let us have the woman in here when she comes back for her answer somebody must satisfy me i mean to make mrs ellmother explain herself  i dont think you will succeed francine  wait a little and you will see bytheby it is understood that my new position at the school gives me the privilege of accepting invitations do you know any nice people to whom you can introduce me  i am the last person in the world who has a chance of helping you emily answered excepting good doctor allday on the point of adding the name of alban morris she checked herself without knowing why and substituted the name of her schoolfriend and not forgetting cecilia she resumed i know nobody  cecilias a fool francine remarked gravely but now i think of it she may be worth cultivating her father is a member of parliamentand didnt i hear that he has a fine place in the country you see emily i may expect to be married with my money if i can only get into good society dont suppose i am dependent on my father my marriage portion is provided for in my uncles will cecilia may really be of some use to me why shouldnt i make a friend of her and get introduced to her fatherin the autumn you know when the house is full of company have you any idea when she is coming back  no  do you think of writing to her  of course  give her my kind love and say i hope she enjoys switzerland  francine you are positively shameless after calling my dearest friend a fool and a glutton you send her your love for your own selfish ends and you expect me to help you in deceiving her i wont do it  keep your temper my child we are all selfish you little goose the only difference issome of us own it and some of us dont i shall find my own way to cecilias good graces quite easily the way is through her mouth you mentioned a certain doctor allday does he give parties and do the right sort of men go to them hush i think i hear the bell again go to the door and see who it is  emily waited without taking any notice of this suggestion the servant announced that the person had called again to know if there was any answer  show her in here emily said  the servant withdrew and came back again  the person doesnt wish to intrude miss it will be quite sufficient if you will send a message by me  emily crossed the room to the door  come in mrs ellmother she said you have been too long away already pray come in     chapter xxix bony  mrs ellmother reluctantly entered the room  since emily had seen her last her personal appearance doubly justified the nickname by which her late mistress had distinguished her the old servant was worn and wasted her gown hung loose on her angular body the big bones of her face stood out more prominently than ever she took emilys offered hand doubtingly i hope i see you well miss she saidwith hardly a vestige left of her former firmness of voice and manner  i am afraid you have been suffering from illness emily answered gently  its the life im leading that wears me down i want work and change  making that reply she looked round and discovered francine observing her with undisguised curiosity you have got company with you she said to emily i had better go away and come back another time  francine stopped her before she could open the door you mustnt go away i wish to speak to you  about what miss  the eyes of the two women metone near the end of her life concealing under a rugged surface a nature sensitively affectionate and incorruptibly true the other young in years with out the virtues of youth hard in manner and hard at heart in silence on either side they stood face to face strangers brought together by the force of circumstances working inexorably toward their hidden end  emily introduced mrs ellmother to francine it may be worth your while she hinted to hear what this young lady has to say  mrs ellmother listened with little appearance of interest in anything that a stranger might have to say her eyes rested on the card which contained her written request to emily francine watching her closely understood what was passing in her mind it might be worth while to conciliate the old woman by a little act of attention turning to emily francine pointed to the card lying on the table you have not attended yet to mr ellmothers request she said  emily at once assured mrs ellmother that the request was granted but is it wise she asked to go out to service again at your age  i have been used to service all my life miss emilythats one reason and service may help me to get rid of my own thoughtsthats another if you can find me a situation somewhere you will be doing me a good turn  is it useless to suggest that you might come back and live with me emily ventured to say  mrs ellmothers head sank on her breast thank you kindly miss it is useless  why is it useless francine asked  mrs ellmother was silent  miss de sor is speaking to you emily reminded her  am i to answer miss de sor  attentively observing what passed and placing her own construction on looks and tones it suddenly struck francine that emily herself might be in mrs ellmothers confidence and that she might have reasons of her own for assuming ignorance when awkward questions were asked for the moment at least francine decided on keeping her suspicions to herself  i may perhaps offer you the employment you want she said to mrs ellmother i am staying at brighton for the present with the lady who was miss emilys schoolmistress and i am in need of a maid would you be willing to consider it if i proposed to engage you  yes miss  in that case you can hardly object to the customary inquiry why did you leave your last place  mrs ellmother appealed to emily did you tell this young lady how long i remained in my last place  melancholy remembrances had been revived in emily by the turn which the talk had now taken francines catlike patience stealthily feeling its way to its end jarred on her nerves yes she said in justice to you i have mentioned your long term of service  mrs ellmother addressed francine you know miss that i served my late mistress for over twentyfive years will you please remember thatand let it be a reason for not asking me why i left my place  francine smiled compassionately my good creature you have mentioned the very reason why i should ask you live fiveandtwenty years with your mistressand then suddenly leave herand you expect me to pass over this extraordinary proceeding without inquiry take a little time to think  i want no time to think what i had in my mind when i left miss letitia is something which i refuse to explain miss to you or to anybody  she recovered some of her old firmness when she made that reply francine saw the necessity of yieldingfor the time at least emily remained silent oppressed by remembrance of the doubts and fears which had darkened the last miserable days of her aunts illness she began already to regret having made francine and mrs ellmother known to each other  i wont dwell on what appears to be a painful subject francine graciously resumed i meant no offense you are not angry i hope  sorry miss i might have been angry at one time that time is over  it was said sadly and resignedly emily heard the answer her heart ached as she looked at the old servant and thought of the contrast between past and present with what a hearty welcome this broken woman had been used to receive her in the bygone holidaytime her eyes moistened she felt the merciless persistency of francine as if it had been an insult offered to herself give it up she said sharply  leave me my dear to manage my own business francine replied about your qualifications she continued turning coolly to mrs ellmother can you dress hair  yes  i ought to tell you francine insisted that i am very particular about my hair  my mistress was very particular about her hair mrs ellmother answered  are you a good needlewoman  as good as ever i waswith the help of my spectacles  francine turned to emily see how well we get on together we are beginning to understand each other already i am an odd creature mrs ellmother sometimes i take sudden likings to personsi have taken a liking to you do you begin to think a little better of me than you did i hope you will produce the right impression on miss ladd you shall have every assistance that i can give i will beg miss ladd as a favor to me not to ask you that one forbidden question  poor mrs ellmother puzzled by the sudden appearance of francine in the character of an eccentric young lady the creature of genial impulse thought it right to express her gratitude for the promised interference in her favor thats kind of you miss she said  no no only just i ought to tell you theres one thing miss ladd is strict aboutsweethearts are you quite sure francine inquired jocosely that you can answer for yourself in that particular  this effort of humor produced its intended effect mrs ellmother thrown off her guard actually smiled lord miss what will you say next  my good soul i will say something next that is more to the purpose if miss ladd asks me why you have so unaccountably refused to be a servant again in this house i shall take care to say that it is certainly not out of dislike to miss emily  you need say nothing of the sort emily quietly remarked  and still less francine proceeded without noticing the interruptionstill less through any disagreeable remembrances of miss emilys aunt  mrs ellmother saw the trap that had been set for her it wont do miss she said  what wont do  trying to pump me  francine burst out laughing emily noticed an artificial ring in her gayety which suggested that she was exasperated rather than amused by the repulse which had baffled her curiosity once more  mrs ellmother reminded the merry young lady that the proposed arrangement between them had not been concluded yet am i to understand miss that you will keep a place open for me in your service  you are to understand francine replied sharply that i must have miss ladds approval before i can engage you suppose you come to brighton i will pay your fare of course  never mind my fare miss will you give up pumping  make your mind easy its quite useless to attempt pumping you when will you come  mrs ellmother pleaded for a little delay im altering my gowns she said i get thinner and thinnerdont i miss emily my work wont be done before thursday  let us say friday then francine proposed  friday mrs ellmother exclaimed you forget that friday is an unlucky day  i forgot that certainly how can you be so absurdly superstitious  you may call it what you like miss i have good reason to think as i do i was married on a fridayand a bitter bad marriage it turned out to be superstitious indeed you dont know what my experience has been my only sister was one of a party of thirteen at dinner and she died within the year if we are to get on together nicely ill take that journey on saturday if you please  anything to satisfy you francine agreed there is the address come in the middle of the day and we will give you your dinner no fear of our being thirteen in number what will you do if you have the misfortune to spill the salt  take a pinch between my finger and thumb and throw it over my left shoulder mrs ellmother answered gravely goodday miss  goodday  emily followed the departing visitor out to the hall she had seen and heard enough to decide her on trying to break off the proposed negotiationwith the one kind purpose of protecting mrs ellmother against the pitiless curiosity of francine  do you think you and that young lady are likely to get on well together she asked  i have told you already miss emily i want to get away from my own home and my own thoughts i dont care where i go so long as i do that having answered in those words mrs ellmother opened the door and waited a while thinking i wonder whether the dead know what is going on in the world they have left she said looking at emily if they do theres one among them knows my thoughts and feels for me goodby missand dont think worse of me than i deserve  emily went back to the parlor the only resource left was to plead with francine for mercy to mrs ellmother  do you really mean to give it up she asked  to give upwhat pumping as that obstinate old creature calls it  emily persisted dont worry the poor old soul however strangely she may have left my aunt and me her motives are kind and goodi am sure of that will you let her keep her harmless little secret  oh of course  i dont believe you francine  dont you i am like ceciliai am getting hungry shall we have some lunch  you hardhearted creature  does that meanno luncheon until i have owned the truth suppose you own the truth i wont tell mrs ellmother that you have betrayed her  for the last time francinei know no more of it than you do if you persist in taking your own view you as good as tell me i lie and you will oblige me to leave the room  even francines obstinacy was compelled to give way so far as appearances went still possessed by the delusion that emily was deceiving her she was now animated by a stronger motive than mere curiosity her sense of her own importance imperatively urged her to prove that she was not a person who could be deceived with impunity  i beg your pardon she said with humility but i must positively have it out with mrs ellmother she has been more than a match for memy turn next i mean to get the better of her and i shall succeed  i have already told you francineyou will fail  my dear i am a dunce and i dont deny it but let me tell you one thing i havent lived all my life in the west indies among black servants without learning something  what do you mean  more my clever friend than you are likely to guess in the meantime dont forget the duties of hospitality ring the bell for luncheon     chapter xxx lady doris  the arrival of miss ladd some time before she had been expected interrupted the two girls at a critical moment she had hurried over her business in london eager to pass the rest of the day with her favorite pupil emilys affectionate welcome was in some degree at least inspired by a sensation of relief to feel herself in the embrace of the warmhearted schoolmistress was like finding a refuge from francine  when the hour of departure arrived miss ladd invited emily to brighton for the second time on the last occasion my dear you wrote me an excuse i wont be treated in that way again if you cant return with us now come tomorrow she added in a whisper otherwise i shall think you include me in your dislike of francine  there was no resisting this it was arranged that emily should go to brighton on the next day  left by herself her thoughts might have reverted to mrs ellmothers doubtful prospects and to francines strange allusion to her life in the west indies but for the arrival of two letters by the afternoon post the handwriting on one of them was unknown to her she opened that one first it was an answer to the letter of apology which she had persisted in writing to mrs rook happily for herself albans influence had not been without its effect after his departure she had written kindlybut she had written briefly at the same time  mrs rooks reply presented a nicely compounded mixture of gratitude and grief the gratitude was addressed to emily as a matter of course the grief related to her excellent master sir jerviss strength had suddenly failed his medical attendant being summoned had expressed no surprise my patient is over seventy years of age the doctor remarked he will sit up late at night writing his book and he refuses to take exercise till headache and giddiness force him to try the fresh air as the necessary result he has broken down at last it may end in paralysis or it may end in death reporting this expression of medical opinion mrs rooks letter glided imperceptibly from respectful sympathy to modest regard for her own interests in the future it might be the sad fate of her husband and herself to be thrown on the world again if necessity brought them to london would kind miss emily grant her the honor of an interview and favor a poor unlucky woman with a word of advice  she may pervert your letter to some use of her own which you may have reason to regret did emily remember albans warning words no she accepted mrs rooks reply as a gratifying tribute to the justice of her own opinions  having proposed to write to alban feeling penitently that she had been in the wrong she was now readier than ever to send him a letter feeling compassionately that she had been in the right besides it was due to the faithful friend who was still working for her in the reading room that he should be informed of sir jerviss illness whether the old man lived or whether he died his literary labors were fatally interrupted in either case and one of the consequences would be the termination of her employment at the museum although the second of the two letters which she had received was addressed to her in cecilias handwriting emily waited to read it until she had first written to alban he will come tomorrow she thought and we shall both make apologies i shall regret that i was angry with him and he will regret that he was mistaken in his judgment of mrs rook we shall be as good friends again as ever  in this happy frame of mind she opened cecilias letter it was full of good news from first to last  the invalid sister had made such rapid progress toward recovery that the travelers had arranged to set forth on their journey back to england in a fortnight my one regret cecilia added is the parting with lady doris she and her husband are going to genoa where they will embark in lord janeaways yacht for a cruise in the mediterranean when we have said that miserable word goodbyoh emily what a hurry i shall be in to get back to you those allusions to your lonely life are so dreadful my dear that i have destroyed your letter it is enough to break ones heart only to look at it when once i get to london there shall be no more solitude for my poor afflicted friend papa will be free from his parliamentary duties in augustand he has promised to have the house full of delightful people to meet you who do you think will be one of our guests he is illustrious he is fascinating he deserves a line all to himself thus  the reverend miles mirabel  lady doris has discovered that the country parsonage in which this brilliant clergyman submits to exile is only twelve miles away from our house she has written to mr mirabel to introduce me and to mention the date of my return we will have some fun with the popular preacherwe will both fall in love with him together  is there anybody to whom you would like me to send an invitation shall we have mr alban morris now i know how kindly he took care of you at the railway station your good opinion of him is my opinion your letter also mentions a doctor is he nice and do you think he will let me eat pastry if we have him too i am so overflowing with hospitality all for your sake that i am ready to invite anybody and everybody to cheer you and make you happy would you like to meet miss ladd and the whole school  as to our amusements make your mind easy  i have come to a distinct understanding with papa that we are to have dances every eveningexcept when we try a little concert as a change private theatricals are to follow when we want another change after the dancing and the music no early rising no fixed hour for breakfast everything that is most exquisitely delicious at dinnerand to crown all your room next to mine for delightful midnight gossipings when we ought to be in bed what do you say darling to the programme  a last piece of newsand i have done  i have actually had a proposal of marriage from a young gentleman who sits opposite me at the table dhote when i tell you that he has white eyelashes and red hands and such enormous front teeth that he cant shut his mouth you will not need to be told that i refused him this vindictive person has abused me ever since in the most shameful manner i heard him last night under my window trying to set one of his friends against me keep clear of her my dear fellow shes the most heartless creature living the friend took my part he said i dont agree with you the young lady is a person of great sensibility nonsense says my amiable lover she eats too muchher sensibility is all stomach theres a wretch for you what a shameful advantage to take of sitting opposite to me at dinner goodby my love till we meet soon and are as happy together as the day is long  emily kissed the signature at that moment of all others cecilia was such a refreshing contrast to francine  before putting the letter away she looked again at that part of it which mentioned lady doriss introduction of cecilia to mr mirabel i dont feel the slightest interest in mr mirabel she thought smiling as the idea occurred to her and i need never have known him but for lady doriswho is a perfect stranger to me  she had just placed the letter in her desk when a visitor was announced doctor allday presented himself in a hurry as usual  another patient waiting emily asked mischievously no time to spare again  not a moment the old gentleman answered have you heard from mrs ellmother  yes  you dont mean to say you have answered her  i have done better than that doctori have seen her this morning  and consented to be her reference of course  how well you know me  doctor allday was a philosopher he kept his temper just what i might have expected he said eve and the apple only forbid a woman to do anything and she does it directlybe cause you have forbidden her ill try the other way with you now miss emily there was something else that i meant to have forbidden  what was it  may i make a special request  certainly  oh my dear write to mrs rook i beg and entreat of you write to mrs rook  emilys playful manner suddenly disappeared  ignoring the doctors little outbreak of humor she waited in grave surprise until it was his pleasure to explain himself  doctor allday on his side ignored the ominous change in emily he went on as pleasantly as ever mr morris and i have had a long talk about you my dear mr morris is a capital fellow i recommend him as a sweetheart i also back him in the matter of mrs rookwhats the matter now youre as red as a rose temper again eh  hatred of meanness emily answered indignantly i despise a man who plots behind my back to get another man to help him oh how i have been mistaken in alban morris  oh how little you know of the best friend you have cried the doctor imitating her girls are all alike the only man they can understand is the man who flatters them will you oblige me by writing to mrs rook  emily made an attempt to match the doctor with his own weapons your little joke comes too late she said satirically there is mrs rooks answer read it and she checked herself even in her anger she was incapable of speaking ungenerously to the old man who had so warmly befriended her i wont say to you she resumed what i might have said to another person  shall i say it for you asked the incorrigible doctor read it and be ashamed of yourselfthat was what you had in your mind isnt it anything to please you my dear he put on his spectacles read the letter and handed it back to emily with an impenetrable countenance what do you think of my new spectacles he asked as he took the glasses off his nose in the experience of thirty years i have had three grateful patients he put the spectacles back in the case this comes from the third very gratifyingvery gratifying  emilys sense of humor was not the uppermost sense in her at that moment she pointed with a peremptory forefinger to mrs rooks letter have you nothing to say about this  the doctor had so little to say about it that he was able to express himself in one word  humbug  he took his hatnodded kindly to emilyand hurried away to feverish pulses waiting to be felt and to furred tongues that were ashamed to show themselves     chapter xxxi moira  when alban presented himself the next morning the hours of the night had exercised their tranquilizing influence over emily she remembered sorrowfully how doctor allday had disturbed her belief in the man who loved her no feeling of irritation remained alban noticed that her manner was unusually subdued she received him with her customary grace but not with her customary smile  are you not well he asked  i am a little out of spirits she replied a disappointmentthat is all  he waited a moment apparently in the expectation that she might tell him what the disappointment was she remained silent and she looked away from him was he in any way answerable for the depression of spirits to which she alluded the doubt occurred to himbut he said nothing  i suppose you have received my letter she resumed  i have come here to thank you for your letter  it was my duty to tell you of sir jerviss illness i deserve no thanks  you have written to me so kindly alban reminded her you have referred to our difference of opinion the last time i was here so gently and so forgivingly  if i had written a little later she interposed the tone of my letter might have been less agreeable to you i happened to send it to the post before i received a visit from a friend of yoursa friend who had something to say to me after consulting with you  do you mean doctor allday  yes  what did he say  what you wished him to say he did his best he was as obstinate and unfeeling as you could possibly wish him to be but he was too late i have written to mrs rook and i have received a reply she spoke sadly not angrilyand pointed to the letter lying on her desk  alban understood he looked at her in despair is that wretched woman doomed to set us at variance every time we meet he exclaimed  emily silently held out the letter  he refused to take it the wrong you have done me is not to be set right in that way he said you believe the doctors visit was arranged between us i never knew that he intended to call on you i had no interest in sending him hereand i must not interfere again between you and mrs rook  i dont understand you  you will understand me when i tell you how my conversation with doctor allday ended i have done with interference i have done with advice whatever my doubts may be all further effort on my part to justify themall further inquiries no matter in what directionare at an end i made the sacrifice for your sake no i must repeat what you said to me just now i deserve no thanks what i have done has been done in deference to doctor alldayagainst my own convictions in spite of my own fears ridiculous convictions ridiculous fears men with morbid minds are their own tormentors it doesnt matter how i suffer so long as you are at ease i shall never thwart you or vex you again have you a better opinion of me now  she made the best of all answersshe gave him her hand  may i kiss it he asked as timidly as if he had been a boy addressing his first sweetheart  she was half inclined to laugh and half inclined to cry yes if you like she said softly  will you let me come and see you again  gladlywhen i return to london  you are going away  i am going to brighton this afternoon to stay with miss ladd  it was hard to lose her on the happy day when they understood each other at last an expression of disappointment passed over his face he rose and walked restlessly to the window miss ladd he repeated turning to emily as if an idea had struck him did i hear at the school that miss de sor was to spend the holidays under the care of miss ladd  yes  the same young lady he went on who paid you a visit yesterday morning  the same  that haunting distrust of the future which he had first betrayed and then affected to ridicule exercised its depressing influence over his better sense he was unreasonable enough to feel doubtful of francine simply because she was a stranger  miss de sor is a new friend of yours he said do you like her  it was not an easy question to answerwithout entering into particulars which emilys delicacy of feeling warned her to avoid i must know a little more of miss de sor she said before i can decide  albans misgivings were naturally encouraged by this evasive reply he began to regret having left the cottage on the previous day when he had heard that emily was engaged he might have sent in his card and might have been admitted it was an opportunity lost of observing francine on the morning of her first day at school when they had accidentally met at the summer house she had left a disagreeable impression on his mind ought he to allow his opinion to be influenced by this circumstance or ought he to follow emilys prudent example and suspend judgment until he knew a little more of francine  is any day fixed for your return to london he asked  not yet she said i hardly know how long my visit will be  in little more than a fortnight he continued i shall return to my classesthey will be dreary classes without you miss de sor goes back to the school with miss ladd i suppose  emily was at a loss to account for the depression in his looks and tones while he was making these unimportant inquiries she tried to rouse him by speaking lightly in reply  miss de sor returns in quite a new character she is to be a guest instead of a pupil do you wish to be better acquainted with her  yes he said grave ly now i know that she is a friend of yours he returned to his place near her a pleasant visit makes the days pass quickly he resumed you may remain at brighton longer than you anticipate and we may not meet again for some time to come if anything happens  do you mean anything serious she asked  no no i only meanif i can be of any service in that case will you write to me  you know i will  she looked at him anxiously he had completely failed to hide from her the uneasy state of his mind a man less capable of concealment of feeling never lived you are anxious and out of spirits she said gently is it my fault  your fault oh dont think that i have my dull days and my bright daysand just now my barometer is down at dull his voice faltered in spite of his efforts to control it he gave up the struggle and took his hat to go do you remember emily what i once said to you in the garden at the school i still believe there is a time of fulfillment to come in our lives he suddenly checked himself as if there had been something more in his mind to which he hesitated to give expressionand held out his hand to bid her goodby  my memory of what you said in the garden is better than yours she reminded him you said happen what may in the interval i trust the future do you feel the same trust still  he sigheddrew her to him gentlyand kissed her on the forehead was that his own reply she was not calm enough to ask him the question it remained in her thoughts for some time after he had gone                             on the same day emily was at brighton  francine happened to be alone in the drawingroom her first proceeding when emily was shown in was to stop the servant  have you taken my letter to the post  yes miss  it doesnt matter she dismissed the servant by a gesture and burst into such effusive hospitality that she actually insisted on kissing emily do you know what i have been doing she said i have been writing to ceciliadirecting to the care of her father at the house of commons i stupidly forgot that you would be able to give me the right address in switzerland you dont object i hope to my making myself agreeable to our dear beautiful greedy girl it is of such importance to me to surround myself with influential friendsand of course i have given her your love dont look disgusted come and see your roomoh never mind miss ladd you will see her when she wakes ill is that sort of old woman ever ill shes only taking her nap after bathing bathing in the sea at her age how she must frighten the fishes  having seen her own bedchamber emily was next introduced to the room occupied by francine  one object that she noticed in it caused her some little surprisenot unmingled with disgust she discovered on the toilettable a coarsely caricatured portrait of mrs ellmother it was a sketch in pencilwretchedly drawn but spitefully successful as a likeness i didnt know you were an artist emily remarked with an ironical emphasis on the last word francine laughed scornfullycrumpled the drawing up in her handand threw it into the wastepaper basket  you satirical creature she burst out gayly if you had lived a dull life at st domingo you would have taken to spoiling paper too i might really have turned out an artist if i had been clever and industrious like you as it was i learned a little drawingand got tired of it i tried modeling in waxand got tired of it who do you think was my teacher one of our slaves  a slave emily exclaimed  yesa mulatto if you wish me to be particular the daughter of an english father and a negro mother in her young time at least she said so herself she was quite a beauty in her particular style her masters favorite he educated her himself besides drawing and painting and modeling in wax she could sing and playall the accomplishments thrown away on a slave when her owner died my uncle bought her at the sale of the property  a word of natural compassion escaped emilyto francines surprise  oh my dear you neednt pity her sappho that was her name fetched a high price even when she was no longer young she came to us by inheritance with the estates and the rest of it and took a fancy to me when she found out i didnt get on well with my father and mother i owe it to my father and mother she used to say that i am a slave when i see affectionate daughters it wrings my heart sappho was a strange compound a woman with a white side to her character and a black side for weeks together she would be a civilized being then she used to relapse and become as complete a negress as her mother at the risk of her life she stole away on those occasions into the interior of the island and looked on in hiding at the horrid witchcrafts and idolatries of the blacks they would have murdered a halfblood prying into their ceremonies if they had discovered her i followed her once so far as i dared the frightful yellings and drummings in the darkness of the forests frightened me the blacks suspected her and it came to my ears i gave her the warning that saved her life i dont know what i should have done without sappho to amuse me and from that time i do believe the curious creature loved me you see i can speak generously even of a slave  i wonder you didnt bring her with you to england emily said  in the first place francine answered she was my fathers property not mine in the second place shes dead poisoned as the other halfbloods supposed by some enemy among the blacks she said herself she was under a spell  what did she mean  francine was not interested enough in the subject to explain stupid superstition my dear the negro side of sappho was uppermost when she was dyingthere is the explanation be off with you i hear the old woman on the stairs meet her before she can come in here my bedroom is my only refuge from miss ladd  on the morning of the last day in the week emily had a little talk in private with her old schoolmistress miss ladd listened to what she had to say of mrs ellmother and did her best to relieve emilys anxieties i think you are mistaken my child in supposing that francine is in earnest it is her great fault that she is hardly ever in earnest you can trust to my discretion leave the rest to your aunts old servant and to me  mrs ellmother arrived punctual to the appointed time she was shown into miss ladds own room francineostentatiously resolved to take no personal part in the affairwent for a walk emily waited to hear the result  after a long interval miss ladd returned to the drawingroom and announced that she had sanctioned the engagement of mrs ellmother  i have considered your wishes in this respect she said it is arranged that a weeks notice on either side shall end the term of service after the first month i cannot feel justified in doing more than that mrs ellmother is such a respectable woman she is so well known to you and she was so long in your aunts service that i am bound to consider the importance of securing a person who is exactly fitted to attend on such a girl as francine in one word i can trust mrs ellmother  when does she enter on her service emily inquired  on the day after we return to the school miss ladd replied you will be glad to see her i am sure i will send her here  one word more before you go emily said  did you ask her why she left my aunt  my dear child a woman who has been fiveandtwenty years in one place is entitled to keep her own secrets i understand that she had her reasons and that she doesnt think it necessary to mention them to anybody never trust people by halvesespecially when they are people like mrs ellmother  it was too late now to raise any objections emily felt relieved rather than disappointed on discovering that mrs ellmother was in a hurry to get back to london by the next train sh e had found an opportunity of letting her lodgings and she was eager to conclude the bargain you see i couldnt say yes she explained till i knew whether i was to get this new place or notand the person wants to go in tonight  emily stopped her at the door promise to write and tell me how you get on with miss de sor  you say that miss as if you didnt feel hopeful about me  i say it because i feel interested about you promise to write  mrs ellmother promised and hastened away emily looked after her from the window as long as she was in view i wish i could feel sure of francine she said to herself  in what way asked the hard voice of francine speaking at the door  it was not in emilys nature to shrink from a plain reply she completed her halfformed thought without a moments hesitation  i wish i could feel sure she answered that you will be kind to mrs ellmother  are you afraid i shall make her life one scene of torment francine inquired how can i answer for myself i cant look into the future  for once in your life can you be in earnest emily said  for once in your life can you take a joke francine replied  emily said no more she privately resolved to shorten her visit to brighton     book the thirdnetherwoods    chapter xxxii in the gray room  the house inhabited by miss ladd and her pupils had been built in the early part of the present century by a wealthy merchantproud of his money and eager to distinguish himself as the owner of the largest country seat in the neighborhood  after his death miss ladd had taken netherwoods as the place was called finding her own house insufficient for the accommodation of the increasing number of her pupils a lease was granted to her on moderate terms netherwoods failed to attract persons of distinction in search of a country residence the grounds were beautiful but no landed propertynot even a parkwas attached to the house excepting the few acres on which the building stood the surrounding land belonged to a retired naval officer of old family who resented the attempt of a merchant of low birth to assume the position of a gentleman no matter what proposals might be made to the admiral he refused them all the privilege of shooting was not one of the attractions offered to tenants the country presented no facilities for hunting and the only stream in the neighborhood was not preserved in consequence of these drawbacks the merchants representatives had to choose between a proposal to use netherwoods as a lunatic asylum or to accept as tenant the respectable mistress of a fashionable and prosperous school they decided in favor of miss ladd  the contemplated change in francines position was accomplished in that vast house without inconvenience there were rooms unoccupied even when the limit assigned to the number of pupils had been reached on the reopening of the school francine was offered her choice between two rooms on one of the upper stories and two rooms on the ground floor she chose these last  her sittingroom and bedroom situated at the back of the house communicated with each other the sittingroom ornamented with a pretty paper of delicate gray and furnished with curtains of the same color had been accordingly named the gray room it had a french window which opened on the terrace overlooking the garden and the grounds some fine old engravings from the grand landscapes of claude part of a collection of prints possessed by miss ladds father hung on the walls the carpet was in harmony with the curtains and the furniture was of lightcolored wood which helped the general effect of subdued brightness that made the charm of the room if you are not happy here miss ladd said i despair of you and francine answered yes its very pretty but i wish it was not so small  on the twelfth of august the regular routine of the school was resumed alban morris found two strangers in his class to fill the vacancies left by emily and cecilia mrs ellmother was duly established in her new place she produced an unfavorable impression in the servants hallnot as the handsome chief housemaid explained because she was ugly and old but because she was a person who didnt talk the prejudice against habitual silence among the lower order of the people is almost as inveterate as the prejudice against red hair  in the evening on that first day of renewed studieswhile the girls were in the grounds after teafrancine had at last completed the arrangement of her rooms and had dismissed mrs ellmother kept hard at work since the morning to take a little rest standing alone at her window the west indian heiress wondered what she had better do next she glanced at the girls on the lawn and decided that they were unworthy of serious notice on the part of a person so specially favored as herself she turned sidewise and looked along the length of the terrace at the far end a tall man was slowly pacing to and fro with his head down and his hands in his pockets francine recognized the rude drawingmaster who had torn up his view of the village after she had saved it from being blown into the pond  she stepped out on the terrace and called to him he stopped and looked up  do you want me he called back  of course i do  she advanced a little to meet him and offered encouragement under the form of a hard smile although his manners might be unpleasant he had claims on the indulgence of a young lady who was at a loss how to employ her idle time in the first place he was a man in the second place he was not as old as the musicmaster or as ugly as the dancingmaster in the third place he was an admirer of emily and the opportunity of trying to shake his allegiance by means of a flirtation in emilys absence was too good an opportunity to be lost  do you remember how rude you were to me on the day when you were sketching in the summerhouse francine asked with snappish playfulness i expect you to make yourself agreeable this timei am going to pay you a compliment  he waited with exasperating composure to hear what the proposed compliment might be the furrow between his eyebrows looked deeper than ever there were signs of secret trouble in that dark face so grimly and so resolutely composed the school without emily presented the severest trial of endurance that he had encountered since the day when he had been deserted and disgraced by his affianced wife  you are an artist francine proceeded and therefore a person of taste i want to have your opinion of my sittingroom criticism is invited pray come in  he seemed to be unwilling to accept the invitationthen altered his mind and followed francine she had visited emily she was perhaps in a fair way to become emilys friend he remembered that he had already lost an opportunity of studying her character andif he saw the necessityof warning emily not to encourage the advances of miss de sor  very pretty he remarked looking round the roomwithout appearing to care for anything in it except the prints  francine was bent on fascinating him she raised her eyebrows and lifted her hands in playful remonstrance do remember its my room she said and take some little interest in it for my sake  what do you want me to say he asked  come and sit down by me she made room for him on the sofa her one favorite aspirationthe longing to excite envy in othersexpressed itself in her next words say something pretty she answered say you would like to have such a room as this  i should like to have your prints he remarked will that do  it wouldnt dofrom anybody else ah mr morris i know why you are not as nice as you might be you are not happy the school has lost its one attraction in losing our dear emily you feel iti know you feel it she assisted this expression of sympathy to produce the right effect by a sigh what would i not give to inspire such devotion as yours i dont envy emily i only wish she paused in confusion and opened her fan isnt it pretty she said with an ostentatious appearance of changing the subject alban behaved like a monster he began to talk of the weather  i think this is the hottest day we have had he said no wonder you want your fan netherwoods is an airless place at this season of the year  she controlled her temper i do indeed feel the heat she admitted with a resignation which gently reproved him it is so heavy and oppressive here after brighton perhaps my sad life far away from home and friends makes me sensitive to trifles do you think so mr morris  the merciless man said he thought it was the situation of the house  miss ladd took the place in the spring he continued and only discovered the one objection to it some months afterward we are in the highest part of the valley herebut you see its a valley surrounded by hills and on three sides the hills are near us all very well in winter but in summer i have heard of girls in this school so out of health in the relaxing atmosphere that they have been sent home again  francine suddenly showed an interest in what he was saying if he had cared to observe her closely he might have noticed it  do you mean that the girls were really ill she asked  no they slept badlylost appetitestarted at trifling noises in short their nerves were out of order  did they get well again at home in another air  not a doubt of it he answered beginning to get weary of the subject may i look at your books  francines interest in the influence of different atmospheres on health was not exhausted yet do you know where the girls lived when they were at home she inquired  i know where one of them lived she was the best pupil i ever hadand i remember she lived in yorkshire he was so weary of the idle curiosityas it appeared to himwhich persisted in asking trifling questions that he left his seat and crossed the room may i look at your books he repeated  oh yes  the conversation was suspended for a while the lady thought i should like to box his ears the gentleman thought shes only an inquisitive fool after all his examination of her books confirmed him in the delusion that there was really nothing in francines character which rendered it necessary to caution emily against the advances of her new friend turning away from the bookcase he made the first excuse that occurred to him for putting an end to the interview  i must beg you to let me return to my duties miss de sor i have to correct the young ladies drawings before they begin again tomorrow  francines wounded vanity made a last expiring attempt to steal the heart of emilys lover  you remind me that i have a favor to ask she said i dont attend the other classesbut i should so like to join your class may i she looked up at him with a languishing appearance of entreaty which sorely tried albans capacity to keep his face in serious order he acknowledged the compliment paid to him in studiously commonplace terms and got a little nearer to the open window francines obstinacy was not conquered yet  my education has been sadly neglected she continued but i have had some little instruction in drawing you will not find me so ignorant as some of the other girls she waited a little anticipating a few complimentary words alban waited alsoin silence i shall look forward with pleasure to my lessons under such an artist as yourself she went on and waited again and was disappointed again perhaps she resumed i may become your favorite pupilwho knows  who indeed  it was not much to say when he spoke at lastbut it was enough to encourage francine she called him dear mr morris she pleaded for permission to take her first lesson immediately she clasped her handsplease say yes  i cant say yes till you have complied with the rules  are they your rules  her eyes expressed the readiest submissionin that case he entirely failed to see it he said they were miss ladds rulesand wished her goodevening  she watched him walking away down the terrace how was he paid did he receive a yearly salary or did he get a little extra money for each new pupil who took drawing lessons in this last case francine saw her opportunity of being even with him you brute catch me attending your class     chapter xxxiii recollections of st domingo  the night was oppressively hot finding it impossible to sleep francine lay quietly in her bed thinking the subject of her reflections was a person who occupied the humble position of her new servant  mrs ellmother looked wretchedly ill mrs ellmother had told emily that her object in returning to domestic service was to try if change would relieve her from the oppression of her own thoughts mrs ellmother believed in vulgar superstitions which declared friday to be an unlucky day and which recommended throwing a pinch over your left shoulder if you happened to spill the salt  in themselves these were trifling recollections but they assumed a certain importance derived from the associations which they called forth  they reminded francine by some mental process which she was at a loss to trace of sappho the slave and of her life at st domingo  she struck a light and unlocked her writing desk from one of the drawers she took out an old household accountbook  the first page contained some entries relating to domestic expenses in her own handwriting they recalled one of her efforts to occupy her idle time by relieving her mother of the cares of housekeeping for a day or two she had perseveredand then she had ceased to feel any interest in her new employment the remainder of the book was completely filled up in a beautifully clear handwriting beginning on the second page a title had been found for the manuscript by francine she had written at the top of the page sapphos nonsense  after reading the first few sentences she rapidly turned over the leaves and stopped at a blank space near the end of the book here again she had added a title this time it implied a compliment to the writer the page was headed sapphos sense  she read this latter part of the manuscript with the closest attention  i entreat my kind and dear young mistress not to suppose that i believe in witchcraftafter such an education as i have received when i wrote down at your biding all that i had told you by word of mouth i cannot imagine what delusion possessed me you say i have a negro side to my character which i inherit from my mother did you mean this dear mistress as a joke i am almost afraid it is sometimes not far off from the truth  let me be careful however to avoid leading you into a mistake it is really true that the manslave i spoke of did pine and die after the spell had been cast on him by my witchmothers image of wax but i ought also to have told you that circumstances favored the working of the spell the fatal end was not brought about by supernatural means  the poor wretch was not in good health at the time and our owner had occasion to employ him in the valley of the island far inland i have been told and can well believe that the climate there is different from the climate on the coastin which the unfortunate slave had been accustomed to live the overseer wouldnt believe him when he said the valley air would be his deathand the negroes who might otherwise have helped him all avoided a man whom they knew to be under a spell  this you see accounts for what might appear incredible to civilized persons if you will do me a favor you will burn this little book as soon as you have read what i have written here if my request is not granted i can only implore you to let no eyes but your own see these pages my life might be in danger if the blacks knew what i have now told you in the interests of truth  francine closed the book and locked it up again in her desk now i know she said to herself what reminded me of st domingo  when francine rang her bell the next morning so long a time elapsed without producing an answer that she began to think of sending one of the houseservants to make inquiries before she could decide mrs ellmother presented herself and offered her apologies  its the first time i have overslept myself miss since i was a girl please to excuse me it shant happen again  do you find that the air here makes you drowsy francine asked  mrs ellmother shook her head i didnt get to sleep she said till morning and so i was too heavy to be up in time but air has got nothing to do with it gentlefolks may have their whims and fancies all air is the same to people like me  you enjoy good health mrs ellmother  why not miss i have never had a doctor  oh thats your opinion of doctors is it  i wont have anything to do with themif thats what you mean by my opinion mrs ellmother answered doggedly how will you have your hair done  the same as yesterday have you seen anything of miss emily she went back to london the day after you left us  i havent been in london im thankful to say my lodgings are let to a good tenant  then where have you lived while you were waiting to come here  i had only one place to go to miss i went to the village where i was born a friend found a corner for me ah dear heart its a pleasant place there  a place like this  lord help you as little like this as chalk is to cheese a fine big moor miss in cumberland without a tree in sightlook where you may something like a wind i can tell you when it takes to blowing there  have you never been in this part of the country  not i when i left the north my new mistress took me to canada talk about air if there was anything in it the people in that air ought to live to be a hundred i liked canada  and who was your next mistress  thus far mrs ellmother had been ready enough to talk had she failed to hear what francine had just said to her or had she some reason for feeling reluctant to answer in any case a spirit of taciturnity took sudden possession of hershe was silent  francine as usual persisted was your next place in service with miss emilys aunt  yes  did the old lady always live in london  no  what part of the country did she live in  kent  among the hop gardens  no  in what other part then  isle of thanet  near the sea coast  yes  even francine could insist no longer mrs ellmothers reserve had beaten herfor that day at least go into the hall she said and see if there are any letters for me in the rack  there was a letter bearing the swiss postmark simple cecilia was flattered and delighted by the charming manner in which francine had written to her she looked forward with impatience to the time when their present acquaintance might ripen into friendship would dear miss de sor waive all ceremony and consent to be a guest later in the autumn at her fathers house circumstances connected with her sisters health would delay their return to england for a little while by the end of the month she hoped to be at home again and to hear if francine was disengaged her address in england was monksmoor park hants  having read the letter francine drew a moral from it there is great use in a fool when one knows how to manage her  having little appetite for her breakfast she tried the experiment of a walk on the terrace alban morris was right the air at netherwoods in the summer time was relaxing the morning mist still hung over the lowest part of the valley between the village and the hills beyond a little exercise produced a feeling of fatigue francine returned to her room and trifled with her tea and toast  her next proceeding was to open her writingdesk and look into the old accountbook once more while it lay open on her lap she recalled what had passed that morning between mrs ellmother and herself  the old woman had been born and bred in the north on an open moor she had been removed to the keen air of canada when she left her birthplace she had been in service after that on the breezy eastward coast of kent would the change to the climate of netherwoods produce any effect on mrs ellmother at her age and with her seasoned constitution would she feel it as those schoolgirls had felt itespecially that one among them who lived in the bracing air of the north the air of yorkshire  weary of solitary thinking on one subject francine returned to the terrace with a vague idea of finding something to amuse herthat is to say something she could turn into ridiculeif she joined the girls  the next morning mrs ellmother answered her mistresss bell without delay you have slept better this time francine said  no miss when i did get to sleep i was troubled by dreams another bad nightand no mistake  i suspect your mind is not quite at ease francine suggested  why do you suspect that if you please  you talked when i met you at miss emilys of wanting to get away from your own thoughts has the change to this place helped you  it hasnt helped me as i expected some peoples thoughts stick fast  remorseful thoughts francine inquired  mrs ellmother held up her forefinger and shook it with a gesture of reproof i thought we agreed miss that there was to be no pumping  the business of the toilet proceeded in silence  a week passed during an interval in the labors of the school miss ladd knocked at the door of francines room  i want to speak to you my dear about mrs ellmother have you noticed that she doesnt seem to be in good health  she looks rather pale miss ladd  its more serious than that francine the servants tell me that she has hardly any appetite she herself acknowledges that she sleeps badly i noticed her yesterday evening in the garden under the schoolroom window one of the girls dropped a dictionary she started at that slight noise as if it terrified her her nerves are seriously out of order can you prevail upon her to see the doctor  francine hesitatedand made an excuse i think she would be much more likely miss ladd to listen to you do you mind speaking to her  certainly not  mrs ellmother was immediately sent for what is your pleasure miss she said to francine  miss ladd interposed it is i who wish to speak to you mrs ellmother for some days past i have been sorry to see you looking ill  i never was ill in my life maam  miss ladd gently persisted i hear that you have lost your appetite  i never was a great eater maam  it was evidently useless to risk any further allusion to mrs ellmothers symptoms miss ladd tried another method of persuasion i daresay i may be mistaken she said but i do really feel anxious about you to set my mind at rest will you see the doctor  the doctor do you think im going to begin taking physic at my time of life lord maam you amuse meyou do indeed she burst into a sudden fit of laughter the hysterical laughter which is on the verge of tears with a desperate effort she controlled herself please dont make a fool of me again she saidand left the room  what do you think now miss ladd asked  francine appeared to be still on her guard  i dont know what to think she said evasively  miss ladd looked at her in silent surprise and withdrew  left by herself francine sat with her elbows on the table and her face in her hands absorbed in thought after a long interval she opened her deskand hesitated she took a sheet of notepaperand paused as if still in doubt she snatched up her pen with a sudden recovery of resolutionand addressed these lines to the wife of her fathers agent in london  when i was placed under your care on the night of my arrival from the west indies you kindly said i might ask you for any little service which might be within your power i shall be greatly obliged if you can obtain for me and send to this place a supply of artists modeling waxsufficient for the product ion of a small image     chapter xxxiv in the dark  a week later alban morris happened to be in miss ladds study with a report to make on the subject of his drawingclass mrs ellmother interrupted them for a moment she entered the room to return a book which francine had borrowed that morning  has miss de sor done with it already miss ladd asked  she wont read it maam she says the leaves smell of tobaccosmoke  miss ladd turned to alban and shook her head with an air of goodhumored reproof i know who has been reading that book last she said  alban pleaded guilty by a look he was the only master in the school who smoked as mrs ellmother passed him on her way out he noticed the signs of suffering in her wasted face  that woman is surely in a bad state of health he said has she seen the doctor  she flatly refuses to consult the doctor miss ladd replied if she was a stranger i should meet the difficulty by telling miss de sor whose servant she is that mrs ellmother must be sent home but i cannot act in that peremptory manner toward a person in whom emily is interested  from that moment mrs ellmother became a person in whom alban was interested later in the day he met her in one of the lower corridors of the house and spoke to her i am afraid the air of this place doesnt agree with you he said  mrs ellmothers irritable objection to being told even indirectly that she looked ill expressed itself roughly in reply i daresay you mean well sirbut i dont see how it matters to you whether the place agrees with me or not  wait a minute alban answered goodhumoredly i am not quite a stranger to you  how do you make that out if you please  i know a young lady who has a sincere regard for you  you dont mean miss emily  yes i do i respect and admire miss emily and i have tried in my poor way to be of some little service to her  mrs ellmothers haggard face instantly softened please to forgive me sir for forgetting my manners she said simply i have had my health since the day i was bornand i dont like to be told in my old age that a new place doesnt agree with me  alban accepted this apology in a manner which at once won the heart of the northcountrywoman he shook hands with her youre one of the right sort she said there are not many of them in this house  was she alluding to francine alban tried to make the discovery polite circumlocution would be evidently thrown away on mrs ellmother is your new mistress one of the right sort he asked bluntly  the old servants answer was expressed by a frowning look followed by a plain question  do you say that sir because you like my new mistress  no  please to shake hands again she said ittook his hand with a sudden grip that spoke for itselfand walked away  here was an exhibition of character which alban was just the man to appreciate if i had been an old woman he thought in his dryly humorous way i believe i should have been like mrs ellmother we might have talked of emily if she had not left me in such a hurry when shall i see her again  he was destined to see her again that nightunder circumstances which he remembered to the end of his life  the rules of netherwoods in summer time recalled the young ladies from their evenings recreation in the grounds at nine oclock after that hour alban was free to smoke his pipe and to linger among trees and flowerbeds before he returned to his hot little rooms in the village as a relief to the drudgery of teaching the young ladies he had been using his pencil when the days lessons were over for his own amusement it was past ten oclock before he lighted his pipe and began walking slowly to and fro on the path which led to the summerhouse at the southern limit of the grounds  in the perfect stillness of the night the clock of the village church was distinctly audible striking the hours and the quarters the moon had not risen but the mysterious glimmer of starlight trembled on the large open space between the trees and the house  alban paused admiring with an artists eye the effect of light so faintly and delicately beautiful on the broad expanse of the lawn does the man live who could paint that he asked himself his memory recalled the works of the greatest of all landscape paintersthe english artists of fifty years since while recollections of many a noble picture were still passing through his mind he was startled by the sudden appearance of a bareheaded woman on the terrace steps  she hurried down to the lawn staggering as she ranstopped and looked back at the househastened onward toward the treesstopped again looking backward and forward uncertain which way to turn nextand then advanced once more he could now hear her heavily gasping for breath as she came nearer the starlight showed a panicstricken facethe face of mrs ellmother  alban ran to meet her she dropped on the grass before he could cross the short distance which separated them as he raised her in his arms she looked at him wildly and murmured and muttered in the vain attempt to speak look at me again he said dont you remember the man who had some talk with you today she still stared at him vacantly he tried again dont you remember miss emilys friend  as the name passed his lips her mind in some degree recovered its balance yes she said emilys friend im glad i have met with emilys friend she caught at albans armstarting as if her own words had alarmed her what am i talking about did i say emily a servant ought to say miss emily my head swims am i going mad  alban led her to one of the garden chairs youre only a little frightened he said rest and compose yourself  she looked over her shoulder toward the house not here ive run away from a shedevil i want to be out of sight further away misteri dont know your name tell me your name i wont trust you unless you tell me your name  hush hush call me alban  i never heard of such a name i wont trust you  you wont trust your friend and emilys friend you dont mean that im sure call me by my other namecall me morris  morris she repeated ah ive heard of people called morris look back your eyes are youngdo you see her on the terrace  there isnt a living soul to be seen anywhere  with one hand he raised her as he spokeand with the other he took up the chair in a minute more they were out of sight of the house he seated her so that she could rest her head against the trunk of a tree  what a good fellow the poor old creature said admiring him he knows how my head pains me dont stand up youre a tall man she might see you  she can see nothing look at the trees behind us even the starlight doesnt get through them  mrs ellmother was not satisfied yet you take it coolly she said do you know who saw us together in the passage today you good morris she saw usshe did wretch cruel cunning shameless wretch  in the shadows that were round them alban could just see that she was shaking her clinched fists in the air he made another attempt to control her dont excite yourself if she comes into the garden she might hear you  the appeal to her fears had its effect  thats true she said in lowered tones a sudden distrust of him seized her the next moment who told me i was excited she burst out its you who are excited deny it if you dare i begin to suspect you mr morris i dont like your conduct what has become of your pipe i saw you put your pipe in your coat pocket you did it when you set me down among the trees where she could see me you are in league with hershe is coming to meet you hereyou know she does not like tobaccosmoke are you two going to put me in the madhouse  she started to her feet it occurred to alban that the speediest way of pacifying her might be by means of the pipe mere words would exercise no persuasive influence over that bewildered mind instant action of some kind would be far more likely to have the right effect he put his pipe and his tobacco pouch into her hands and so mastered her attention before he spoke  do you know how to fill a mans pipe for him he asked  havent i filled my husbands pipe hundreds of times she answered sharply  very well now do it for me  she took her chair again instantly and filled the pipe he lighted it and seated himself on the grass quietly smoking do you think im in league with her now he asked purposely adopting the rough tone of a man in her own rank of life  she answered him as she might have answered her husband in the days of her unhappy marriage  oh dont gird at me theres a good man if ive been off my head for a minute or two please not to notice me its cool and quiet here the poor woman said gratefully bless god for the darkness theres something comforting in the darknessalong with a good man like you give me a word of advice you are my friend in need what am i to do i darent go back to the house  she was quiet enough now to suggest the hope that she might be able to give alban some information were you with miss de sor he asked before you came out here what did she do to frighten you  there was no answer mrs ellmother had abruptly risen once more hush she whispered dont i hear somebody near us  alban at once went back along the winding path which they had followed no creature was visible in the gardens or on the terrace on returning he found it impossible to use his eyes to any good purpose in the obscurity among the trees he waited a while listening intently no sound was audible there was not even air enough to stir the leaves  as he returned to the place that he had left the silence was broken by the chimes of the distant church clock striking the threequarters past ten  even that familiar sound jarred on mrs ellmothers shattered nerves in her state of mind and body she was evidently at the mercy of any false alarm which might be raised by her own fears relieved of the feeling of distrust which had thus far troubled him alban sat down by her againopened his matchbox to relight his pipeand changed his mind mrs ellmother had unconsciously warned him to be cautious  for the first time he thought it likely that the heat in the house might induce some of the inmates to try the cooler atmosphere in the grounds if this happened and if he continued to smoke curiosity might tempt them to follow the scent of tobacco hanging on the stagnant air  is there nobody near us mrs ellmother asked are you sure  quite sure now tell me did you really mean it when you said just now that you wanted my advice  need you ask that sir who else have i got to help me  i am ready and willing to help youbut i cant do it unless i know first what has passed between you and miss de sor will you trust me  i will  may i depend on you  try me     chapter xxxv the treachery of the pipe  alban took mrs ellmother at her word i am going to venture on a guess he said you have been with miss de sor tonight  quite true mr morris  i am going to guess again did miss de sor ask you to stay with her when you went into her room  thats it she rang for me to see how i was getting on with my needleworkand she was what i call hearty for the first time since i have been in her service i didnt think badly of her when she first talked of engaging me and ive had reason to repent of my opinion ever since oh she showed the cloven foot tonight sit down she says ive nothing to read and i hate work lets have a little chat shes got a glib tongue of her own all i could do was to say a word now and then to keep her going she talked and talked till it was time to light the lamp she was particular in telling me to put the shade over it we were half in the dark and half in the light she trapped me lord knows how into talking about foreign parts i mean the place she lived in before they sent her to england have you heard that she comes from the west indies  yes i have heard that go on  wait a bit sir theres something by your leave that i want to know do you believe in witchcraft  i know nothing about it did miss de sor put that question to you  she did  and how did you answer  neither in one way nor the other im in two minds about that matter of witchcraft when i was a girl there was an old woman in our village who was a sort of show people came to see her from all the country roundgentlefolks among them it was her great age that made her famous more than a hundred years old sir one of our neighbors didnt believe in her age and she heard of it she cast a spell on his flock i tell you she sent a plague on his sheep the plague of the bots the whole flock died i remember it well some said the sheep would have had the bots anyhow some said it was the spell which of them was right how am i to settle it  did you mention this to miss de sor  i was obliged to mention it didnt i tell you just now that i cant make up my mind about witchcraft you dont seem to know whether you believe or disbelieve she says it made me look like a fool i told her i had my reasons and then i was obliged to give them  and what did she do then  she said ive got a better story of witchcraft than yours and she opened a little book with a lot of writing in it and began to read her story made my flesh creep it turns me cold sir when i think of it now  he heard her moaning and shuddering strongly as his interest was excited there was a compassionate reluctance in him to ask her to go on his merciful scruples proved to be needless the fascination of beauty it is possible to resist the fascination of horror fastens its fearful hold on us struggle against it as we may mrs ellmother repeated what she had heard in spite of herself  it happened in the west indies she said and the writing of a woman slave was the writing in the little book the slave wrote about her mother her mother was a blacka witch in her own country there was a forest in her own country the devil taught her witchcraft in the forest the serpents and the wild beasts were afraid to touch her she lived without eating she was sold for a slave and sent to the islandan island in the west indies an old man lived there the wickedest man of them all he filled the black witch with devilish knowledge she learned to make the image of wax the image of wax casts spells you put pins in the image of wax at every pin you put the person under the spell gets nearer and nearer to death there was a poor black in the island he offended the witch she made his image in wax she cast spells on him he couldnt sleep he couldnt eat he was such a coward that common noises frightened him like me oh god like me  wait a little alban interposed you are exciting yourself againwait  youre wrong sir you think it ended when she finished her story and shut up her book theres worse to come than anything youve heard yet i dont know what i did to offend her she looked at me and spoke to me as if i was the dirt under her feet if youre too stupid to understand what i have been reading she says get up and go to the glass look at yourself and remember what happened to the slave who was under the spell youre getting paler and paler and thinner and thinner youre pining away just as he did shall i tell you why she snatched off the shade from the lamp and put her hand under the table and brought out an image of wax my image she pointed to three pins in it one she says for no sleep one for no appetite one for broken nerves i asked her what i had done to make such a bitter enemy of her she says remember what i asked of you when we talked of your being my servant choose which you will do die by inches i swear she said it as i hope to be saved die by inches or tell me  therein the full frenzy of the agitation that possessed herthere mrs ellmother suddenly stopped  albans first impression was that she might have fainted he looked closer and could just see her shadowy figure still seated in the chair he asked if she was ill no  then why dont you go on  i have done she answered  do you think you can put me off he rejoined sternly with such an excuse as that what did miss de sor ask you to tell her you promised to trust me be as good as your word  in the days of her health and strength she would have set him at defiance all she could do now was to appeal to his mercy  make some allowance for me she said i have been terribly upset what has become of my courage what has broken me down in this way spare me sir  he refused to listen this vile attempt to practice on your fears may be repeated he reminded her more cruel advantage may be taken of the nervous derangement from which you are suffering in the climate of this place you little know me if you think i will allow that to go on  she made a last effort to plead with him oh sir is this behaving like the good kind man i thought you were you say you are miss emilys friend dont press mefor miss emilys sake  emily alban exclaimed is she concerned in this  there was a change to tenderness in his voice which persuaded mrs ellmother that she had found her way to the weak side of him her one effort now was to strengthen the impression which she believed herself to have produced miss emily is concerned in it she confessed  in what way  never mind in what way  but i do mind  i tell you sir miss emily must never know it to her dying day  the first suspicion of the truth crossed albans mind  i understand you at last he said what miss emily must never knowis what miss de sor wanted you to tell her oh its useless to contradict me her motive in trying to frighten you is as plain to me now as if she had confessed it are you sure you didnt betray yourself when she showed the image of wax  i should have died first the reply had hardly escaped her before she regretted it what makes you want to be so sure about it she said it looks as if you knew  i do know  what  the kindest thing that he could do now was to speak out your secret is no secret to me he said  rage and fear shook her together for the moment she was like the mrs ellmother of former days you lie she cried  i speak the truth  i wont believe you i darent believe you  listen to me in emilys interests listen to me i have read of the murder at zeeland  thats nothing the man was a namesake of her father  the man was her father himself keep your seat there is nothing to be alarmed about i know that emily is ignorant of the horrid death that her father died i know that you and your late mistress have kept the discovery from her to this day i know the love and pity which plead your excuse for deceiving her and the circumstances that favored the deception my good creature emilys peace of mind is as sacred to me as it is to you i love her as i love my own lifeand better are you calmer now  he heard her crying it was the best relief that could come to her after waiting a while to let the tears have their way he helped her to rise there was no more to be said now the one thing to do was to take her back to the house  i can give you a word of advice he said before we part for the night you must leave miss de sors service at once your health will be a sufficient excuse give her warning immediately  mrs ellmother hung back when he offered her his arm the bare prospect of seeing francine again was revolting to her on albans assurance that the notice to leave could be given in writing she made no further resistance the village clock struck eleven as they ascended the terrace steps  a minute later another person left the grounds by the path which led to the house albans precaution had been taken too late the smell of tobaccosmoke had guided francine when she was at a loss which way to turn next in search of mrs ellmother for the last quarter of an hour she had been listening hidden among the trees     chapter xxxvi change of air  the inmates of netherwoods rose early and went to bed early when alban and mrs ellmother arrived at the back door of the house they found it locked  the only light visible along the whole length of the building glimmered through the venetian blind of the windowentrance to francines sittingroom alban proposed to get admission to the house by that way in her horror of again encountering francine mrs ellmother positively refused to follow him when he turned away from the door they cant be all asleep yet she saidand rang the bell  one person was still out of bedand that person was the mistress of the house they recognized her voice in the customary question whos there the door having been opened good miss ladd looked backward and forward between alban and mrs ellmother with the bewildered air of a lady who doubted the evidence of her own eyes the next moment her sense of humor overpowered her she burst out laughing  close the door mr morris she said and be so good as to tell me what this means have you been giving a lesson in drawing by starlight  mrs ellmother moved so that the light of the lamp in miss ladds hand fell on her face i am faint and giddy she said let me go to my bed  miss ladd instantly followed her pray forgive me i didnt see you were ill when i spoke she gently explained what can i do for you  thank you kindly maam i want nothing but peace and quiet i wish you goodnight  alban followed miss ladd to her study on the front side of the house he had just mentioned the circumstances under which he and mrs ellmother had met when they were interrupted by a tap at the door francine had got back to her room unperceived by way of the french window she now presented herself with an elaborate apology and with the nearest approach to a penitent expression of which her face was capable  i am ashamed miss ladd to intrude on you at this time of night my only excuse is that i am anxious about mrs ellmother i heard you just now in the hall if she is really ill i am the unfortunate cause of it  in what way miss de sor  i am sorry to say i frightened herwhile we were talking in my roomquite unintentionally she rushed to the door and ran out i supposed she had gone to her bedroom i had no idea she was in the grounds  in this false statement there was mingled a grain of truth it was true that francine believed mrs ellmother to have taken refuge in her roomfor she had examined the room finding it empty and failing to discover the fugitive in other parts of the house she had become alarmed and had tried the grounds nextwith the formidable result which has been already related concealing this circumstance she had lied in such a skillfully artless manner that alban having no suspicion of what had really happened to sharpen his wits was as completely deceived as miss ladd proceeding to further explanationand remembering that she was in albans presencefrancine was careful to keep herself within the strict limit of truth confessing that she had frightened her servant by a description of sorcery as it was practiced among the slaves on her fathers estate she only lied again in declaring that mrs ellmother had supposed she was in earnest when she was guilty of no more serious offense than playing a practical joke  in this case alban was necessarily in a position to detect the falsehood but it was so evidently in francines interests to present her conduct in the most favorable light that the discovery failed to excite his suspicion he waited in silence while miss ladd administered a severe reproof francine having left the room as penitently as she had entered it with her handkerchief over her tearless eyes he was at liberty with certain reserves to return to what had passed between mrs ellmother and himself  the fright which the poor old woman has suffered he said has led to one good result i have found her ready at last to acknowledge that she is ill and inclined to believe that the change to netherwoods has had something to do with it i have advised her to take the course which you suggested by leaving this house is it possible to dispense with the usual delay when she gives notice to leave miss de sors service  she need feel no anxiety poor soul on that account miss ladd replied in any case i had arranged that a weeks notice on either side should be enough as it is i will speak to francine myself the least she can do to express her regret is to place no difficulties in mrs ellmothers way  the next day was sunday  miss ladd broke through her rule of attending to secular affairs on week days only and after consulting with mrs ellmother arranged with francine that her servant should be at liberty to leave netherwoods health permitting on the next day but one difficulty remained mrs ellmother was in no condition to take the long journey to her birthplace in cumberland and her own lodgings in london had been let  under these circumstances what was the best arrangement that could be made for her miss ladd wisely and kindly wrote to emily on the subject and asked for a speedy reply  later in the day alban was sent for to see mrs ellmother he found her anxiously waiting to hear what had passed on the previous night between miss ladd and himself were you careful sir to say nothing about miss emily  i was especially careful i never alluded to her in any way  has miss de sor spoken to you  i have not given her the opportunity  shes an obstinate oneshe might try  if she does she shall hear my opinion of her in plain words the talk between them turned next on albans discovery of the secret of which mrs ellmother had believed herself to be the sole depositary since miss letitias death without alarming her by any needless allusion to doctor allday or to miss jethro he answered her inquiries so far as he was himself concerned without reserve her curiosity once satisfied she showed no disposition to pursue the topic she pointed to miss ladds cat fast asleep by the side of an empty saucer  is it a sin mr morris to wish i was tom he doesnt trouble himself about his life that is past or his life that is to come if i could only empty my saucer and go to sleep i shouldnt be thinking of the number of people in this world like myself who would be better out of it than in it miss ladd has got me my liberty tomorrow and i dont even know where to go when i leave this place  suppose you follow toms example alban suggested enjoy today in that comfortable chair and let tomorrow take care of itself  tomorrow arrived and justified albans system of philosophy emily answered miss ladds letter to excellent purpose by telegraph  i leave london today with cecilia the message announced for monksmoor park hants will mrs ellmother take care of the cottage in my absence i shall be away for a month at least all is prepared for her if she consents  mrs ellmother gladly accepted this proposal in the interval of emilys absence she could easily arrange to return to her own lodgings with words of sincere gratitude she took leave of miss ladd but no persuasion would induce her to say goodby to francine do me one more kindness maam dont tell miss de sor when i go away ignorant of the provocation which had produced this unforgiving temper of mind miss ladd gently remonstrated miss de sor received my reproof in a penitent spirit she expresses sincere sorrow for having thoughtlessly frightened you both yesterday and today she has made kind inquiries after your health come come dont bear malicewish her goodby mrs ellmothers answer was characteristic ill say goodby by telegraph when i get to london  her last words were addressed to alban if you can find a way of doing it sir keep those two apart  do you mean emily and miss de sor  yes  what are you afraid of  i dont know  is that quite reasonable mrs ellmother  i daresay not i only know that i am afraid  the pony chaise took her away albans class was not yet ready for him he waited on the terrace  innocent alike of all knowledge of the serious reason for fear which did really exist mrs ellmother and alban felt nevertheless the same vague distrust of an intimacy between the two girls idle vain malicious falseto know that francines character presented these faults without any discoverable merits to set against them was surely enough to justify a gloomy view of the prospect if she succeeded in winning the position of emilys friend alban reasoned it out logically in this waywithout satisfying himself and without accounting for the remembrance that haunted him of mrs ellmothers farewell look a commonplace man would say we are both in a morbid state of mind he thought and sometimes commonplace men turn out to be right  he was too deeply preoccupied to notice that he had advanced perilously near francines window she suddenly stepped out of her room and spoke to him  do you happen to know mr morris why mrs ellmother has gone away without bidding me goodby  she was probably afraid miss de sor that you might make her the victim of another joke  francine eyed him steadily have you any particular reason for speaking to me in that way  i am not aware that i have answered you rudelyif that is what you mean  that is not what i mean you seem to have taken a dislike to me i should be glad to know why  i dislike crueltyand you have behaved cruelly to mrs ellmother  meaning to be cruel francine inquired  you know as well as i do miss de sor that i cant answer that question  francine looked at him again am i to understand that we are enemies she asked  you are to understand he replied that a person whom miss ladd employs to help her in teaching cannot always presume to express his sentiments in speaking to the young ladies  if that means anything mr morris it means that we are enemies  it means miss de sor that i am the drawingmaster at this school and that i am called to my class  francine returned to her room relieved of the only doubt that had troubled her plainly no suspicion that she had overheard what passed between mrs ellmother and himself existed in albans mind as to the use to be made of her discovery she felt no difficulty in deciding to wait and be guided by events her curiosity and her selfesteem had been alike gratifiedshe had got the better of mrs ellmother at last and with that triumph she was content while emily remained her friend it would be an act of useless cruelty to disclose the terrible truth there had certainly been a coolness between them at brighton but francinestill influenced by the magnetic attraction which drew her to emilydid not conceal from herself that she had offered the provocation and had been therefore the person to blame i can set all that right she thought when we meet at monksmoor park she opened her desk and wrote the shortest and sweetest of letters to cecilia i am entirely at the disposal of my charming friend on any convenient daymay i add my dear the sooner the better     chapter xxxvii the lady wants you sir  the pupils of the drawingclass put away their pencils and colorboxes in high good humor the teachers vigilant eye for faults had failed him for the first time in their experience not one of them had been reproved they had chattered and giggled and drawn caricatures on the margin of the paper as freely as if the master had left the room albans wandering attention was indeed beyond the reach of control his interview with francine had doubled his sense of responsibility toward emilywhile he was further than ever from seeing how he could interfere to any useful purpose in his present position and with his reasons for writing under reserve  one of the servants addressed him as he was leaving the schoolroom the landladys boy was waiting in the hall with a message from his lodgings  now then what is it he asked irritably  the lady wants you sir with this mysterious answer the boy presented a visiting card the name inscribed on it wasmiss jethro  she had arrived by the train and she was then waiting at albans lodgings say i will be with her directly having given the message he stood for a while with his hat in his handliterally lost in astonishment it was simply impossible to guess at miss jethros object and yet with the usual perversity of human nature he was still wondering what she could possibly want with him up to the final moment when he opened the door of his sittingroom  she rose and bowed with the same grace of movement and the same wellbred composure of manner which doctor allday had noticed when she entered his consultingroom her dark melancholy eyes rested on alban with a look of gentle interest a faint flush of color animated for a moment the faded beauty of her facepassed away againand left it paler than before  i cannot conceal from myself she began that i am intruding on you under embarrassing circumstances  may i ask miss jethro to what circumstances you allude  you forget mr morris that i left miss ladds school in a manner which justified doubt of me in the minds of strangers  speaking as one of those strangers alban replied i cannot feel that i had any right to form an opinion on a matter which only concerned miss ladd and yourself  miss jethro bowed gravely you encourage me to hope she said i think you will place a favorable construction on my visit when i mention my motive i ask you to receive me in the interests of miss emily brown  stating her purpose in calling on him in those plain terms she added to the amazement which alban already felt by handing to himas if she was presenting an introductiona letter marked private addressed to her by doctor allday  i may tell you she premised that i had no idea of troubling you until doctor allday suggested it i wrote to him in the first instance and there is his reply pray read it  the letter was dated penzance and the doctor wrote as he spoke without ceremony   madamyour letter has been forwarded to me i am spending my autumn holiday in the far west of cornwall however if i had been at home it would have made no difference i should have begged leave to decline holding any further conversation with you on the subject of miss emily brown for the following reasons  in the first place though i cannot doubt your sincere interest in the young ladys welfare i dont like your mysterious way of showing it in the second place when i called at your address in london after you had left my house i found that you had taken to flight i place my own interpretation on this circumstance but as it is not founded on any knowledge of facts i merely allude to it and say no more  arrived at that point alban offered to return the letter do you really mean me to go on reading it he asked  yes she said quietly  alban returned to the letter  in the third place i have good reason to believe that you entered miss ladds school as a teacher under false pretenses after that discovery i tell you plainly i hesitate to attach credit to any statement that you may wish to make at the same time i must not permit my prejudices as you will probably call them to stand in the way of miss emilys interestssupposing them to be really depending on any interference of yours miss ladds drawingmaster mr alban morris is even more devoted to miss emilys service than i am whatever you might have said to me you can say to himwith this possible advantage that he may believe you  there the letter ended alban handed it back in silence  miss jethro pointed to the words mr alban morris is even more devoted to miss emilys service than i am  is that true she asked  quite true  i dont complain mr morris of the hard things said of me in that letter you are at liberty to suppose if you like that i deserve them attribute it to pride or attribute it to reluctance to make needless demands on your timei shall not attempt to defend myself i leave you to decide whether the woman who has shown you that letterhaving something important to say to youis a person who is mean enough to say it under false pretenses  tell me what i can do for you miss jethro and be assured beforehand that i dont doubt your sincerity  my purpose in coming here she answered is to induce you to use your influence over miss emily brown  with what object alban asked interrupting her  my object is her own good some years since i happened to become acquainted with a person who has attained some celebrity as a preacher you have perhaps heard of mr miles mirabel  i have heard of him  i have been in correspondence with him miss jethro proceeded he tells me he has been introduced to a young lady who was formerly one of miss ladds pupils and who is the daughter of mr wyvil of monksmoor park he has called on mr wyvil and he has since received an invitation to stay at mr wyvils house the day fixed for the visit is monday the fifth of next month  alban listenedat a loss to know what interest he was supposed to have in being made acquainted with mr mirabels engagements miss jethros next words enlightened him  you are perhaps aware she resumed that miss emily brown is miss wyvils intimate friend she will be one of the guests at monksmoor park if there are any obstacles which you can place in her wayif there is any influence which you can exert without exciting suspicion of your motiveprevent her i entreat you from accepting miss wyvils invitation until mr mirabels visit has come to an end  is there anything against mr mirabel he asked  i say nothing against him  is miss emily acquainted with him  no  is he a person with whom it would be disagreeable to her to associate  quite the contrary  and yet you expect me to prevent them from meeting be reasonable miss jethro  i can only be in earnest mr morrismore truly more deeply in earnest than you can suppose i declare to you that i am speaking in miss emilys interests do you still refuse to exert yourself for her sake  i am spared the pain of refusal alban answered the time for interference has gone by she is at this moment on her way to monksmoor park  miss jethro attempted to riseand dropped back into her chair water she said faintly after drinking from the glass to the last drop she began to revive her little travelingbag was on the floor at her side she took out a railway guide and tried to consult it her fingers trembled incessantly she was unable to find the page to which she wished to refer help me she said i must leave this placeby the first train that passes  to see emily alban asked  quite useless you have said it yourselfthe time for interference has gone by look at the guide  what place shall i look for  look for vale regis  alban found the place the train was due in ten minutes surely you are not fit to travel so soon he suggested  fit or not i must see mr mirabeli must make the effort to keep them apart by appealing to him  with any hope of success  with no hopeand with no interest in the man himself still i must try  out of anxiety for emilys welfare  out of anxiety for more than that  for what  if you cant guess i darent tell you  that strange reply startled alban before he could ask what it meant miss jethro had left him  in the emergencies of life a person readier of resource than alban morris it would not have been easy to discover the extraordinary interview that had now come to an end had found its limits bewildered and helpless he stood at the window of his room and asked himself as if he had been the weakest man living what shall i do     book the fourththe country house    chapter xxxviii dancing  the windows of the long drawingroom at monksmoor are all thrown open to the conservatory distant masses of plants and flowers mingled in evervarying forms of beauty are touched by the melancholy luster of the rising moon nearer to the house the restful shadows are disturbed at intervals where streams of light fall over them aslant from the lamps in the room the fountain is playing in rivalry with its lighter music the nightingales are singing their song of ecstasy sometimes the laughter of girls is heardand sometimes the melody of a waltz the younger guests at monksmoor are dancing  emily and cecilia are dressed alike in white with flowers in their hair francine rivals them by means of a gorgeous contrast of color and declares that she is rich with the bright emphasis of diamonds and the soft persuasion of pearls  miss plym from the rectory is fat and fair and prosperous she overflows with good spirits she has a waist which defies tightlacing and she dances joyously on large flat feet miss darnaway officers daughter with small means is the exact opposite of miss plym she is thin and tall and fadedpoor soul destiny has made it her hard lot in life to fill the place of headnursemaid at home in her pensive moments she thinks of the little brothers and sisters whose patient servant she is and wonders who comforts them in their tumbles and tells them stories at bedtime while she is holidaymaking at the pleasant country house  tenderhearted cecilia remembering how few pleasures this young friend has and knowing how well she dances never allows her to be without a partner there are three invaluable young gentlemen present who are excellent dancers members of different families they are nevertheless fearfully and wonderfully like each other they present the same rosy complexions and strawcolored mustachios the same plump cheeks vacant eyes and low forehead and they utter with the same stolid gravity the same imbecile small talk on sofas facing each other sit the two remaining guests who have not joined the elders at the cardtable in another room they are both men one of them is drowsy and middleagedhappy in the possession of large landed property happier still in a capacity for drinking mr wyvils famous portwine without gouty results  the other gentlemanah who is the other he is the confidential adviser and bosom friend of every young lady in the house is it necessary to name the reverend miles mirabel  there he sits enthroned with room for a fair admirer on either side of himthe clerical sultan of a platonic harem his persuasive ministry is felt as well as heard he has an innocent habit of fondling young persons one of his arms is even long enough to embrace the circumference of miss plymwhile the other clasps the rigid silken waist of francine i do it everywhere else he says innocently why not here why not indeedwith that delicate complexion and those beautiful blue eyes with the glorious golden hair that rests on his shoulders and the glossy beard that flows over his breast familiarities forbidden to mere men become privileges and condescensions when an angel enters societyand more especially when that angel has enough of mortality in him to be amusing mr mirabel on his social side is an irresistible companion he is cheerfulness itself he takes a favorable view of everything his sweet temper never differs with anybody in my humble way he confesses i like to make the world about me brighter laughter harmlessly produced observe is the element in which he lives and breathes miss darnaways serious face puts him out he has laid a bet with emilynot in money not even in gloves only in flowersthat he will make miss darnaway laugh and he has won the wager emilys flowers are in his buttonhole peeping through the curly interstices of his beard must you leave me he asks tenderly when there is a dancing man at liberty and it is francines turn to claim him she leaves her seat not very willingly for a while the place is vacant miss plym seizes the opportunity of consulting the ladies bosom friend  dear mr mirabel do tell me what you think of miss de sor  dear mr mirabel bursts into enthusiasm and makes a charming reply his large experience of young ladies warns him that they will tell each other what he thinks of them when they retire for the night and he is careful on these occasions to say something that will bear repetition  i see in miss de sor he declares the resolution of a man tempered by the sweetness of a woman when that interesting creature marries her husband will beshall i use the vulgar wordhenpecked dear miss plym he will enjoy it and he will be quite right too and if i am asked to the wedding i shall say with heartfelt sincerity enviable man  in the height of her admiration for mr mirabels wonderful eye for character miss plym is called away to the piano cecilia succeeds to her friends placeand has her waist taken in charge as a matter of course  how do you like miss plym she asks directly  mr mirabel smiles and shows the prettiest little pearly teeth i was just thinking of her he confesses pleasantly miss plym is so nice and plump so comforting and domesticsuch a perfect clergymans daughter you love her dont you is she engaged to be married in that casebetween ourselves dear miss wyvil a clergyman is obliged to be cautiousi may own that i love her too  delicious titillations of flattered selfesteem betray themselves in cecilias lovely complexion she is the chosen confidante of this irresistible man and she would like to express her sense of obligation but mr mirabel is a master in the art of putting the right words in the right places and simple cecilia distrusts herself and her grammar  at that moment of embarrassment a friend leaves the dance and helps cecilia out of the difficulty  emily approaches the sofathrone breathlessfollowed by her partner entreating her to give him one turn more she is not to be tempted she means to rest cecilia sees an act of mercy suggested by the presence of the disengaged young man she seizes his arm and hurries him off to poor miss darnaway sitting forlorn in a corner and thinking of the nursery at home in the meanwhile a circumstance occurs mr mirabels allembracing arm shows itself in a new character when emily sits by his side  it becomes for the first time an irresolute arm it advances a littleand hesitates emily at once administers an unexpected check she insists on preserving a free waist in her own outspoken language no mr mirabel keep that for the others you cant imagine how ridiculous you and the young ladies look and how absurdly unaware of it you all seem to be for the first time in his life the reverend and readywitted man of the world is at a loss for an answer why  for this simple reason he too has felt the magnetic attraction of the irresistible little creature whom every one likes miss jethro has been doubly defeated she has failed to keep them apart and her unexplained misgivings have not been justified by events emily and mr mirabel are good friends already the brilliant clergyman is poor his interests in life point to a marriage for money he has fascinated the heiresses of two rich fathers mr tyvil and mr de sorand yet he is conscious of an influence an alien influence without a balance at its bankers which has in some mysterious way got between him and his interests  on emilys side the attraction felt is of another nature altogether among the merry young people at monksmoor she is her old happy self again and she finds in mr mirabel the most agreeable and amusing man whom she has ever met after those dismal night watches by the bed of her dying aunt and the dreary weeks of solitude that followed to live in this new world of luxury and gayety is like escaping from the darkness of night and basking in the fall brightn ess of day cecilia declares that she looks once more like the joyous queen of the bedroom in the bygone time at school and francine profaning shakespeare without knowing it says emily is herself again  now that your arm is in its right place reverend sir she gayly resumes i may admit that there are exceptions to all rules my waist is at your disposal in a case of necessitythat is to say in a case of waltzing  the one case of all others mirabel answers with the engaging frankness that has won him so many friends which can never happen in my unhappy experience waltzing i blush to own it means picking me up off the floor and putting smelling salts to my nostrils in other words dear miss emily it is the room that waltzesnot i i cant look at those whirling couples there with a steady head even the exquisite figure of our young hostess when it describes flying circles turns me giddy  hearing this allusion to cecilia emily drops to the level of the other girls she too pays her homage to the pope of private life you promised me your unbiased opinion of cecilia she reminds him and you havent given it yet  the ladies friend gently remonstrates miss wyvils beauty dazzles me how can i give an unbiased opinion besides i am not thinking of her i can only think of you  emily lifts her eyes half merrily half tenderly and looks at him over the top of her fan it is her first effort at flirtation she is tempted to engage in the most interesting of all games to a girlthe game which plays at making love what has cecilia told her in those bedroom gossipings dear to the hearts of the two friends cecilia has whispered mr mirabel admires your figure he calls you the venus of milo in a state of perfect abridgment where is the daughter of eve who would not have been flattered by that pretty complimentwho would not have talked soft nonsense in return you can only think of me emily repeats coquettishly have you said that to the last young lady who occupied my place and will you say it again to the next who follows me  not to one of them mere compliments are for the othersnot for you  what is for me mr mirabel  what i have just offered youa confession of the truth  emily is startled by the tone in which he replies he seems to be in earnest not a vestige is left of the easy gayety of his manner his face shows an expression of anxiety which she has never seen in it yet do you believe me he asks in a whisper  she tries to change the subject  when am i to hear you preach mr mirabel  he persists when you believe me he says  his eyes add an emphasis to that reply which is not to be mistaken emily turns away from him and notices francine she has left the dance and is looking with marked attention at emily and mirabel i want to speak to you she says and beckons impatiently to emily  mirabel whispers dont go  emily rises neverthelessready to avail herself of the first excuse for leaving him francine meets her half way and takes her roughly by the arm  what is it emily asks  suppose you leave off flirting with mr mirabel and make yourself of some use  in what way  use your earsand look at that girl  she points disdainfully to innocent miss plym the rectors daughter possesses all the virtues with one exceptionthe virtue of having an ear for music when she sings she is out of tune and when she plays she murders time  who can dance to such music as that says francine finish the waltz for her  emily naturally hesitates how can i take her place unless she asks me  francine laughs scornfully say at once you want to go back to mr mirabel  do you think i should have got up when you beckoned to me emily rejoins if i had not wanted to get away from mr mirabel  instead of resenting this sharp retort francine suddenly breaks into good humor come along you little spitfire ill manage it for you  she leads emily to the piano and stops miss plym without a word of apology its your turn to dance now heres miss brown waiting to relieve you  cecilia has not been unobservant in her own quiet way of what has been going on waiting until francine and miss plym are out of hearing she bends over emily and says my dear i really do think francine is in love with mr mirabel  after having only been a week in the same house with him emily exclaims  at any rate said cecilia more smartly than usual she is jealous of you     chapter xxxix feigning  the next morning mr mirabel took two members of the circle at monksmoor by surprise one of them was emily and one of them was the master of the house  seeing emily alone in the garden before breakfast he left his room and joined her let me say one word he pleaded before we go to breakfast i am grieved to think that i was so unfortunate as to offend you last night  emilys look of astonishment answered for her before she could speak what can i have said or done she asked to make you think that  now i breathe again he cried with the boyish gayety of manner which was one of the secrets of his popularity among women i really feared that i had spoken thoughtlessly it is a terrible confession for a clergyman to makebut it is not the less true that i am one of the most indiscreet men living it is my rock ahead in life that i say the first thing which comes uppermost without stopping to think being well aware of my own defects i naturally distrust myself  even in the pulpit emily inquired  he laughed with the readiest appreciation of the satirealthough it was directed against himself  i like that question he said it tells me we are as good friends again as ever the fact is the sight of the congregation when i get into the pulpit has the same effect upon me that the sight of the footlights has on an actor all oratory though my clerical brethren are shy of confessing it is actingwithout the scenery and the costumes did you really mean it last night when you said you would like to hear me preach  indeed i did  how very kind of you i dont think myself the sermon is worth the sacrifice there is another specimen of my indiscreet way of talking what i mean is that you will have to get up early on sunday morning and drive twelve miles to the damp and dismal little village in which i officiate for a man with a rich wife who likes the climate of italy my congregation works in the fields all the week and naturally enough goes to sleep in church on sunday i have had to counteract that not by preaching i wouldnt puzzle the poor people with my eloquence for the world no no i tell them little stories out of the biblein a nice easy gossiping way a quarter of an hour is my limit of time and i am proud to say some of them mostly the women do to a certain extent keep awake if you and the other ladies decide to honor me it is needless to say you shall have one of my grand efforts what will be the effect on my unfortunate flock remains to be seen i will have the church brushed up and luncheon of course at the parsonage beans bacon and beeri havent got anything else in the house are you rich i hope not  i suspect i am quite as poor as you are mr mirabel  i am delighted to hear it more of my indiscretion our poverty is another bond between us  before he could enlarge on this text the breakfast bell rang  he gave emily his arm quite satisfied with the result of the mornings talk in speaking seriously to her on the previous night he had committed the mistake of speaking too soon to amend this false step and to recover his position in emilys estimation had been his object in viewand it had been successfully accomplished at the breakfasttable that morning the companionable clergyman was more amusing than ever  the meal being over the company dispersed as usualwith the one exception of mirabel without any apparent reason he kept his place at the table mr wyvil the most courteous and considerate of men felt it an attention due to his guest not to leave the room first all that he could venture to do was to give a little hint have you any plans for the morning he asked  i have a plan that depends entirely on yourself mirabel answered and i am afraid of being as indiscreet as usual if i mention it your charming daughter tells me you play on the violin  modest mr wyvil looked confused i hope you have not been annoyed he said i practice in a distant room so that nobody may hear me  my dear sir i am eager to hear you music is my passion and the violin is my favorite instrument  mr wyvil led the way to his room positively blushing with pleasure since the death of his wife he had been sadly in want of a little encouragement his daughters and his friends were carefulovercareful as he thoughtof intruding on him in his hours of practice and sad to say his daughters and his friends were from a musical point of view perfectly right  literature has hardly paid sufficient attention to a social phenomenon of a singularly perplexing kind we hear enough and more than enough of persons who successfully cultivate the artsof the remarkable manner in which fitness for their vocation shows itself in early life of the obstacles which family prejudice places in their way and of the unremitting devotion which has led to the achievement of glorious results  but how many writers have noticed those other incomprehensible persons members of families innocent for generations past of practicing art or caring for art who have notwithstanding displayed from their earliest years the irresistible desire to cultivate poetry painting or music who have surmounted obstacles and endured disappointments in the singlehearted resolution to devote their lives to an intellectual pursuitbeing absolutely without the capacity which proves the vocation and justifies the sacrifice here is nature unerring nature presented in flat contradiction with herself here are men bent on performing feats of running without having legs and women hopelessly barren living in constant expectation of large families to the end of their days the musician is not to be found more completely deprived than mr wyvil of natural capacity for playing on an instrumentand for twenty years past it had been the pride and delight of his heart to let no day of his life go by without practicing on the violin  i am sure i must be tiring you he said politelyafter having played without mercy for an hour and more  no the insatiable amateur had his own purpose to gain and was not exhausted yet mr wyvil got up to look for some more music in that interval desultory conversation naturally took place mirabel contrived to give it the necessary directionthe direction of emily  the most delightful girl i have met with for many a long year past mr wyvil declared warmly i dont wonder at my daughter being so fond of her she leads a solitary life at home poor thing and i am honestly glad to see her spirits reviving in my house  an only child mirabel asked  in the necessary explanation that followed emilys isolated position in the world was revealed in few words but one more discoverythe most important of allremained to be made had she used a figure of speech in saying that she was as poor as mirabel himself or had she told him the shocking truth he put the question with perfect delicacybut with unerring directness as well  mr wyvil quoting his daughters authority described emilys income as falling short even of two hundred a year having made that disheartening reply he opened another music book you know this sonata of course he said the next moment the violin was under his chin and the performance began  while mirabel was to all appearance listening with the utmost attention he was actually endeavoring to reconcile himself to a serious sacrifice of his own inclinations if he remained much longer in the same house with emily the impression that she had produced on him would be certainly strengthenedand he would be guilty of the folly of making an offer of marriage to a woman who was as poor as himself the one remedy that could be trusted to preserve him from such infatuation as this was absence at the end of the week he had arranged to return to vale regis for his sunday duty engaging to join his friends again at monksmoor on the monday following that rash promise there could be no further doubt about it must not be fulfilled  he had arrived at this resolution when the terrible activity of mr wyvils bow was suspended by the appearance of a third person in the room  cecilias maid was charged with a neat little threecornered note from her young lady to be presented to her master wondering why his daughter should write to him mr wyvil opened the note and was informed of cecilias motive in these words  dearest papai hear mr mirabel is with you and as this is a secret i must write emily has received a very strange letter this morning which puzzles her and alarms me when you are quite at liberty we shall be so much obliged if you will tell us how emily ought to answer it  mr wyvil stopped mirabel on the point of trying to escape from the music a little domestic matter to attend to he said but we will finish the sonata first     chapter xl consulting  out of the music room and away from his violin the sound side of mr wyvils character was free to assert itself in his public and in his private capacity he was an eminently sensible man  as a member of parliament he set an example which might have been followed with advantage by many of his colleagues in the first place he abstained from hastening the downfall of representative institutions by asking questions and making speeches in the second place he was able to distinguish between the duty that he owed to his party and the duty that he owed to his country when the legislature acted politicallythat is to say when it dealt with foreign complications or electoral reformshe followed his leader when the legislature acted sociallythat is to say for the good of the peoplehe followed his conscience on the last occasion when the great russian bugbear provoked a division he voted submissively with his conservative allies but when the question of opening museums and picture galleries on sundays arrayed the two parties in hostile camps he broke into open mutiny and went over to the liberals he consented to help in preventing an extension of the franchise but he refused to be concerned in obstructing the repeal of taxes on knowledge i am doubtful in the first case he said but i am sure in the second he was asked for an explanation doubtful of what and sure of what to the astonishment of his leader he answered the benefit to the people the same sound sense appeared in the transactions of his private life lazy and dishonest servants found that the gentlest of masters had a side to his character which took them by surprise and on certain occasions in the experience of cecilia and her sister the most indulgent of fathers proved to be as capable of saying no as the sternest tyrant who ever ruled a fireside  called into council by his daughter and his guest mr wyvil assisted them by advice which was equally wise and kindbut which afterward proved under the perverse influence of circumstances to be advice that he had better not have given  the letter to emily which cecilia had recommended to her fathers consideration had come from netherwoods and had been written by alban morris  he assured emily that he had only decided on writing to her after some hesitation in the hope of serving interests which he did not himself understand but which might prove to be interests worthy of consideration nevertheless having stated his motive in these terms he proceeded to relate what had passed between miss jethro and himself on the subject of francine alban only ventured to add that she had not produced a favorable impression on him and that he could not think her likely on further experience to prove a desirable friend  on the last leaf were added some lines which emily was at no loss how to answer she had folded back the page so that no eyes but her own should see how the poor drawingmaster finished his letter i wish you all possible happiness my dear among your new friends but dont forget the old friend who thinks of you and dreams of you and longs to see you again the little world i live in is a dreary world emily in your absence will you write to me now and then and encourage me to hope  mr wyvil smiled as he looked at the folded page which hid the signature  i suppose i may take it for granted he said slyly that this gentleman really has your interests at heart may i know who he is  emily answered the last question readily enough mr wyvil went on with his inquiries about the mysterious lady with the strange name he proceededdo you know anything of her  emily related what she knew without revealing the true reason for miss jethros departure from netherwoods in after years it was one of her most treasured remembrances that she had kept secret the melancholy confession which had startled her on the last night of her life at school  mr wyvil looked at albans letter again do you know how miss jethro became acquainted with mr mirabel he asked  i didnt even know that they were acquainted  do you think it likelyif mr morris had been talking to you instead of writing to youthat he might have said more than he has said in his letter  cecilia had hitherto remained a model of discretion seeing emily hesitate temptation overcame her not a doubt of it papa she declared confidently  is cecilia right mr wyvil inquired  reminded in this way of her influence over alban emily could only make one honest reply she admitted that cecilia was right  mr wyvil thereupon advised her not to express any opinion until she was in a better position to judge for herself when you write to mr morris he continued say that you will wait to tell him what you think of miss jethro until you see him again  i have no prospect at present of seeing him again emily said  you can see mr morris whenever it suits him to come here mr wyvil replied i will write and ask him to visit us and you can inclose the invitation in your letter  oh mr wyvil how good of you  oh papa the very thing i was going to ask you to do  the excellent master of monksmoor looked unaffectedly surprised what are you two young ladies making a fuss about he said mr morris is a gentleman by profession andmay i venture to say it miss emilya valued friend of yours as well who has a better claim to be one of my guests  cecilia stopped her father as he was about to leave the room i suppose we mustnt ask mr mirabel what he knows of miss jethro she said  my dear what can you be thinking of what right have we to question mr mirabel about miss jethro  its so very unsatisfactory papa there must be some reason why emily and mr mirabel ought not to meetor why should miss jethro have been so very earnest about it  miss jethro doesnt intend us to know why cecilia it will perhaps come out in time wait for time  left together the girls discussed the course which alban would probably take on receiving mr wyvils invitation  he will only be too glad cecilia asserted to have the opportunity of seeing you again  i doubt whether he will care about seeing me again among strangers emily replied and you forget that there are obstacles in his way how is he to leave his class  quite easily his class doesnt meet on the saturday halfholiday he can be here if he starts early in time for luncheon and he can stay till monday or tuesday  who is to take his place at the school  miss ladd to be sureif you make a point of it write to her as well as to mr morris  the letters being writtenand the order having been given to prepare a room for the expected guestemily and cecilia returned to the drawingroom they found the elders of the party variously engagedthe men with newspapers and the ladies with work entering the conservatory next they discovered cecilias sister languishing among the flowers in an easy chair constitutional laziness in some young ladies assumes an invalid character and presents the interesting spectacle of perpetual convalescence the doctor declared that the baths at st moritz had cured miss julia miss julia declined to agree with the doctor  come into the garden with emily and me cecilia said  emily and you dont know what it is to be ill julia answered  the two girls left her and joined the young people who were amusing themselves in the garden francine had taken possession of mirabel and had condemned him to hard labor in swinging her he made an attempt to get away when emily and cecilia approached and was peremptorily recalled to his duty higher cried miss de sor in her hardest tones of authority i want to swing higher than anybody else mirabel submitted with gentlemanlike resignation and was rewarded by tender encouragement expressed in a look  do you see that cecilia whispered he knows how rich she isi wonder whether he will marry her  emily smiled i doubt it while he is in this house she said you are as rich as francineand dont forget that you have other attractions as well  cecilia shook her head mr mirabel is very nice she admitted but i wouldnt marry him would you  emily secretly compared alban with mirabel not for the world she answered  the next day was the day of mirabels departure his admirers among the ladies followed him out to the door at which mr wyvils carriage was waiting francine threw a nosegay after the departing guest as he got in mind you come back to us on monday she said mirabel bowed and thanked her but his last look was for emily standing apart from the others at the top of the steps francine said nothing her lips closed convulsivelyshe turned suddenly pale     chapter xli speechifying  on the monday a plowboy from vale regis arrived at monksmoor  in respect of himself he was a person beneath notice in respect of his errand he was sufficiently important to cast a gloom over the household the faithless mirabel had broken his engagement and the plowboy was the herald of misfortune who brought his apology to his great disappointment he wrote he was detained by the affairs of his parish he could only trust to mr wyvils indulgence to excuse him and to communicate his sincere sense of regret on scented note paper to the ladies  everybody believed in the affairs of the parishwith the exception of francine mr mirabel has made the best excuse he could think of for shortening his visit and i dont wonder at it she said looking significantly at emily  emily was playing with one of the dogs exercising him in the tricks which he had learned she balanced a morsel of sugar on his noseand had no attention to spare for francine  cecilia as the mistress of the house felt it her duty to interfere that is a strange remark to make she answered do you mean to say that we have driven mr mirabel away from us  i accuse nobody francine began with spiteful candor  now shes going to accuse everybody emily interposed addressing herself facetiously to the dog  but when girls are bent on fascinating men whether they like it or not francine proceeded men have only one alternativethey must keep out of the way she looked again at emily more pointedly than ever  even gentle cecilia resented this whom do you refer to she said sharply  my dear emily remonstrated need you ask she glanced at francine as she spoke and then gave the dog his signal he tossed up the sugar and caught it in his mouth his audience applauded himand so for that time the skirmish ended  among the letters of the next mornings delivery arrived albans reply emilys anticipations proved to be correct the drawingmasters du ties would not permit him to leave netherwoods and he like mirabel sent his apologies his short letter to emily contained no further allusion to miss jethro it began and ended on the first page  had he been disappointed by the tone of reserve in which emily had written to him under mr wyvils advice or as cecilia suggested had his detention at the school so bitterly disappointed him that he was too disheartened to write at any length emily made no attempt to arrive at a conclusion either one way or the other she seemed to be in depressed spirits and she spoke superstitiously for the first time in cecilias experience of her  i dont like this reappearance of miss jethro she said if the mystery about that woman is ever cleared up it will bring trouble and sorrow to meand i believe in his own secret heart alban morris thinks so too  write and ask him cecilia suggested  he is so kind and so unwilling to distress me emily answered that he wouldnt acknowledge it even if i am right  in the middle of the week the course of private life at monksmoor suffered an interruptiondue to the parliamentary position of the master of the house  the insatiable appetite for making and hearing speeches which represents one of the marked peculiarities of the english race including their cousins in the united states had seized on mr wyvils constituents there was to be a political meeting at the market hall in the neighboring town and the member was expected to make an oration passing in review contemporary events at home and abroad pray dont think of accompanying me the good man said to his guests the hall is badly ventilated and the speeches including my own will not be worth hearing  this humane warning was ungratefully disregarded the gentlemen were all interested in the objects of the meeting and the ladies were firm in the resolution not to be left at home by themselves they dressed with a view to the large assembly of spectators before whom they were about to appear and they outtalked the men on political subjects all the way to the town  the most delightful of surprises was in store for them when they reached the market hall among the crowd of ordinary gentlemen waiting under the portico until the proceedings began appeared one person of distinction whose title was reverend and whose name was mirabel  francine was the first to discover him she darted up the steps and held out her hand  this is a pleasure she cried have you come here to see she was about to say me but observing the strangers round her altered the word to us please give me your arm she whispered before her young friends had arrived within hearing i am so frightened in a crowd  she held fast by mirabel and kept a jealous watch on him was it only her fancy or did she detect a new charm in his smile when he spoke to emily  before it was possible to decide the time for the meeting had arrived mr wyvils friends were of course accommodated with seats on the platform francine still insisting on her claim to mirabels arm got a chair next to him as she seated herself she left him free for a moment in that moment the infatuated man took an empty chair on the other side of him and placed it for emily he communicated to that hated rival the information which he ought to have reserved for francine the committee insist he said on my proposing one of the resolutions i promise not to bore you mine shall be the shortest speech delivered at the meeting  the proceedings began  among the earlier speakers not one was inspired by a feeling of mercy for the audience the chairman reveled in words the mover and seconder of the first resolution not having so much as the ghost of an idea to trouble either of them poured out language in flowing and overflowing streams like water from a perpetual spring the heat exhaled by the crowded audience was already becoming insufferable cries of sit down assailed the orator of the moment the chairman was obliged to interfere a man at the back of the hall roared out ventilation and broke a window with his stick he was rewarded with three rounds of cheers and was ironically invited to mount the platform and take the chair  under these embarrassing circumstances mirabel rose to speak  he secured silence at the outset by a humorous allusion to the prolix speaker who had preceded him look at the clock gentlemen he said and limit my speech to an interval of ten minutes the applause which followed was heard through the broken window in the street the boys among the mob outside intercepted the flow of air by climbing on each others shoulders and looking in at the meeting through the gaps left by the shattered glass having proposed his resolution with discreet brevity of speech mirabel courted popularity on the plan adopted by the late lord palmerston in the house of commonshe told stories and made jokes adapted to the intelligence of the dullest people who were listening to him the charm of his voice and manner completed his success punctually at the tenth minute he sat down amid cries of go on francine was the first to take his hand and to express admiration mutely by pressing it he returned the pressurebut he looked at the wrong ladythe lady on the other side  although she made no complaint he instantly saw that emily was overcome by the heat her lips were white and her eyes were closing let me take you out he said or you will faint  francine started to her feet to follow them the lower order of the audience eager for amusement put their own humorous construction on the young ladys action they roared with laughter let the parson and his sweetheart be they called out twos company miss and three isnt mr wyvil interposed his authority and rebuked them a lady seated behind francine interfered to good purpose by giving her a chair which placed her out of sight of the audience order was restoredand the proceedings were resumed  on the conclusion of the meeting mirabel and emily were found waiting for their friends at the door mr wyvil innocently added fuel to the fire that was burning in francine he insisted that mirabel should return to monksmoor and offered him a seat in the carriage at emilys side  later in the evening when they all met at dinner there appeared a change in miss de sor which surprised everybody but mirabel she was gay and goodhumored and especially amiable and attentive to emilywho sat opposite to her at the table what did you and mr mirabel talk about while you were away from us she asked innocently politics  emily readily adopted francines friendly tone would you have talked politics in my place she asked gayly  in your place i should have had the most delightful of companions francine rejoined i wish i had been overcome by the heat too  mirabelattentively observing heracknowledged the compliment by a bow and left emily to continue the conversation in perfect good faith she owned to having led mirabel to talk of himself she had heard from cecilia that his early life had been devoted to various occupations and she was interested in knowing how circumstances had led him into devoting himself to the church francine listened with the outward appearance of implicit belief and with the inward conviction that emily was deliberately deceiving her when the little narrative was at an end she was more agreeable than ever she admired emilys dress and she rivaled cecilia in enjoyment of the good things on the table she entertained mirabel with humorous anecdotes of the priests at st domingo and was so interested in the manufacture of violins ancient and modern that mr wyvil promised to show her his famous collection of instruments after dinner her overflowing amiability included even poor miss darnaway and the absent brothers and sisters she heard with flattering sympathy how they had been ill and had got well again what amusing tricks they played what alarming accidents happened to them and how remarkably clever they wereincluding i do assure you dear miss de sor the baby only ten months old when the ladies rose to retire francine was socially speaking the heroine of the evening  while the violins were in course of exhibition mirabel found an opportunity of speaking to emily unobserved  have you said or done anything to offend miss de sor he asked  nothing whatever emily declared startled by the question what makes you think i have offended her  i have been trying to find a reason for the change in her mirabel answeredespecially the change toward yourself  well  wellshe means mischief  mischief of what sort  of a sort which may expose her to discoveryunless she disarms suspicion at the outset that is as i believe exactly what she has been doing this evening i neednt warn you to be on your guard  all the next day emily was on the watch for eventsand nothing happened not the slightest appearance of jealousy betrayed itself in francine she made no attempt to attract to herself the attentions of mirabel and she showed no hostility to emily either by word look or manner    the day after an event occurred at netherwoods alban morris received an anonymous letter addressed to him in these terms  a certain young lady in whom you are supposed to be interested is forgetting you in your absence if you are not mean enough to allow yourself to be supplanted by another man join the party at monksmoor before it is too late     chapter xlii cooking  the day after the political meeting was a day of departures at the pleasant country house  miss darnaway was recalled to the nursery at home the old squire who did justice to mr wyvils portwine went away next having guests to entertain at his own house a far more serious loss followed the three dancing men had engagements which drew them to new spheres of activity in other drawingrooms they said with the same dreary grace of manner very sorry to go they drove to the railway arrayed in the same perfect traveling suits of neutral tint and they had but one difference of opinion among themeach firmly believed that he was smoking the best cigar to be got in london  the morning after these departures would have been a dull morning indeed but for the presence of mirabel  when breakfast was over the invalid miss julia established herself on the sofa with a novel her father retired to the other end of the house and profaned the art of music on musics most expressive instrument left with emily cecilia and francine mirabel made one of his happy suggestions we are thrown on our own resources he said let us distinguish ourselves by inventing some entirely new amusement for the day you young ladies shall sit in counciland i will be secretary he turned to cecilia the meeting waits to hear the mistress of the house  modest cecilia appealed to her school friends for help addressing herself in the first instance by the secretarys advice to francine as the eldest they all noticed another change in this variable young person she was silent and subdued and she said wearily i dont care what we doshall we go out riding  the unanswerable objection to riding as a form of amusement was that it had been more than once tried already something clever and surprising was anticipated from emily when it came to her turn she too disappointed expectation let us sit under the trees was all that she could suggest and ask mr mirabel to tell us a story  mirabel laid down his pen and took it on himself to reject this proposal remember he remonstrated that i have an interest in the diversions of the day you cant expect me to be amused by my own story i appeal to miss wyvil to invent a pleasure which will include the secretary  cecilia blushed and looked uneasy i think i have got an idea she announced after some hesitation may i propose that we all go to the keepers lodge there her courage failed her and she hesitated again  mirabel gravely registered the proposal as far as it went what are we to do when we get to the keepers lodge he inquired  we are to ask the keepers wife cecilia proceeded to lend us her kitchen  to lend us her kitchen mirabel repeated  and what are we to do in the kitchen  cecilia looked down at her pretty hands crossed on her lap and answered softly cook our own luncheon  here was an entirely new amusement in the most attractive sense of the words here was charming cecilias interest in the pleasures of the table so happily inspired that the grateful meeting offered its tribute of applauseeven including francine the members of the council were young their daring digestions contemplated without fear the prospect of eating their own amateur cookery the one question that troubled them now was what they were to cook  i can make an omelet cecilia ventured to say  if there is any cold chicken to be had emily added i undertake to follow the omelet with a mayonnaise  there are clergymen in the church of england who are even clever enough to fry potatoes mirabel announcedand i am one of them what shall we have next a pudding miss de sor can you make a pudding  francine exhibited another new side to her charactera diffident and humble side i am ashamed to say i dont know how to cook anything she confessed you had better leave me out of it  but cecilia was now in her element her plan of operations was wide enough even to include francine you shall wash the lettuce my dear and stone the olives for emilys mayonnaise dont be discouraged you shall have a companion we will send to the rectory for miss plymthe very person to chop parsley and shallot for my omelet oh emily what a morning we are going to have her lovely blue eyes sparkled with joy she gave emily a kiss which mirabel must have been more or less than man not to have coveted i declare cried cecilia completely losing her head im so excited i dont know what to do with myself  emilys intimate knowledge of her friend applied the right remedy you dont know what to do with yourself she repeated have you no sense of duty give the cook your orders  cecilia instantly recovered her presence of mind she sat down at the writingtable and made out a list of eatable productions in the animal and vegetable world in which every other word was underlined two or three times over her serious face was a sight to see when she rang for the cook and the two held a privy council in a corner  on the way to the keepers lodge the young mistress of the house headed a procession of servants carrying the raw materials francine followed held in custody by miss plymwho took her responsibilities seriously and clamored for instruction in the art of chopping parsley mirabel and emily were together far behind they were the only two members of the company whose minds were not occupied in one way or another by the kitchen  this childs play of ours doesnt seem to interest you mirabel remarked  i am thinking emily answered of what you said to me about francine  i can say something more he rejoined when i noticed the change in her at dinner i told you she meant mischief there is another change today which suggests to my mind that the mischief is done  and directed against me emily asked  mirabel made no direct reply it was impossible for him to remind her that she had no matter how innocently exposed herself to the jealous hatred of francine time will tell us what we dont know now he replied evasively  you seem to have faith in time mr mirabel  the greatest faith time is the inveterate enemy of deceit sooner or later every hidden thing is a thing doomed to discovery  without exception  yes he answered positively without exception  at that moment francine stopped and looked back at them did she think that emily and mirabel had been talking together long enough miss plymwith the parsley still on her mindadvanced to consult emil ys experience the two walked on together leaving mirabel to overtake francine he saw in her first look at him the effort that it cost her to suppress those emotions which the pride of women is most deeply interested in concealing before a word had passed he regretted that emily had left them together  i wish i had your cheerful disposition she began abruptly i am out of spirits or out of temperi dont know which and i dont know why do you ever trouble yourself with thinking of the future  as seldom as possible miss de sor in such a situation as mine most people have prospectsi have none  he spoke gravely conscious of not feeling at ease on his side if he had been the most modest man that ever lived he must have seen in francines face that she loved him  when they had first been presented to each other she was still under the influence of the meanest instincts in her scheming and selfish nature she had thought to herself with my money to help him that mans celebrity would do the rest the best society in england would be glad to receive mirabels wife as the days passed strong feeling had taken the place of those contemptible aspirations mirabel had unconsciously inspired the one passion which was powerful enough to master francinesensual passion wild hopes rioted in her measureless desires which she had never felt before united themselves with capacities for wickedness which had been the horrid growth of a few nightscapacities which suggested even viler attempts to rid herself of a supposed rivalry than slandering emily by means of an anonymous letter without waiting for it to be offered she took mirabels arm and pressed it to her breast as they slowly walked on the fear of discovery which had troubled her after she had sent her base letter to the post vanished at that inspiriting moment she bent her head near enough to him when he spoke to feel his breath on her face  there is a strange similarity she said softly between your position and mine is there anything cheering in my prospects i am far away from homemy father and mother wouldnt care if they never saw me again people talk about my money what is the use of money to such a lonely wretch as i am suppose i write to london and ask the lawyer if i may give it all away to some deserving person why not to you  my dear miss de sor  is there anything wrong mr mirabel in wishing that i could make you a prosperous man  you must not even talk of such a thing  how proud you are she said submissively  oh i cant bear to think of you in that miserable villagea position so unworthy of your talents and your claims and you tell me i must not talk about it would you have said that to emily if she was as anxious as i am to see you in your right place in the world  i should have answered her exactly as i have answered you  she will never embarrass you mr mirabel by being as sincere as i am emily can keep her own secrets  is she to blame for doing that  it depends on your feeling for her  what feeling do you mean  suppose you heard she was engaged to be married francine suggested  mirabels mannerstudiously cold and formal thus faraltered on a sudden he looked with unconcealed anxiety at francine do you say that seriously he asked  i said suppose i dont exactly know that she is engaged  what do you know  oh how interested you are in emily she is admired by some people are you one of them  mirabels experience of women warned him to try silence as a means of provoking her into speaking plainly the experiment succeeded francine returned to the question that he had put to her and abruptly answered it  you may believe me or not as you likei know of a man who is in love with her he has had his opportunities and he has made good use of them would you like to know who he is  i should like to know anything which you may wish to tell me he did his best to make the reply in a tone of commonplace politenessand he might have succeeded in deceiving a man the womans quicker ear told her that he was angry francine took the full advantage of that change in her favor  i am afraid your good opinion of emily will be shaken she quietly resumed when i tell you that she has encouraged a man who is only drawingmaster at a school at the same time a person in her circumstancesi mean she has no moneyought not to be very hard to please of course she has never spoken to you of mr alban morris  not that i remember  only four wordsbut they satisfied francine  the one thing wanting to complete the obstacle which she had now placed in emilys way was that alban morris should enter on the scene he might hesitate but if he was really fond of emily the anonymous letter would sooner or later bring him to monksmoor in the meantime her object was gained she dropped mirabels arm  here is the lodge she said gaylyi declare cecilia has got an apron on already come and cook     chapter xliii sounding  mirabel left francine to enter the lodge by herself his mind was disturbed he felt the importance of gaining time for reflection before he and emily met again  the keepers garden was at the back of the lodge passing through the wicketgate he found a little summerhouse at a turn in the path nobody was there he went in and sat down  at intervals he had even yet encouraged himself to underrate the true importance of the feeling which emily had awakened in him there was an end to all selfdeception now after what francine had said to him this shallow and frivolous man no longer resisted the allabsorbing influence of love he shrank under the one terrible question that forced itself on his mindhad that jealous girl spoken the truth  in what process of investigation could he trust to set this anxiety at rest to apply openly to emily would be to take a liberty which emily was the last person in the world to permit in his recent intercourse with her he had felt more strongly than ever the importance of speaking with reserve he had been scrupulously careful to take no unfair advantage of his opportunity when he had removed her from the meeting and when they had walked together with hardly a creature to observe them in the lonely outskirts of the town emilys gaiety and good humor had not led him astray he knew that these were bad signs viewed in the interests of love his one hope of touching her deeper sympathies was to wait for the help that might yet come from time and chance with a bitter sigh he resigned himself to the necessity of being as agreeable and amusing as ever it was just possible that he might lure her into alluding to alban morris if he began innocently by making her laugh  as he rose to return to the lodge the keepers little terrier prowling about the garden looked into the summerhouse seeing a stranger the dog showed his teeth and growled  mirabel shrank back against the wall behind him trembling in every limb his eyes stared in terror as the dog came nearer barking in high triumph over the discovery of a frightened man whom he could bully mirabel called out for help a laborer at work in the garden ran to the placeand stopped with a broad grin of amusement at seeing a grown man terrified by a barking dog well he said to himself after mirabel had passed out under protection there goes a coward if ever there was one yet  mirabel waited a minute behind the lodge to recover himself he had been so completely unnerved that his hair was wet with perspiration while he used his handkerchief he shuddered at other recollections than the recollection of the dog after that night at the inn he thought the least thing frightens me  he was received by the young ladies with cries of derisive welcome oh for shame for shame here are the potatoes already cut and nobody to fry them  mirabel assumed the mask of cheerfulnesswith the desperate resolution of an actor amusing his audience at a time of domestic distress he astonished the keepers wife by showing that he really knew how to use her fryingpan cecilias omelet was toughbut the young ladies ate it emilys mayonnaise sauce was almost as liquid as waterthey swallowed it nevertheless by the help of spoons the potatoes followed crisp and dry and deliciousand mirabel became more popular than ever he is the only one of us cecilia sadly acknowledged who knows how to cook  when they all left the lodge for a stroll in the park francine attached herself to cecilia and miss plym she resigned mirabel to emilyin the happy belief that she had paved the way for a misunderstanding between them  the merriment at the luncheon table had revived emilys good spirits she had a lighthearted remembrance of the failure of her sauce mirabel saw her smiling to herself may i ask what amuses you he said  i was thinking of the debt of gratitude that we owe to mr wyvil she replied if he had not persuaded you to return to monksmoor we should never have seen the famous mr mirabel with a frying pan in his hand and never have tasted the only good dish at our luncheon  mirabel tried vainly to adopt his companions easy tone now that he was alone with her the doubts that francine had aroused shook the prudent resolution at which he had arrived in the garden he ran the risk and told emily plainly why he had returned to mr wyvils house  although i am sensible of our hosts kindness he answered i should have gone back to my parsonagebut for you  she declined to understand him seriously then the affairs of your parish are neglectedand i am to blame she said  am i the first man who has neglected his duties for your sake he asked i wonder whether the masters at school had the heart to report you when you neglected your lessons  she thought of albanand betrayed herself by a heightened color the moment after she changed the subject mirabel could no longer resist the conclusion that francine had told him the truth  when do you leave us she inquired  tomorrow is saturdayi must go back as usual  and how will your deserted parish receive you  he made a desperate effort to be as amusing as usual  i am sure of preserving my popularity he said while i have a cask in the cellar and a few spare sixpences in my pocket the public spirit of my parishioners asks for nothing but money and beer before i went to that wearisome meeting i told my housekeeper that i was going to make a speech about reform she didnt know what i meant i explained that reform might increase the number of british citizens who had the right of voting at elections for parliament she brightened up directly ah she said ive heard my husband talk about elections the more there are of them he says the more money hell get for his vote im all for reform on my way out of the house i tried the man who works in my garden on the same subject he didnt look at the matter from the housekeepers sanguine point of view i dont deny that parliament once gave me a good dinner for nothing at the publichouse he admitted but that was years agoand youll excuse me sir i hear nothing of another dinner to come its a matter of opinion of course i dont myself believe in reform there are specimens of the state of public spirit in our village he paused emily was listeningbut he had not succeeded in choosing a subject that amused her he tried a topic more nearly connected with his own interests the topic of the future our good friend has asked me to prolong my visit after sundays duties are over he said i hope i shall find you here next week  will the affairs of your parish allow you to come back emily asked mischievously  the affairs of my parishif you force me to confess itwere only an excuse  an excuse for what  an excuse for keeping away from monksmoorin the interests of my own tranquillity the experiment has failed while you are here i cant keep away  she still declined to understand him seriously must i tell you in plain words that flattery is thrown away on me she said  flattery is not offered to you he answered gravely i beg your pardon for having led to the mistake by talking of myself having appealed to her indulgence by that act of submission he ventured on another distant allusion to the man whom he hated and feared shall i meet any friends of yours he resumed when i return on monday  what do you mean  i only meant to ask if mr wyvil expects any new guests  as he put the question cecilias voice was heard behind them calling to emily they both turned round mr wyvil had joined his daughter and her two friends he advanced to meet emily  i have some news for you that you little expect he said a telegram has just arrived from netherwoods mr alban morris has got leave of absence and is coming here tomorrow     chapter xliv competing  time at monksmoor had advanced to the half hour before dinner on saturday evening  cecilia and francine mr wyvil and mirabel were loitering in the conservatory in the drawingroom emily had been considerately left alone with alban he had missed the early train from netherwoods but he had arrived in time to dress for dinner and to offer the necessary explanations  if it had been possible for alban to allude to the anonymous letter he might have owned that his first impulse had led him to destroy it and to assert his confidence in emily by refusing mr wyvils invitation but try as he might to forget them the base words that he had read remained in his memory irritating him at the outset they had ended in rousing his jealousy under that delusive influence he persuaded himself that he had acted in the first instance without due consideration it was surely his interestit might even be his dutyto go to mr wyvils house and judge for himself after some last wretched moments of hesitation he had decided on effecting a compromise with his own better sense by consulting miss ladd that excellent lady did exactly what he had expected her to do she made arrangements which granted him leave of absence from the saturday to the tuesday following the excuse which had served him in telegraphing to mr wyvil must now be repeated in accounting for his unexpected appearance to emily i found a person to take charge of my class he said and i gladly availed myself of the opportunity of seeing you again  after observing him attentively while he was speaking to her emily owned with her customary frankness that she had noticed something in his manner which left her not quite at her ease  i wonder she said if there is any foundation for a doubt that has troubled me to his unutterable relief she at once explained what the doubt was i am afraid i offended you in replying to your letter about miss jethro  in this case alban could enjoy the luxury of speaking unreservedly he confessed that emilys letter had disappointed him  i expected you to answer me with less reserve he replied and i began to think i had acted rashly in writing to you at all when there is a better opportunity i may have a word to say he was apparently interrupted by something that he saw in the conservatory looking that way emily perceived that mirabel was the object which had attracted albans attention the vile anonymous letter was in his mind again without a preliminary word to prepare emily he suddenly changed the subject how do you like the clergyman he asked  very much indeed she replied without the slightest embarrassment mr mirabel is clever and agreeableand not at all spoiled by his success i am sure she said innocently you will like him too  albans face answered her unmistakably in the negative sensebut emilys attention was drawn the other way by francine she joined them at the moment on the lookout for any signs of an encouraging result which her treachery might already have produced alban had been inclined to suspect her when he had received the letter he rose and bowed as she approached somethinghe was unable to realize what it wastold him in the moment when they looked at each other that his suspicion had hit the mark  in the conservatory the everamiable mirabel had left his friends for a while in search of flowers for cecilia she turned to her father when they were alone and asked him which of the gentlemen was to take her in to dinnermr mirabel or mr morris  mr morris of course he answered he is the new guestand he turns out to be more than the equal sociallyspeaking of our other friend when i showed him his room i asked if he was related to a man who bore the same namea fellow student of mine years and years ago at college he is my friends younger son one of a ruined familybut persons of high distinction in their day  mirabel returned with the flowers just as dinner was announced  you are to take emily today cecilia said to him leading the way out of the conservatory as they entered the drawingroom alban was just offering his arm to emily papa gives you to me mr morris cecilia explained pleasantly alban hesitated apparently not understanding the allusion mirabel interfered with his best grace mr wyvil offers you the honor of taking his daughter to the diningroom albans face darkened ominously as the elegant little clergyman gave his arm to emily and followed mr wyvil and francine out of the room cecilia looked at her silent and surly companion and almost envied her lazy sister diningunder cover of a convenient headachein her own room  having already made up his mind that alban morris required careful handling mirabel waited a little before he led the conversation as usual between the soup and the fish he made an interesting confession addressed to emily in the strictest confidence  i have taken a fancy to your friend mr morris he said first impressions in my case decide everything i like people or dislike them on impulse that man appeals to my sympathies is he a good talker  i should say yes emily answered prettily if you were not present  mirabel was not to be beaten even by a woman in the art of paying compliments he looked admiringly at alban sitting opposite to him and said let us listen  this flattering suggestion not only pleased emilyit artfully served mirabels purpose that is to say it secured him an opportunity for observation of what was going on at the other side of the table  albans instincts as a gentleman had led him to control his irritation and to regret that he had suffered it to appear anxious to please he presented himself at his best gentle cecilia forgave and forgot the angry look which had startled her mr wyvil was delighted with the son of his old friend emily felt secretly proud of the good opinions which her admirer was gathering and francine saw with pleasure that he was asserting his claim to emilys preference in the way of all others which would be most likely to discourage his rival these various impressionsproduced while albans enemy was ominously silentbegan to suffer an imperceptible change from the moment when mirabel decided that his time had come to take the lead a remark made by alban offered him the chance for which he had been on the watch he agreed with the remark he enlarged on the remark he was brilliant and familiar and instructive and amusingand still it was all due to the remark albans temper was once more severely tried mirabels mischievous object had not escaped his penetration he did his best to put obstacles in the adversarys wayand was baffled time after time with the readiest ingenuity if he interruptedthe sweettempered clergyman submitted and went on if he differedmodest mr mirabel said in the most amiable manner i daresay i am wrong and handled the topic from his opponents point of view never had such a perfect christian sat before at mr wyvils table not a hard word not an impatient look escaped him the longer alban resisted the more surely he lost ground in the general estimation cecilia was disappointed emily was grieved mr wyvils favorable opinion began to waver francine was disgusted when dinner was over and the carriage was waiting to take the shepherd back to his flock by moonlight mirabels triumph was complete he had made alban the innocent means of publicly exhibiting his perfect temper and perfect politeness under their best and brightest aspect  so that day ended sunday promised to pass quietly in the absence of mirabel the morning cameand it seemed doubtful whether the promise would be fulfilled  francine had passed an uneasy night no such encouraging result as she had anticipated had hitherto followed the appearance of alban morris at monksmoor he had clumsily allowed mirabel to improve his positionwhile he had himself lost groundin emilys estimation if this first disastrous consequence of the meeting between the two men was permitted to repeat itself on future occasions emily and mirabel would be brought more closely together and alban himself would be the unhappy cause of it francine rose on the sunday morning before the table was laid for breakfastresolved to try the effect of a timely word of advice  her bedroom was situated in the front of the house the man she was looking for presently passed within her range of view from the window on his way to take a morning walk in the park she followed him immediately  goodmorning mr morris  he raised his hat and bowedwithout speaking and without looking at her  we resemble each other in one particular she proceeded graciously we both like to breathe the fresh air before breakfast  he said exactly what common politeness obliged him to say and no morehe said yes  some girls might have been discouraged francine went on  it is no fault of mine mr morris that we have not been better friends for some reason into which i dont presume to inquire you seem to distrust me i really dont know what i have done to deserve it  are you sure of that he askedeying her suddenly and searchingly as he spoke  her hard face settled into a rigid look her eyes met his eyes with a stony defiant stare now for the first time she knew that he suspected her of having written the anonymous letter every evil quality in her nature steadily defied him a hardened old woman could not have sustained the shock of discovery with a more devilish composure than this girl displayed perhaps you will explain yourself she said  i have explained myself he answered  then i must be content she rejoined to remain in the dark i had intended out of my regard for emily to suggest that you mightwith advantage to yourself and to interests that are very dear to yoube more careful in your behavior to mr mirabel are you disposed to listen to me  do you wish me to answer that question plainly miss de sor  i insist on your answering it plainly  then i am not disposed to listen to you  may i know why or am i to be left in the dark again  you are to be left if you please to your own ingenuity  francine looked at him with a malignant smile one of these days mr morrisi will deserve your confidence in my ingenuity she said it and went back to the house  this was the only element of disturbance that troubled the perfect tranquillity of the day what francine had proposed to do with the one idea of making alban serve her purpose was accomplished a few hours later by emilys influence for good over the man who loved her  they passed the afternoon together uninterruptedly in the distant solitudes of the park in the course of conversation emily found an opportunity of discreetly alluding to mirabel you mustnt be jealous of our clever little friend she said i like him and admire him but  but you dont love him  she smiled at the eager way in which alban put the question  there is no fear of that she answered brightly  not even if you discovered that he loves you  not even then are you content at last promise me not to be rude to mr mirabel again  for his sake  nofor my sake i dont like to see you place yourself at a disadvantage toward another man i dont like you to disappoint me  the happiness of hearing her say those words transfigured himthe manly beauty of his earlier and happier years seemed to have returned to alban he took her handhe was too agitated to speak  you are forgetting mr mirabel she reminded him gently  i will be all that is civil and kind to mr mirabel i will like him and admire him as you do oh emily are you a little only a very little fond of me  i dont quite know  may i try to find out  how she asked  her fair cheek was very near to him the softlyrising color on it said answer me hereand he answered     chapter xlv mischiefmaking  on monday mirabel made his appearanceand the demon of discord returned with him  alban had employed the earlier part of the day in making a sketch in the parkintended as a little present for emily presenting himself in the drawingroom when his work was completed he found cecilia and francine alone he asked where emily was  the question had been addressed to cecilia francine answered it  emily mustnt be disturbed she said  why not  she is with mr mirabel in the rose garden i saw them talking togetherevidently feeling the deepest interest in what they were saying to each other dont interrupt themyou will only be in the way  cecilia at once protested against this last assertion she is trying to make mischief mr morrisdont believe her i am sure they will be glad to see you if you join them in the garden  francine rose and left the room she turned and looked at alban as she opened the door try it she saidand you will find i am right  francine sometimes talks in a very illnatured way cecilia gently remarked do you think she means it mr morris  i had better not offer an opinion alban replied  why  i cant speak impartially i dislike miss de sor  there was a pause albans sense of selfrespect forbade him to try the experiment which francine had maliciously suggested his thoughtsless easy to restrainwandered in the direction of the garden the attempt to make him jealous had failed but he was conscious at the same time that emily had disappointed him after what they had said to each other in the park she ought to have remembered that women are at the mercy of appearances if mirabel had something of importance to say to her she might have avoided exposing herself to francines spiteful misconstruction it would have been easy to arrange with cecilia that a third person should be present at the interview  while he was absorbed in these reflections ceciliaembarrassed by the silencewas trying to find a topic of conversation alban roughly pushed his sketchbook away from him on the table was he displeased with emily the same question had occurred to cecilia at the time of the correspondence on the subject of miss jethro to recall those letters led her by natural sequence to another effort of memory she was reminded of the person who had been the cause of the correspondence her interest was revived in the mystery of miss jethro  has emily told you that i have seen your letter she asked  he roused himself with a start i beg your pardon what letter are you thinking of  i was thinking of the letter which mentions miss jethros strange visit emily was so puzzled and so surprised that she showed it to meand we both consulted my father have you spoken to emily about miss jethro  i have triedbut she seemed to be unwilling to pursue the subject  have you made any discoveries since you wrote to emily  no the mystery is as impenetrable as ever  as he replied in those terms mirabel entered the conservatory from the garden evidently on his way to the drawingroom  to see the man whose introduction to emily it had been miss jethros mysterious object to preventat the very moment when he had been speaking of miss jethro herselfwas not only a temptation of curiosity but a direct incentive in emilys own interests to make an effort at discovery alban pursued the conversation with cecilia in a tone which was loud enough to be heard in the conservatory  the one chance of getting any information that i can see he proceeded is to speak to mr mirabel  i shall be only too glad if i can be of any service to miss wyvil and mr morris  with those obliging words mirabel made a dramatic entry and looked at cecilia with his irresistible smile startled by his sudden appearance she unconsciously assisted albans design her silence gave him the opportunity of speaking in her place  we were talking he said quietly to mirabel of a lady with whom you are acquainted  indeed may i ask the ladys name  miss jethro  mirabel sustained the shock with extraordinary selfpossessionso far as any betrayal by sudden movement was concerned but his color told the truth it faded to palenessit revealed even to cecilias eyes a man overpowered by fright  alban offered him a chair he refused to take it by a gesture alban tried an apology next i am afraid i have ignorantly revived some painful associations pray excuse me  the apology roused mirabel he felt the necessity of offering some explanation in timid animals the one defensive capacity which is always ready for action is cunning mirabel was too wily to dispute the inferencethe inevitable inferencewhich any one must have drawn after seeing the effect on him that the name of miss jethro had produced he admitted that painful associations had been revived and deplored the nervous sensibility which had permitted it to be seen  no blame can possibly attach to you my dear sir he continued in his most amiable manner will it be indiscreet on my part if i ask how you first became acquainted with miss jethro  i first became acquainted with her at miss ladds school alban answered she was for a short time only one of the teachers and she left her situation rather suddenly he pausedbut mirabel made no remark after an interval of a few months he resumed i saw miss jethro again she called on me at my lodgings near netherwoods  merely to renew your former acquaintance  mirabel made that inquiry with an eager anxiety for the reply which he was quite unable to conceal had he any reason to dread what miss jethro might have it in her power to say of him to another person alban was in no way pledged to secrecy and he was determined to leave no means untried of throwing light on miss jethros mysterious warning he repeated the plain narrative of the interview which he had communicated by letter to emily mirabel listened without making any remark  after what i have told you can you give me no explanation alban asked  i am quite unable mr morris to help you  was he lying or speaking the truth the impression produced on alban was that he had spoken the truth  women are never so ready as men to resign themselves to the disappointment of their hopes cecilia silently listening up to this time now ventured to speakanimated by her sisterly interest in emily  can you not tell us she said to mirabel why miss jethro tried to prevent emily brown from meeting you here  i know no more of her motive than you do mirabel replied  alban interposed miss jethro left me he said with the intentionquite openly expressedof trying to prevent you from accepting mr wyvils invitation did she make the attempt  mirabel admitted that she had made the attempt but he added without mentioning miss emilys name i was asked to postpone my visit as a favor to herself because she had her own reasons for wishing it i had my reasons he bowed with gallantry to cecilia for being eager to have the honor of knowing mr wyvil and his daughter and i refused  once more the doubt arose was he lying or speaking the truth and once more alban could not resist the conclusion that he was speaking the truth  there is one thing i should like to know mirabel continued after some hesitation has miss emily been informed of this strange affair  certainly  mirabel seemed to be disposed to continue his inquiriesand suddenly changed his mind was he beginning to doubt if alban had spoken without concealment in describing miss jethros visit was he still afraid of what miss jethro might have said of him in any case he changed the subject and made an excuse for leaving the room  i am forgetting my errand he said to alban miss emily was anxious to know if you had finished your sketch i must tell her that you have returned  he bowed and withdrew  alban rose to follow himand checked himself  no he thought i trust emily he sat down again by cecilias side    mirabel had indeed returned to the rose garden he found emily employed as he had left her in making a crown of roses to be worn by cecilia in the evening but in one other respect there was a change francine was present  excuse me for sending you on a needless errand emily said to mirabel miss de sor tells me mr morris has finished his sketch she left him in the drawingroomwhy didnt you bring him here  he was talking with miss wyvil  mirabel answered absentlywith his eyes on francine he gave her one of those significant looks which says to a third person why are you here francines jealousy declined to understand him he tried a broader hint in words  are you going to walk in the garden he said  francine was impenetrable no she answered i am going to stay here with emily  mirabel had no choice but to yield imperative anxieties forced him to say in francines presence what he had hoped to say to emily privately  when i joined miss wyvil and mr morris he began what do you think they were doing they were talking ofmiss jethro  emily dropped the rosecrown on her lap it was easy to see that she had been disagreeably surprised  mr morris has told me the curious story of miss jethros visit mirabel continued but i am in some doubt whether he has spoken to me without reserve perhaps he expressed himself more freely when he spoke to you miss jethro may have said something to him which tended to lower me in your estimation  certainly not mr mirabelso far as i know if i had heard anything of the kind i should have thought it my duty to tell you will it relieve your anxiety if i go at once to mr morris and ask him plainly whether he has concealed anything from you or from me  mirabel gratefully kissed her hand your kindness overpowers me he saidspeaking for once with true emotion  emily immediately returned to the house as soon as she was out of sight francine approached mirabel trembling with suppressed rage     chapter xlvi pretending  miss de sor began cautiously with an apology excuse me mr mirabel for reminding you of my presence  mr mirabel made no reply  i beg to say francine proceeded that i didnt intentionally see you kiss emilys hand  mirabel stood looking at the roses which emily had left on her chair as completely absorbed in his own thoughts as if he had been alone in the garden  am i not even worth notice francine asked ah i know to whom i am indebted for your neglect she took him familiarly by the arm and burst into a harsh laugh tell me now in confidencedo you think emily is fond of you  the impression left by emilys kindness was still fresh in mirabels memory he was in no humor to submit to the jealous resentment of a woman whom he regarded with perfect indifference through the varnish of politeness which overlaid his manner there rose to the surface the underlying insolence hidden on all ordinary occasions from all human eyes he answered francinemercilessly answered herat last  it is the dearest hope of my life that she may be fond of me he said  francine dropped his arm and fortune favors your hopes she added with an ironical assumption of interest in mirabels prospects when mr morris leaves us tomorrow he removes the only obstacle you have to fear am i right  no you are wrong  in what way if you please  in this way i dont regard mr morris as an obstacle emily is too delicate and too kind to hurt his feelingsshe is not in love with him there is no absorbing interest in her mind to divert her thoughts from me she is idle and happy she thoroughly enjoys her visit to this house and i am associated with her enjoyment there is my chance  he suddenly stopped listening to him thus far unnaturally calm and cold francine now showed that she felt the lash of his contempt a hideous smile passed slowly over her white face it threatened the vengeance which knows no fear no pity no remorsethe vengeance of a jealous woman hysterical anger furious language mirabel was prepared for the smile frightened him  well she said scornfully why dont you go on  a bolder man might still have maintained the audacious position which he had assumed mirabels faint heart shrank from it he was eager to shelter himself under the first excuse that he could find his ingenuity paralyzed by his fears was unable to invent anything new he feebly availed himself of the commonplace trick of evasion which he had read of in novels and seen in action on the stage  is it possible he asked with an overacted assumption of surprise that you think i am in earnest  in the case of any other person francine would have instantly seen through that flimsy pretense but the love which accepts the meanest crumbs of comfort that can be thrown to itwhich fawns and grovels and deliberately deceives itself in its own intensely selfish interestswas the love that burned in francines breast the wretched girl believed mirabel with such an ecstatic sense of belief that she trembled in every limb and dropped into the nearest chair  i was in earnest she said faintly didnt you see it  he was perfectly shameless he denied that he had seen it in the most positive manner upon my honor i thought you were mystifying me and i humored the joke  she sighed and looking at him with an expression of tender reproach i wonder whether i can believe you she said softly  indeed you may believe me he assured her  she hesitatedfor the pleasure of hesitating i dont know emily is very much admired by some men why not by you  for the best of reasons he answered she is poor and i am poor those are facts which speak for themselves  yesbut emily is bent on attracting you she would marry you tomorrow if you asked her dont attempt to deny it besides you kissed her hand  oh miss de sor  dont call me miss de sor call me francine i want to know why you kissed her hand  he humored her with inexhaustible servility allow me to kiss your hand francineand let me explain that kissing a ladys hand is only a form of thanking her for her kindness you must own that emily  she interrupted him for the third time emily she repeated are you as familiar as that already does she call you miles when you are by yourselves is there any effort at fascination which this charming creature has left untried she told you no doubt what a lonely life she leads in her poor little home  even mirabel felt that he must not permit this to pass  she has said nothing to me about herself he answered what i know of her i know from mr wyvil  oh indeed you asked mr wyvil about her family of course what did he say  he said she lost her mother when she was a childand he told me her father had died suddenly a few years since of heart complaint  well and what elsenever mind now here is somebody coming  the person was only one of the servants mirabel felt grateful to the man for interrupting them animated by sentiments of a precisely opposite nature francine spoke to him sharply  what do you want here  a message miss  from whom  from miss brown  for me  no miss he turned to mirabel miss brown wishes to speak to you sir if you are not engaged  francine controlled herself until the man was out of hearing  upon my word this is too shameless she declared indignantly emily cant leave you with me for five minutes without wanting to see you again if you go to her after all that you have said to me she cried threatening mirabel with her outstretched hand you are the meanest of men  he was the meanest of menhe carried out his cowardly submission to the last extremity  only say what you wish me to do he replied  even francine expected some little resistance from a creature bearing the outward appearance of a man oh do you really mean it she asked i want you to disappoint emily will you stay here and let me make your excuses  i will do anything to please you  francine gave him a farewell look her admiration made a desperate effort to express itself appropriately in words you are not a man she said you are an angel  left by himself mirabel sat down to rest he reviewed his own conduct with perfect complacency not one man in a hundred could have managed that shedevil as i have done he thought how shall i explain matters to emily  considering this question he looked by chance at the unfinished crown of roses the very thing to help me he saidand took out his pocketbook and wrote these lines on a blank page i have had a scene of jealousy with miss de sor which is beyond all description to spare you a similar infliction i have done violence to my own feelings instead of instantly obeying the message which you have so kindly sent to me i remain here for a little whileentirely for your sake  having torn out the page and twisted it up among the roses so that only a corner of the paper appeared in view mirabel called to a lad who was at work in the garden and gave him his directions accompanied by a shilling take those flowers to the servants hall and tell one of the maids to put them in miss browns room stop which is the way to the fruit garden  the lad gave the necessary directions mirabel walked away slowly with his hands in his pockets his nerves had been shaken he thought a little fruit might refresh him     chapter xlvii debating  in the meanwhile emily had been true to her promise to relieve mirabels anxieties on the subject of miss jethro entering the drawingroom in search of alban she found him talking with cecilia and heard her own name mentioned as she opened the door  here she is at last cecilia exclaimed what in the world has kept you all this time in the rose garden  has mr mirabel been more interesting than usual alban asked gayly whatever sense of annoyance he might have felt in emilys absence was forgotten the moment she appeared all traces of trouble in his face vanished when they looked at each other  you shall judge for yourself emily replied with a smile mr mirabel has been speaking to me of a relative who is very dear to himhis sister  cecilia was surprised why has he never spoken to us of his sister she asked  its a sad subject to speak of my dear his sister lives a life of sufferingshe has been for years a prisoner in her room he writes to her constantly his letters from monksmoor have interested her poor soul it seems he said something about meand she has sent a kind message inviting me to visit her one of these days do you understand it now cecilia  of course i do tell meis mr mirabels sister older or younger than he is  older  is she married  she is a widow  does she live with her brother alban asked  oh no she has her own housefar away in northumberland  is she near sir jervis redwood  i fancy not her house is on the coast  any children cecilia inquired  no she is quite alone now cecilia i have told you all i knowand i have something to say to mr morris no you neednt leave us its a subject in which you are interested a subject she repeated turning to alban which you may have noticed is not very agreeable to me  miss jethro alban guessed  yes miss jethro  cecilias curiosity instantly asserted itself  we have tried to get mr mirabel to enlighten us and tried in vain she said you are a favorite have you succeeded  i have made no attempt to succeed emily replied my only object is to relieve mr mirabels anxiety if i canwith your help mr morris  in what way can i help you  you mustnt be angry  do i look angry  you look serious it is a very simple thing mr mirabel is afraid that miss jethro may have said something disagreeable about him which you might hesitate to repeat is he making himself uneasy without any reason  without the slightest reason i have concealed nothing from mr mirabel  thank you for the explanation she turned to cecilia may i send one of the servants with a message i may as well put an end to mr mirabels suspense  the man was summoned and was dispatched with the message emily would have done well after this if she had abstained from speaking further of miss jethro but mirabels doubts had unhappily inspired a similar feeling of uncertainty in her own mind she was now disposed to attribute the tone of mystery in albans unlucky letter to some possible concealment suggested by regard for herself i wonder whether i have any reason to feel uneasy she saidhalf in jest half in earnest  uneasy about what alban inquired  about miss jethro of course has she said anything of me which your kindness has concealed  alban seemed to be a little hurt by the doubt which her question implied was that your motive he asked for answering my letter as cautiously as if you had been writing to a stranger  indeed you are quite wrong emily earnestly assured him i was perplexed and startledand i took mr wyvils advice before i wrote to you shall we drop the subject  alban would have willingly dropped the subjectbut for that unfortunate allusion to mr wyvil emily had unconsciously touched him on a sore place he had already heard from cecilia of the consultation over his letter and had disapproved of it i think you were wrong to trouble mr wyvil he said  the altered tone of his voice suggested to emily that he would have spoken more severely if cecilia had not been in the room she thought him needlessly ready to complain of a harmless proceedingand she too returned to the subject after having proposed to drop it not a minute since  you didnt tell me i was to keep your letter a secret she replied  cecilia made matters worsewith the best intentions im sure mr morris my father was only too glad to give emily his advice  alban remained silentungraciously silent as emily thought after mr wyvils kindness to him  the thing to regret she remarked is that mr morris allowed miss jethro to leave him without explaining herself in his place i should have insisted on knowing why she wanted to prevent me from meeting mr mirabel in this house  cecilia made another unlucky attempt at judicious interference this time she tried a gentle remonstrance  remember emily how mr morris was situated he could hardly be rude to a lady and i daresay miss jethro had good reasons for not wishing to explain herself  francine opened the drawingroom door and heard cecilias last words  miss jethro again she exclaimed  where is mr mirabel emily asked i sent him a message  he regrets to say he is otherwise engaged for the present francine replied with spiteful politeness dont let me interrupt the conversation who is this miss jethro whose name is on everybodys lips  alban could keep silent no longer we have done with the subject he said sharply  because i am here  because we have said more than enough about miss jethro already  speak for yourself mr morris emily answered resenting the masterful tone which albans interference had assumed i have not done with miss jethro yet i can assure you  my dear you dont know where she lives cecilia reminded her  leave me to discover it emily answered hotly perhaps mr mirabel knows i shall ask mr mirabel  i thought you would find a reason for returning to mr mirabel francine remarked  before emily could reply one of the maids entered the room with a wreath of roses in her hand  mr mirabel sends you these flowers miss the woman said addressing emily the boy told me they were to be taken to your room i thought it was a mistake and i have brought them to you here  francine who happened to be nearest to the door took the roses from the girl on pretense of handing them to emily her jealous vigilance detected the one visible morsel of mirabels letter twisted up with the flowers had emily entrapped him into a secret correspondence with her a scrap of waste paper among your roses she said crumpling it up in her hand as if she meant to throw it away  but emily was too quick for her she caught francine by the wrist waste paper or not she said it was among my flowers and it belongs to me  francine gave up the letter with a look which might have startled emily if she had noticed it she handed the roses to cecilia i was making a wreath for you to wear this evening my dearand i left it in the garden its not quite finished yet  cecilia was delighted how lovely it is she exclaimed and how very kind of you ill finish it myself she turned away to the conservatory  i had no idea i was interfering with a letter said francine watching emily with fiercelyattentive eyes while she smoothed out the crumpled paper  having read what mirabel had written to her emily looked up and saw that alban was on the point of following cecilia into the conservatory he had noticed something in francines face which he was at a loss to understand but which made her presence in the room absolutely hateful to him emily followed and spoke to him  i am going back to the rose garden she said  for any particular purpose alban inquired  for a purpose which i am afraid you wont approve of i mean to ask mr mirabel if he knows miss jethros address  i hope he is as ignorant of it as i am alban answered gravely  are we going to quarrel over miss jethro as we once quarreled over mrs rook emily askedwith the readiest recovery of her good humor come come i am sure you are as anxious in your own private mind to have this matter cleared up as i am  with one differencethat i think of consequences and you dont he said it in his gentlest and kindest manner and stepped into the conservatory  never mind the consequences she called after him if we can only get at the truth i hate being deceived  there is no person living who has better reason than you have to say that  emily looked round with a start alban was out of hearing it was francine who had answered her  what do you mean she said  francine hesitated a ghastly paleness overspread her face  are you ill emily asked  noi am thinking  after waiting for a moment in silence emily moved away toward the door of the drawingroom francine suddenly held up her hand  stop she cried  emily stood still  my mind is made up francine said  made upto what  you asked what i meant just now  i did  well my mind is made up to answer you miss emily brown you are leading a sadly frivolous life in this house i am going to give you something more serious to think about than your flirtation with mr mirabel oh dont be impatient i am coming to the point without knowing it yourself you have been the victim of deception for years pastcruel deceptionwicked deception that puts on the mask of mercy  are you alluding to miss jethro emily asked in astonishment i thought you were strangers to each other just now you wanted to know who she was  i know nothing about her i care nothing about her i am not thinking of miss jethro  who are you thinking of  i am thinking francine answered of your dead father     chapter xlviii investigating  having revived his sinking energies in the fruit garden mirabel seated himself under the shade of a tree and reflected on the critical position in which he was placed by francines jealousy  if miss de sor continued to be mr wyvils guest there seemed to be no other choice before mirabel than to leave monksmoorand to trust to a favorable reply to his sisters invitation for the free enjoyment of emilys society under another roof try as he might he could arrive at no more satisfactory conclusion than this in his preoccupied state time passed quickly nearly an hour had elapsed before he rose to return to the house  entering the hall he was startled by a cry of terror in a womans voice coming from the upper regions at the same time mr wyvil passing along the bedroom corridor after leaving the musicroom was confronted by his daughter hurrying out of emilys bedchamber in such a state of alarm that she could hardly speak  gone she cried the moment she saw her father  mr wyvil took her in his arms and tried to compose her who has gone he asked  emily oh papa emily has left us she has heard dreadful newsshe told me so herself  what news how did she hear it  i dont know how she heard it i went back to the drawingroom to show her my roses  was she alone  yes she frightened meshe seemed quite wild she said let me be by myself i shall have to go home she kissed meand ran up to her room oh i am such a fool anybody else would have taken care not to lose sight of her  how long did you leave her by herself  i cant say i thought i would go and tell you and then i got anxious about her and knocked at her door and looked into the room gone gone  mr wyvil rang the bell and confided cecilia to the care of her maid mirabel had already joined him in the corridor they went downstairs together and consulted with alban he volunteered to make immediate inquiries at the railway station mr wyvil followed him as far as the lodge gate which opened on the highroadwhile mirabel went to a second gate at the opposite extremity of the park  mr wyvil obtained the first news of emily the lodge keeper had seen her pass him on her way out of the park in the greatest haste he had called after her anything wrong miss and had received no reply asked what time had elapsed since this had happened he was too confused to be able to answer with any certainty he knew that she had taken the road which led to the stationand he knew no more  mr wyvil and mirabel met again at the house and instituted an examination of the servants no further discoveries were made  the question which occurred to everybody was suggested by the words which cecilia had repeated to her father emily had said she had heard dreadful newshow had that news reached her the one postal delivery at monksmoor was in the morning had any special messenger arrived with a letter for emily the servants were absolutely certain that no such person had entered the house the one remaining conclusion suggested that somebody must have communicated the evil tidings by word of mouth but here again no evidence was to be obtained no visitor had called during the day and no new guests had arrived investigation was completely baffled  alban returned from the railway with news of the fugitive  he had reached the station some time after the departure of the london train the clerk at the office recognized his description of emily and stated that she had taken her ticket for london the stationmaster had opened the carriage door for her and had noticed that the young lady appeared to be very much agitated this information obtained alban had dispatched a telegram to emilyin cecilias name pray send us a few words to relieve our anxiety and let us know if we can be of any service to you  this was plainly all that could be donebut cecilia was not satisfied if her father had permitted it she would have followed emily alban comforted her he apologized to mr wyvil for shortening his visit and announced his intention of traveling to london by the next train we may renew our inquiries to some advantage he added after hearing what had happened in his absence if we can find out who was the last person who saw her and spoke to her before your daughter found her alone in the drawingroom when i went out of the room i left her with miss de sor  the maid who waited on miss de sor was sent for francine had been out by herself walking in the park she was then in her room changing her dress on hearing of emilys sudden departure she had been as the maid reported much shocked and quite at a loss to understand what it meant  joining her friends a few minutes later francine presented so far as personal appearance went a strong contrast to the pale and anxious faces round her she looked wonderfully well after her walk in other respects she was in perfect harmony with the prevalent feeling she expressed herself with the utmost propriety her sympathy moved poor cecilia to tears  i am sure miss de sor you will try to help us mr wyvil began  with the greatest pleasure francine answered  how long were you and miss emily brown together after mr morris left you  not more than a quarter of an hour i should think  did anything remarkable occur in the course of conversation  nothing whatever  alban interfered for the first time did you say anything he asked which agitated or offended miss brown  thats rather an extraordinary question francine remarked  have you no other answer to give alban inquired  i answerno she said with a sudden outburst of anger  there the matter dropped while she spoke in reply to mr wyvil francine had confronted him without embarrassment when alban interposed she never looked at himexcept when he provoked her to anger did she remember that the man who was questioning her was also the man who had suspected her of writing the anonymous letter alban was on his guard against himself knowing how he disliked her but the conviction in his own mind was not to be resisted in some unimaginable way francine was associated with emilys flight from the house  the answer to the telegram sent from the railway station had not arrived when alban took his departure for london cecilias suspense began to grow unendurable she looked to mirabel for comfort and found none his office was to console and his capacity for performing that office was notorious among his admirers but he failed to present himself to advantage when mr wyvils lovely daughter had need of his services he was in truth too sincerely anxious and distressed to be capable of commanding his customary resources of readymade sentiment and fluentlypious philosophy emilys influence had awakened the only earnest and true feeling which had ever ennobled the popular preachers life  toward evening the longexpected telegram was received at last what could be said under the circumstances it said in these words  safe at homedont be uneasy about mewill write soon  with that promise they were for the time forced to be content     book the fifththe cottage    chapter xlix emily suffers  mrs ellmotherleft in charge of emilys place of abode and feeling sensible of her lonely position from time to timehad just thought of trying the cheering influence of a cup of tea when she heard a cab draw up at the cottage gate a violent ring at the bell followed she opened the doorand found emily on the steps one look at that dear and familiar face was enough for the old servant  god help us she cried whats wrong now  without a word of reply emily led the way into the bedchamber which had been the scene of miss letitias death mrs ellmother hesitated on the threshold  why do you bring me in here she asked  why did you try to keep me out emily answered  when did i try to keep you out miss  when i came home from school to nurse my aunt ah you remember now is it truei ask you here where your old mistress diedis it true that my aunt deceived me about my fathers death and that you knew it  there was dead silence mrs ellmother trembled horriblyher lips dropped aparther eyes wandered round the room with a stare of idiotic terror is it her ghost tells you that she whispered where is her ghost the room whirls round and round missand the air sings in my ears  emily sprang forward to support her she staggered to a chair and lifted her great bony hands in wild entreaty dont frighten me she said stand back  emily obeyed her she dashed the cold sweat off her forehead you were talking about your fathers death just now she burst out in desperate defiant tones well we know it and we are sorry for ityour father died suddenly  my father died murdered in the inn at zeeland all the long way to london i have tried to doubt it oh me i know it now  answering in those words she looked toward the bed harrowing remembrances of her aunts delirious selfbetrayal made the room unendurable to her she ran out the parlor door was open entering the room she passed by a portrait of her father which her aunt had hung on the wall over the fireplace she threw herself on the sofa and burst into a passionate fit of crying oh my fathermy dear gentle loving father my first best truest friendmurdered murdered oh god where was your justice where was your mercy when he died that dreadful death  a hand was laid on her shoulder a voice said to her hush my child god knows best  emily looked up and saw that mrs ellmother had followed her you poor old soul she said suddenly remembering i frightened you in the other room  i have got over it my dear i am old and i have lived a hard life a hard life schools a person i make no complaints she stopped and began to shudder again will you believe me if i tell you something she asked i warned my selfwilled mistress standing by your fathers coffin i warned her hide the truth as you may i said a time will come when our child will know what you are keeping from her now one or both of us may live to see it i am the one who has lived no refuge in the grave for me i want to hear about ittheres no fear of frightening or hurting me now i want to hear how you found it out was it by accident my dear or did a person tell you  emilys mind was far away from mrs ellmother she rose from the sofa with her hands held fast over her aching heart  the one duty of my life she saidi am thinking of the one duty of my life look i am calm now i am resigned to my hard lot never never again can the dear memory of my father be what it was from this time it is the horrid memory of a crime the crime has gone unpunished the man has escaped others he shall not escape me she paused and looked at mrs ellmother absently what did you say just now you want to hear how i know what i know naturally naturally sit down heresit down my old friend on the sofa with meand take your mind back to netherwoods alban morris  mrs ellmother recoiled from emily in dismay dont tell me he had anything to do with it the kindest of men the best of men  the man of all men living who least deserves your good opinion or mine emily answered sternly  you mrs ellmother exclaimed you say that  i say it hewho won on me to like himhe was in the conspiracy to deceive me and you know it he heard me talk of the newspaper story of the murder of my fatheri say he heard me talk of it composedly talk of it carelessly in the innocent belief that it was the murder of a strangerand he never opened his lips to prevent that horrid profanation he never even said speak of something else i wont hear you no more of him god forbid i should ever see him again no do what i told you carry your mind back to netherwoods one night you let francine de sor frighten you you ran away from her into the garden keep quiet at your age must i set you an example of selfcontrol  i want to know miss emily where francine de sor is now  she is at the house in the country which i have left  where does she go next if you please back to miss ladd  i suppose so what interest have you in knowing where she goes next  i wont interrupt you miss its true that i ran away into the garden i can guess who followed me how did she find her way to me and mr morris in the dark  the smell of tobacco guided hershe knew who smokedshe had seen him talking to you on that very dayshe followed the scentshe heard what you two said to each otherand she has repeated it to me oh my old friend the malice of a revengeful girl has enlightened me when you my nurseand he my loverleft me in the dark it has told me how my father died  thats said bitterly miss  is it said truly  no it isnt said truly of myself god knows you would never have been kept in the dark if your aunt had listened to me i begged and prayedi went down on my knees to heri warned her as i told you just now must i tell you what a headstrong woman miss letitia was she insisted she put the choice before me of leaving her at once and foreveror giving in i wouldnt have given in to any other creature on the face of this earth i am obstinate as you have often told me well your aunts obstinacy beat mine i was too fond of her to say no besides if you ask me who was to blame in the first place i tell you it wasnt your aunt she was frightened into it  who frightened her  your godfatherthe great london surgeonhe who was visiting in our house at the time  sir richard  yessir richard he said he wouldnt answer for the consequences in the delicate state of your health if we told you the truth ah he had it all his own way after that he went with miss letitia to the inquest he won over the coroner and the newspaper men to his will he kept your aunts name out of the papers he took charge of the coffin he hired the undertaker and his men strangers from london he wrote the certificatewho but he everybody was cap in hand to the famous man  surely the servants and the neighbors asked questions  hundreds of questions what did that matter to sir richard they were like so many children in his hands and mind you the luck helped him to begin with there was the common name who was to pick out your poor father among the thousands of james browns then again the house and lands went to the male heir as they called himthe man your father quarreled with in the bygone time he brought his own establishment with him long before you got back from the friends you were staying withdont you remember itwe had cleared out of the house we were miles and miles away and the old servants were scattered abroad finding new situations wherever they could how could you suspect us we had nothing to fear in that way but my conscience pricked me i made another attempt to prevail on miss letitia when you had recovered your health i said theres no fear of a relapse now break it to her gently but tell her the truth no your aunt was too fond of you she daunted me with dreadful fits of crying when i tried to persuade her and that wasnt the worst of it she bade me remember what an excitable man your father wasshe reminded me that the misery of your mothers death laid him low with brain fevershe said emily takes after her father i have heard you say it yourself she has his constitution and his sensitive nerves dont you know how she loved himhow she talks of him to this day who can tell if we are not careful what dreadful mischief we may do that was how my mistress worked on me i got infected with her fears it was as if i had caught an infection of disease oh my dear blame me if it must be but dont forget how i have suffered for it since i was driven away from my dying mistress in terror of what she might say while you were watching at her bedside i have lived in fear of what you might ask meand have longed to go back to youand have not had the courage to do it look at me now  the poor woman tried to take out her handkerchief her quivering hand helplessly entangled itself in her dress i cant even dry my eyes she said faintly try to forgive me miss  emily put her arms round the old nurses neck it is you she said sadly who must forgive me  for a while they were silent through the window that was open to the little garden came the one sound that could be heardthe gentle trembling of leaves in the evening wind  the silence was harshly broken by the bell at the cottage door they both started  emilys heart beat fast who can it be she said  mrs ellmother rose shall i say you cant see anybody she asked before leaving the room  yes yes  emily heard the door openedheard low voices in the passage there was a momentary interval then mrs ellmother returned she said nothing emily spoke to her  is it a visitor  yes  have you said i cant see anybody  i couldnt say it  why not  dont be hard on him my dear its mr alban morris     chapter l miss ladd advises  mrs ellmother sat by the dying embers of the kitchen fire thinking over the events of the day in perplexity and distress  she had waited at the cottage door for a friendly word with alban after he had left emily the stern despair in his face warned her to let him go in silence she had looked into the parlor next pale and cold emily lay on the sofasunk in helpless depression of body and mind dont speak to me she whispered i am quite worn out it was but too plain that the view of albans conduct which she had already expressed was the view to which she had adhered at the interview between them they had parted in griefperhaps in angerperhaps forever mrs ellmother lifted emily in compassionate silence and carried her upstairs and waited by her until she slept  in the still hours of the night the thoughts of the faithful old servantdwelling for a while on past and presentadvanced by slow degrees to consideration of the doubtful future measuring to the best of her ability the responsibility which had fallen on her she felt that it was more than she could bear or ought to bear alone to whom could she look for help  the gentlefolks at monksmoor were strangers to her doctor allday was near at handbut emily had said dont send for him he will torment me with questionsand i want to keep my mind quiet if i can but one person was left to whose everready kindness mrs ellmother could appealand that person was miss ladd  it would have been easy to ask the help of the good schoolmistress in comforting and advising the favorite pupil whom she loved but mrs ellmother had another object in view she was determined that the coldblooded cruelty of emilys treacherous friend should not be allowed to triumph with impunity if an ignorant old woman could do nothing else she could tell the plain truth and could leave miss ladd to decide whether such a person as francine deserved to remain under her care  to feel justified in taking this step was one thing to put it all clearly in writing was another after vainly making the attempt overnight mrs ellmother tore up her letter and communicated with miss ladd by means of a telegraphic message in the morning miss emily is in great distress i must not leave her i have something besides to say to you which cannot be put into a letter will you please come to us  later in the forenoon mrs ellmother was called to the door by the arrival of a visitor the personal appearance of the stranger impressed her favorably he was a handsome little gentleman his manners were winning and his voice was singularly pleasant to hear  i have come from mr wyvils house in the country he said and i bring a letter from his daughter may i take the opportunity of asking if miss emily is well  far from it sir i am sorry to say she is so poorly that she keeps her bed  at this reply the visitors face revealed such sincere sympathy and regret that mrs ellmother was interested in him she added a word more my mistress has had a hard trial to bear sir i hope there is no bad news for her in the young ladys letter  on the contrary there is news that she will be glad to hearmiss wyvil is coming here this evening will you excuse my asking if miss emily has had medical advice  she wont hear of seeing the doctor sir hes a good friend of hersand he lives close by i am unfortunately alone in the house if i could leave her i would go at once and ask his advice  let me go mirabel eagerly proposed  mrs ellmothers face brightened thats kindly thought of sirif you dont mind the trouble  my good lady nothing is a trouble in your young mistresss service give me the doctors name and addressand tell me what to say to him  theres one thing you must be careful of mrs ellmother answered he mustnt come here as if he had been sent forshe would refuse to see him  mirabel understood her i will not forget to caution him kindly tell miss emily i calledmy name is mirabel i will return tomorrow  he hastened away on his errandonly to find that he had arrived too late doctor allday had left london called away to a serious case of illness he was not expected to get back until late in the afternoon mirabel left a message saying that he would return in the evening  the next visitor who arrived at the cottage was the trusty friend in whose generous nature mrs ellmother had wisely placed confidence miss ladd had resolved to answer the telegram in person the moment she read it  if there is bad news she said let me hear it at once i am not well enough to bear suspense my busy life at the school is beginning to tell on me  there is nothing that need alarm you maambut there is a great deal to say before you see miss emily my stupid head turns giddy with thinking of it i hardly know where to begin  begin with emily miss ladd suggested  mrs ellmother took the advice she described emilys unexpected arrival on the previous day and she repeated what had passed between them afterward miss ladds first impulse when she had recovered her composure was to go to emily without waiting to hear more not presuming to stop her mrs ellmother ventured to put a question do you happen to have my telegram about you maam miss ladd produced it will you please look at the last part of it again  miss ladd read the words i have something besides to say to you which cannot be put into a letter she at once returned to her chair  does what you have still to tell me refer to any person whom i know she said  it refers maam to miss de sor i am afraid i shall distress you  what did i say when i came in miss ladd asked speak out plainly and tryits not easy i knowbut try to begin at the beginning  mrs ellmother looked back through her memory of past events and began by alluding to the feeling of curiosity which she had excited in francine on the day when emily had made them known to one another from this she advanced to the narrative of what had taken place at netherwoodsto the atrocious attempt to frighten her by means of the image of waxto the discovery made by francine in the garden at nightand to the circumstances under which that discovery had been communicated to emily  miss ladds face reddened with indignation are you sure of all that you have said she asked  i am quite sure maam i hope i have not done wrong mrs ellmother added simply in telling you all this  wrong miss ladd repeated warmly if that wretched girl has no defense to offer she is a disgrace to my schooland i owe you a debt of gratitude for showing her to me in her true character she shall return at once to netherwoods and she shall answer me to my entire satisfactionor leave my house what cruelty what duplicity in all my experience of girls i have never met with the like of it let me go to my dear little emilyand try to forget what i have heard  mrs ellmother led the good lady to emilys roomand returning to the lower part of the house went out into the garden the mental effort that she had made had left its result in an aching head and in an overpowering sense of depression a mouthful of fresh air will revive me she thought  the front garden and back garden at the cottage communicated with each other walking slowly round and round mrs ellmother heard footsteps on the road outside which stopped at the gate she looked through the grating and discovered alban morris  come in sir she said rejoiced to see him he obeyed in silence the full view of his face shocked mrs ellmother never in her experience of the friend who had been so kind to her at netherwoods had he looked so old and so haggard as he looked now oh mr alban i see how she has distressed you dont take her at her word keep a good heart siryoung girls are never long together of the same mind  alban gave her his hand i mustnt speak about it he said silence helps me to bear my misfortune as becomes a man i have had some hard blows in my time they dont seem to have blunted my sense of feeling as i thought they had thank god she doesnt know how she has made me suffer i want to ask her pardon for having forgotten myself yesterday i spoke roughly to her at one time no i wont intrude on her i have said i am sorry in writing do you mind giving it to her goodbyand thank you i mustnt stay longer miss ladd expects me at netherwoods  miss ladd is in the house sir at this moment  here in london  upstairs with miss emily  upstairs is emily ill  she is getting better sir would you like to see miss ladd  i should indeed i have something to say to herand time is of importance to me may i wait in the garden  why not in the parlor sir  the parlor reminds me of happier days in time i may have courage enough to look at the room again not now  if she doesnt make it up with that good man mrs ellmother thought on her way back to the house my nursechild is what i have never believed her to be yetshes a fool  in half an hour more miss ladd joined alban on the little plot of grass behind the cottage i bring emilys reply to your letter she said read it before you speak to me  alban read it dont suppose you have offended meand be assured that i feel gratefully the tone in which your note is written i try to write forbearingly on my side i wish i could write acceptably as well it is not to be done i am as unable as ever to enter into your motives you are not my relation you were under no obligation of secrecy you heard me speak ignorantly of the murder of my father as if it had been the murder of a stranger and yet you kept medeliberately cruelly kept medeceived the remembrance of it burns me like fire i cannotoh alban i cannot restore you to the place in my estimation which you have lost if you wish to help me to bear my trouble i entreat you not to write to me again  alban offered the letter silently to miss ladd she signed to him to keep it  i know what emily has written she said and i have told her what i now tell youshe is wrong in every way wrong it is the misfortune of her impetuous nature that she rushes to conclusionsand those conclusions once formed she holds to them with all the strength of her character in this matter she has looked at her side of the question exclusively she is blind to your side  not willfully alban interposed  miss ladd looked at him with admiration you defend emily she said  i love her alban answered  miss ladd felt for him as mrs ellmother had felt for him trust to time mr morris she resumed the danger to be afraid of isthe danger of some headlong action on her part in the interval who can say what the end may be if she persists in her present way of thinking there is something monstrous in a young girl declaring that it is her duty to pursue a murderer and to bring him to justice dont you see it yourself  alban still defended emily it seems to me to be a natural impulse he saidnatural and noble  noble miss ladd exclaimed  yesfor it grows out of the love which has not died with her fathers death  then you encourage her  with my whole heartif she would give me the opportunity  we wont pursue the subject mr morris i am told by mrs ellmother that you have something to say to me what is it  i have to ask you alban replied to let me resign my situation at netherwoods  miss ladd was not only surprised she was alsoa very rare thing with herinclined to be suspicious after what he had said to emily it occurred to her that alban might be meditating some desperate project with the hope of recovering his lost place in her favor  have you heard of some better employment she asked  i have heard of no employment my mind is not in a state to give the necessary attention to my pupils  is that your only reason for wishing to leave me  it is one of my reasons  the only one which you think it necessary to mention  yes  i shall be sorry to lose you mr morris  believe me miss ladd i am not ungrateful for your kindness  will you let me in all kindness say something more miss ladd answered i dont intrude on your secretsi only hope that you have no rash project in view  i dont understand you miss ladd  yes mr morrisyou do  she shook hands with himand went back to emily     chapter li the doctor sees  alban returned to netherwoodsto continue his services until another master could be found to take his place  by a later train miss ladd followed him emily was too well aware of the importance of the mistresss presence to the wellbeing of the school to permit her to remain at the cottage it was understood that they were to correspond and that emilys room was waiting for her at netherwoods whenever she felt inclined to occupy it  mrs ellmother made the tea that evening earlier than usual being alone again with emily it struck her that she might take advantage of her position to say a word in albans favor she had chosen her time unfortunately the moment she pronounced the name emily checked her by a look and spoke of another personthat person being miss jethro  mrs ellmother at once entered her protest in her own downright way whatever you do she said dont go back to that what does miss jethro matter to you  i am more interested in her than you supposei happen to know why she left the school  begging your pardon miss thats quite impossible  she left the school emily persisted for a serious reason miss ladd discovered that she had used false references  good lord who told you that  you see i know it i asked miss ladd how she got her information she was bound by a promise never to mention the persons name i didnt say it to herbut i may say it to you i am afraid i have an idea of who the person was  no mrs ellmother obstinately asserted you cant possibly know who it was how should you know  do you wish me to repeat what i heard in that room opposite when my aunt was dying  drop it miss emily for gods sake drop it  i cant drop it its dreadful to me to have suspicions of my auntand no better reason for them than what she said in a state of delirium tell me if you love me was it her wandering fancy or was it the truth  as i hope to be saved miss emily i can only guess as you doi dont rightly know my mistress trusted me half way as it were im afraid i have a rough tongue of my own sometimes i offended herand from that time she kept her own counsel what she did she did in the dark so far as i was concerned  how did you offend her  i shall be obliged to speak of your father if i tell you how  speak of him  he was not to blamemind that mrs ellmother said earnestly if i wasnt certain of what i say now you wouldnt get a word out of me good harmless mantheres no denying ithe was in love with miss jethro whats the matter  emily was thinking of her memorable conversation with the disgraced teacher on her last night at school nothing she answered go on  if he had not tried to keep it secret from us mrs ellmother resumed your aunt might never have taken it into her head that he was entangled in a love affair of the shameful sort i dont deny that i helped her in her inquiries but it was only because i felt sure from the first that the more she discovered the more certainly my masters innocence would show itself he used to go away and visit miss jethro privately in the time when your aunt trusted me we never could find out where she made that discovery afterward for herself i cant tell you how long afterward and she spent money in employing mean wretches to pry into miss jethros past life she had if you will excuse me for saying it an old maids hatred of the handsome young woman who lured your father away from home and set up a secret in a manner of speaking between her brother and herself i wont tell you how we looked at letters and other things which he forgot to leave under lock and key i will only say there was one bit in a journal he kept which made me ashamed of myself i read it out to miss letitia and i told her in so many words not to count any more on me no i havent got a copy of the wordsi can remember them without a copy even if my religion did not forbid me to peril my soul by leading a life of sin with this woman whom i lovethat was how it beganthe thought of my daughter would keep me pure no conduct of mine shall ever make me unworthy of my childs affection and respect there im making you cry i wont stay here any longer all that i had to say has been said nobody but miss ladd knows for certain whether your aunt was innocent or guilty in the matter of miss jethros disgrace please to excuse me my works waiting downstairs   from time to time as she pursued her domestic labors mrs ellmother thought of mirabel hours on hours had passedand the doctor had not appeared was he too busy to spare even a few minutes of his time or had the handsome little gentleman after promising so fairly failed to perform his errand this last doubt wronged mirabel he had engaged to return to the doctors house and he kept his word  doctor allday was at home again and was seeing patients introduced in his turn mirabel had no reason to complain of his reception at the same time after he had stated the object of his visit something odd began to show itself in the doctors manner  he looked at mirabel with an appearance of uneasy curiosity and he contrived an excuse for altering the visitors position in the room so that the light fell full on mirabels face  i fancy i must have seen you the doctor said at some former time  i am ashamed to say i dont remember it mirabel answered  ah very likely im wrong ill call on miss emily sir you may depend on it  left in his consultingroom doctor allday failed to ring the bell which summoned the next patient who was waiting for him he took his diary from the table drawer and turned to the daily entries for the past month of july  arriving at the fifteenth day of the month he glanced at the first lines of writing a visit from a mysterious lady calling herself miss jethro our conference led to some very unexpected results  no that was not what he was in search of he looked a little lower down and read on regularly from that point as follows  called on miss emily in great anxiety about the discoveries which she might make among her aunts papers papers all destroyed thank godexcept the handbill offering a reward for discovery of the murderer which she found in the scrapbook gave her back the handbill emily much surprised that the wretch should have escaped with such a careful description of him circulated everywhere she read the description aloud to me in her nice clear voice supposed age between twentyfive and thirty years a wellmade man of small stature fai r complexion delicate features clear blue eyes hair light and cut rather short clean shaven with the exception of narrow halfwhiskersand so on emily at a loss to understand how the fugitive could disguise himself reminded her that he could effectually disguise his head and face with time to help him by letting his hair grow long and cultivating his beard emily not convinced even by this selfevident view of the case changed the subject  the doctor put away his diary and rang the bell  curious he thought that dandified little clergyman has certainly reminded me of my discussion with emily more than two months since was it his flowing hair i wonder or his splendid beard good god suppose it should turn out  he was interrupted by the appearance of his patient other ailing people followed doctor alldays mind was professionally occupied for the rest of the evening     chapter lii if i could find a friend  shortly after miss ladd had taken her departure a parcel arrived for emily bearing the name of a bookseller printed on the label it was large and it was heavy reading enough i should think to last for a lifetime mrs ellmother remarked after carrying the parcel upstairs  emily called her back as she was leaving the room i want to caution you she said before miss wyvil comes dont tell herdont tell anybodyhow my father met his death if other persons are taken into our confidence they will talk of it we dont know how near to us the murderer may be the slightest hint may put him on his guard  oh miss are you still thinking of that  i think of nothing else  bad for your mind miss emilyand bad for your body as your looks show i wish you would take counsel with some discreet person before you move in this matter by yourself  emily sighed wearily in my situation where is the person whom i can trust  you can trust the good doctor  can i perhaps i was wrong when i told you i wouldnt see him he might be of some use to me  mrs ellmother made the most of this concession in the fear that emily might change her mind doctor allday may call on you tomorrow she said  do you mean that you have sent for him  dont be angry i did it for the bestand mr mirabel agreed with me  mr mirabel what have you told mr mirabel  nothing except that you are ill when he heard that he proposed to go for the doctor he will be here again tomorrow to ask for news of your health will you see him  i dont know yeti have other things to think of bring miss wyvil up here when she comes  am i to get the spare room ready for her  no she is staying with her father at the london house  emily made that reply almost with an air of relief when cecilia arrived it was only by an effort that she could show grateful appreciation of the sympathy of her dearest friend when the visit came to an end she felt an ungrateful sense of freedom the restraint was off her mind she could think again of the one terrible subject that had any interest for her now over love over friendship over the natural enjoyment of her young life predominated the blighting resolution which bound her to avenge her fathers death her dearest remembrances of himtender remembrances oncenow burned in her to use her own words like fire it was no ordinary love that had bound parent and child together in the bygone time emily had grown from infancy to girlhood owing all the brightness of her lifea life without a mother without brothers without sistersto her father alone to submit to lose this beloved this only companion by the cruel stroke of disease was of all trials of resignation the hardest to bear but to be severed from him by the murderous hand of a man was more than emilys fervent nature could passively endure before the garden gate had closed on her friend she had returned to her one thought she was breathing again her one aspiration the books that she had ordered with her own purpose in viewbooks that might supply her want of experience and might reveal the perils which beset the course that lay before herwere unpacked and spread out on the table hour after hour when the old servant believed that her mistress was in bed she was absorbed over biographies in english and french which related the stratagems by means of which famous policemen had captured the worst criminals of their time from these she turned to works of fiction which found their chief topic of interest in dwelling on the discovery of hidden crime the night passed and dawn glimmered through the windowand still she opened book after book with sinking courageand still she gained nothing but the disheartening conviction of her inability to carry out her own plans almost every page that she turned over revealed the immovable obstacles set in her way by her sex and her age could she mix with the people or visit the scenes familiar to the experience of men in fact and in fiction who had traced the homicide to his hidingplace and had marked him among his harmless fellowcreatures with the brand of cain no a young girl following or attempting to follow that career must reckon with insult and outragepaying their abominable tribute to her youth and her beauty at every turn what proportion would the men who might respect her bear to the men who might make her the object of advances which it was hardly possible to imagine without shuddering she crept exhausted to her bed the most helpless hopeless creature on the wide surface of the eartha girl selfdevoted to the task of a man    careful to perform his promise to mirabel without delay the doctor called on emily early in the morningbefore the hour at which he usually entered his consultingroom  well whats the matter with the pretty young mistress he asked in his most abrupt manner when mrs ellmother opened the door is it love or jealousy or a new dress with a wrinkle in it  you will hear about it sir from miss emily herself i am forbidden to say anything  but you mean to say somethingfor all that  dont joke doctor allday the state of things here is a great deal too serious for joking make up your mind to be surprisedi say no more  before the doctor could ask what this meant emily opened the parlor door come in she said impatiently  doctor alldays first greeting was strictly professional my dear child i never expected this he began you are looking wretchedly ill he attempted to feel her pulse she drew her hand away from him  its my mind thats ill she answered feeling my pulse wont cure me of anxiety and distress i want advice i want help dear old doctor you have always been a good friend to mebe a better friend than ever now  what can i do  promise you will keep secret what i am going to say to youand listen pray listen patiently till i have done  doctor allday promised and listened he had been in some degree at least prepared for a surprisebut the disclosure which now burst on him was more than his equanimity could sustain he looked at emily in silent dismay she had surprised and shocked him not only by what she said but by what she unconsciously suggested was it possible that mirabels personal appearance had produced on her the same impression which was present in his own mind his first impulse when he was composed enough to speak urged him to put the question cautiously  if you happened to meet with the suspected man he said have you any means of identifying him  none whatever doctor if you would only think it over  he stopped her there convinced of the danger of encouraging her and resolved to act on his conviction  i have enough to occupy me in my profession he said ask your other friend to think it over  what other friend  mr alban morris  the moment he pronounced the name he saw that he had touched on some painful association has mr morris refused to help you he inquired  i have not asked him to help me  why  there was no choice with such a man as doctor allday between offending him or answering him emily adopted the last alternative on this occasion she had no reason to complain of his silence  your view of mr morriss conduct surprises me he repliedsurprises me more than i can say he added remembering that he too was guilty of having kept her in ignorance of the truth out of regardmistaken regard as it now seemed to befor her peace of mind  be good to me and pass it over if i am wrong emily said i cant dispute with you i can only tell you what i feel you have always been so kind to memay i count on your kindness still  doctor allday relapsed into silence  may i at least ask she went on if you know anything of persons she paused discouraged by the cold expression of inquiry in the old mans eyes as he looked at her  what persons he said  persons whom i suspect  name them  emily named the landlady of the inn at zeeland she could now place the right interpretation on mrs rooks conduct when the locket had been put into her hand at netherwoods doctor allday answered shortly and stiffly he had never even seen mrs rook emily mentioned miss jethro nextand saw at once that she had interested him  what do you suspect miss jethro of doing he asked  i suspect her of knowing more of my fathers death than she is willing to acknowledge emily replied  the doctors manner altered for the better i agree with you he said frankly but i have some knowledge of that lady i warn you not to waste time and trouble in trying to discover the weak side of miss jethro  that was not my experience of her at school emily rejoined at the same time i dont know what may have happened since those days i may perhaps have lost the place i once held in her regard  how  through my aunt  through your aunt  i hope and trust i am wrong emily continued but i fear my aunt had something to do with miss jethros dismissal from the schooland in that case miss jethro may have found it out her eyes resting on the doctor suddenly brightened you know something about it she exclaimed  he considered a littlewhether he should or should not tell her of the letter addressed by miss ladd to miss letitia which he had found at the cottage  if i could satisfy you that your fears are well founded he asked would the discovery keep you away from miss jethro  i should be ashamed to speak to hereven if we met  very well i can tell you positively that your aunt was the person who turned miss jethro out of the school when i get home i will send you a letter that proves it  emilys head sank on her breast why do i only hear of this now she said  because i had no reason for letting you know of it before today if i have done nothing else i have at least succeeded in keeping you and miss jethro apart  emily looked at him in alarm he went on without appearing to notice that he had startled her i wish to god i could as easily put a stop to the mad project which you are contemplating  the mad project emily repeated oh doctor allday do you cruelly leave me to myself at the time of all others when i am most in need of your sympathy  that appeal moved him he spoke more gently he pitied while he condemned her  my poor dear child i should be cruel indeed if i encouraged you you are giving yourself up to an enterprise so shockingly unsuited to a young girl like you that i declare i contemplate it with horror think i entreat you think and let me hear that you have yieldednot to my poor entreatiesbut to your own better sense his voice faltered his eyes moistened i shall make a fool of myself he burst out furiously if i stay here any longer goodby  he left her  she walked to the window and looked out at the fair morning no one to feel for herno one to understand hernothing nearer that could speak to poor mortality of hope and encouragement than the bright heaven so far away she turned from the window the sun shines on the murderer she thought as it shines on me  she sat down at the table and tried to quiet her mind to think steadily to some good purpose of the few friends that she possessed every one had declared that she was in the wrong had they lost the one loved being of all beings on earth and lost him by the hand of a homicideand that homicide free all that was faithful all that was devoted in the girls nature held her to her desperate resolution as with a hand of iron if she shrank at that miserable moment it was not from her designit was from the sense of her own helplessness oh if i had been a man she said to herself oh if i could find a friend     chapter liii the friend is found  mrs ellmother looked into the parlor i told you mr mirabel would call again she announced here he is  has he asked to see me  he leaves it entirely to you  for a moment and a moment only emily was undecided show him in she said  mirabels embarrassment was visible the moment he entered the room for the first time in his lifein the presence of a womanthe popular preacher was shy he who had taken hundreds of fair hands with sympathetic pressurehe who had offered fluent consolation abroad and at home to beauty in distresswas conscious of a rising color and was absolutely at a loss for words when emily received him and yet though he appeared at disadvantageand worse still though he was aware of it himselfthere was nothing contemptible in his look and manner his silence and confusion revealed a change in him which inspired respect love had developed this spoiled darling of foolish congregations this effeminate pet of drawingrooms and boudoirs into the likeness of a manand no woman in emilys position could have failed to see that it was love which she herself had inspired  equally ill at ease they both took refuge in the commonplace phrases suggested by the occasion these exhausted there was a pause mirabel alluded to cecilia as a means of continuing the conversation  have you seen miss wyvil he inquired  she was here last night and i expect to see her again today before she returns to monksmoor with her father do you go back with them  yesif you do  i remain in london  then i remain in london too  the strong feeling that was in him had forced its way to expression at last in happier dayswhen she had persistently refused to let him speak to her seriouslyshe would have been ready with a lighthearted reply she was silent now mirabel pleaded with her not to misunderstand him by an honest confession of his motives which presented him under a new aspect the easy plausible man who had hardly ever seemed to be in earnest beforemeant seriously meant what he said now  may i try to explain myself he asked  certainly if you wish it  pray dont suppose me capable mirabel said earnestly of presuming to pay you an idle compliment i cannot think of you alone and in trouble without feeling anxiety which can only be relieved in one wayi must be near enough to hear of you day by day not by repeating this visit unless you wish it i will not again cross the threshold of your door mrs ellmother will tell me if your mind is more at ease mrs ellmother will tell me if there is any new trial of your fortitude she neednt even mention that i have been speaking to her at the door and she may be sure and you may be sure that i shall ask no inquisitive questions i can feel for you in your misfortune without wishing to know what that misfortune is if i can ever be of the smallest use think of me as your other servant say to mrs ellmother i want himand say no more  where is the woman who could have resisted such devotion as thisinspired truly inspired by herself emilys eyes softened as she answered him  you little know how your kindness touches me she said  dont speak of my kindness until you have put me to the proof he interposed can a friend such a friend as i am i mean be of any use  of the greatest use if i could feel justified in trying you  i entreat you to try me  but mr mirabel you dont know what i am thinking of  i dont want to know  i may be wrong my friends all say i am wrong  i dont care what your friends say i dont care about any earthly thing but your tranquillity does your dog ask whether you are right or wrong i am your dog i think of you and i think of nothing else  she looked back through the experience of the last few days miss laddmrs ellmotherdoctor allday not one of them had felt for her not one of them had spoken to her as this man had felt and had spoken she remembered the dreadful sense of solitude and helplessness which had wrung her heart in the interval before mirabel came in her father himself could hardly have been kinder to her than this friend of a few weeks only she looked at him through her tears she could say nothing that was eloquent nothing even that was adequate you are very good to me was her only acknowledgment of all that he had offered how poor it seemed to be and yet how much it meant  he rosesaying considerately that he would leave her to recover herself and would wait to hear if he was wanted  no she said i must not let you go in common gratitude i ought to decide before you leave me and i do decide to take you into my confidence she hesitated her color rose a little i know how unselfishly you offer me your help she resumed i know you speak to me as a brother might speak to a sister  he gently interrupted her no he said i cant honestly claim to do that andmay i venture to remind youyou know why  she started her eyes rested on him with a momentary expression of reproach  is it quite fair she asked in my situation to say that  would it have been quite fair he rejoined to allow you to deceive yourself should i deserve to be taken into your confidence if i encouraged you to trust me under false pretenses not a word more of those hopes on which the happiness of my life depends shall pass my lips unless you permit it in my devotion to your interests i promise to forget myself my motives may be misinterpreted my position may be misunderstood ignorant people may take me for that other happier man who is an object of interest to you  stop mr mirabel the person to whom you refer has no such claim on me as you suppose  dare i say how happy i am to hear it will you forgive me  i will forgive you if you say no more  their eyes met completely overcome by the new hope that she had inspired mirabel was unable to answer her his sensitive nerves trembled under emotion like the nerves of a woman his delicate complexion faded away slowly into whiteness emily was alarmedhe seemed to be on the point of fainting she ran to the window to open it more widely  pray dont trouble yourself he said i am easily agitated by any sudden sensationand i am a little overcome at this moment by my own happiness  let me give you a glass of wine  thank youi dont need it indeed  you really feel better  i feel quite well againand eager to hear how i can serve you  its a long story mr mirabeland a dreadful story  dreadful  yes let me tell you first how you can serve me i am in search of a man who has done me the cruelest wrong that one human creature can inflict on another but the chances are all against mei am only a woman and i dont know how to take even the first step toward discovery  you will know when i guide you  he reminded her tenderly of what she might expect from him and was rewarded by a grateful look seeing nothing suspecting nothing they advanced together nearer and nearer to the end  once or twice emily continued i spoke to you of my poor father when we were at monksmoorand i must speak of him again you could have no interest in inquiring about a strangerand you cannot have heard how he died  pardon me i heard from mr wyvil how he died  you heard what i had told mr wyvil emily said i was wrong  wrong mirabel exclaimed in a tone of courteous surprise was it not a sudden death  it was a sudden death  caused by disease of the heart  caused by no disease i have been deceived about my fathers deathand i have only discovered it a few days since  at the impending moment of the frightful shock which she was innocently about to inflict on him she stoppeddoubtful whether it would be best to relate how the discovery had been made or to pass at once to the result mirabel supposed that she had paused to control her agitation he was so immeasurably far away from the faintest suspicion of what was coming that he exerted his ingenuity in the hope of sparing her  i can anticipate the rest he said your sad loss has been caused by some fatal accident let us change the subject tell me more of that man whom i must help you to find it will only distress you to dwell on your fathers death  distress me she repeated his death maddens me  oh dont say that  hear me hear me my father died murdered at zeelandand the man you must help me to find is the wretch who killed him  she started to her feet with a cry of terror mirabel dropped from his chair senseless to the floor     chapter liv the end of the fainting fit  emily recovered her presence of mind she opened the door so as to make a draught of air in the room and called for water returning to mirabel she loosened his cravat mrs ellmother came in just in time to prevent her from committing a common error in the treatment of fainting persons by raising mirabels head the current of air and the sprinkling of water over his face soon produced their customary effect hell come round directly mrs ellmother remarked your aunt was sometimes taken with these swoons miss and i know something about them he looks a poor weak creature in spite of his big beard has anything frightened him  emily little knew how correctly that chance guess had hit on the truth  nothing can possibly have frightened him she replied i am afraid he is in bad health he turned suddenly pale while we were talking and i thought he was going to be taken ill he made light of it and seemed to recover unfortunately i was right it was the threatening of a fainting fithe dropped on the floor a minute afterward  a sigh fluttered over mirabels lips his eyes opened looked at mrs ellmother in vacant terror and closed again emily whispered to her to leave the room the old woman smiled satirically as she opened the doorthen looked back with a sudden change of humor to see the kind young mistress bending over the feeble little clergyman set herby some strange association of ideasthinking of alban morris ah she muttered to herself on her way out i call him a man  there was wine in the sideboardthe wine which emily had once already offered in vain mirabel drank it eagerly this time he looked round the room as if he wished to be sure that they were alone have i fallen to a low place in your estimation he asked smiling faintly i am afraid you will think poorly enough of your new ally after this  i only think you should take more care of your health emily replied with sincere interest in his recovery let me leave you to rest on the sofa  he refused to remain at the cottagehe asked with a sudden change to fretfulness if she would let her servant get him a cab she ventured to doubt whether he was quite strong enough yet to go away by himself he reiterated piteously reiterated his request a passing cab was stopped directly emily accompanied him to the gate i know what to do he said in a hurried absent way rest and a little tonic medicine will soon set me right the clammy coldness of his skin made emily shudder as they shook hands you wont think the worse of me for this he asked  how can you imagine such a thing she answered warmly  will you see me if i come tomorrow  i shall be anxious to see you  so they parted emily returned to the house pitying him with all her heart     book the sixthhere and there    chapter lv mirabel sees his way  reaching the hotel at which he was accustomed to stay when he was in london mirabel locked the door of his room he looked at the houses on the opposite side of the street his mind was in such a state of morbid distrust that he lowered the blind over the window in solitude and obscurity the miserable wretch sat down in a corner and covered his face with his hands and tried to realize what had happened to him  nothing had been said at the fatal interview with emily which could have given him the slightest warning of what was to come her fathers nameabsolutely unknown to him when he fled from the innhad only been communicated to the public by the newspaper reports of the adjourned inquest at the time when those reports appeared he was in hiding under circumstances which prevented him from seeing a newspaper while the murder was still a subject of conversation he was in francefar out of the track of english travelersand he remained on the continent until the summer of eighteen hundred and eightyone no exercise of discretion on his part could have extricated him from the terrible position in which he was now placed he stood pledged to emily to discover the man suspected of the murder of her father and that man washimself  what refuge was left open to him  if he took to flight his sudden disappearance would be a suspicious circumstance in itself and would therefore provoke inquiries which might lead to serious results supposing that he overlooked the risk thus presented would he be capable of enduring a separation from emily which might be a separation for life even in the first horror of discovering his situation her influence remained unshakenthe animating spirit of the one manly capacity for resistance which raised him above the reach of his own fears the only prospect before him which he felt himself to be incapable of contemplating was the prospect of leaving emily  having arrived at this conclusion his fears urged him to think of providing for his own safety  the first precaution to adopt was to separate emily from friends whose advice might be hostile to his interestsperhaps even subversive of his security to effect this design he had need of an ally whom he could trust that ally was at his disposal far away in the north  at the time when francines jealousy began to interfere with all freedom of intercourse between emily and himself at monksmoor he had contemplated making arrangements which might enable them to meet at the house of his invalid sister mrs delvin he had spoken of her and of the bodily affliction which confined her to her room in terms which had already interested emily in the present emergency he decided on returning to the subject and on hastening the meeting between the two women which he had first suggested at mr wyvils country seat  no time was to be lost in carrying out this intention he wrote to mrs delvin by that days post confiding to her in the first place the critical position in which he now found himself this done he proceeded as follows  to your sound judgment dearest agatha it may appear that i am making myself needlessly uneasy about the future two persons only know that i am the man who escaped from the inn at zeeland you are one of them and miss jethro is the other on you i can absolutely rely and after my experience of her i ought to feel sure of miss jethro i admit this but i cannot get over my distrust of emilys friends i fear the cunning old doctor i doubt mr wyvil i hate alban morris  do me a favor my dear invite emily to be your guest and so separate her from these friends the old servant who attends on her will be included in the invitation of course mrs ellmother is as i believe devoted to the interests of mr alban morris she will be well out of the way of doing mischief while we have her safe in your northern solitude  there is no fear that emily will refuse your invitation  in the first place she is already interested in you in the second place i shall consider the small proprieties of social life and instead of traveling with her to your house i shall follow by a later train in the third place i am now the chosen adviser in whom she trusts and what i tell her to do she will do it pains me really and truly pains me to be compelled to deceive herbut the other alternative is to reveal myself as the wretch of whom she is in search was there ever such a situation and oh agatha i am so fond of her if i fail to persuade her to be my wife i dont care what becomes of me i used to think disgrace and death on the scaffold the most frightful prospect that a man can contemplate in my present frame of mind a life without emily may just as well end in that way as in any other when we are together in your old seabeaten tower do your best my dear to incline the heart of this sweet girl toward me if she remains in london how do i know that mr morris may not recover the place he has lost in her good opinion the bare idea of it turns me cold  there is one more point on which i must touch before i can finish my letter  when you last wrote you told me that sir jervis redwood was not expected to live much longer and that the establishment would be broken up after his death can you find out for me what will become under the circumstances of mr and mrs rook so far as i am concerned i dont doubt that the alteration in my personal appearance which has protected me for years past may be trusted to preserve me from recognition by these two people but it is of the utmost importance remembering the project to which emily has devoted herself that she should not meet with mrs rook they have been already in correspondence and mrs rook has expressed an intention if the opportunity offers itself of calling at the cottage another reason and a pressing reason for removing emily from london we can easily keep the rooks out of your house but i own i should feel more at my ease if i heard that they had left northumberland  with that confession mrs delvins brother closed his letter     chapter lvi alban sees his way  during the first days of mirabels sojourn at his hotel in london events were in progress at netherwoods affecting the interests of the man who was the especial object of his distrust not long after miss ladd had returned to her school she heard of an artist who was capable of filling the place to be vacated by alban morris it was then the twentythird of the month in four days more the new master would be ready to enter on his duties and alban would be at liberty  on the twentyfourth alban received a telegram which startled him the person sending the message was mrs ellmother and the words were meet me at your railway station today at two oclock  he found the old woman in the waitingroom and he met with a rough reception  minutes are precious mr morris she said you are two minutes late the next train to london stops here in half an hourand i must go back by it  good heavens what brings you here is emily  emily is well enough in healthif thats what you mean as to why i come here the reason is that its a deal easier for me worse luck to take this journey than to write a letter one good turn deserves another i dont forget how kind you were to me away there at the schooland i cant and wont see whats going on at the cottage behind your back without letting you know of it oh you neednt be alarmed about her ive made an excuse to get away for a few hoursbut i havent left her by herself miss wyvil has come to london again and mr mirabel spends the best part of his time with her excuse me for a moment will you im so thirsty after the journey i can hardly speak  she presented herself at the counter in the waitingroom ill trouble you young woman for a glass of ale she returned to alban in a better humor its not bad stuff that when i have said my say ill have a drop morejust to wash the taste of mr mirabel out of my mouth wait a bit i have something to ask you how much longer are you obliged to stop here teaching the girls to draw  i leave netherwoods in three days more alban replied  thats all right you may be in time to bring miss emily to her senses yet  what do you mean  i meanif you dont stop itshe will marry the parson  i cant believe it mrs ellmother i wont believe it  ah its a comfort to him poor fellow to say that look here mr morris this is how it stands youre in disgrace with miss emilyand he profits by it i was fool enough to take a liking to mr mirabel when i first opened the door to him i know better now he got on the blind side of me and now he has got on the blind side of her shall i tell you how by doing what you would have done if you had had the chance hes helping heror pretending to help her i dont know whichto find the man who murdered poor mr brown after four years and when all the police in england with a reward to encourage them did their best and it came to nothing  never mind that alban said impatiently i want to know how mr mirabel is helping her  thats more than i can tell you you dont suppose they take me into their confidence all i can do is to pick up a word here and there when fine weather tempts them out into the garden she tells him to suspect mrs rook and to make inquiries after miss jethro and he has his plans and he writes them down which is dead against his doing anything useful in my opinion i dont hold with your scribblers at the same time i wouldnt count too positively in your place on his being likely to fail that little mirabelif it wasnt for his beard i should believe he was a woman and a sickly woman too he fainted in our house the other daythat little mirabel is in earnest rather than leave miss emily from saturday to monday he has got a parson out of employment to do his sunday work for him and whats more he has persuaded her for some reasons of his own to leave london next week  is she going back to monksmoor  not she mr mirabel has got a sister a widow lady shes a cripple or something of the sort her name is mrs delvin she lives far away in the north country by the sea and miss emily is going to stay with her  are you sure of that  sure ive seen the letter  do you mean the letter of invitation  yesi do miss emily herself showed it to me im to go with herin attendance on my mistress as the lady puts it this i will say for mrs delvin her handwriting is a credit to the school that taught her and the poor bedridden creature words her invitation so nicely that i myself couldnt have resisted itand im a hard one as you know you dont seem to heed me mr morris  i beg your pardon i was thinking  thinking of whatif i may make so bold  of going back to london with you instead of waiting till the new master comes to take my place  dont do that sir you would do harm instead of good if you showed yourself at the cottage now besides it would not be fair to miss ladd to leave her before the other man takes your girls off your hands trust me to look after your interests and dont go near miss emilydont even write to herunless you have got something to say about the murder which she will be eager to hear make some discovery in that direction mr morris while the parson is only trying to do it or pretending to do itand ill answer for the result look at the clock in ten minutes more the train will be here my memory isnt as good as it was but i do think i have told you all i had to tell  you are the best of good friends alban said warmly  never mind about that sir if you want to do a friendly thing in return tell me if you know what has become of miss de sor  she has returned to netherwoods  aha miss ladd is as good as her word would you mind writing to tell me of it if miss de sor leaves the school again good lord there she is on the platform with bag and baggage dont let her see me mr morris if she comes in here i shall set the marks of my ten fingernails on that false face of hers as sure as i am a christian woman  alban placed himself at the door so as to hide mrs ellmother there indeed was francine accompanied by one of the teachers at the school she took a seat on the bench outside the bookingoffice in a state of sullen indifferenceabsorbed in herselfnoticing nothing urged by ungovernable curiosity mrs ellmother stole on tiptoe to albans side to look at her to a person acquainted with the circumstances there could be no possible doubt of what had happened francine had failed to excuse herself and had been dismissed from miss ladds house  i would have traveled to the worlds end mrs ellmother said to see that  she returned to her place in the waitingroom perfectly satisfied  the teacher noticed alban on leaving the bookingoffice after taking the tickets i shall be glad she said looking toward francine when i have resigned the charge of that young lady to the person who is to receive her in london  is she to be sent back to her parents alban asked  we dont know yet miss ladd will write to st domingo by the next mail in the meantime her fathers agent in londonthe same person who pays her allowancetakes care of her until he hears from the west indies  does she consent to this  she doesnt seem to care what becomes of her miss ladd has given her every opportunity of explaining and excusing herself and has produced no impression you can see the state she is in our good mistressalways hopeful even in the worst cases as you knowthinks she is feeling ashamed of herself and is too proud and selfwilled to own it my own idea is that some secret disappointment is weighing on her mind perhaps i am wrong  no miss ladd was wrong and the teacher was right  the passion of revenge being essentially selfish in its nature is of all passions the narrowest in its range of view in gratifying her jealous hatred of emily francine had correctly foreseen consequences as they might affect the other object of her enmityalban morris but she had failed to perceive the imminent danger of another result which in a calmer frame of mind might not have escaped discovery in triumphing over emily and alban she had been the indirect means of inflicting on herself the bitterest of all disappointmentsshe had brought emily and mirabel together the first forewarning of this catastrophe had reached her on hearing that mirabel would not return to monksmoor her worst fears had been thereafter confirmed by a letter from cecilia which had followed her to netherwoods from that moment she who had made others wretched paid the penalty in suffering as keen as any that she had inflicted completely prostrated powerless through ignorance of his address in london to make a last appeal to mirabel she was literally as had just been said careless what became of her when the train approached she sprang to her feetadvanced to the edge of the platformand suddenly drew back shuddering the teacher looked in terror at alban had the desperate girl meditated throwing herself under the wheels of the engine the thought had been in both their minds but neither of them acknowledged it francine stepped quietly into the carriage when the train drew up and laid her head back in a corner and closed her eyes mrs ellmother took her place in another compartment and beckoned to alban to speak to her at the window  where can i see you when you go to london she asked  at doctor alldays house  on what day  on tuesday next     chapter lvii approaching the end  alban reached london early enough in the afternoon to find the doctor at his luncheon too late to see mrs ellmother he announced sit down and have something to eat  has she left any message for me  a message my good friend that you wont like to hear she is off with her mistress this morning on a visit to mr mirabels sister  does he go with them  no he follows by a later train  has mrs ellmother mentioned the address  there it is in her own handwriting  alban read the addressmrs delvin the clink belford northumberland  turn to the back of that bit of paper the doctor said mrs ellmother has written something on it  she had written these words no discoveries made by mr mirabel up to this time sir jervis redwood is dead the rooks are believed to be in scotland and miss emily if need be is to help the parson to find them no news of miss jethro  now you have got your information doctor allday resumed let me have a look at you youre not in a rage thats a good sign to begin with  i am not the less determined alban answered  to bring emily to her senses the doctor asked  to do what mirabel has not doneand then to let her choose between us  ay ay your good opinion of her hasnt altered though she has treated you so badly  my good opinion makes allowance for the state of my poor darlings mind after the shock that has fallen on her alban answered quietly she is not my emily now she will be my emily yet i told her i was convinced of it in the old days at schooland my conviction is as strong as ever have you seen her since i have been away at netherwoods  yes and she is as angry with me as she is with you  for the same reason  no no i heard enough to warn me to hold my tongue i refused to help herthats all you are a man and you may run risks which no young girl ought to encounter do you remember when i asked you to drop all further inquiries into the murder for emilys sake the circumstances have altered since that time can i be of any use  of the greatest use if you can give me miss jethros address  oh you mean to begin in that way do you  yes you know that miss jethro visited me at netherwoods  go on  she showed me your answer to a letter which she had written to you have you got that letter  doctor allday produced it the address was at a postoffice in a town on the south coast looking up when he had copied it alban saw the doctors eyes fixed on him with an oddlymingled expression partly of sympathy partly of hesitation  have you anything to suggest he asked  you will get nothing out of miss jethro the doctor answered unless there he stopped  unless what  unless you can frighten her  how am i to do that  after a little reflection doctor allday returned without any apparent reason to the subject of his last visit to emily  there was one thing she said in the course of our talk he continued which struck me as being sensible possibly for we are all more or less conceited because i agreed with her myself she suspects miss jethro of knowing more about that damnable murder than miss jethro is willing to acknowledge if you want to produce the right effect on her he looked hard at alban and checked himself once more  well what am i to do  tell her you have an idea of who the murderer is  but i have no idea  but i have  good god what do you mean  dont mistake me an impression has been produced on my mindthats all call it a freak or fancy worth trying perhaps as a bold experiment and worth nothing more come a little nearer my housekeeper is an excellent woman but i have once or twice caught her rather too near to that door i think ill whisper it  he did whisper it in breathless wonder alban heard of the doubt which had crossed doctor alldays mind on the evening when mirabel had called at his house  you look as if you didnt believe it the doctor remarked  im thinking of emily for her sake i hope and trust you are wrong ought i to go to her at once i dont know what to do  find out first my good fellow whether i am right or wrong you can do it if you will run the risk with miss jethro  alban recovered himself his old friends advice was clearly the right advice to follow he examined his railway guide and then looked at his watch if i can find miss jethro he answered ill risk it before the day is out  the doctor accompanied him to the door you will write to me wont you  without fail thank youand goodby   book the sevenththe clink    chapter lviii a council of two  early in the last century one of the picturesque race of robbers and murderers practicing the vices of humanity on the borderlands watered by the river tweed built a tower of stone on the coast of northumberland he lived joyously in the perpetration of atrocities and he died penitent under the direction of his priest since that event he has figured in poems and pictures and has been greatly admired by modern ladies and gentlemen whom he would have outraged and robbed if he had been lucky enough to meet with them in the good old times  his son succeeded him and failed to profit by the paternal example that is to say he made the fatal mistake of fighting for other people instead of fighting for himself  in the rebellion of fortyfive this northern squire sided to serious purpose with prince charles and the highlanders he lost his head and his children lost their inheritance in the lapse of years the confiscated property fell into the hands of strangers the last of whom having a taste for the turf discovered in course of time that he was in want of money a retired merchant named delvin originally of french extraction took a liking to the wild situation and purchased the tower his wifealready in failing healthhad been ordered by the doctors to live a quiet life by the sea her husbands death left her a rich and lonely widow by day and night alike a prisoner in her room wasted by disease and having but two interests which reconciled her to lifewriting poetry in the intervals of pain and paying the debts of a reverend brother who succeeded in the pulpit and prospered nowhere else  in the later days of its life the tower had been greatly improved as a place of residence the contrast was remarkable between the dreary gray outer walls and the luxuriously furnished rooms inside rising by two at a time to the lofty eighth story of the building among the scattered populace of the country round the tower was still known by the odd name given to it in the bygone timethe clink it had been so called as was supposed in allusion to the noise made by loose stones washed backward and forward at certain times of the tide in hollows of the rock on which the building stood  on the evening of her arrival at mrs delvins retreat emily retired at an early hour fatigued by her long journey mirabel had an opportunity of speaking with his sister privately in her own room  send me away agatha if i disturb you he said and let me know when i can see you in the morning  my dear miles have you forgotten that i am never able to sleep in calm weather my lullaby for years past has been the moaning of the great north sea under my window listen there is not a sound outside on this peaceful night it is the right time of the tide just nowand yet the clink is not to be heard is the moon up  mirabel opened the curtains the whole sky is one great abyss of black he answered if i was superstitious i should think that horrid darkness a bad omen for the future are you suffering agatha  not just now i suppose i look sadly changed for the worse since you saw me last  but for the feverish brightness of her eyes she would have looked like a corpse her wrinkled forehead her hollow cheeks her white lips told their terrible tale of the suffering of years the ghastly appearance of her face was heightened by the furnishing of the room this doomed woman dying slowly day by day delighted in bright colors and sumptuous materials the paper on the walls the curtains the carpet presented the hues of the rainbow she lay on a couch covered with purple silk under draperies of green velvet to keep her warm rich lace hid h er scanty hair turning prematurely gray brilliant rings glittered on her bony fingers the room was in a blaze of light from lamps and candles even the wine at her side that kept her alive had been decanted into a bottle of lustrous venetian glass my grave is open she used to say and i want all these beautiful things to keep me from looking at it i should die at once if i was left in the dark  her brother sat by the couch thinking shall i tell you what is in your mind she asked  mirabel humored the caprice of the moment tell me he said  you want to know what i think of emily she answered your letter told me you were in love but i didnt believe your letter i have always doubted whether you were capable of feeling true loveuntil i saw emily the moment she entered the room i knew that i had never properly appreciated my brother you are in love with her miles and you are a better man than i thought you does that express my opinion  mirabel took her wasted hand and kissed it gratefully  what a position i am in he said to love her as i love her and if she knew the truth to be the object of her horrorto be the man whom she would hunt to the scaffold as an act of duty to the memory of her father  you have left out the worst part of it mrs delvin reminded him you have bound yourself to help her to find the man your one hope of persuading her to become your wife rests on your success in finding him and you are the man there is your situation you cant submit to it how can you escape from it  you are trying to frighten me agatha  i am trying to encourage you to face your position boldly  i am doing my best mirabel said with sullen resignation fortune has favored me so far i have really and truly been unable to satisfy emily by discovering miss jethro she has left the place at which i saw her lastthere is no trace to be found of herand emily knows it  dont forget mrs delvin replied that there is a trace to be found of mrs rook and that emily expects you to follow it  mirabel shuddered i am surrounded by dangers whichever way i look he said do what i may it turns out to be wrong i was wrong perhaps when i brought emily here  no  i could easily make an excuse mirabel persisted and take her back to london  and for all you know to the contrary his wiser sister replied mrs rook may go to london and you may take emily back in time to receive her at the cottage in every way you are safer in my old tower anddont forgetyou have got my money to help you if you want it in my belief miles you will want it  you are the dearest and best of sisters what do you recommend me to do  what you would have been obliged to do mrs delvin answered if you had remained in london you must go to redwood hall tomorrow as emily has arranged it if mrs rook is not there you must ask for her address in scotland if nobody knows the address you must still bestir yourself in trying to find it and when you do fall in with mrs rook  well  take care wherever it may be that you see her privately  mirabel was alarmed dont keep me in suspense he burst out tell me what you propose  never mind what i propose tonight before i can tell you what i have in my mind i must know whether mrs rook is in england or scotland bring me that information tomorrow and i shall have something to say to you hark the wind is rising the rain is falling there is a chance of sleep for mei shall soon hear the sea goodnight  goodnight dearestand thank you again and again     chapter lix the accident at belford  early in the morning mirabel set forth for redwood hall in one of the vehicles which mrs delvin still kept at the clink for the convenience of visitors he returned soon after noon having obtained information of the whereabout of mrs rook and her husband when they had last been heard of they were at lasswade near edinburgh whether they had or had not obtained the situation of which they were in search neither miss redwood nor any one else at the hall could tell  in half an hour more another horse was harnessed and mirabel was on his way to the railway station at belford to follow mrs rook at emilys urgent request before his departure he had an interview with his sister  mrs delvin was rich enough to believe implicitly in the power of money her method of extricating her brother from the serious difficulties that beset him was to make it worth the while of mr and mrs rook to leave england their passage to america would be secretly paid and they would take with them a letter of credit addressed to a banker in new york if mirabel failed to discover them after they had sailed emily could not blame his want of devotion to her interests he understood this but he remained desponding and irresolute even with the money in his hands the one person who could rouse his courage and animate his hope was also the one person who must know nothing of what had passed between his sister and himself he had no choice but to leave emily without being cheered by her bright looks invigorated by her inspiriting words mirabel went away on his doubtful errand with a heavy heart  the clink was so far from the nearest post town that the few letters usually addressed to the tower were delivered by private arrangement with a messenger the mans punctuality depended on the convenience of his superiors employed at the office sometimes he arrived early and sometimes he arrived late on this particular morning he presented himself at half past one oclock with a letter for emily and when mrs ellmother smartly reproved him for the delay he coolly attributed it to the hospitality of friends whom he had met on the road  the letter directed to emily at the cottage had been forwarded from london by the person left in charge it addressed her as honored miss she turned at once to the endand discovered the signature of mrs rook  and mr mirabel has gone emily exclaimed just when his presence is of the greatest importance to us  shrewd mrs ellmother suggested that it might be as well to read the letter firstand then to form an opinion  emily read it   lasswade near edinburgh sept 26th  honored missi take up my pen to bespeak your kind sympathy for my husband and myself two old people thrown on the world again by the death of our excellent master we are under a months notice to leave redwood hall  hearing of a situation at this place also that our expenses would be paid if we applied personally we got leave of absence and made our application the lady and her son are either the stingiest people that ever livedor they have taken a dislike to me and my husband and they make money a means of getting rid of us easily suffice it to say that we have refused to accept starvation wages and that we are still out of place it is just possible that you may have heard of something to suit us so i write at once knowing that good chances are often lost through needless delay  we stop at belford on our way back to see some friends of my husband and we hope to get to redwood hall in good time on the 28th would you please address me to care of miss redwood in case you know of any good situation for which we could apply perhaps we may be driven to try our luck in london in this case will you permit me to have the honor of presenting my respects as i ventured to propose when i wrote to you a little time since  i beg to remain honored miss  your humble servant  r rook   emily handed the letter to mrs ellmother read it she said and tell me what you think  i think you had better be careful  careful of mrs rook  yesand careful of mrs delvin too  emily was astonished are you really speaking seriously she said mrs delvin is a most interesting person so patient under her sufferings so kind so clever so interested in all that interests me i shall take the letter to her at once and ask her advice  have your own way miss i cant tell you whybut i dont like her  mrs delvins devotion to the interests of her guest took even emily by surprise after reading mrs rooks letter she rang the bell on her table in a frenzy of impatience my brother must be instantly recalled she said telegraph to him in your own name telling him what has happened he will find the message waiting for him at the end of his journey  the groom summoned by the bell was ordered to saddle the third and last horse left in the stables to take the telegram to belford and to wait there until the answer arrived  how far is it to redwood hall emily asked when the man had received his orders  ten miles mrs delvin answered  how can i get there today  my dear you cant get there  pardon me mrs delvin i must get there  pardon me my brother represents you in this matter leave it to my brother  the tone taken by mirabels sister was positive to say the least of it emily thought of what her faithful old servant had said and began to doubt her own discretion in so readily showing the letter the mistakeif a mistake it washad however been committed and wrong or right she was not disposed to occupy the subordinate position which mrs delvin had assigned to her  if you will look at mrs rooks letter again emily replied you will see that i ought to answer it she supposes i am in london  do you propose to tell mrs rook that you are in this house mrs delvin asked  certainly  you had better consult my brother before you take any responsibility on yourself  emily kept her temper allow me to remind you she said that mr mirabel is not acquainted with mrs rookand that i am if i speak to her personally i can do much to assist the object of our inquiries before he returns she is not an easy woman to deal with  and therefore mrs delvin interposed the sort of person who requires careful handling by a man like my brothera man of the world  the sort of person as i venture to think emily persisted whom i ought to see with as little loss of time as possible  mrs delvin waited a while before she replied in her condition of health anxiety was not easy to bear mrs rooks letter and emilys obstinacy had seriously irritated her but like all persons of ability she was capable when there was serious occasion for it of exerting selfcontrol she really liked and admired emily and as the elder woman and the hostess she set an example of forbearance and good humor  it is out of my power to send you to redwood hall at once she resumed the only one of my three horses now at your disposal is the horse which took my brother to the hall this morning a distance there and back of twenty miles you are not in too great a hurry i am sure to allow the horse time to rest  emily made her excuses with perfect grace and sincerity i had no idea the distance was so great she confessed i will wait dear mrs delvin as long as you like  they parted as good friends as everwith a certain reserve nevertheless on either side emilys eager nature was depressed and irritated by the prospect of delay mrs delvin on the other hand devoted to her brothers interests thought hopefully of obstacles which might present themselves with the lapse of time the horse might prove to be incapable of further exertion for that day or the threatening aspect of the weather might end in a storm  but the hours passedand the sky clearedand the horse was reported to be fit for work again fortune was against the lady of the tower she had no choice but to submit  mrs delvin had just sent word to emily that the carriage would be ready for her in ten minutes when the coachman who had driven mirabel to belford returned he brought news which agreeably surprised both the ladies mirabel had reached the station five minutes too late the coachman had left him waiting the arrival of the next train to the north he would now receive the telegraphic message at belford and might return immediately by taking the grooms horse mrs delvin left it to emily to decide whether she would proceed by herself to redwood hall or wait for mirabels return  under the changed circumstances emily would have acted ungraciously if she had persisted in holding to her first intention she consented to wait  the sea still remained calm in the stillness of the moorland solitude on the western side of the clink the rapid steps of a horse were heard at some little distance on the highroad  emily ran out followed by careful mrs ellmother expecting to meet mirabel  she was disappointed it was the groom who had returned as he pulled up at the house and dismounted emily noticed that the man looked excited  is there anything wrong she asked  there has been an accident miss  not to mr mirabel  no no miss an accident to a poor foolish woman traveling from lasswade  emily looked at mrs ellmother it cant be mrs rook she said  thats the name miss she got out before the train had quite stopped and fell on the platform  was she hurt  seriously hurt as i heard they carried her into a house hard byand sent for the doctor  was mr mirabel one of the people who helped her  he was on the other side of the platform miss waiting for the train from london i got to the station and gave him the telegram just as the accident took place we crossed over to hear more about it mr mirabel was telling me that he would return to the clink on my horsewhen he heard the womans name mentioned upon that he changed his mind and went to the house  was he let in  the doctor wouldnt hear of it he was making his examination and he said nobody was to be in the room but her husband and the woman of the house  is mr mirabel waiting to see her  yes miss he said he would wait all day if necessary and he gave me this bit of a note to take to the mistress  emily turned to mrs ellmother its impossible to stay here not knowing whether mrs rook is going to live or die she said i shall go to belfordand you will go with me  the groom interfered i beg your pardon miss it was mr mirabels most particular wish that you were not on any account to go to belford  why not  he didnt say  emily eyed the note in the mans hand with wellgrounded distrust in all probability mirabels object in writing was to instruct his sister to prevent her guest from going to belford the carriage was waiting at the door with her usual promptness of resolution emily decided on taking it for granted that she was free to use as she pleased a carriage which had been already placed at her disposal  tell your mistress she said to the groom that i am going to belford instead of to redwood hall  in a minute more she and mrs ellmother were on their way to join mirabel at the station     chapter lx outside the room  emily found mirabel in the waiting room at belford her sudden appearance might well have amazed him but his face expressed a more serious emotion than surprisehe looked at her as if she had alarmed him  didnt you get my message he asked i told the groom i wished you to wait for my return i sent a note to my sister in case he made any mistake  the man made no mistake emily answered i was in too great a hurry to be able to speak with mrs delvin did you really suppose i could endure the suspense of waiting till you came back do you think i can be of no usei who know mrs rook  they wont let you see her  why not you seem to be waiting to see her  i am waiting for the return of the rector of belford he is at berwick and he has been sent for at mrs rooks urgent request  is she dying  she is in fear of deathwhether rightly or wrongly i dont know there is some internal injury from the fall i hope to see her when the rector returns as a brother clergyman i may with perfect propriety ask him to use his influence in my favor  i am glad to find you so eager about it  i am always eager in your interests  dont think me ungrateful emily replied gently i am no stranger to mrs rook and if i send in my name i may be able to see her before the clergyman returns  she stopped mirabel suddenly moved so as to place himself between her and the door i must really beg of you to give up that idea he said you dont know what horrid sight you may seewhat dreadful agonies of pain this unhappy woman may be suffering  his manner suggested to emily that he might be acting under some motive which he was unwilling to acknowledge if you have a reason for wishing that i should keep away from mrs rook she said let me hear what it is surely we trust each other i have done my best to set the example at any rate  mirabel seemed to be at a loss for a reply  while he was hesitating the stationmaster passed the door emily asked him to direct her to the house in which mrs rook had been received he led the way to the end of the platform and pointed to the house emily and mrs ellmother immediately left the station mirabel accompanied them still remonstrating still raising obstacles  the house door was opened by an old man he looked reproachfully at mirabel you have been told already he said that no strangers are to see my wife  encouraged by discovering that the man was mr rook emily mentioned her name perhaps you may have heard mrs rook speak of me she added  ive heard her speak of you oftentimes  what does the doctor say  he thinks she may get over it she doesnt believe him  will you say that i am anxious to see her if she feels well enough to receive me  mr rook looked at mrs ellmother are there two of you wanting to go upstairs he inquired  this is my old friend and servant emily answered she will wait for me down here  she can wait in the parlor the good people of this house are well known to me he pointed to the parlor doorand then led the way to the first floor emily followed him mirabel as obstinate as ever followed emily  mr rook opened a door at the end of the landing and turning round to speak to emily noticed mirabel standing behind her without making any remarks the old man pointed significantly down the stairs his resolution was evidently immovable mirabel appealed to emily to help him  she will see me if you ask her he said let me wait here  the sound of his voice was instantly followed by a cry from the bedchambera cry of terror  mr rook hurried into the room and closed the door in less than a minute he opened it again with doubt and horror plainly visible in his face he stepped up to mirabeleyed him with the closest scrutinyand drew back again with a look of relief  shes wrong he said you are not the man  this strange proceeding startled emily  what man do you mean she asked  mr rook took no notice of the question still looking at mirabel he pointed down the stairs once more with vacant eyesmoving mechanically like a sleepwalker in his dreammirabel silently obeyed mr rook turned to emily  are you easily frightened he said  i dont understand you emily replied who is going to frighten me why did you speak to mr mirabel in that strange way  mr rook looked toward the bedroom door maybe youll hear why inside there if i could have my way you shouldnt see herbut shes not to be reasoned with a caution miss dont be too ready to believe what my wife may say to you shes had a fright he opened the door in my belief he whispered shes off her head  emily crossed the threshold mr rook softly closed the door behind her     chapter lxi inside the room  a decent elderly woman was seated at the bedside she rose and spoke to emily with a mingling of sorrow and confusion strikingly expressed on her face it isnt my fault she said that mrs rook receives you in this manner i am obliged to humor her  she drew aside and showed mrs rook with her head supported by many pillows and her face strangely hidden from view under a veil emily started back in horror is her face injured she asked  mrs rook answered the question herself her voice was low and weak but she still spoke with the same nervous hurry of articulation which had been remarked by alban morris on the day when she asked him to direct her to netherwoods  not exactly injured she explained but ones appearance is a matter of some anxiety even on ones deathbed i am disfigured by a thoughtless use of water to bring me to when i had my falland i cant get at my toiletthings to put myself right again i dont wish to shock you please excuse the veil  emily remembered the rouge on her cheeks and the dye on her hair when they had first seen each other at the school vanityof all human frailties the longestlivedstill held its firmlyrooted place in this womans nature superior to torment of conscience unassailable by terror of death  the good woman of the house waited a moment before she left the room what shall i say she asked if the clergyman comes  mrs rook lifted her hand solemnly say she answered that a dying sinner is making atonement for sin say this young lady is present by the decree of an allwise providence no mortal creature must disturb us her hand dropped back heavily on the bed are we alone she asked  we are alone emily answered what made you scream just before i came in  no i cant allow you to remind me of that mrs rook protested i must compose myself be quiet let me think  recovering her composure she also recovered that sense of enjoyment in talking of herself which was one of the marked peculiarities in her character  you will excuse me if i exhibit religion she resumed my dear parents were exemplary people i was most carefully brought up are you pious let us hope so  emily was once more reminded of the past  the bygone time returned to her memorythe time when she had accepted sir jervis redwoods offer of employment and when mrs rook had arrived at the school to be her traveling companion to the north the wretched creature had entirely forgotten her own loose talk after she had drunk miss ladds good wine to the last drop in the bottle as she was boasting now of her piety so she had boasted then of her lost faith and hope and had mockingly declared her freethinking opinions to be the result of her illassorted marriage forgottenall forgotten in this later time of pain and fear prostrate under the dread of death her innermost naturestripped of the concealments of her later lifewas revealed to view the early religious training at which she had scoffed in the insolence of health and strength revealed its latent influenceintermitted but a living influence always from first to last mrs rook was tenderly mindful of her exemplary parents and proud of exhibiting religion on the bed from which she was never to rise again  did i tell you that i am a miserable sinner she asked after an interval of silence  emily could endure it no longer say that to the clergyman she answerednot to me  oh but i must say it mrs rook insisted i am a miserable sinner let me give you an instance of it she continued with a shameless relish of the memory of her own frailties i have been a drinker in my time anything was welcome when the fit was on me as long as it got into my head like other persons in liquor i sometimes talked of things that had better have been kept secret we bore that in mindmy old man and iwhen we were engaged by sir jervis miss redwood wanted to put us in the next bedroom to hersa risk not to be run i might have talked of the murder at the inn and she might have heard me please to remark a curious thing whatever else i might let out when i was in my cups not a word about the pocketbook ever dropped from me you will ask how i know it my dear i should have heard of it from my husband if i had let that outand he is as much in the dark as you are wonderful are the workings of the human mind as the poet says and drink drowns care as the proverb says but can drink deliver a person from fear by day and fear by night i believe if i had dropped a word about the pocketbook it would have sobered me in an instant have you any remark to make on this curious circumstance  thus far emily had allowed the woman to ramble on in the hope of getting information which direct inquiry might fail to produce it was impossible however to pass over the allusion to the pocketbook after giving her time to recover from the exhaustion which her heavy breathing sufficiently revealed emily put the question  who did the pocketbook belong to  wait a little said mrs rook everything in its right place is my motto i mustnt begin with the pocketbook why did i begin with it do you think this veil on my face confuses me suppose i take it off but you must promise firstsolemnly promise you wont look at my face how can i tell you about the murder the murder is part of my confession you know with this lace tickling my skin go awayand stand there with your back to me thank you now ill take it off ha the air feels refreshing i know what i am about good heavens i have forgotten something i have forgotten him and after such a fright as he gave me did you see him on the landing  who are you talking of emily asked  mrs rooks failing voice sank lower still  come closer she said this must be whispered who am i talking of she repeated i am talking of the man who slept in the other bed at the inn the man who did the deed with his own razor he was gone when i looked into the outhouse in the gray of the morning oh i have done my duty i have told mr rook to keep an eye on him downstairs you havent an idea how obstinate and stupid my husband is he says i couldnt know the man because i didnt see him ha theres such a thing as hearing when you dont see i heardand i knew it again  emily turned cold from head to foot  what did you know again she said  his voice mrs rook answered ill swear to his voice before all the judges in england  emily rushed to the bed she looked at the woman who had said those dreadful words speechless with horror  youre breaking your promise cried mrs rook you false girl youre breaking your promise  she snatched at the veil and put it on again the sight of her face momentary as it had been reassured emily her wild eyes made wilder still by the blurred stains of rouge below them half washed awayher disheveled hair with streaks of gray showing through the dyepresented a spectacle which would have been grotesque under other circumstances but which now reminded emily of mr rooks last words warning her not to believe what his wife said and even declaring his conviction that her intellect was deranged emily drew back from the bed conscious of an overpowering sense of selfreproach although it was only for a moment she had allowed her faith in mirabel to be shaken by a woman who was out of her mind  try to forgive me she said i didnt willfully break my promise you frightened me  mrs rook began to cry i was a handsome woman in my time she murmured you would say i was handsome still if the clumsy fools about me had not spoiled my appearance oh i do feel so weak wheres my medicine  the bottle was on the table emily gave her the prescribed dose and revived her failing strength  i am an extraordinary person she resumed my resolution has always been the admiration of every one who knew me but my mind feelshow shall i express ita little vacant have mercy on my poor wicked soul help me  how can i help you  i want to recollect something happened in the summer time when we were talking at netherwoods i mean when that impudent master at the school showed his suspicions of me lord how he frightened me when he turned up afterward at sir jerviss house you must have seen yourself he suspected me how did he show it  he showed you my locket emily answered  oh the horrid reminder of the murder mrs rook exclaimed i didnt mention it dont blame me you poor innocent i have something dreadful to tell you  emilys horror of the woman forced her to speak dont tell me she cried i know more than you suppose i know what i was ignorant of when you saw the locket  mrs rook took offense at the interruption  clever as you are theres one thing you dont know she said you asked me just now who the pocketbook belonged to it belonged to your father whats the matter are you crying  emily was thinking of her father the pocketbook was the last present she had given to hima present on his birthday is it lost she asked sadly  no its not lost you will hear more of it directly dry your eyes and expect something interestingim going to talk about love love my dear means myself why shouldnt it im not the only nicelooking woman married to an old man who has had a lover  wretch what has that got to do with it  everything you rude girl my lover was like the rest of them he would bet on racehorses and he lost he owned it to me on the day when your father came to our inn he said i must find the moneyor be off to america and say goodby forever i was fool enough to be fond of him it broke my heart to hear him talk in that way i said if i find the money and more than the money will you take me with you wherever you go of course he said yes i suppose you have heard of the inquest held at our old place by the coroner and jury oh what idiots they believed i was asleep on the night of the murder i never closed my eyesi was so miserable i was so tempted  tempted what tempted you  do you think i had any money to spare your fathers pocketbook tempted me i had seen him open it to pay his bill overnight it was full of banknotes oh what an overpowering thing love is perhaps you have known it yourself  emilys indignation once more got the better of her prudence have you no feeling of decency on your deathbed she said  mrs rook forgot her piety she was ready with an impudent rejoinder you hotheaded little woman your time will come she answered but youre righti am wandering from the point i am not sufficiently sensible of this solemn occasion bytheby do you notice my language i inherit correct english from my mothera cultivated person who married beneath her my paternal grandfather was a gentleman did i tell you that there came a time on that dreadful night when i could stay in bed no longer the pocketbooki did nothing but think of that devilish pocketbook full of banknotes my husband was fast asleep all the time i got a chair and stood on it i looked into the place where the two men were sleeping through the glass in the top of the door your father was awake he was walking up and down the room what do you say was he agitated i didnt notice i dont know whether the other man was asleep or awake i saw nothing but the pocketbook stuck under the pillow half in and half out your father kept on walking up and down i thought to myself ill wait till he gets tired and then ill have another look at the pocketbook wheres the wine the doctor said i might have a glass of wine when i wanted it  emily found the wine and gave it to her she shuddered as she accidentally touched mrs rooks hand  the wine helped the sinking woman  i must have got up more than once she resumed and more than once my heart must have failed me i dont clearly remember what i did till the gray of the morning came i think that must have been the last time i looked through the glass in the door  she began to tremble she tore the veil off her face she cried out piteously lord be merciful to me a sinner come here she said to emily where are you no i darent tell you what i saw i darent tell you what i did when youre pos sessed by the devil theres nothing nothing nothing you cant do where did i find the courage to unlock the door where did i find the courage to go in any other woman would have lost her senses when she found blood on her fingers after taking the pocketbook  emilys head swam her heart beat furiouslyshe staggered to the door and opened it to escape from the room  im guilty of robbing him but im innocent of his blood mrs rook called after her wildly the deed was donethe yard door was wide open and the man was gonewhen i looked in for the last time come back come back  emily looked round  i cant go near you she said faintly  come near enough to see this  she opened her bedgown at the throat and drew up a loop of ribbon over her head the pocketbook was attached to the ribbon she held it out  your fathers book she said wont you take your fathers book  for a moment and only for a moment emily was repelled by the profanation associated with her birthday gift then the loving remembrance of the dear hands that had so often touched that relic drew the faithful daughter back to the woman whom she abhorred her eyes rested tenderly on the book before it had lain in that guilty bosom it had been his book the beloved memory was all that was left to her now the beloved memory consecrated it to her hand she took the book  open it said mrs rook  there were two fivepound banknotes in it  his emily asked  no minethe little i have been able to save toward restoring what i stole  oh emily cried is there some good in this woman after all  theres no good in the woman mrs rook answered desperately theres nothing but fearfear of hell now fear of the pocketbook in the past time twice i tried to destroy itand twice it came back to remind me of the duty that i owed to my miserable soul i tried to throw it into the fire it struck the bar and fell back into the fender at my feet i went out and cast it into the well it came back again in the first bucket of water that was drawn up from that moment i began to save what i could restitution atonement i tell you the book found a tongueand those were the grand words it dinned in my ears morning and night she stooped to fetch her breathstopped and struck her bosom i hid it here so that no person should see it and no person take it from me superstition oh yes superstition shall tell you something you may find yourself superstitious if you are ever cut to the heart as i was he left me the man i had disgraced myself for deserted me on the day when i gave him the stolen money he suspected it was stolen he took care of his own cowardly selfand left me to the hard mercy of the law if the theft was found out what do you call that in the way of punishment havent i suffered havent i made atonement be a christiansay you forgive me  i do forgive you  say you will pray for me  i will  ah that comforts me now you can go  emily looked at her imploringly dont send me away knowing no more of the murder than i knew when i came here is there nothing really nothing you can tell me  mrs rook pointed to the door  havent i told you already go downstairs and see the wretch who escaped in the dawn of the morning  gently maam gently youre talking too loud cried a mocking voice from outside  its only the doctor said mrs rook she crossed her hands over her bosom with a deepdrawn sigh i want no doctor now my peace is made with my maker im ready for death im fit for heaven go away go away     chapter lxii downstairs  in a moment more the doctor came ina brisk smiling selfsufficient mansmartly dressed with a flower in his buttonhole a stifling odor of musk filled the room as he drew out his handkerchief with a flourish and wiped his forehead  plenty of hard work in my line just now he said hullo mrs rook somebody has been allowing you to excite yourself i heard you before i opened the door have you been encouraging her to talk he asked turning to emily and shaking his finger at her with an air of facetious remonstrance  incapable of answering him forgetful of the ordinary restraints of social intercoursewith the one doubt that preserved her belief in mirabel eager for confirmationemily signed to this stranger to follow her into a corner of the room out of hearing she made no excuses she took no notice of his look of surprise one hope was all she could feel one word was all she could say after that second assertion of mirabels guilt indicating mrs rook by a glance at the bed she whispered the word  mad  flippant and familiar the doctor imitated her he too looked at the bed  no more mad than you are miss as i said just now my patient has been exciting herself i daresay she has talked a little wildly in consequence hers isnt a brain to give way i can tell you but theres somebody else  emily had fled from the room he had destroyed her last fragment of belief in mirabels innocence she was on the landing trying to console herself when the doctor joined her  are you acquainted with the gentleman downstairs he asked  what gentleman  i havent heard his name he looks like a clergyman if you know him  i do know him i cant answer questions my mind  steady your mind miss and take your friend home as soon as you can he hasnt got mrs rooks hard brain hes in a state of nervous prostration which may end badly do you know where he lives  he is staying with his sistermrs delvin  mrs delvin shes a friend and patient of mine say ill look in tomorrow morning and see what i can do for her brother in the meantime get him to bed and to rest and dont be afraid of giving him brandy  the doctor returned to the bedroom emily heard mrs ellmothers voice below  are you up there miss  yes  mrs ellmother ascended the stairs it was an evil hour she said that you insisted on going to this place mr mirabel the sight of emilys face suspended the next words on her lips she took the poor young mistress in her motherly arms oh my child what has happened to you  dont ask me now give me your armlet us go downstairs  you wont be startled when you see mr mirabelwill you my dear i wouldnt let them disturb you i said nobody should speak to you but myself the truth is mr mirabel has had a dreadful fright what are you looking for  is there a garden here any place where we can breathe the fresh air  there was a courtyard at the back of the house they found their way to it a bench was placed against one of the walls they sat down  shall i wait till youre better before i say any more mrs ellmother asked no you want to hear about mr mirabel my dear he came into the parlor where i was and mr rook came in tooand waited looking at him mr mirabel sat down in a corner in a dazed state as i thought it wasnt for long he jumped up and clapped his hand on his heart as if his heart hurt him i must and will know whats going on upstairs he says mr rook pulled him back and told him to wait till the young lady came down mr mirabel wouldnt hear of it your wifes frightening her he says your wifes telling her horrible things about me he was taken on a sudden with a shivering fit his eyes rolled and his teeth chattered mr rook made matters worse he lost his temper im damned he says if i dont begin to think you are the man after all ive half a mind to send for the police mr mirabel dropped into his chair his eyes stared his mouth fell open i took hold of his hand coldcold as ice what it all meant i cant say oh miss you know let me tell you the rest of it some other time  emily insisted on hearing more the end she cried how did it end  i dont know how it might have ended if the doctor hadnt come into pay his visit you know upstairs he said some learned words when he came to plain english he asked if anybody had frightened the gentleman i said mr rook had frightened him the doctor says to mr rook mind what you are about if you frighten him again you may have his death to answer for that cowed mr rook he asked what he had better do give me some brandy for him first says the doctor and then get him home at once i found the brandy and went away to the inn to order the carriage your ears are quicker than mine missdo i hear it now  they rose and went to the house door the carriage was there  still cowed by what the doctor had said mr rook appeared carefully leading mirabel out he had revived under the action of the stimulant passing emily he raised his eyes to hertrembledand looked down again when mr rook opened the door of the carriage he paused with one of his feet on the step a momentary impulse inspired him with a false courage and brought a flush into his ghastly face he turned to emily  may i speak to you he asked  she started back from him he looked at mrs ellmother tell her i am innocent he said the trembling seized on him again mr rook was obliged to lift him into the carriage  emily caught at mrs ellmothers arm you go with him she said i cant  how are you to get back miss  she turned away and spoke to the coachman i am not very well i want the fresh airill sit by you  mrs ellmother remonstrated and protested in vain as emily had determined it should be so it was  has he said anything she asked when they had arrived at their journeys end  he has been like a man frozen up he hasnt said a word he hasnt even moved  take him to his sister and tell her all that you know be careful to repeat what the doctor said i cant face mrs delvin be patient my good old friend i have no secrets from you only wait till tomorrow and leave me by myself tonight  alone in her room emily opened her writingcase searching among the letters in it she drew out a printed paper it was the handbill describing the man who had escaped from the inn and offering a reward for the discovery of him  at the first line of the personal description of the fugitive the paper dropped from her hand burning tears forced their way into her eyes feeling for her handkerchief she touched the pocketbook which she had received from mrs rook after a little hesitation she took it out she looked at it she opened it  the sight of the banknotes repelled her she hid them in one of the pockets of the book there was a second pocket which she had not yet examined she pat her hand into it and touching something drew out a letter  the envelope already open was addressed to james brown esq post office zeeland would it be inconsistent with her respect for her fathers memory to examine the letter no a glance would decide whether she ought to read it or not  it was without date or address a startling letter to look atfor it only contained three words  i say no  the words were signed in initials  s j  in the instant when she read the initials the name occurred to her  sara jethro     chapter lxiii the defense of mirabel  the discovery of the letter gave a new direction to emilys thoughtsand so for the time at least relieved her mind from the burden that weighed on it to what question on her fathers part had i say no been miss jethros brief and stern reply neither letter nor envelope offered the slightest hint that might assist inquiry even the postmark had been so carelessly impressed that it was illegible  emily was still pondering over the three mysterious words when she was interrupted by mrs ellmothers voice at the door  i must ask you to let me come in miss though i know you wished to be left by yourself till tomorrow mrs delvin says she must positively see you tonight its my belief that she will send for the servants and have herself carried in here if you refuse to do what she asks you neednt be afraid of seeing mr mirabel  where is he  his sister has given up her bedroom to him mrs ellmother answered she thought of your feelings before she sent me hereand had the curtains closed between the sittingroom and the bedroom i suspect my nasty temper misled me when i took a dislike to mrs delvin shes a good creature im sorry you didnt go to her as soon as we got back  did she seem to be angry when she sent you here  angry she was crying when i left her  emily hesitated no longer  she noticed a remarkable change in the invalids sittingroomso brilliantly lighted on other occasionsthe moment she entered it the lamps were shaded and the candles were all extinguished my eyes dont bear the light so well as usual mrs delvin said come and sit near me emily i hope to quiet your mind i should be grieved if you left my house with a wrong impression of me  knowing what she knew suffering as she must have suffered the quiet kindness of her tone implied an exercise of selfrestraint which appealed irresistibly to emilys sympathies forgive me she said for having done you an injustice i am ashamed to think that i shrank from seeing you when i returned from belford  i will endeavor to be worthy of your better opinion of me mrs delvin replied in one respect at least i may claim to have had your best interests at heartwhile we were still personally strangers i tried to prevail on my poor brother to own the truth when he discovered the terrible position in which he was placed toward you he was too conscious of the absence of any proof which might induce you to believe him if he attempted to defend himselfin one word he was too timidto take my advice he has paid the penalty and i have paid the penalty of deceiving you  emily started in what way have you deceived me she asked  in the way that was forced on us by our own conduct mrs delvin said we have appeared to help you without really doing so we calculated on inducing you to marry my brother and then when he could speak with the authority of a husband on prevailing on you to give up all further inquiries when you insisted on seeing mrs rook miles had the money in his hand to bribe her and her husband to leave england  oh mrs delvin  i dont attempt to excuse myself i dont expect you to consider how sorely i was tempted to secure the happiness of my brothers life by marriage with such a woman as yourself i dont remind you that i knewwhen i put obstacles in your waythat you were blindly devoting yourself to the discovery of an innocent man  emily heard her with angry surprise innocent she repeated mrs rook recognized his voice the instant she heard him speak  impenetrable to interruption mrs delvin went on but what i do ask she persisted even after our short acquaintance is this do you suspect me of deliberately scheming to make you the wife of a murderer  emily had never viewed the serious question between them in this light warmly generously she answered the appeal that had been made to her oh dont think that of me i know i spoke thoughtlessly and cruelly to you just now  you spoke impulsively mrs delvin interposed that was all my one desire before we parthow can i expect you to remain here after what has happenedis to tell you the truth i have no interested object in view for all hope of your marriage with my brother is now at an end may i ask if you have heard that he and your father were strangers when they met at the inn  yes i know that  if there had been any conversation between them when they retired to rest they might have mentioned their names but your father was preoccupied and my brother after a long days walk was so tired that he fell asleep as soon as his head was on the pillow he only woke when the morning dawned what he saw when he looked toward the opposite bed might have struck with terror the boldest man that ever lived his first impulse was naturally to alarm the house when he got on his feet he saw his own razora bloodstained razor on the bed by the side of the corpse at that discovery he lost all control over himself in a panic of terror he snatched up his knapsack unfastened the yard door and fled from the house knowing him as you and i know him can we wonder at it many a man has been hanged for murder on circumstantial evidence less direct than the evidence against poor miles his horror of his own recollections was so overpowering that he forbade me even to mention the inn at zeeland in my letters while he was abroad never tell me he wrote who that wretched murdered stranger was if i only heard of his name i believe it would haunt me to my dying day i ought not to trouble you with these detailsand yet i am surely not without excuse in the absence of any proof i cannot expect you to believe as i do in my brothers innocence but i may at least hope to show you that there is some reason for doubt will you give him the benefit of that doubt  willingly emily replied am i right in supposing that you dont despair of proving his innocence even yet  i dont quite despair but my hopes have grown fainter and fainter as the years have gone on there is a person associated with his escape from zeeland a person named jethro  you mean miss jethro  yes do you know her  i know herand my father knew her i have found a letter addressed to him which i have no doubt was written by miss jethro it is barely possible that you may understand what it means pray look at it  i am quite unable to help you mrs delvin answered after reading the letter all i know of miss jethro is that but for her interposition my brother might have fallen into the hands of the police she saved him  knowing him of course  that is the remarkable part of it they were perfect strangers to each other  but she must have had some motive  there is the foundation of my hope for miles miss jethro declared when i wrote and put the question to her that the one motive by which she was actuated was the motive of mercy i dont believe her to my mind it is in the last degree improbable that she would consent to protect a stranger from discovery who owned to her as my brother did that he was a fugitive suspected of murder she knows something i am firmly convinced of that dreadful event at zeelandand she has some reason for keeping it secret have you any influence over her  tell me where i can find her  i cant tell you she has removed from the address at which my brother saw her last he has made every possible inquirywithout result  as she replied in those discouraging terms the curtains which divided mrs delvins bedroom from her sittingroom were drawn aside an elderly womanservant approached her mistresss couch  mr mirabel is awake maam he is very low i can hardly feel his pulse shall i give him some more brandy  mrs delvin held out her hand to emily come to me tomorrow morning she saidand signed to the servant to wheel her couch into the next room as the curtain closed over them emily heard mirabels voice where am i he said faintly is it all a dream  the prospect of his recovery the next morning was gloomy indeed he had sunk into a state of deplorable weakness in mind as well as in body the little memory of events that he still preserved was regarded by him as the memory of a dream he alluded to emily and to his meeting with her unexpectedly but from that point his recollection failed him they had talked of something interesting he saidbut he was unable to remember what it was and they had waited together at a railway stationbut for what purpose he could not tell he sighed and wondered when emily would marry himand so fell asleep again weaker than ever  not having any confidence in the doctor at belford mrs delvin had sent an urgent message to a physician at edinburgh famous for his skill in treating diseases of the nervous system i cannot expect him to reach this remote place without some delay she said i must bear my suspense as well as i can  you shall not bear it alone emily answered i will wait with you till the doctor comes  mrs delvin lifted her frail wasted hands to emilys face drew it a little nearerand kissed her     chapter lxiv on the way to london  the parting words had been spoken emily and her companion were on their way to london  for some little time they traveled in silencealone in the railway carriage after submitting as long as she could to lay an embargo on the use of her tongue mrs ellmother started the conversation by means of a question do you think mr mirabel will get over it miss  its useless to ask me emily said even the great man from edinburgh is not able to decide yet whether he will recover or not  you have taken me into your confidence miss emily as you promisedand i have got something in my mind in consequence may i mention it without giving offense  what is it  i wish you had never taken up with mr mirabel  emily was silent mrs ellmother having a design of her own to accomplish ventured to speak more plainly i often think of mr alban morris she proceeded i always did like him and i always shall  emily suddenly pulled down her veil dont speak of him she said  i didnt mean to offend you  you dont offend me you distress me oh how often i have wished she threw herself back in a corner of the carriage and said no more  although not remarkable for the possession of delicate tact mrs ellmother discovered that the best course she could now follow was a course of silence  even at the time when she had most implicitly trusted mirabel the fear that she might have acted hastily and harshly toward alban had occasionally troubled emilys mind the impression produced by later events had not only intensified this feeling but had presented the motives of that true friend under an entirely new point of view if she had been left in ignorance of the manner of her fathers deathas alban had designed to leave her as she would have been left but for the treachery of francinehow happily free she would have been from thoughts which it was now a terror to her to recall she would have parted from mirabel when the visit to the pleasant country house had come to an end remembering him as an amusing acquaintance and nothing more he would have been spared and she would have been spared the shock that had so cruelly assailed them both what had she gained by mrs rooks detestable confession the result had been perpetual disturbance of mind provoked by selftorturing speculations on the subject of the murder if mirabel was innocent who was guilty the false wife without pity and without shameor the brutal husband who looked capable of any enormity what was her future to be how was it all to end in the despair of that bitter momentseeing her devoted old servant looking at her with kind compassionate eyesemilys troubled spirit sought refuge in impetuous selfbetrayal the very betrayal which she had resolved should not escape her hardly a minute since  she bent forward out of her corner and suddenly drew up her veil do you expect to see mr alban morris when we get back she asked  i should like to see him missif you have no objection  tell him i am ashamed of myself and say i ask his pardon with all my heart  the lord be praised mrs ellmother burst outand then when it was too late remembered the conventional restraints appropriate to the occasion gracious what a fool i am she said to herself beautiful weather miss emily isnt it she continued in a desperate hurry to change the subject  emily reclined again in her corner of the carriage she smiled for the first time since she had become mrs delvins guest at the tower     book the lastat home again    chapter lxv cecilia in a new character  reaching the cottage at night emily found the card of a visitor who had called during the day it bore the name of miss wyvil and had a message written on it which strongly excited emilys curiosity  i have seen the telegram which tells your servant that you return tonight expect me early tomorrow morningwith news that will deeply interest you  to what news did cecilia allude emily questioned the woman who had been left in charge of the cottage and found that she had next to nothing to tell miss wyvil had flushed up and had looked excited when she read the telegraphic messagethat was all emilys impatience was as usual not to be concealed expert mrs ellmother treated the case in the right wayfirst with supper and then with an adjournment to bed the clock struck twelve when she put out the young mistresss candle ten hours to pass before cecilia comes here emily exclaimed not ten minutes mrs ellmother reminded her if you will only go to sleep  cecilia arrived before the breakfasttable was cleared as lovely as gentle as affectionate as everbut looking unusually serious and subdued  out with it at once emily cried what have you got to tell me  perhaps i had better tell you first cecilia said that i know what you kept from me when i came here after you left us at monksmoor dont think my dear that i say this by way of complaint mr alban morris says you had good reasons for keeping your secret  mr alban morris did you get your information from him  yes do i surprise you  more than words can tell  can you bear another surprise mr morris has seen miss jethro and has discovered that mr mirabel has been wrongly suspected of a dreadful crime our amiable little clergyman is guilty of being a cowardand guilty of nothing else are you really quiet enough to read about it  she produced some leaves of paper filled with writing there she explained is mr morriss own account of all that passed between miss jethro and himself  but how do you come by it  mr morris gave it to me he said show it to emily as soon as possible and take care to be with her while she reads it there is a reason for this cecilias voice faltered on the brink of some explanation she seemed to recoil from it i will tell you byandby what the reason is she said  emily looked nervously at the manuscript why doesnt he tell me himself what he has discovered is he the leaves began to flutter in her trembling fingersis he angry with me  oh emily angry with you read what he has written and you shall know why he keeps away  emily opened the manuscript     chapter lxvi albans narrative  the information which i have obtained from miss jethro has been communicated to me on the condition that i shall not disclose the place of her residence let me pass out of notice she said as completely as if i had passed out of life i wish to be forgotten by some and to be unknown by others with this one stipulation she left me free to write the present narrative of what passed at the interview between us i feel that the discoveries which i have made are too important to the persons interested to be trusted to memory   1 she receives me  finding miss jethros place of abode with far less difficulty than i had anticipated thanks to favoring circumstances i stated plainly the object of my visit she declined to enter into conversation with me on the subject of the murder at zeeland  i was prepared to meet with this rebuke and to take the necessary measures for obtaining a more satisfactory reception a person is suspected of having committed the murder i said and there is reason to believe that you are in a position to say whether the suspicion is justified or not do you refuse to answer me if i put the question  miss jethro asked who the person was  i mentioned the namemr miles mirabel  it is not necessary and it would certainly be not agreeable to me to describe the effect which this reply produced on miss jethro after giving her time to compose herself i entered into certain explanations in order to convince her at the outset of my good faith the result justified my anticipations i was at once admitted to her confidence  she said i must not hesitate to do an act of justice to an innocent man but in such a serious matter as this you have a right to judge for yourself whether the person who is now speaking to you is a person whom you can trust you may believe that i tell the truth about others if i beginwhatever it may cost meby telling the truth about myself   2 she speaks of herself  i shall not attempt to place on record the confession of a most unhappy woman it was the common story of sin bitterly repented and of vain effort to recover the lost place in social esteem too well known a story surely to be told again  but i may with perfect propriety repeat what miss jethro said to me in allusion to later events in her life which are connected with my own personal experience she recalled to my memory a visit which she had paid to me at netherwoods and a letter addressed to her by doctor allday which i had read at her express request  she said you may remember that the letter contained some severe reflections on my conduct among other things the doctor mentions that he called at the lodging i occupied during my visit to london and found i had taken to flight also that he had reason to believe i had entered miss ladds service under false pretenses  i asked if the doctor had wronged her  she answered no in one case he is ignorant in the other he is right on leaving his house i found myself followed in the street by the man to whom i owe the shame and misery of my past life my horror of him is not to be described in words the one way of escaping was offered by an empty cab that passed me i reached the railway station safely and went back to my home in the country do you blame me  it was impossible to blame herand i said so  she then confessed the deception which she had practiced on miss ladd i have a cousin she said who was a miss jethro like me before her marriage she had been employed as a governess she pitied me she sympathized with my longing to recover the character that i had lost with her permission i made use of the testimonials which she had earned as a teacheri was betrayed to this day i dont know by whomand i was dismissed from netherwoods now you know that i deceived miss ladd you may reasonably conclude that i am likely to deceive you  i assured her with perfect sincerity that i had drawn no such conclusion encouraged by my reply miss jethro proceeded as follows   3 she speaks of mirabel  four years ago i was living near cowes in the isle of wightin a cottage which had been taken for me by a gentleman who was the owner of a yacht we had just returned from a short cruise and the vessel was under orders to sail for cherbourg with the next tide  while i was walking in my garden i was startled by the sudden appearance of a man evidently a gentleman who was a perfect stranger to me he was in a pitiable state of terror and he implored my protection in reply to my first inquiries he mentioned the inn at zeeland and the dreadful death of a person unknown to him whom i recognized partly by the description given and partly by comparison of dates as mr james brown i shall say nothing of the shock inflicted on me you dont want to know what i felt what i did having literally only a minute left for decision was to hide the fugitive from discovery and to exert my influence in his favor with the owner of the yacht i saw nothing more of him he was put on board as soon as the police were out of sight and was safely landed at cherbourg  i asked what induced her to run the risk of protecting a stranger who was under suspicion of having committed a murder  she said you shall hear my explanation directly let us have done with mr mirabel first we occasionally corresponded during the long absence on the continent never alluding at his express request to the horrible event at the inn his last letter reached me after he had established himself at vale regis writing of the society in the neighborhood he informed me of his introduction to miss wyvil and of the invitation that he had received to meet her friend and schoolfellow at monksmoor i knew that miss emily possessed a handbill describing personal peculiarities in mr mirabel not hidden under the changed appearance of his head and face if she remembered or happened to refer to that description while she was living in the same house with him there was a possibility at least of her suspicion being excited the fear of this took me to you it was a morbid fear and as events turned out an unfounded fear but i was unable to control it failing to produce any effect on you i went to vale regis and tried vainly again to induce mr mirabel to send an excuse to monksmoor he like you wanted to know what my motive was when i tell you that i acted solely in miss emilys interests and that i knew how she had been deceived about her fathers death need i say why i was afraid to acknowledge my motive  i understood that miss jethro might well be afraid of the consequences if she risked any allusion to mr browns horrible death and if it afterward chanced to reach his daughters ears but this state of feeling implied an extraordinary interest in the preservation of emilys peace of mind i asked miss jethro how that interest had been excited  she answered i can only satisfy you in one way i must speak of her father now   emily looked up from the manuscript she felt cecilias arm tenderly caressing her she heard cecilia say my poor dear there is one last trial of your courage still to come i am afraid of what you are going to read when you turn to the next page and yet  and yet emily replied gently it must be done i have learned my hard lesson of endurance cecilia dont be afraid  emily turned to the next page   4 she speaks of the dead  for the first time miss jethro appeared to be at a loss how to proceed i could see that she was suffering she rose and opening a drawer in her writing table took a letter from it  she said will you read this it was written by miss emilys father perhaps it may say more for me than i can say for myself  i copy the letter it was thus expressed  you have declared that our farewell today is our farewell forever for the second time you have refused to be my wife and you have done this to use your own words in mercy to me  in mercy to me i implore you to reconsider your decision  if you condemn me to live without youi feel it i know ityou condemn me to despair which i have not fortitude enough to endure look at the passages which i have marked for you in the new testament again and again i say it your true repentance has made you worthy of the pardon of god are you not worthy of the love admiration and respect of man think oh sara think of what our lives might be and let them be united for time and for eternity  i can write no more a deadly faintness oppresses me my mind is in a state unknown to me in past years i am in such confusion that i sometimes think i hate you and then i recover from my delusion and know that man never loved woman as i love you  you will have time to write to me by this evenings post i shall stop at zeeland tomorrow on my way back and ask for a letter at the post office i forbid explanations and excuses i forbid heartless allusions to your duty let me have an answer which does not keep me for a moment in suspense  for the last time i ask you do you consent to be my wife say yesor say no  i gave her back the letterwith the one comment on it which the circumstances permitted me to make  you said no  she bent her head in silence  i went onnot willingly for i would have spared her if it had been possible i said he died despairing by his own handand you knew it  she looked up no to say that i knew it is too much to say that i feared it is the truth  did you love him  she eyed me in stern surprise have i any right to love could i disgrace an honorable man by allowing him to marry me you look as if you held me responsible for his death  innocently responsible i said  she still followed her own train of thought do you suppose i could for a moment anticipate that he would destroy himself when i wrote my reply he was a truly religious man if he had been in his right mind he would have shrunk from the idea of suicide as from the idea of a crime  on reflection i was inclined to agree with her in his terrible position it was at least possible that the sight of the razor placed ready with the other appliances of the toilet for his fellowtravelers use might have fatally tempted a man whose last hope was crushed whose mind was tortured by despair i should have been merciless indeed if i had held miss jethro accountable thus far but i found it hard to sympathize with the course which she had pursued in permitting mr browns death to be attributed to murder without a word of protest why were you silent i said  she smiled bitterly  a woman would have known why without asking she replied a woman would have understood that i shrank from a public confession of my shameful past life a woman would have remembered what reasons i had for pitying the man who loved me and for accepting any responsibility rather than associate his memory before the world with an unworthy passion for a degraded creature ending in an act of suicide even if i had made that cruel sacrifice would public opinion have believed such a person as i amagainst the evidence of a medical man and the verdict of a jury no mr morris i said nothing and i was resolved to say nothing so long as the choice of alternatives was left to me on the day when mr mirabel implored me to save him that choice was no longer mineand you know what i did and now again when suspicion after all the long interval that had passed has followed and found that innocent man you know what i have done what more do you ask of me  your pardon i said for not having understood youand a last favor may i repeat what i have heard to the one person of all others who ought to know and who must know what you have told me  it was needless to hint more plainly that i was speaking of emily miss jethro granted my request  it shall be as you please she answered say for me to his daughter that the grateful remembrance of her is my one refuge from the thoughts that tortured me when we spoke together on her last night at school she has made this dead heart of mine feel a reviving breath of life when i think of her never in our earthly pilgrimage shall we meet againi implore her to pity and forget me farewell mr morris farewell forever  i confess that the tears came into my eyes when i could see clearly again i was alone in the room     chapter lxvii the true consolation  emily closed the pages which told her that her father had died by his own hand  cecilia still held her tenderly embraced by slow degrees her head dropped until it rested on her friends bosom silently she suffered silently cecilia bent forward and kissed her forehead the sounds that penetrated to the room were not out of harmony with the time from a distant house the voices of children were just audible singing the plaintive melody of a hymn and now and then the breeze blew the first faded leaves of autumn against the window neither of the girls knew how long the minutes followed each other uneventfully before there was a change emily raised her head and looked at cecilia  i have one friend left she said  not only me loveoh i hope not only me  yes only you  i want to say something emily but i am afraid of hurting you  my dear do you remember what we once read in a book of history at school it told of the death of a tortured man in the old time who was broken on the wheel he lived through it long enough to say that the agony after the first stroke of the club dulled his capacity for feeling pain when the next blows fell i fancy pain of the mind must follow the same rule nothing you can say will hurt me now  i only wanted to ask emily if you were engagedat one timeto marry mr mirabel is it true  false he pressed me to consent to an engagementand i said he must not hurry me  what made you say that  i thought of alban morris  vainly cecilia tried to restrain herself a cry of joy escaped her  are you glad emily asked why  cecilia made no direct reply may i tell you what you wanted to know a little while since she said you asked why mr morris left it all to me instead of speaking to you himself when i put the same question to him he told me to read what he had written not a shadow of suspicion rests on mr mirabel he said emily is free to marry himand free through me can i tell her that for her sake and for mine it must not be all that i can do is to leave old remembrances to plead for me if they fail i shall know that she will be happier with mr mirabel than with me and you will submit i asked because i love her he answered i must submit oh how pale you are have i distressed you  you have done me good  will you see him  emily pointed to the manuscript at such a time as this she said  cecilia still held to her resolution such a time as this is the right time she answered it is now when you most want to be comforted that you ought to see him who can quiet your poor aching heart as he can quiet it she impulsively snatched at the manuscript and threw it out of sight i cant bear to look at it she said emily if i have done wrong will you forgive me i saw him this morning before i came here i was afraid of what might happeni refused to break the dreadful news to you unless he was somewhere near us your good old servant knows where to go let me send her  mrs ellmother herself opened the door and stood doubtful on the threshold hysterically sobbing and laughing at the same time im everything thats bad the good old creature burst out ive been listeningive been lyingi said you wanted him turn me out of my situation if you like ive got him here he is  in another moment emily was in his armsand they were alone on his faithful breast the blessed relief of tears came to her at last she burst out crying  oh alban can you forgive me  he gently raised her head so that he could see her face  my love let me look at you he said i want to think again of the day when we parted in the garden at school do you remember the one conviction that sustained me i told you emily there was a time of fulfillment to come in our two lives and i have never wholly lost the dear belief my own darling the time has come   postscript  gossip in the studio   the winter time had arrived alban was clearing his palette after a hard days work at the cottage the servant announced that tea was ready and that miss ladd was waiting to see him in the next room  alban ran in and received the visitor cordially with both hands welcome back to england i neednt ask if the seavoyage has done you good you are looking ten years younger than when you went away  miss ladd smiled i shall soon be ten years older again if i go back to netherwoods she replied i didnt believe it at the time but i know better now our friend doctor allday was right when he said that my working days were over i must give up the school to a younger and stronger successor and make the best i can in retirement of what is left of my life you and emily may expect to have me as a near neighbor where is emily  far away in the north  in the north you dont mean that she has gone back to mrs delvin  she has gone backwith mrs ellmother to take care of herat my express request you know what emily is when there is an act of mercy to be done that unhappy man has been sinking with intervals of partial recovery for months past mrs delvin sent word to us that the end was near and that the one last wish her brother was able to express was the wish to see emily he had been for some hours unable to speak when my wife arrived but he knew her and smiled faintly he was just able to lift his hand she took it and waited by him and spoke words of consolation and kindness from time to time as the night advanced he sank into sleep still holding her hand they only knew that he had passed from sleep to deathpassed without a movement or a sighwhen his hand turned cold emily remained for a day at the tower to comfort poor mrs delvinand she comes home thank god this evening  i neednt ask if you are happy miss ladd said  happy i sing when i have my bath in the morning if that isnt happiness in a man of my age i dont know what is  and how are you getting on  famously i have turned portrait painter since you were sent away for your health a portrait of mr wyvil is to decorate the town hall in the place that he represents and our dear kindhearted cecilia has induced a fascinated mayor and corporation to confide the work to my hands  is there no hope yet of that sweet girl being married miss ladd asked we old maids all believe in marriage mr morristhough some of us dont own it  there seems to be a chance alban answered a young lord has turned up at monksmoor a handsome pleasant fellow and a rising man in politics he happened to be in the house a few days before cecilias birthday and he asked my advice about the right present to give her i said try something new in tarts when he found i was in earnest what do you think he did sent his steam yacht to rouen for some of the famous pastry you should have seen cecilia when the young lord offered his delicious gift if i could paint that smile and those eyes i should be the greatest artist living i believe she will marry him need i say how rich they will be we shall not envy themwe are rich too everything is comparative the portrait of mr wyvil will put three hundred pounds in my pocket i have earned a hundred and twenty more by illustrations since we have been married and my wifes income i like to be particular is only five shillings and tenpence short of two hundred a year moral we are rich as well as happy  without a thought of the future miss ladd asked slyly  oh doctor allday has taken the future in hand he revels in the oldfashioned jokes which used to be addressed to newlymarried people in his time my dear fellow he said the other day you may possibly be under a joyful necessity of sending for the doctor before we are all a year older in that case let it be understood that i am honorary physician to the family the warmhearted old man talks of getting me another portrait to do the greatest ass in the medical profession he informed me has just been made a baronet and his admiring friends have decided that he is to be painted at full length with his bandy legs hidden under a gown and his great globular eyes staring at the spectatorill get you the job shall i tell you what he says of mrs rooks recovery  miss ladd held up her hands in amazement recovery she exclaimed  and a most remarkable recovery too alban informed her it is the first case on record of any person getting over such an injury as she has received doctor allday looked grave when he heard of it i begin to believe in the devil he said nobody else could have saved mrs rook other people dont take that view she has been celebrated in all the medical newspapersand she has been admitted to come excellent almshouse to live in comfortable idleness to a green old age the best of it is that she shakes her head when her wonderful recovery is mentioned it seems such a pity she says i was so fit for heaven mr rook having got rid of his wife is in excellent spirits he is occupied in looking after an imbecile old gentleman and when he is asked if he likes the employment he winks mysteriously and slaps his pocket now miss ladd i think its my turn to hear some news what have you got to tell me  i believe i can match your account of mrs rook miss ladd said do you care to hear what has become of francine  alban rattling on hitherto in boyish high spirits suddenly became serious i have no doubt miss de sor is doing well he said sternly she is too heartless and wicked not to prosper  you are getting like your old cynical self again mr morrisand you are wrong i called this morning on the agent who had the care of francine when i left england when i mentioned her name he showed me a telegram sent to him by her father theres my authority he said for letting her leave my house the message was short enough to be easily remembered anything my daughter likes as long as she doesnt come back to us in those cruel terms mr de sor wrote of his own child the agent was just as unfeeling in his way he called her the victim of slighted love and clever proselytizing in plain words he said the priest of the catholic chapel close by has converted her and she is now a novice in a convent of carmelite nuns in the west of england who could have expected it who knows how it may end  as miss ladd spoke the bell rang at the cottage gate here she is alban cried leading the way into the hall emily has come home
