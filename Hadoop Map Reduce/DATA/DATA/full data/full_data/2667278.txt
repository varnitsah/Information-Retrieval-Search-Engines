ad 200262 lucretius to a young american bookhunter rochefoucauld of vers de societe on vers de societe richardson gerard de nerval on books about red men appendix i appendix ii     dedication   dear mr way  after so many letters to people who never existed may i venture a short one to a person very real to me though i have never seen him and only know him by his many kindnesses  perhaps you will add another to these by accepting the dedication of a little work of a sort experimental in english and in prose though horacein latin and in versewas successful with it long ago  very sincerely yours  a lang  to w j way esq topeka kansas     preface   these letters were originally published in the independent of new york the idea of writing them occurred to the author after he had produced letters to dead authors  that kind of epistle was open to the objection that nobody would write so frankly to a correspondent about his own work and yet it seemed that the form of letters might be attempted again  the lettres a emilie sur la mythologie are a well known model but emilie was not an imaginary correspondent  the persons addressed here on the other hand are all people of fancythe name of lady violet lebas is an invention of mr thackerays gifted hopkins is the minor poet in dr oliver wendell holmess guardian angel  the authors object has been to discuss a few literary topics with more freedom and personal bias than might be permitted in a graver kind of essay  the letter on samuel richardson is by a lady more frequently the authors critic than his collaborator     introductory of modern english poetry   to mr arthur wincott topeka kansas  dear wincottyou write to me from your bright home in the setting sun with the flattering information that you have read my poor letters to dead authors  you are kind enough to say that you wish i would write some letters to living authors but that i fear is out of the questionfor me  a thoughtful critic in the spectator has already remarked that the great men of the past would not care for my shadowy epistlesif they could read them  possibly not but like prior i may write till they can spellan exercise of which ghosts are probably as incapable as was matts little mistress of quality  but living authors are very different people and it would be perilous as well as impertinent to direct ones comments on them literally in the french phrase to their address  yet there is no reason why a critic should not adopt the epistolary form  our old english essays the papers in the tatler and spectator were originally nothing but letters  the vehicle permits a touch of personal taste perhaps of personal prejudice  so i shall write my letters on literature of the present and of the past english american ancient or modern to you in your distant kansas or to such other correspondents as are kind enough to read these notes  poetry has always the precedence in these discussions  poor poetry  she is an ancient maiden of good family and is led out first at banquets though many would prefer to sit next some livelier and younger muse the lady of fiction or even the chattering soubrette of journalism seniores priores poetry if no longer very popular is a dame of the worthiest lineage and can boast a long train of gallant admirers dead and gone  she has been much in courts  the old greek tyrants loved her great rhamses seated her at his right hand every prince had his singers now we dwell in an age of democracy and poetry wins but a feigned respect more out of courtesy and for old friendships sake than for liking  though so many write verse as in juvenals time i doubt if many read it  none but minstrels list of sonneting  the purchasing public for poetry must now consist chiefly of poets and they are usually poor  can anything speak more clearly of the decadence of the art than the birth of so many poetical societies  we have the browning society the shelley society the shakespeare society the wordsworth societylately dead  they all demonstrate that people have not the courage to study verse in solitude and for their proper pleasure men and women need confederates in this adventure  there is safety in numbers and by dint of teaparties recitations discussions quarrels and the like dr furnivall and his friends keep blowing the faint embers on the altar of apollo  they cannot raise a flame  in england we are in the odd position of having several undeniable poets and very little new poetry worthy of the name  the chief singers have outlived if not their genius at all events its flowering time  hard it is to estimate poetry so apt we are by our very nature to prefer the newest songs as odysseus says men did even during the war of troy  or following another ancient example we say like the rich niggards who neglected theocritus homer is enough for all  let us attempt to get rid of every bias and thinking as dispassionately as we can we still seem to read the name of tennyson in the golden book of english poetry  i cannot think that he will ever fall to a lower place or be among those whom only curious students pore over like gower drayton donne and the rest  lovers of poetry will always read him as they will read wordsworth keats milton coleridge and chaucer look his defects in the face throw them into the balance and how they disappear before his merits  he is the last and youngest of the mighty race born as it were out of due time late and into a feebler generation  let it be admitted that the gold is not without alloy that he has a touch of voluntary affectation of obscurity even an occasional perversity a mannerism a set of favourite epithets windy and happy  there is a momentary echo of donne of crashaw nay in his earliest pieces even a touch of leigh hunt  you detect it in pieces like lilian and eleanore and the others of that kind and of that date  let it be admitted that in memoriam has certain lapses in all that meed of melodious tears that there are trivialities which might deserve here is an example to line a box or to curl some maidens locks that there are weaknesses of thought that the poet now speaks of himself as a linnet singing because it must now dares to approach questions insoluble and again declines their solution  what is all this but the changeful mood of grief  the singing linnet like the bird in the old english heathen apologue dashes its light wings painfully against the walls of the chamber into which it has flown out of the blind night that shall again receive it  i do not care to dwell on the imperfections in that immortal strain of sympathy and consolation that enchanted book of consecrated regrets  it is an easier if not more grateful task to note a certain peevish egotism of tone in the heroes of locksley hall of maud of lady clara vere de vere  you cant think how poor a figure you make when you tell that story sir said dr johnson to some unlucky gentleman whose figure must certainly have been more respectable than that which is cut by these whining and peevish lovers of maud and cousin amy  let it be admitted too that king arthur of the idylls is like an albert in blank verse an albert cursed with a guinevere for a wife and a lancelot for friend  the idylls with all their beauties are full of a victorian respectability and love of talking with vivien about what is not so respectable  one wishes at times that the morte darthur had remained a lonely and flawless fragment as noble as homer as polished as sophocles  but then we must have missed with many other admirable things the last battle in the west  people who come after us will be more impressed than we are by the laureates versatility  he has touched so many strings from will waterproofs monologue so far above praed to the agony of rizpah the invincible energy of ulysses the languor and the fairy music of the lotus eaters the grace as of a greek epigram which inspires the lines to catullus and to virgil  he is with milton for learning with keats for magic and vision with virgil for graceful recasting of ancient golden lines and even in the latest volume of his long life we may tell from the straw as homer says what the grain has been  there are many who make it a kind of religion to regard mr browning as the greatest of living english poets  for him too one is thankful as for a veritable great poet but can we believe that impartial posterity will rate him with the laureate or that so large a proportion of his work will endure  the charm of an enigma now attracts students who feel proud of being able to understand what others find obscure  but this attraction must inevitably become a stumblingblock  why mr browning is obscure is a long question probably the answer is that he often could not help himself  his darkest poems may be made out by a person of average intelligence who will read them as hard as for example he would find it necessary to read the logic of hegel  there is a story of two clever girls who set out to peruse sordello and corresponded with each other about their progress  somebody is dead in sordello one of them wrote to her friend  i dont quite know who it is but it must make things a little clearer in the long run  alas a copious use of the guillotine would scarcely clear the stage of sordello  it is hardly to be hoped that sordello or red cotton night cap country or fifine will continue to be struggled with by posterity  but the mass of men and women that unexampled gallery of portraits of the inmost hearts and secret minds of priests prigs princes girls lovers poets painters must survive immortally while civilization and literature last while men care to know what is in men  no perversity of humour no voluntary or involuntary harshness of style can destroy the merit of these poems which have nothing like them in the letters of the past and must remain without successful imitators in the future  they will last all the better for a certain manliness of religious faithsomething sturdy and assurednot moved by winds of doctrine not paltering with doubts which is certainly one of mr brownings attractions in this fickle and shifting generation  he cannot be forgotten while as he says           a sunset touch    a chorus ending of euripides  remind men that they are creatures of immortality and move a thousand hopes and fears  if one were to write out of mere personal preference and praise most that which best fits ones private moods i suppose i should place mr matthew arnold at the head of contemporary english poets  reason and reflection discussion and critical judgment tell one that he is not quite there  mr arnold had not the many melodies of the laureate nor his versatile mastery nor his magic nor his copiousness  he had not the microscopic glance of mr browning nor his rude grasp of facts which tears the life out of them as the aztec priest plucked the very heart from the victim we know that but yet mr arnolds poetry has our love his lines murmur in our memory through all the stress and accidents of life  the scholar gipsy obermann switzerland the melancholy majesty of the close of sohrab and rustum the tenderness of those elegiacs on two kindred graves beneath the himalayas and by the midland sea the surge and thunder of dover beach with its melancholy longwithdrawing roar these can only cease to whisper to us and console us in that latest hour when life herself ceases to moan round with many voices  my friends tell me that mr arnold is too doubting and too didactic that he protests too much and considers too curiously that his best poems are at most a chain of highly valuable thoughts  it may be so but he carries us back to wet birdhaunted english lawns like him we know what white and purple fritillaries the grassy harvest of the river yields with him we try to practise resignation and to give ourselves over to that spirit     whose purpose is not missed    while life endures while things subsist  mr arnolds poetry is to me in brief what wordsworths was to his generation  he has not that inspired greatness of wordsworth when nature does for him what his lutin did for corneille takes the pen from his hand and writes for him  but he has none of the creeping prose which to my poor mind invades even tintern abbey  he is as mr swinburne says the surestfooted of our poets  he can give a natural and lovely life even to the wildest of ancient imaginings as to these bright and ancient snakes that once were cadmus and harmonia  bacon speaks of the legends of the earlier and ruder world coming to us breathed softly through the flutes of the grecians  but even the grecian flute as in the lay of the strife of apollo and marsyas comes more tunably in the echo of mr arnolds song that beautiful song in empedocles on etna which has the perfection of sculpture and the charm of the purest colour  it is full of the silver light of dawn among the hills of the music of the lochs dark slow waves among the reeds of the scent of the heather and the wet tresses of the birch  surely then we have had great poets living among us but the fountains of their song are silent or flow but rarely over a clogged and stony channel  and who is there to succeed the two who are gone or who shall be our poet if the master be silent  that is a melancholy question which i shall try to answer with doubt and dread enough in my next letter 1     of modern english poetry   my dear wincotti hear that a book has lately been published by an american lady in which all the modern poets are represented  the singers have been induced to make their own selections and put forward as mr browning says their best foot anapaest or trochee or whatever it may be  my information goes further and declares that there are but eighteen poets of england to sixty inspired americans  this western collection of modern minstrelsy shows how very dangerous it is to write even on the english poetry of the day  eighteen is long odds against a single critic and major bellenden in old mortality tells us that three to one are odds as long as ever any warrior met victoriously and that warrior was old corporal raddlebanes  i decline the task i am not going to try to estimate either the eighteen of england or the sixty of the states  it is enough to speak about three living poets in addition to those masters treated of in my last letter two of the three you will have guessed atmr swinburne and mr william morris  the third i dare say you do not know even by name  i think he is not one of the english eighteenmr robert bridges  his muse has followed the epicurean maxim and chosen the shadowy path fallentis semita vitae where the dew lies longest on the grass and the red rowan berries droop in autumn above the yellow st johns wort  but you will find her all the fresher for her country ways  my knowledge of mr william morriss poetry begins in years so far away that they seem like reminiscences of another existence  i remember sitting beneath cardinal beatons ruined castle at st andrews looking across the bay to the sunset while some one repeated two red roses across the moon  and i remember thinking that the poem was nonsense with mr morriss other early verses the defence of guinevere this song of the moon and the roses was published in 1858  probably the little book won no attention it is not popular even now  yet the lyrics remain in memories which forget all but a general impression of the vast earthly paradise that huge decorative poem in which slim maidens and greenclad men and waters wan and flowering apple trees and rich palaces are all mingled as on some long ancient tapestry shaken a little by the wind of death  they are not living and breathing people these persons of the fables they are but shadows beautiful and faint and their poem is fit reading for sleepy summer afternoons  but the characters in the lyrics in the defence of guinevere are people of flesh and blood under their chain armour and their velvet and the trappings of their tabards  there is no book in the world quite like this of mr morriss old oxford days when the spirit of the middle ages entered into him with all its contradictions of faith and doubt and its earnest desire to enjoy this life to the full in war and love or to make certain of a future in which war is not and all love is pure heavenly  if one were to choose favourites from the defence of guinevere they would be the ballads of shameful death and of the sailing of the sword and the wind which has the winds wail in its voice and all the mad regret of porphyrias lover in its burden  the use of colourwords in all these pieces is very curious and happy  the red ruby the brown falcon the white maids the scarlet roofs of the good town in the sailing of the sword make the poem a vivid picture  then look at the mad remorseful searover the slayer of his lady in the wind     for my chair is heavy and carved and with sweeping green behind    it is hung and the dragons thereon grin out in the gusts of the wind    on its folds an orange lies with a deep gash cut in the rind    if i move my chair it will scream and the orange will roll out far    and the faint yellow juice ooze out like blood from a wizards jar    and the dogs will howl for those who went last month the war  the blue closet which is said to have been written for some drawings of mr rossetti is also a masterpiece in this romantic manner  our brief english age of romanticism our 1830 was 185660 when mr morris mr burne jones and mr swinburne were undergraduates  perhaps it wants a peculiar turn of taste to admire these strange things though the haystack in the floods with its tragedy must surely appeal to all who read poetry  for the rest as time goes on i more and more feel as if mr morriss long later poems the earthly paradise especially were less art than art manufacture  this may be an ungrateful and erroneous sentiment the earthly paradise and still more certainly jason are full of such pleasure as only poetry can give  as some one said of a contemporary politician they are good but copious  even from narrative poetry mr morris has long abstained  he too illustrates mr matthew arnolds parable of the progress of poetry     the mount is mute the channel dry  euripides has been called the meteoric poet and the same title seems very appropriate to mr swinburne  probably few readers had heard his namei only knew it as that of the author of a strange mediaeval tale in prosewhen he published atalanta in calydon in 1865  i remember taking up the quarto in white cloth at the oxford union and being instantly led captive by the beauty and originality of the verse  there was this novel meteoric character in the poem the writer seemed to rejoice in snow and fire and stars and storm the blue cold fields and folds of air in all the primitive forces which were alive before this earth was the naked vast powers that circle the planets and farthest constellations  this quality and his varied and sonorous verse and his pessimism put into the mouth of a greek chorus were the things that struck one most in mr swinburne  he was above all a mightymouthed inventer of harmonies and one looked eagerly for his next poems  they came with disappointment and trouble  the famous poems and ballads have become so well known that people can hardly understand the noise they made  i dont wonder at the scandal even now  i dont see the fun of several of the pieces except the mischievous fun of shocking your audience  however the leper and his company are chiefly boyish in the least favourable sense of the word they do not destroy the imperishable merit of the hymn to proserpine and the garden of proserpine and the triumph of time and itylus  many years have passed since 1866 and yet ones old opinion that english poetry contains no verbal music more original sonorous and sweet than mr swinburne wrote in these pieces when still very young remains an opinion unshaken  twenty years ago then he had enabled the world to take his measure he had given proofs of a true poet he was learned too in literature as few poets have been since milton and like milton skilled to make verse in the languages of the ancient world and in modern tongues  his french songs and greek elegiacs are of great excellence probably no scholar who was not also a poet could match his greek lines on landor  what then is lacking to make mr swinburne a poet of a rank even higher than that which he occupies  who can tell  there is no science that can master this chemistry of the brain  he is too copious  bothwell is long enough for six plays and tristram of lyonesse is prolix beyond even mediaeval narrative  he is too pertinacious children are the joy of the world and victor hugo is a great poet but mr swinburne almost makes us excuse herod and napoleon iii by his endless odes to hugo and rondels to small boys and girls  ne quid nimis that is the golden rule which he constantly spurns being too luxuriant too emphatic and as fond of repeating himself as professor freeman  such are the defects of so noble a genius thus perverse nature has decided that it shall be nature which makes no ruby without a flaw  the name of mr robert bridges is probably strange to many lovers of poetry who would like nothing better than to make acquaintance with his verse  but his verse is not so easily found  this poet never writes in magazines his books have not appealed to the public by any sort of advertisement only two or three of them have come forth in the regular way  the first was poems by robert bridges batchelor of arts in the university of oxford  parva seges satis est  london pickering 1873  this volume was presently i fancy withdrawn and the author has distributed some portions of it in succeeding pamphlets or in books printed at mr daniels private press in oxford  in these as in all mr bridgess poems there is a certain austere and indifferent beauty of diction and a memory of the old english poets milton and the earlier lyrists  i remember being greatly pleased with the elegy on a lady whom grief for the death of her betrothed killed     let the priests go before arrayed in white       and let the darkstoled minstrels follow slow    next they that bear her honoured on this night       and then the maidens in a double row       each singing soft and low    and each on high a torch upstaying    unto her lover lead her forth with light    with music and with singing and with praying  this is a stately stanza  in his first volume mr bridges offered a few rondeaux and triolets turning his back on all these things as soon as they became popular  in spite of their popularity i have the audacity to like them still in their humble twittering way  much more in his true vein were the lines clear and gentle stream and all the other verses in which like a true etonian he celebrates the beautiful thames     there is a hill beside the silver thames       shady with birch and beech and odorous pine    and brilliant under foot with thousand gems       steeply the thickets to his floods decline          straight trees in every place          their thick tops interlace       and pendent branches trail their foliage fine          upon his watery face              a reedy island guards the sacred bower       and hides it from the meadow where in peace    the lazy cows wrench many a scented flower       robbing the golden market of the bees          and laden branches float          by banks of myosote       and scented flag and golden fleurdelys          delay the loitering boat  i cannot say how often i have read that poem and how delightfully it carries the breath of our river through the london smoke  nor less welcome are the two poems on spring the invitation to the country and the reply  in these besides their verbal beauty and their charming pictures is a manly philosophy of life which animates mr bridgess more important pieceshis prometheus the firebringer and his nero a tragedy remarkable for the representation of nero himself the luxurious human tiger  from prometheus i make a short extract to show the quality of mr bridgess blank verse     nor is there any spirit on earth astir    nor neath the airy vault nor yet beyond    in any dweller in farreaching space    nobler or dearer than the spirit of man    that spirit which lives in each and will not die    that wooeth beauty and for all good things    urgeth a voice or still in passion sigheth    and where he loveth draweth the heart with him  mr bridgess latest book is his eros and psyche bell  sons who publish the prometheus  it is the old story very closely followed and beautifully retold with a hundred memories of ancient poets homer dante theocritus as well as of apuleius  i have named mr bridges here because his poems are probably all but unknown to readers well acquainted with many other english writers of late days  on them especially on actual contemporaries or juniors in age it would be almost impertinent for me to speak to you but even at that risk i take the chance of directing you to the poetry of mr bridges  i owe so much pleasure to its delicate air that if speech be impertinence silence were ingratitude 2     fielding   to mrs goodhart in the upper mississippi valley  dear madammany thanks for the new york newspaper you have kindly sent me with the statistics of bookbuying in the upper mississippi valley those are interesting particulars which tell one so much about the taste of a community  so the rev e p roe is your favourite novelist there a thousand of his books are sold for every two copies of the works of henry fielding  this appears to me to speak but oddly for taste in the upper mississippi valley  on mr roes works i have no criticism to pass for i have not read them carefully  but i do think your neighbours lose a great deal by neglecting henry fielding  you will tell me he is coarse which i cannot deny you will remind me of what dr johnson said rebuking mrs hannah more  i never saw johnson really angry with me but once writes that sainted maiden lady  i alluded to some witty passage in tom jones  he replied i am shocked to hear you quote from so vicious a book  i am sorry to hear you have read it a confession which no modest lady should ever make  you remind me of this and that johnson was no prude and that his age was tolerant  you add that the literary taste of the upper mississippi valley is much more pure than the waters of her majestic river and that you only wish you knew who the two culprits were that bought books of fieldings  ah madam how shall i answer you  remember that if you have johnson on your side on mine i have mrs more herself a character purer than the consecrated snow that lies on dians lap  again we cannot believe johnson was fair to fielding who had made his friend the author of pamela very uncomfortable by his jests  johnson owned that he read all amelia at one sitting  could so worthy a man have been so absorbed by an unworthy book  once more i am not recommending fielding to boys and girls  tom jones was one of the works that lydia languish hid under the sofa even miss languish did not care to be caught with that humorous foundling fielding was the last of our writers who drew a man mr thackeray said and he certainly did not study from a draped model  for these reasons and because his language is often unpolished and because his morality that he is always preaching is not for those that eddy round and round i do not desire to see fielding popular among miss alcotts readers  but no man who cares for books can neglect him and many women are quite manly enough have good sense and good taste enough to benefit by amelia by much of tom jones  i dont say by joseph andrews  no man ever respected your sex more than henry fielding  what says his reformed rake mr wilson in joseph andrews  to say the truth i do not perceive that inferiority of understanding which the levity of rakes the dulness of men of business and the austerity of the learned would persuade us of in women  as for my wife i declare i have found none of my own sex capable of making juster observations on life or of delivering them more agreeably nor do i believe any one possessed of a faithfuller or braver friend  he has no other voice wherein to speak of a happy marriage  can you find among our genteel writers of this age a figure more beautiful tender devoted and in all good ways womanly than sophia westerns  yes you will say but the man must have been a brute who could give her to tom jones to that fellow who sold himself as colonel newcome said there you have me at an avail in the language of the old romancers there we touch the centre of fieldings morality a subject ill to discuss a morality not for everyday preaching  fielding distinctly takes himself for a moralist  he preaches as continually as thackeray  and his moral is this let a man be kind generous charitable tolerant brave honestand we may pardon him vices of young blood and the stains of adventurous living  fielding has no mercy on a seducer  lovelace would have fared worse with him than with richardson who i verily believe admired that infernal excuse me coward and villain  the case of young nightingale in tom jones will show you what fielding thought of such gallants  why tom himself preaches to nightingale  miss nancys interest alone and not yours ought to be your sole consideration cried thomas    and the very best and truest honour which is goodness requires it of you that is requires that nightingale shall marry miss nancy  how tom jones combined these sentiments which were perfectly honest with his own astonishing lack of retenue and with lady bellaston is just the puzzle  we cannot very well argue about it  i only ask you to let jones in his right mind partly excuse jones in a number of very delicate situations  if you ask me whether sophia had not after her marriage to be as forgiving as amelia i fear i must admit that probably it was so  but dr johnson himself thought little of that  i am afraid our only way of dealing with fieldings morality is to take the best of it and leave the remainder alone  here i find that i have unconsciously agreed with that wellknown philosopher mr james boswell the younger of auchinleck  the moral tendency of fieldings writings    is ever favourable to honour and honesty and cherishes the benevolent and generous affections he who is as good as fielding would make him is an amiable member of society and may be led on by more regulated instructions to a higher state of ethical perfection  let us be as good and simple as adams without his vanity and his oddity as brave and generous as jones without joness faults and what a world of men and women it will become  fielding did not paint that unborn world he sketched the world he knew very well  he found that respectable people were often perfectly blind to the duties of charity in every sense of the word  he found that the only man in a whole company who pitied joseph andrews when stripped and beaten by robbers was a postilion with defects in his moral character  in short he knew that respectability often practised none but the strictly selfregarding virtues and that poverty and recklessness did not always extinguish a native goodness of heart  perhaps this discovery made him leniently disposed to characters and situations so wretchedly low and dirty that i say the author of pamela could not be interested for any one of them  how amusing richardson always was about fielding  how jealousy spite and the confusion of mind that befogs a prig when he is not taken seriously do darken the eyes of the author of those deplorably tedious lamentations clarissa and sir charles grandison as horace walpole calls them  fielding asks his muse to give him humour and good humour  what novelist was ever so rich in both  who ever laughed at mankind with so much affection for mankind in his heart  this love shines in every book of his  the poor have all his goodwill and in him an untired advocate and friend  what a life the poor led in the england of 1742  there never before was such tyranny without a servile insurrection  i remember a dreadful passage in joseph andrews where lady booby is trying to have fanny josephs sweetheart locked up in prison  it would do a man good says her accomplice scout to see his worship our justice commit a fellow to bridewell he takes so much pleasure in it  and when once we ha um there we seldom hear any more o um  hes either starved or eat up by vermin in a months time  this england with its dominant squires who behaved much like robber barons on the rhine was the merry england fielding tried to turn from some of its ways  i seriously do believe that with all its faults it was a better place with a better breed of men than our england of to day  but fielding satirized intolerable injustice  he would be a reformer a didactic writer  if we are to have nothing but art for arts sake that burly body of harry fieldings must even go to the wall  the first beau didapper of a critic that passes can shove him aside  he preaches like thackeray he writes with a purpose like dickensobsolete old authors  his cause is judged and into bridewell he goes if lart pour lart is all the literary law and the prophets  but fielding cannot be kept in prison long  his noble english his sonorous voice must be heard  there is somewhat inexpressibly heartening to me in the style of fielding  one seems to be carried along like a swimmer in a strong clear stream trusting ones self to every whirl and eddy with a feeling of safety of comfort of delightful ease in the motion of the elastic water  he is a scholar nay more as adams had his innocent vanity fielding has his innocent pedantry  he likes to quote greek fancy quoting greek in a novel of today and to make the rogues of printers set it up correctly  he likes to air his ideas on homer to bring in a piece of aristotlenot hackneyedto show you that if he is writing about characters and situations so wretchedly low and dirty he is yet a student and a critic  mr samuel richardson a man of little reading according to johnson was i doubt sadly put to it to understand booths conversations with the author who remarked that perhaps mr pope followed the french translations  i observe indeed he talks much in the notes of madame dacier and monsieur eustathius  what knew samuel of eustathius  i not only can forgive fielding his pedantry i like it  i like a man of letters to be a scholar and his little pardonable display and ostentation of his greek only brings him nearer to us who have none of his genius and do not approach him but in his faults  they make him more human one loves him for them as he loves squire western with all his failings  delightful immortal squire  it was not he it was another tory squire that called out hurray for old england  twenty thousand honest frenchmen are landed in sussex  but it was western that talked of one acton that the story book says was turned into a hare and his own dogs killd un and eat un  and have you forgotten the popular discussion during the fortyfive of the affairs of the nation which as squire western said all of us understand  said the puppetman i dont care what religion comes provided the presbyterians are not uppermost for they are enemies to puppetshows  but the puppetman had no vote in 1745  now to our comfort he can and does exercise the glorious privilege of the franchise  there is no room in this epistle for fieldings glorious gallery of charactersfor lady bellaston who remains a lady in her debaucheries and is therefore so unlike our modern representative of her class lady betty in miss broughtons doctor cupid for square and thwackum and trulliber and the jealous spite of lady booby and honour that undying ladys maid and partridge and captain blifil and amelia the fair and kind and good  it is like the whole world of that old englandthe maids of the inn the parish clerk the two sportsmen the hosts of the taverns the beaux the starveling authorsall alive all save the authors full of beef and beer a cudgel in every fist every man ready for a brotherly bout at fisticuffs  what has become of it the lusty old militant world  what will become of us and why do we prefer to fieldinga number of meritorious moderns  who knows  but do not let us prefer anything to our english follower of cervantes our wise merry learned sancho trudging on english roads like don quixote on the paths of spain  but i cannot convert you  you will turn to some story about storeclerks and summer visitors  such is his fate who argues with the fair     longfellow   to walter mainwaring esq lothian college oxford  my dear mainwaringyou are very good to ask me to come up and listen to a discussion by the college browning society of the minor characters in sordello but i think it would suit me better if you didnt mind to come up when the may races are on  i am not deeply concerned about the minor characters in sordello and have long reconciled myself to the conviction that i must pass through this pilgrimage without hearing sordellos story told in an intelligible manner  your letter however set me avoyaging about my bookshelves taking up a volume of poetry here and there  what an interesting tract might be written by any one who could remember and honestly describe the impressions that the same books have made on him at different ages  there is longfellow for example  i have not read much in him for twenty years  i take him up today and what a flood of memories his music brings with it  to me it is like a sad autumn wind blowing over the woods blowing over the empty fields bringing the scents of october the song of a belated bird and here and there a red leaf from the tree  there is that autumnal sense of things fair and far behind in his poetry or if it is not there his poetry stirs it in our forsaken lodges of the past  yes it comes to one out of ones boyhood it breathes of a world very vaguely realizeda world of imitative sentiments and forebodings of hours to come  perhaps longfellow first woke me to that later sense of what poetry means which comes with early manhood  before one had been content i am still content with scott in his battle pieces with the ballads of the border  longfellow had a touch of reflection you do not find of course in battle poems in a boys favourites such as of nelson and the north or ye mariners of england  his moral reflections may seem obvious now and trite they were neither when one was fifteen  to read the voices of the night in particularthose early piecesis to be back at school again on a sunday reading all alone on a summers day high in some tree with a wide prospect of gardens and fields  there is that mysterious note in the tone and measure which one first found in longfellow which has since reached our ears more richly and fully in keats in coleridge in tennyson  take for example     the welcome the thrice prayed for the most fair       the bestbeloved night  is not that version of euripides exquisitedoes it not seem exquisite still though this is not the quality you expect chiefly from longfellow though you rather look to him for honest human matter than for an indefinable beauty of manner  i believe it is the manner after all of the psalm of life that has made it so strangely popular  people tell us excellent people that it is as good as a sermon that they value it for this reason that its lesson has strengthened the hearts of men in our difficult life  they say so and they think so but the poem is not nearly as good as a sermon it is not even coherent  but it really has an original cadence of its own with its double rhymes and the pleasure of this cadence has combined with a belief that they are being edified to make readers out of number consider the psalms of life a masterpiece  youmy learned prosodist and student of browning and shelleywill agree with me that it is not a masterpiece  but i doubt if you have enough of the experience brought by years to tolerate the opposite opinion as your elders can  how many other poems of longfellows there are that remind us of youth and of those kind vanished faces which were around us when we read the reaper and the flowers  i read again and as the poet says     then the forms of the departed       enter at the open door    the beloved the truehearted       come to visit me once more  compare that simple strain you lover of theophile gautier with theos own chateau de souvenir in emaux et camees and confess the truth which poet brings the break into the readers voice  it is not the dainty accomplished frenchman the jeweller in words it is the simpler speaker of our english tongue who stirs you as a ballad moves you  i find one comes back to longfellow and to ones old self of the old years  i dont know a poem of the affections as sir barnes newcome would have called it that i like better than thackerays canebottomed chair  well the fire of driftwood and this other of longfellows with its absolute lack of pretence its artful avoidance of art is not less tender and true     and she sits and gazes at me       with those deep and tender eyes    like the stars so still and saintlike       looking downward from the skies  it is from the skies that they look down those eyes which once read the voices of the night from the same book with us how long ago  so long ago that one was halffrightened by the legend of the beleaguered city i know the ballad brought the scene to me so vividly that i expected any frosty night to see how     the white pavilions rose and fell       on the alarmed air  and it was down the valley of ettrick beneath the dark three brethrens cairn that i halfhoped to watch when the troubled army fledfled with battered banners of mist drifting through the pines down to the tweed and the sea  the skeleton in armour comes out once more as terrific as ever and the wreck of the hesperus touches one in the old simple way after so many many days of versereading and even versewriting  in brief longfellows qualities are so mixed with what the reader brings with so many kindliest associations of memory that one cannot easily criticize him in cold blood  even in spite of this friendliness and affection which longfellow wins i can see of course that he does moralize too much  the first part of his lyrics is always the best the part where he is dealing directly with his subject  then comes the practical application as preachers say and i feel now that it is sometimes uncalled for disenchanting and even manufactured  look at his endymion  it is the earlier verses that win you     and silver white the river gleams    as if diana in her dreams       had dropt her silver bow       upon the meadows low  that is as good as ronsard and very like him in manner and matter  but the moral and consolatory application is too longtoo much dwelt on     like dians kiss unasked unsought    love gives itself but is not bought  excellent but there are four weak moralizing stanzas at the close and not only does the poet moralize his song but the moral is feeble and fantastic and untrue  there are though he denies it myriads of persons now of whom it cannot be said that     some heart though unknown       responds unto his own  if it were true the reflection could only console a schoolgirl  a poem like my lost youth is needed to remind one of what the author really was simple sensuous passionate  what a lovely verse this is a verse somehow inspired by the breath of longfellows favourite finnish kalevala a verse of a lapland song like a wind over pines and salt coasts     i remember the black wharves and the slips       and the seatide tossing free    and spanish sailors with bearded lips    and the beauty and the mystery of the ships       and the magic of the sea  thus longfellow though not a very great magician and master of languagenot a keats by any meanshas often by sheer force of plain sincerity struck exactly the right note and matched his thought with music that haunts us and will not be forgotten     ye open the eastern windows       that look towards the sun    where thoughts are singing swallows       and the brooks of morning run  there is a picture of sandro botticellis the virgin seated with the child by a hedge of roses in a faint blue air as of dawn in paradise this poem of longfellows the childrens hour seems like botticellis painting to open a door into the paradise of children where their angels do ever behold that which is hidden from menwhat no man hath seen at any time  longfellow is exactly the antithesis of poe who with all his science of verse and ghostly skill has no humanity or puts none of it into his lines  one is the poet of life and everyday life the other is the poet of death and of bizarre shapes of death from which heaven deliver us  neither of them shows any sign of being particularly american though longfellow in evangeline and hiawatha and the new england tragedies sought his topics in the history and traditions of the new world  to me hiawatha seems by far the best of his longer efforts it is quite full of sympathy with men and women nature beasts birds weather and wind and snow  everything lives with a human breath as everything should live in a poem concerned with these wild folk to whom all the world and all in it is personal as themselves  of course there are lapses of style in so long a piece  it jars on us in the lay of the mystic chibiabos the boy persephone of the indian eleusinia to be told that        the gentle chibiabos    sang in tones of deep emotion  tones of deep emotion may pass in a novel but not in this epic of the wild wood and the wild kindreds an epic in all ways a worthy record of those dim mournful races which have left no story of their own only here and there a ruined wigwam beneath the forest leaves  a poets life is no affair perhaps of ours  who does not wish he knew as little of burns as of shakespeares  of longfellows there is nothing to know but good and his poetry testifies to ithis poetry the voice of the kindest and gentlest heart that poet ever bore  i think there are not many things in poets lives more touching than his silence in verse as to his own chief sorrow  a stranger intermeddles not with it and he kept secret his brief lay on that insuperable and incommunicable regret  much would have been lost had all poets been as reticent yet one likes him better for it than if he had given us a new vita nuova  what an immense long way i have wandered from sordello my dear mainwaring but when a man turns to his books his thoughts like those of a boy are long long thoughts  i have not written on longfellows sonnets for even you impeccable sonneteer admit that you admire them as much as i do     a friend of keats   to thomas egerton esq lothian college oxford  dear egertonyes as you say mr sidney colvins new life of keats 3 has only one fault its too short  perhaps also it is almost too studiously free from enthusiasm  but when one considers how keats like shelley has been gushed about and how easy it is to gush about keats one can only thank mr colvin for his example of reserve  what a good fellow keats was  how really manly and in the best sense moral he seems when one compares his life and his letters with the vagaries of contemporary poets who lived longer than he though they too died young and who left more work though not better never so good perhaps as keatss best  however it was not of keats that i wished to write but of his friend john hamilton reynolds  noscitur a sociisa man is known by the company he keeps  reynolds i think must have been excellent company if we may judge him by his writings  he comes into lord houghtons life and letters of keats very early vol i p 30  we find the poet writing to him in the april of 1817 from the isle of wight  i shall forthwith begin my endymion which i hope i shall have got some way with before you come when we will read our verses in a delightful place i have set my heart upon near the castle  keats ends your sincere friend and a man to whom keats was a sincere friend had some occasion for pride  about reynoldss life neither time nor space permits me to say very much if i knew very much which i dont  he was the son of a master in one of our large schools  he went to the bar  he married a sister of thomas hood  he wrote like hood in the london magazine  with hood for ally he published odes and addresses to great people the third edition which i have here is of 1826  the late relations of the brothersinlaw were less happy possibly the ladies of their families quarrelled that is usually the way of the belligerent sex  reynolds died in the enjoyment of a judicial office in the isle of wight some thirty years later than his famous friend the author of endymion it is to be lamented says lord houghton that mr reynoldss own remarkable verse is not better known  let us try to know it a little better  i have not succeeded in getting reynoldss first volume of poems which was published before endymion  it contained some oriental melodies and won a careless good word from byron  the earliest work of his i can lay my hand on is the fancy a selection from the poetical remains of the late peter corcoran of grays inn student at law with a brief memoir of his life  there is a motto from wordsworth     frank are the sports the stains are fugitive  4  it was the old palmy time of the ring  every one knows how byron took lessons from jackson the boxer how shelley had a fight at eton in which he quoted homer but was licked by a smaller boy how christopher north whipped the professional pugilist how keats himself never had enough of fighting at school and beat the butcher afterwards  his friend reynolds also liked a setto with the gloves  his imaginary character peter corcoran is a poetical lad who becomes possessed by a passion for prizefighting  it seems odd in a poet but the stains are fugitive  we would liefer see a young man rejoicing in his strength and improving his science than loafing about with long hair and giving anxious thought to the colour of his necktie  it is a disinterested preference as fighting was never my forte any more than it was artemus wards  at school i was more remarkable for what i suffered than for what i achieved  peter corcoran fought nearly as soon as he could walk wherein he resembled keats and part of his character may even have been borrowed from the author of the ode to the nightingale  peter fell in love wrote poetry witnessed a mill at the fivescourt and became the laureate of the ring  he has made a good setto with eales tom belcher the monarch of the gloves and turner and it is known that he has parried the difficult and ravaging hand even of randall himself  the difficult and ravaging handthere is a style for you  reynolds has himself the enthusiasm of his hero let us remember that homer virgil and theocritus have all described spirited rallies with admiration and good taste  from his dissipation in cidercellars and coalholes this rival of tom and jerry wrote a sonnet that applies well enough to reynoldss own career     were this a feather from an eagles wing       and thou my tablet white a marble tile       taken from ancient joves majestic pile    and might i dip my feather in some spring    adown mount ida threadlike wandering       and were my thoughts brought from some starry isle       in heavens blue seai then might with a smile    write down a hymn to fame and proudly sing     but i am mortal and i cannot write       aught that may foil the fatal wing of time       silent i look at fame i cannot climb    to where her temple isnot mine the might       i have some glimmering of what is sublime    but ah it is a most inconstant light  keats might have written this sonnet in a melancholy mood  about this time he peter wrote a slang description of a fight he had witnessed to a lady  unlucky peter  was ever woman in this manner wooed  the lady glanced her eye over page after page in hopes of meeting with something that was intelligible and no wonder she did not care for a long letter devoted to the subject of a mill between belasco and the brummagem youth  peter was so illadvised as to appear before her with glorious scars two black eyes in fact and she was inexorably cruel  peter did not survive her disdain  the lady still lives and is married  it is ever thus  peters published works contain an american tragedy  peter says he got it from a friend who was sending him an american copy of guy mannering to present to a young lady who strange to say read books and wore pockets virtues unusual in the sex  one of the songs on the delights of bullbaiting contains the most vigorous lines i have ever met but they are too vigorous for our lax age  the tragedy ends most tragically and the moral comes in better late says the author than never  the other poems are all very lively and very much out of date poor peter  reynolds was married by 1818 and it is impossible to guess whether the poems of peter corcoran did or did not contain allusions to his own more lucky love affair  upon my soul writes keats i have been getting more and more close to you every day ever since i knew you and now one of the first pleasures i look to is your happy marriage  reynolds was urging keats to publish the pot of basil as an answer to the attack made on me in blackwoods magazine and the quarterly review  next keats writes that he himself never was in love yet the voice and shape of a woman has haunted me these two days  on september 22 1819 keats sent reynolds the ode to autumn than which there is no more perfect poem in the language of shakespeare  this was the last of his published letters to reynolds  he was dying haunted eternally by that womans shape and voice  reynoldss bestknown book if any of them can be said to be known at all was published under the name of john hamilton  it is the garden of florence and other poems warren london 1821  there is a dedicationto his young wife  thou hast entreated me to write no more and he as an elderly man of twentyfour promises to obey  the lily and myself henceforth are two he says implying that he and the lily have previously been one a quaint confession from the poet of peter corcoran  there is something very pleasant in the graceful regret and obedience of this farewell to the muse  he says to mrs reynolds     i will not tell the world that thou hast chid       my heart for worshipping the idol muse    that thy dark eye has given its gentle lid       tears for my wanderings i may not choose    when thou dost speak but do as i am bid       and therefore to the roses and the dews    very respectfully i make my bow    and turn my back upon the tulips now  the chief poems in the collection taken from boccaccio were to have been associated with tales from the same source intended to have been written by a friend but illness on his part and distracting engagements on mine prevented us from accomplishing our plan at the time and death now to my deep sorrow has frustrated it for ever  i cannot but quote what follows the tribute to keatss kindness to the most endearing quality our nature possesses the quality that was scotts in such a winning degree that was so marked in moliere  he who is gone was one of the very kindest friends i ever possessed and yet he was not kinder perhaps to me than to others  his intense mind and powerful feeling would i truly believe have done the world some service had his life been sparedbut he was of too sensitive a natureand thus he was destroyed  one story he completed and that is to me now the most pathetic poem in existence  it was isabella or the pot of basil  the garden of florence is written in the couplets of endymion and is a beautiful version of the tale once more retold by alfred de musset in simone  from the romance of youth let me quote one stanza which applies to keats     he read and dreamt of young endymion       till his romantic fancy drank its fill    he saw that lovely shepherd sitting lone       watching his white flocks upon idas hill    the moon adored himand when all was still       and stars were wakefulshe would earthward stray    and linger with her shepherd love until       the hooves of the steeds that bear the car of day    struck silver light in the east and then she waned away  it was on latmos not ida that endymion shepherded his flocks but that is of no moment except to schoolmasters  there are other stanzas of reynolds worthy of keats for example this on the fairy queen     her bodice was a pretty sight to see       ye who would know its colourbe a thief    of the roses muffled bud from off the tree       and for your knowledge strip it leaf by leaf    spite of your own remorse or floras grief       till ye have come unto its hearts pale hue    the last last leaf which is the queenthe chief       of beautiful dim blooms ye shall not rue    at sight of that sweet leaf the mischief which ye do  one does not know when to leave off gathering buds in the garden of florence  even after shakespeare and after keats this passage on wild flowers has its own charm     we gathered wood flowerssome blue as the vein    oer heros eyelid stealing and some as white    in the clustering grass as rich europas hand    nested amid the curls on jupiters forehead    what time he snatched her through the startled waves    some poppies too such as in ennas meadows    forsook their own green homes and parent stalks    to kiss the fingers of proserpina    and some were small as fairies eyes and bright    as lovers tears  i wish i had room for three or four sonnets the robin hood sonnets to keats and another on a picture of a lady  excuse the length of this letter and read this     sorrow hath made thine eyes more dark and keen       and set a whiter hue upon thy cheeks       and round thy pressed lips drawn anguishstreaks    and made thy forehead fearfully serene    even in thy steady hair her work is seen       for its still parted darknesstill it breaks       in heavy curls upon thy shouldersspeaks       like the stern wave how hard the storm hath been     so looked that hapless lady of the south       sweet isabella at that dreary part    of all the passiond hours of her youth       when her green basil pot by brothers art    was stolen away so lookd her pained mouth       in the mute patience of a breaking heart  there let us leave him the gay rhymer of prizefighters and eminent personslet us leave him in a serious hour and with a memory of keats 5     on virgil   to lady violet lebas  dear lady violetwho can admire too much your undefeated resolution to admire only the right things  i wish i had this respect for authority but let me confess that i have always admired the things which nature made me prefer and that i have no power of accommodating my taste to the verdict of the critical  if i do not like an author i leave him alone however great his reputation  thus i do not care for mr gibbon except in his autobiography nor for the elegant plays of m racine nor very much for some of wordsworth though his genius is undeniable nor excessively for the late prof amiel  why should we force ourselves into an affection for them any more than into a relish for olives or claret both of which excellent creatures i have the misfortune to dislike  no spectacle annoys me more than the sight of people who ask if it is right to take pleasure in this or that work of art  their loves and hatreds will never be genuine natural spontaneous  you say that it is right to like virgil and yet you admit that you admire the mantuan as the scotch editor joked wi deeficulty  i too must admit that my liking for much of virgils poetry is not enthusiastic not like the admiration expressed for example by mr frederic myers in whose classical essays you will find all that the advocates of the latin singer can say for him  these heights i cannot reach any more than i can equal that eloquence  yet must virgil always appear to us one of the most beautiful and moving figures in the whole of literature  how sweet must have been that personality which can still win our affections across eighteen hundred years of change and through the mists of commentaries and schoolbooks and traditions  does it touch thee at all oh gentle spirit and serene that we who never knew thee love thee yet and revere thee as a saint of heathendom  have the dead any delight in the religion they inspire     id cinerem aut manes credis curare sepultos  i half fancy i can trace the origin of this personal affection for virgil which survives in me despite the lack of a very strong love of parts of his poems  when i was at school we met every morning for prayer in a large circular hall round which on pedestals were set copies of the portrait busts of great ancient writers  among these was the ionian father of the rest our father homer with a winning and venerable majesty  but the bust of virgil was i think of white marble not a cast so at least i remember it and was of a singular youthful purity and beauty sharing my affections with a copy of the exquisite psyche of naples  it showed us that virgil who was called the maiden as milton was named the lady of christs  i dont know the archeology of it perhaps it was a mere work of modern fancy but the charm of this image beheld daily overcame even the tedium of short scraps of the aeneid daily parsed not without stripes and anguish  so i retain a sentiment for virgil though i well perceive the many drawbacks of his poetry  it is not always poetry at first hand it is often imitative like all latin poetry of the greek songs that sounded at the awakening of the world  this is more tolerable when theocritus is the model as in the eclogues and less obvious in the georgics when the poet is carried away into naturalness by the passion for his native land by the longing for peace after cruel wars by the joy of a country life  virgil had that love of rivers which i think a poet is rarely without and it did not need greece to teach him to sing of the fields     propter aquam tardis ingens ubi flexibus    mincius et tenera praetexit arundine ripas  by the waterside where mighty mincius wanders with links and loops and fringes all the banks with the tender reed  not the muses of greece but his own casmenae songmaidens of italy have inspired him here and his music is blown through a reed of the mincius  in many such places he shows a temper with which we of england in our late age may closely sympathize  do you remember that mediaeval story of the building of parthenope how it was based by the magician virgilius on an egg and how the city shakes when the frail foundation chances to be stirred  this too vast empire of ours is as frail in its foundation and trembles at a word  so it was with the empire of rome in virgils time civic revolution muttering within it like the subterranean thunder and the forces of destruction gathering without  in virgil as in horace you constantly note their anxiety their apprehension for the tottering fabric of the roman state  this it was i think and not the contemplation of human fortunes alone that lent virgil his melancholy  from these fears he looks for a shelter in the sylvan shades he envies the ideal past of the golden world     aureus hanc vitam in terris saturnus agebat  oh for the fields  oh for spercheius and taygetus where wander the lacaenian maids  oh that one would carry me to the cool valleys of haemus and cover me with the wide shadow of the boughs  happy was he who came to know the causes of things who set his foot on fear and on inexorable fate and far below him heard the roaring of the streams of hell  and happy he who knows the rural deities pan and sylvanus the old and the sisterhood of the nymphs  unmoved is he by the peoples favour by the purple of kings unmoved by all the perfidies of civil war by the dacian marching down from his hostile danube by the peril of the roman state and the empire hurrying to its doom  he wasteth not his heart in pity of the poor he envieth not the rich he gathereth what fruits the branches bear and what the kindly wilderness unasked brings forth he knows not our laws nor the madness of the courts nor the records of the common wealdoes not read the newspapers in fact  the sorrows of the poor the luxury of the rich the peril of the empire the shame and dread of each days news we too know them like virgil we too deplore them  we in our reveries long for some such careless paradise but we place it not in sparta but in the islands of the southern seas  it is in passages of this temper that virgil wins us most when he speaks for himself and for his age so distant and so weary and so modern when his own thought unborrowed and unforced is wedded to the music of his own unsurpassable style  but he does not always write for himself and out of his own thought that style of his being far more frequently misapplied wasted on telling a story that is only of feigned and foreign interest  doubtless it was the aeneid his artificial and unfinished epic that won virgil the favour of the middle aces  to the middle ages which knew not greek and knew not homer virgil was the representative of the heroic and eternally interesting past  but to us who know homer virgils epic is indeed like moonlight unto sunlight is a beautiful empty world where no real life stirs a world that shines with a silver lustre not its own but borrowed from the sun of greece  homer sang of what he knew of spears and ships of heroic chiefs and beggar men of hunts and sieges of mountains where the lion roamed and of fairy isles where a goddess walked alone  he lived on the marches of the land of fable when half the mediterranean was a sea unsailed when even italy was as dimly descried as the city of the sun in elizabeths reign  of all that he knew he sang but virgil could only follow and imitate with a pale antiquarian interest the things that were alive for homer  what could virgil care for a tussle between two stout menatarms for the clash of contending warchariots driven each on each like wave against wave in the sea  all that tide had passed over all the story of the aeneid is mere borrowed antiquity like the middle ages of sir walter scott but the borrower had none of scotts joy in the noise and motion of war none of the homeric delight in battle  virgil in writing the aeneid executed an imperial commission and an ungrateful commission it is the sublime of hackwork and the legend may be true which declares that on his deathbed he wished his poem burned he could only be himself here and there as in that earliest picture of romantic love as some have called the story of dido not remembering perhaps that even here virgil had before his mind a greek model that he was thinking of apollonius rhodius and of jason and medea  he could be himself too in passages of reflection and description as in the beautiful sixth book with its picture of the under world and its hints of mystical philosophy  could we choose our own heavens there in that elysian world might virgil be well content to dwell in the shadow of that fragrant laurel grove with them who were priests pure of life while life was theirs and holy singers whose songs were worthy of apollo  there he might muse on his own religion and on the divinity that dwells in that breathes in that is all things and more than all  who could wish virgil to be one of the spirits that     lethaeum ad flumen dues evocat agmine magno  that are called once more to the lethean stream and that once more forgetful of their home into the world and wave of men depart  there will come no other virgil unless his soul in accordance with his own philosophy is among us today crowned with years and honours the singer of ulysses of the lotus eaters of tithonus and oenone  so after all i have been enthusiastic maugre my head as malory says and perhaps lady violet i have shown you why it is right to admire virgil and perhaps i have persuaded nobody but myself  psmr coleridge was no great lover of virgil inconsistently  if you take from virgil his diction and metre what do you leave him  yet mr coleridge had defined poetry as the best words in the best orderthat is diction and metre  he therefore proposed to take from virgil his poetry and then to ask what was left of the poet     aucassin and nicolette   to the lady violet lebas  dear lady violeti do not wonder that you are puzzled by the language of the first french novel  the french of aucassin et nicolette is not french after the school of miss pinkerton at chiswick  indeed as the little songstory has been translated into modern french by m bida the painter whose book is very scarce i presume even the countrywomen of aucassin find it difficult  you will not expect me to write an essay on the grammar nor would you read it if i did  the chief thing is that s appears as the sign of the singular instead of being the sign of the plural and the nouns have cases  the story must be as old as the end of the twelfth century and must have received its present form in picardy  it is written as you see in alternate snatches of verse and prose  the verse which was chanted is not rhymed as a rule but each laisse or screed as in the chanson de roland runs on the same final assonance or vowel sound throughout  so much for the form  who is the author  we do not know and never shall know  apparently he mentions himself in the first lines     who would listen to the lay    of the captive old and gray  for this is as much sense as one can make out of del deport du viel caitif  the author then was an old fellow  i think we might learn as much from the story  an old man he was or a man who felt old  do you know whom he reminds me of  why of mr bowes of the theatre royal chatteris of mr bowes that battered old kindly sentimentalist who told his tale with mr arthur pendennis  it is a love story a story of love overmastering without conscience or care of aught but the beloved  and the viel caitif tells it with sympathy and with a smile  oh folly of fondness he seems to cry oh pretty fever and foolish oh absurd happy days of desolation     when i was young as you are young    and lutes were touched and songs were sung    and lovelamps in the windows hung  it is the very tone of thackeray when thackeray is tender and the world heard it first from this elderly nameless minstrel strolling with his viol and his singing boys a blameless dassoucy from castle to castle in the happy poplar land  i think i see him and hear him in the silver twilight in the court of some chateau of picardy while the ladies around sit listening on silken cushions and their lovers fettered with silver chains lie at their feet  they listen and look and do not think of the minstrel with his gray head and his green heart but we think of him  it is an old mans work and a weary mans work  you can easily tell the places where he has lingered and been pleased as he wrote  the story is simple enough  aucassin son of count garin of beaucaire loved so well fair nicolette the captive girl from an unknown land that he would never be dubbed knight nor follow tourneys nor even fight against his fathers mortal foe count bougars de valence  so nicolette was imprisoned high in a painted chamber  but the enemy were storming the town and for the promise of one word or two with nicolette and one kiss aucassin armed himself and led out his men  but he was all adream about nicolette and his horse bore him into the press of foes ere he knew it  then he heard them contriving his death and woke out of his dream  the damoiseau was tall and strong and the horse whereon he sat fierce and great and aucassin laid hand to sword and fell asmiting to right and left and smote through helm and headpiece and arm and shoulder making a murder about him like a wild boar the hounds fall on in the forest  there slew he ten knights and smote down seven and mightily and knightly he hurled through the press and charged home again sword in hand  for that hour aucassin struck like one of mallorys men in the best of all romances  but though he took count bougars prisoner his father would not keep his word nor let him have one word or two with nicolette and one kiss  nay aucassin was thrown into prison in an old tower  there he sang of nicolette     was it not the other day    that a pilgrim came this way    and a passion him possessed    that upon his bed he lay    lay and tossed and knew no rest    in his pain discomforted    but thou camest by his bed    holding high thine amice fine    and thy kirtle of ermine    then the beauty that is thine    did he look on and it fell    that the pilgrim straight was well    straight was hale and comforted    and he rose up from his bed    and went back to his own place    sound and strong and fair of face  thus aucassin makes a legend of his lady as it were assigning to her beauty such miracles as faith attributes to the excellence of the saints  meanwhile nicolette had slipped from the window of her prison chamber and let herself down into the garden where she heard the song of the nightingales  then caught she up her kirtle in both hands behind and before and flitted over the dew that lay deep on the grass and fled out of the garden and the daisy flowers bending below her tread seemed dark against her feet so white was the maiden  cant you see her stealing with those feet of ivory like bombycas down the dark side of the silent moonlit streets of beaucaire  then she came where aucassin was lamenting in his cell and she whispered to him how she was fleeing for her life  and he answered that without her he must die and then this foolish pair in the very mouth of peril must needs begin a war of words as to which loved the other best  nay fair sweet friend saith aucassin it may not be that thou lovest me more than i love thee  woman may not love man as man loves woman for a womans love lies no deeper than in the glance of her eye and the blossom of her breast and her foots tiptoe but mans love is in his heart planted whence never can it issue forth and pass away  so while they speak     in debate as birds are    hawk on bough  comes the kind sentinel to warn them of a danger  and nicolette flees and leaps into the fosse and thence escapes into a great forest and lonely  in the morning she met shepherds merry over their meat and bade them tell aucassin to hunt in that forest where he should find a deer whereof one glance would cure him of his malady  the shepherds are happy laughing people who half mock nicolette and quite mock aucassin when he comes that way  but at first they took nicolette for a fee such a beauty shone so brightly from her and lit up all the forest aucassin they banter and indeed the free talk of the peasants to their lords son in that feudal age sounds curiously and may well make us reconsider our notions of early feudalism  but aucassin learns at least that nicolette is in the wood and he rides at adventure after her till the thorns have ruined his silken surcoat and the blood dripping from his torn body makes a visible track in the grass  so as he wept he met a monstrous man of the wood that asked him why he lamented  and he said he was sorrowing for a lilywhite hound that he had lost  then the wild man mocked him and told his own tale he was in that estate which achilles among the ghosts preferred to all the kingship of the dead outworn  he was hind and hireling to a villein and he had lost one of the villeins oxen  for that he dared not go into the town where a prison awaited him  moreover they had dragged the very bed from under his old mother to pay the price of the ox and she lay on straw and at that the woodman wept  a curious touch is it not of pity for the people  the old poet is serious for one moment  compare he says the sorrows of sentiment of ladies and lovers praised in song with the sorrows of the poor with troubles that are real and not of the heart  even aucassin the lovelorn feels it and gives the hind money to pay for his ox and so riding on comes to a lodge that nicolette has built with blossoms and boughs  and aucassin crept in and looked through a gap in the fragrant walls of the lodge and saw the stars in heaven and one that was brighter than the rest  does one not feel it the cool of that old summer night the sweet smell of broken boughs and trodden grass and deep dew and the shining of the star     star that i from far behold    that the moon draws to her fold    nicolette with thee doth dwell    my sweet love with locks of gold  sings aucassin  and when nicolette heard aucassin right so came she unto him and passed within the lodge and cast her arms about his neck and kissed and embraced him     fair sweet friend welcome be thou    and thou fair sweet love be thou welcome  there the story should end in a dream of a summers night  but the old minstrel did not end it so or some one has continued his work with a heavier hand  aucassin rides he cares not whither if he has but his love with him  and they come to a fantastic land of burlesque such as pantagruels crew touched at many a time  and nicolette is taken by carthaginian pirates and proves to be daughter to the king of carthage and leaves his court and comes to beaucaire in the disguise of a ministrel and journeys end in lovers meeting  that is all the tale with its gaps its careless passages its adventures that do not interest the poet  he only cares for youth love spring flowers and the song of the birds the rest except the passage about the hind is mere business done casually because the audience expects broad jests hard blows misadventures recognitions  what lives is the touch of poetry of longing of tender heart of humorous resignation  it lives and always must live while the nature of man is the same  the poet hopes his tale will gladden sad men  this service it did for m bida he says in the dreadful year of 187071 when he translated aucassin  this too it has done for me in days not delightful 6     plotinus ad 200262   to the lady violet lebas  dear lady violetyou are discursive and desultory enough as a reader to have pleased even the late lord iddesleigh  it was aucassin and nicolette only a month ago and today you have been reading lord lyttons strange story i am sure for you want information about plotinus  he was born about ad 200 in wolftown lycopolis in egypt the town you know where the natives might not eat wolves poor fellows just as the people of thebes might not eat sheep  probably this prohibition caused plotinus no regret for he was a consistent vegetarian  however we are advancing too rapidly and we must discuss plotinus more in order  his name is very dear to mystic novelists like the author of zanoni  they always describe their favourite hero as deep in plotinus or iamblichus and i venture to think that nearly represents the depth of their own explorations  we do not know exactly when plotinus was born  like many ladies he used to wrap up his age in a mystery observing that these petty details about the body a mere husk of flesh binding the soul were of no importance  he was not weaned till he was eight years old a singular circumstance  having a turn for philosophy he attended the schools of alexandria concerning which kingsleys hypatia is the most accessible authority  all these anecdotes i should have said we learn from porphyry the tyrian who was a kind of boswell to plotinus  the philosopher himself often reminds me of dr johnson especially as dr johnson is described by mr carlyle  just as the good doctor was a sound churchman in the beginning of the age of new ideas so plotinus was a sound pagan in the beginning of the triumph of christianity  like johnson plotinus was lazy and energetic and shortsighted  he wrote a very large number of treatises but he never took the trouble to read through them when once they were written because his eyes were weak  he was superstitious like dr johnson yet he had lucid intervals of common sense when he laughed at the superstitions of his disciples like dr johnson he was always begirt by disciples men and women bozzys and thrales  he was so full of honour and charity that his house was crowded with persons in need of help and friendly care  though he lived so much in the clouds and among philosophical abstractions he was an excellent man of business  though a philosopher he was pious and was courageous dreading the plague no more than the good doctor dreaded the tempest that fell on him when he was voyaging to coll  you will admit that the parallel is pretty close for an historical parallel despite the differences between the ascetic of wolftown and the sage of bolt court hard by fleet street  to return to the education of plotinus  he was twentyeight when he went up to the university of alexandria  for eleven years he diligently attended the lectures of ammonius  then he went on the emperor gordians expedition to the east hoping to learn the philosophy of the hindus  the upanishads would have puzzled plotinus had he reached india but he never did  gordians army was defeated in mesopotamia no blessed word to gordian and plotinus hardly escaped with his life  he must have felt like stendhal on the retreat from moscow  from syria his friend and disciple amelius led him to rome and here as novelists say a curious thing happened  there was in rome an egyptian priest who offered to raise up the demon or guardian angel of plotinus in visible form  but there was only one pure spot in all rome so said the priest and this spot was the temple of isis  here the seance was held and no demon appeared but a regular god of one of the first circles  so terrified was an onlooker that he crushed to death the living birds which he held in his hands for some ritual or magical purpose  it was a curious scene a cosmopolitan confusion of egypt rome isis tableturning the late mr home religion and mummery while christian hymns of the early church were being sung perhaps in the garrets around outside the temple of isis  the discovery that he had a god for his guardian angel gave plotinus plenty of confidence in dealing with rival philosophers  for example alexandrinus olympius another mystic tried magical arts against plotinus  but alexandrinus suddenly doubling up during lecture with unaffected agony cried great virtue hath the soul of plotinus for my spells have returned against myself  as for plotinus he remarked among his disciples now the body of alexandrinus is collapsing like an empty purse  how diverting it would be lady violet if our modern controversialists had those accomplishments and if mr max muller could literally double up professor whitney or if any one could cause peppmuller to collapse with his queer homeric theory  plotinus had many such arts  a piece of jewellery was stolen from one of his protegees a lady and he detected the thief a servant by a glance  after being flogged within an inch of his life the servant perhaps to save the remaining inch confessed all  once when porphyry was at a distance and was meditating suicide plotinus appeared at his side saying this that thou schemest cometh not of the pure intellect but of black humours and so sent porphyry for change of air to sicily  this was thoroughly good advice but during the absence of the disciple the master died  porphyry did not see the great snake that glided into the wall when plotinus expired he only heard of the circumstance  plotinuss last words were i am striving to release that which is divine within us and to merge it in the universally divine  it is a strange mixture of philosophy and savage survival  the zulus still believe that the souls of the dead reappear like the soul of plotinus in the form of serpents  plotinus wrote against the paganizing christians or gnostics  like all great men he was accused of plagiarism  a defence of great men accused of literary theft would be as valuable as naudes work of a like name about magic  on his death the delphic oracle in very secondrate hexameters declared that plotinus had become a demon  such was the life of plotinus a man of sense and virtue and so modest that he would not allow his portrait to be painted  his character drew good men round him his repute for supernatural virtues brought fools into a circle  what he meant by his belief that four times he had whether in the body or out of the body been united with the spirit of the world who knows  what does tennyson mean when he writes     so word by word and line by line       the dead man touchd me from the past       and all at once it seemd at last    his living soul was flashed on mine     and mine in his was wound and whirld       about empyreal heights of thought       and came on that which is and caught    the deep pulsations of the world  mystery  we cannot fathom it we know not the paths of the souls of pascal and gordon of plotinus and st paul  they are wise with a wisdom not of this world or with a foolishness yet more wise  in his practical philosophy plotinus was an optimist or at least he was at war with pessimism  they that love god bear lightly the ways of the worldbear lightly whatsoever befalls them of necessity in the general movement of things he believed in a rest that remains for the people of god where they speak not one with the other but as we understand many things by the eyes only so does soul read soul in heaven where the spiritual body is pure and nothing is hidden and nothing feigned  the arguments by which these opinions are buttressed may be called metaphysical and may be called worthless the conviction and the beauty of the language in which it is stated remain immortal possessions  why such a man as plotinus with such ideas remained a pagan while christianity offered him a sympathetic refuge who can tell  probably natural conservatism in him as in dr johnsonconservatism and tastecaused his adherence to the forms at least of the older creeds there was much to laugh at in plotinus and much to like  but if you read him in hopes of material for strange stories you will be disappointed  perhaps lord lytton and others who have invoked his name in fiction like vivian grey in lord beaconsfields tale knew his name better than his doctrine  his enneads even as edited by his patient boswell porphyry are not very light subjects of study     lucretius   to the rev geoffrey martin oxford  dear martinhow individuals found religious consolation from the creeds of ancient greece and rome is as you quote c o muller a very curious question  it is odd that while we have countless books on the philosophy and the mythology and the ritual of the classic peoples we hear about their religion in the modern sense scarcely anything from anybody  we know very well what gods they worshipped and what sacrifices they offered to the olympians and what stories they told about their deities and about the beginnings of things  we know too in a general way that the gods were interested in morality  they would all punish offences in their own department at least when it was a case of numine laeso when the god who protected the hearth was offended by breach of hospitality or when the gods invoked to witness an oath were offended by perjury  but how did a religiously minded man regard the gods  what hope or what fears did he entertain with regard to the future life  had he any sense of sin as more than a thing that could be expiated by purification with the blood of slaughtered swine or by purchasing the prayers and masses so to speak of the mendicant clergy or charlatans mentioned by plato in the republic  about these great questions of the religious lifethe future and mans fortunes in the future the punishment or reward of justice or iniquitywe really know next to nothing  that is one reason why the great poem of lucretius seems so valuable to me  the de rerum natura was written for no other purpose than to destroy religion as lucretius understood it to free mens minds from all dread as to future punishment all hope of heaven all dread or desire for the interference of the gods in this mortal life of ours on earth  for no other reason did lucretius desire to know the causes of things except that the knowledge would bring emancipation as people call it from the gods to whom men had hitherto stood in the relation of the roman son to the roman sire under the patria potestas or in manu patris  as lucretius wrought all his arduous work to this end it follows that his fellowcountrymen must have gone in a constant terror about spiritual penalties which we seldom associate in thought with the blithe and careless existence of the ancient peoples  in every line of lucretius you read the joy and the indignation of the slave just escaped from an intolerable thraldom to fear  nobody could well have believed on any other evidence that the classical people had a gloomy calvinism of their own time  true as early as homer we hear of the shadowy existence of the souls and of the torments endured by the notably wicked by impious ghosts or tyrannical like sisyphus and tantalus  but when we read the opening books of the republic we find the educated friends of socrates treating these terrors as oldwives fables  they have heard they say that such notions circulate among the people but they seem never for a moment to have themselves believed in a future of rewards and punishments  the remains of ancient funereal art in etruria or attica usually show us the semblances of the dead lying at endless feasts or receiving sacrifices of food and wine as in egypt from their descendants or perhaps welcoming the later dead their friends who have just rejoined them  but it is only in the descriptions by pausanias and others of certain old wallpaintings that we hear of the torments of the wicked of the demons that torture them and above all of the great chief fiend coloured like a carrion fly  to judge from lucretius although so little remains to us of this creed yet it had a very strong hold of the minds of people in the century before christ  perhaps the belief was reinforced by the teaching of socrates who in the vision of er in the republic brings back in a myth the old popular faith in a purgatorio if not in an inferno  in the phaedo for certain we come to the very definite account of a hell a place of eternal punishment as well as of a purgatory whence souls are freed when their sins are expiated  the spirits beyond redemption for the multitude of their murders or sacrileges fate hurls into tartarus whence they never any more come forth  but souls of lighter guilt abide a year in tartarus and then drift out down the streams cocytus and pyriphlegethon  thence they reach the marsh of acheron but are not released until they have received the pardon of the souls whom in life they had injured  all this and much more to the same purpose in other dialogues of platos appears to have been derived by socrates from the popular unphilosophic traditions from folklore in short and to have been raised by him to the rank of pious opinion if not of dogma  now lucretius represents nothing but the reaction against all this dread of future doom whether that dread was inculcated by platonic philosophy or by popular belief  the latter must have been much the more powerful and widely diffused  it follows that the romans at least must have been haunted by a constant dread of judgment to come from which but for the testimony of lucretius and his manifest sincerity we might have believed them free  perhaps we may regret the existence of this roman religion for it did its best to ruin a great poet  the sublimity of the language of lucretius when he can leave his attempts at scientific proof the closeness of his observation his enjoyment of life of nature and his power of painting them a certain largeness of touch and noble amplitude of mannerthese with a burning sincerity mark him above all others that smote the latin lyre  yet these great qualities are halfcrushed by his task by his attempt to turn the atomic theory into verse by his unsympathetic effort to destroy all faith and hope because these were united in his mind with dread of styx and acheron  it is an almost intolerable philosophy the philosophy of eternal sleep without dreams and without awakening  this belief is wholly divorced from joy which inspires all the best art  this negation of hope has closelipped patience for its only friend  in vain does lucretius paint pictures of life and nature so large so glowing so majestic that they remind us of nothing but the fete champetre of giorgione in the louvre  all that life is a thing we must leave soon and forever and must be hopelessly lapped in an eternity of blind silence  i shall let men see the certain end of all he cries then will they resist religion and the threats of priests and prophets  but this certain end is exactly what mortals do not desire to see  to this sleep they prefer even tenebras orci vastasque lacunas  they will not be deprived of gods the friends of man merciful gods compassionate  they will not turn from even a faint hope in those to the lucretian deities in their endless and indifferent repose and divine delight in immortal and peaceful life far far away from us and ourslife painless and fearless needing nothing we can give replete with its own wealth unmoved by prayer and promise untouched by anger  do you remember that hymn as one may call it of lucretius to death to death which does not harm us  for as we knew no hurt of old in ages when the carthaginian thronged against us in war and the world was shaken with the shock of fight and dubious hung the empire over all things mortal by sea and land even so careless so unmoved shall we remain in days when we shall no more exist when the bond of body and soul that makes our life is broken  then naught shall move us nor wake a single sense not though earth with sea be mingled and sea with sky there is no hell he cries or like omar he says hell is the vision of a soul on fire  your true tityus gnawed by the vulture is only the slave of passion and of love your true sisyphus like lord salisbury in punch is only the politician striving always never attaining the stone rolls down again from the hillcrest and thunders far along the plain  thus his philosophy which gives him such a delightful sense of freedom is rejected after all these years of trial by men  they feel that since those remotest days     quum venus in silvis jungebat corpora amantum  they have travelled the long the weary way lucretius describes to little avail if they may not keep their hopes and fears  robbed of these we are robbed of all it serves us nothing to have conquered the soil and fought the winds and waves to have built cities and tamed fire if the world is to be dispeopled of its dreams  better were the old life we started from and dreams therewith better the free days        novitas tum florida mundi    pabula dia tulit miseris mortablibus ampla  than wealth or power and neither hope nor fear but one certain end of all before the eyes of all  thus the heart of man has answered and will answer lucretius the noblest roman poet and the least beloved who sought at last by his own hand they say the doom that virgil waited for in the season appointed     to a young american bookhunter   to philip dodsworth esq new york  dear dodsworthlet me congratulate you on having joined the army of bookhunters  everywhere have i sought peace and found it nowhere says the blessed thomas a kempis save in a corner with a book  whether that good monk wrote the de imitatione christi or not one always likes him for his love of books  perhaps he was the only bookhunter that ever wrought a miracle  other signs and miracles which he was wont to tell as having happened at the prayer of an unnamed person are believed to have been granted to his own such as the sudden reappearance of a lost book in his cell  ah if faith that moveth mountains could only bring back the books we have lost the books that have been borrowed from us but we are a faithless generation  from a collector so much older and better experienced in misfortune than yourself you ask for some advice on the sport of bookhunting  well i will give it but you will not take it  no you will hunt wild like young pointers before they are properly broken  let me suppose that you are to middle fortune born and that you cannot stroll into the great bookmarts and give your orders freely for all that is rich and rare  you are obliged to wait and watch an opportunity to practise that maxim of the stoics endure and abstain  then abstain from rushing at every volume however out of the line of your literary interests which seems to be a bargain  probably it is not even a bargain it can seldom be cheap to you if you do not need it and do not mean to read it  not that any collector reads all his books  i may have and indeed do possess an aldine homer and caliergus his theocritus but i prefer to study the authors in a cheap german edition  the old editions we buy mainly for their beauty and the sentiment of their antiquity and their associations  but i dont take my own advice  the shelves are crowded with books quite out of my linea whole small library of tomes on the pastime of curling and i dont curl and gods revenge against murther though so far i am not an assassin  probably it was for love of sir walter scott and his mention of this truculent treatise that i purchased it  the full title of it is the triumphs of gods revenge against the crying and execrable sinne of willful and premeditated murther  or rather there is nearly a column more of title which i spare you  but the pictures are so bad as to be nearly worth the price  do not waste your money like your foolish adviser on books like that or on les sept visions de don francisco de quevedo published at cologne in 1682  why in the world did i purchase this with the titlepage showing quevedo asleep and all his seven visions floating round him in little circles like soapbubbles  probably because the book was published by clement malassis and perhaps he was a forefather of that whimsical frenchman poulet malassis who published for banville and baudelaire and charles asselineau  it was a bad reason  more likely the mere cheapness attracted me  curiosity not cheapness assuredly betrayed me into another purchase if i want to read the pilgrims progress of course i read it in john bunyans good english  then why must i ruin myself to acquire voyage dun chrestien vers leternite  ecrit en anglois par monsieur bunjan fm en bedtfort et nouvellement traduit en francois  avec figures  a amsterdam chez jean boekholt libraire pres de la bourse 1685  i suppose this is the oldest french version of the famed allegory  do you know an older  bunyan was still living and indeed had just published the second part of the book about christians wife and children and the deplorable young woman whose name was dull  as the little volume the elzevir size is bound in blue morocco by cuzin i hope it is not wholly a foolish bargain but what do i want after all with a french pilgrims progress  these are the errors a man is always making who does not collect books with system with a conscience and an aim  do have a specially  make a collection of works on few subjects well chosen  and what subjects shall they be  that depends on taste probably it is well to avoid the latest fashion  for example the illustrated french books of the eighteenth century are at this moment en hausse  there is a boom in them  fifty years ago brunet the author of the great manuel sneered at them  but in his library companion dr dibdin admitted their merit  the illustrations by gravelot moreau marillier and the rest are certainly delicate graceful full of character stamped with style  but only the proofs before letters are very much valued and for these wild prices are given by competitive millionaires  you cannot compete with them  it is better wholly to turn the back on these books and on any others at the height of the fashion unless you meet them for fourpence on a stall even then should a gentleman take advantage of a poor booksellers ignorance  i dont know  i never fell into the temptation because i never was tempted  bargains real bargains are so rare that you may hunt for a lifetime and never meet one  the best plan for a man who has to see that his collection is worth what it cost him is probably to confine ones self to a single line say in your case first editions of new english french and american books that are likely to rise in value  i would try were i you to collect first editions of longfellow bryant whittier poe and hawthorne  as to poe you probably will never have a chance  outside of the british museum where they have the tamerlane of 1827 i have only seen one early example of poes poems  it is al aaraaf tamerlane and minor poems by edgar a poe  baltimore hatch and dunning 1829 8vo pp 71  the book came to mr locker mr frederick lockerlampson through mr r h stoddard the american poet  so says mr lockerlampsons catalogue  he also has the new york edition of 1831  these books are extraordinarily rare you are more likely to find them in some collection of twopenny rubbish than to buy them in the regular market  bryants poems cambridge 1821 must also be very rare and emersons of 1847 and dr oliver wendell holmess of 1836 and longfellows voices of the night 1839 and mr lowells a years life none of these can be common and all are desirable as are mr whittiers legends of new england 1831 and poems 1838  perhaps you may never be lucky enough to come across them cheap no doubt they are greatly sought for by amateurs  indeed all american books of a certain age or of a special interest are exorbitantly dear  men like mr james lenox used to keep the market up  one cannot get the jesuit relationsshabby little missionary reports from canada in dirty vellum  cartier perrot champlain and the other early explorers books are beyond the means of a working student who needs them  may you come across them in a garret of a farmhouse or in some dusty lane of the city  why are they not reprinted as mr arber has reprinted captain john smiths voyages and reports on virginia  the very reprints when they have been made are rare and hard to come by  there are certain modern books new books that go up rapidly in value and interest  mr swinburnes atalanta of 1865 the quarto in white cloth is valued at twenty dollars  twenty years ago one dollar would have purchased it  mr austin dobsons proverbs in porcelain is also in demand among the curious  nay even i may say about the first edition of ballades in blue china 1880 as gibbon said of his essay on the study of literature the primitive value of half a crown has risen to the fanciful price of a guinea or thirty shillings or even more  i wish i had a copy myself for old sakes sake  certain modern books on large paper are safe investments  the badminton library an english series of books on sport is at a huge premium already when on large paper  but one should never buy the book unless as in the case of dr john hill burtons bookhunter first edition it is not only on large paper and not only rare twenty five copies but also readable and interesting 7  a collector should have the taste to see when a new book is in itself valuable and charming and when its author is likely to succeed so that his early attempts as in the case of mr matthew arnold lord tennyson and a few others of the moderns are certain to become things of curious interest  you can hardly ever get a novel of jane austens in the first edition she is rarer than fielding or smollett  some day it may be the same in miss broughtons case  cling to the fair and witty jane if you get a chance  beware of illustrated modern books in which processes are employed  amateurs will never really value mechanical reproductions which can be copied to any extent  the old french copperplate engravings and the best english mezzotints are so valuable because good impressions are necessarily so rare  one more piece of advice  never or hardly ever buy an imperfect book  it is a constant source of regret an eyesore  here have i lovelaces lucasta 1649 without the engraving  it is deplorable but i never had a chance of another lucasta  this is not a case of invenies aliam  however you fare you will have the pleasure of hope and the consolation of books quietem inveniendam in abditis recessibus et libellulis     rochefoucauld   to the lady violet lebas  dear lady violeti am not sure that i agree with you in your admiration of rochefoucauldof the reflexions ou sentences et maximes morales i mean  at least i hardly agree when i have read many of them at a stretch  it is not fair to read them in that way of course for there are more than five hundred pensees and so much esprit becomes fatiguing  i doubt if people study them much  five or six of them have become known even to writers in the newspapers and we all copy them from each other  rochefoucauld says that a man may be too dull to be duped by a very clever person  he himself was so clever that he was often duped first by the general honest dulness of mankind and then by his own acuteness he thought he saw more than he did see and he said even more than he thought he saw  if the true motive of all our actions is selflove or vanity no man is a better proof of the truth than the great maximmaker his selflove took the shape of a brilliancy that is sometimes false  he is tricked out in paste for diamonds now and then like a vain provincial beauty at a ball  a clever man would frequently be much at a loss he says in stupid company  one has seen this embarrassment of a wit in a company of dullards  it is rochefoucaulds own position in this world of men and women  we are all in the mass dullards compared with his cleverness and so he fails to understand us is much at a loss among us  people only praise others in hopes of being praised in turn he says  mankind is not such a company of logrollers as he avers  there is more truth in a line of tennysons about        the praise of those we love    dearer to true young hearts than their own praise  i venture to think we need not be young to prefer to hear the praise of others rather than our own  it is not embarrassing in the first place as all praise of ourselves must be  i doubt if any man or woman can flatter so discreetly as not to make us uncomfortable  besides if our own performances be lauded we are uneasy as to whether the honour is deserved  an artist has usually his own doubts about his own doings or rather he has his own certainties  about our friends work we need have no such misgivings  and our selflove is more delicately caressed by the success of our friends than by our own  it is still selflove but it is filtered so to speak through our affection for another  what are human motives according to rochefoucauld  temperament vanity fear indolence selflove and a grain of natural perversity which somehow delights in evil for itself  he neglects that other element a grain of natural worth which somehow delights in good for itself  this taste i think is quite as innate and as active in us as that other taste for evil which causes there to be something not wholly displeasing in the misfortunes of our friends  there is a story which always appears to me a touching proof of this grain of goodness as involuntary as fatal as its opposite  i do not remember in what book of travels i found this trait of native excellence the black fellows of australia are very fond of sugar and no wonder if it be true that it has on them an intoxicating effect  well a certain black fellow had a small parcel of brown sugar which was pilfered from his lair in the camp  he detected the thief who was condemned to be punished according to tribal law that is to say the injured man was allowed to have a whack at his enemys head with a waddy a short club of heavy hard wood  the whack was duly given and then the black who had suffered the loss threw down his club burst into tears embraced the thief and displayed every sign of a lively regret for his revenge  that seems to me an example of the human touch that rochefoucauld never allows for the natural goodness pity kindness which can assert itself in contempt of the love of self and the love of revenge  this is that true clemency which is a real virtue and not the child of vanity fear indolence or of all three together  nor is it so true that we have all fortitude enough to endure the misfortunes of others  everybody has witnessed anothers grief that came as near him as his own  how much more true and how greatly poetical is that famous maxim death and the sun are two things not to be looked on with a steady eye  this version is from the earliest english translation of 1698  the maximes were first published in paris in 1665 8  our tardy apish nation took thirtythree years in finding them out and appropriating them  this too is good if we were faultless we would observe with less pleasure the faults of others  indeed to observe these with pleasure is not the least of our faults  again we are never so happy nor so wretched as we suppose  it is our vanity perhaps that makes us think ourselves miserrimi  do you rememberno you dontthat meeting in candide of the unfortunate cunegonde and the still more unfortunate old lady who was the daughter of a pope  you lament your fate said the old lady alas you have known no such sorrows as mine  what my good woman says cunegonde  unless you have been maltreated by two bulgarians received two stabs from a knife had two of your castles burned over your head seen two fathers and two mothers murdered before your eyes and two of your lovers flogged at two autosdafe i dont fancy that you can have the advantage of me  besides i was born a baroness of seventytwo quarterings and i have been a cook  but the daughter of a pope had indeed been still more unlucky as she proved than cunegonde and the old lady was not a little proud of it  but can you call this true there is nobody but is ashamed of having loved when once he loves no longer  if it be true at all i dont think the love was much worth having or giving  if one really loves once one can never be ashamed of it for we never cease to love  however this is the very high water of sentiment you will say but i blush no more for it than m le duc de rochefoucauld for his own opinion  perhaps i am thinking of that kind of love about which he says true love is like ghosts which everybody talks about and few have seen  many be the thyrsusbearers few the mystics as the greek proverb runs  many are called few are chosen  as to friendship being a reciprocity of interests the saying is but one of those which rochefoucaulds vanity imposed on his wit  very witty it is not and it is emphatically untrue  old men console themselves by giving good advice for being no longer able to set bad examples capital but the poor old men are often good examples of the results of not taking their own good advice  many an ingrate is less to blame than his benefactor  one might add at least i will every man who looks for gratitude deserves to get none of it  to say that one never flirtsis flirting  i rather like the old translators version of il y a de bons mariages mais il ny en a point de delicieuxmarriage is sometimes convenient but never delightful  how true is this of authors with a brief popularity il y a des gens qui ressemblent aux vaudevilles quon ne chante quun certain temps again to be in haste to repay a kindness is a sort of ingratitude and a rather insulting sort too  almost everybody likes to repay small favours many people can be grateful for favours not too weighty but for favours truly great there is scarce anything but ingratitude  they must have been small favours that wordsworth had conferred when the gratitude of men had oftener left him mourning  indeed the very pettiness of the aid we can generally render each other makes gratitude the touching thing it is  so much is repaid for so little and few can ever have the chance of incurring the thanklessness that rochefoucauld found all but universal  lovers and ladies never bore each other because they never speak of anything but themselves  do husbands and wives often bore each other for the same reason  who said to know all is to forgive all  it is rather like on pardonne tant que lon aimeas long as we love we can forgive a comfortable saying and these are rare in rochefoucauld women do not quite know what flirts they are is also let us hope not incorrect  the maxim that there is a love so excessive that it kills jealousy is only a corollary from as long as we love we forgive  you remember the classical example manon lescaut and the chevalier des grieux not an honourable precedent  the accent of our own country dwells in our hearts as well as on our tongues  ah never may i lose the border accent  loves miracle  to cure a coquette  most honest women are tired of their task says this unbeliever  and the others  are they never aweary  the duke is his own best critic after all when he says the greatest fault of a penetrating wit is going beyond the mark  beyond the mark he frequently goes but not when he says that we come as fresh hands to each new epoch of life and often want experience for all our years  how hard it was to begin to be middleaged  shall we find old age easier if ever we come to its threshold  perhaps and death perhaps the easiest of all  nor let me forget it will be long before you have occasion to remember that vivacity which grows with age is not far from folly     of vers de societe   to mr gifted hopkins  my dear hopkinsthe verses which you have sent me with a request to get published in some magazine i now return to you  if you are anxious that they should be published send them to an editor yourself  if he likes them he will accept them from you  if he does not like them why should he like them because they are forwarded by me  his only motive would be an aversion to disobliging a confrere and why should i put him in such an unpleasant position  but this is a very boorish way of thanking you for the premiere representation of your little poem  to delia in girton you call it recommending her to avoid the muses and seek the society of the graces and loves  an oldfashioned preamble and of the lengthiest and how do you go on     golden hair is fairy gold       fairy gold that cannot stay    turns to leaflets green and cold       at the ending of the day       laurelleaves the muses may    twine about your golden head       will the crown reward you say    when the fairy gold is fled     daphne was a maid unwise       shun the laurel seek the rose    azure lovely in the skies       shines less gracious in the hose  dont you think dear hopkins that this allusion to basbleus if not indelicate is a little rococo and out of date  editors will think so i fear  besides i dont like fairy gold that cannot stay  if fairy gold were a horse it would be all very well to write that it cannot stay  tis the style of the stable unsuited to songs of the salon  this is a very difficult kind of verse that you are essaying you whom the laurels of mr locker do not suffer to sleep for envy  you kindly ask my opinion on vers de societe in general  well i think them a very difficult sort of thing to write well as one may infer from this that the ancients our masters could hardly write them at all  in greek poetry of the great ages i only remember one piece which can be called a modelthe aeolic verses that theocritus wrote to accompany the gift of the ivory distaff  it was a present you remember to the wife of his friend nicias the physician of miletus  the greeks of that age kept their women in almost oriental reserve  one may doubt whether nicias would have liked it if theocritus had sent instead of a distaff a fan or a jewel  but there is safety in a spinning instrument and all the compliments to the lady the daintyankled theugenis turn on her skill and industry and housewifery  so louis xiv no mean authority called this piece of vers de societe a model of honourable gallantry  i have just looked all through pomtows pretty little pocket volumes of the minor greek poets and found nothing more of the nature of the lighter verse than this of alcmansgreek text  do you remember the pretty paraphrase of it in love in idleness     maidens with voices like honey for sweetness that breathe desire    would that i were a sea bird with wings that could never tire    over the foamflowers flying with halcyons ever on wing    keeping a careless heart a seablue bird of the spring  it does not quite give the sense alcman intended the lament for his limbs weary with old agewith old age sadder for the sight of the honey voiced girls  the greeks had not the kind of society that is the home of society verses where as mr locker says a boudoir decorum is or ought always to be preserved where sentiment never surges into passion and where humour never overflows into boisterous merriment  honest women were estranged from their mirth and their melancholy  the romans were little more fortunate  you cannot expect the genius of catullus not to surge into passion even in his hours of gayer song composed when     multum lusimus in meis tabellis    ut convenerat esse delicatos    scribens versiculos uterque nostrum  thus the lighter pieces of catullus like the dedication of his book are addressed to men his friends and thus they scarcely come into the category of what we call society verses  given the character of roman society perhaps we might say that plenty of this kind of verse was written by horace and by martial  the famous ode to pyrrha does not exceed the decorum of a roman boudoir and as far as love was concerned it does not seem to have been in the nature of horace to surge into passion  so his best songs in this kind are addressed to men with whom he drinks a little and talks of politics and literature a great deal and muses over the shortness of life and the zest that snow clad soracte gives to the wintry fire  perhaps the ode to leuconoe which mr austin dobson has rendered so prettily in a villanelle may come within the scope of this muse for it has a playfulness mingled with its melancholy a sadness in its play perhaps too if horace is to be done into verse these old french forms seem as fit vehicles as any for latin poetry that was written in the exotic measures of greece  there is a foreign grace and a little technical difficulty overcome in the english ballade and villanelle as in the horatian sapphics and alcaics  i would not say so much on my own responsibility nor trespass so far on the domain of scholarship but this opinion was communicated to me by a learned professor of latin  i think too that some of the lyric measures of the old french pleiad of ronsard and du bellay would be well wedded with the verse of horace  but perhaps no translator will ever please any one but himself and of horace every man must be his own translator  it may be that ovid now and then comes near to writing vers de societe only he never troubles himself for a moment about the decorum of the boudoir  do you remember the lines on the ring which he gave his lady  they are the origin and pattern of all the verses written by lovers on that pretty metempsychosis which shall make them slippers or fans or girdles like wallers and like that which bound the dainty dainty waist of the millers daughter     ring that shalt bind the finger fair    of my sweet maid thou art not rare    thou hast not any price above    the token of her poets love    her finger mayst thou mate as she    is mated every wise with me  and the poet goes on as poets will to wish he were this favoured this fortunate jewel     in vain i wish  so ring depart    and say with me thou hast his heart  once more ovids verses on his catholic affection for all ladies the brown and the blonde the short and the tall may have suggested cowleys humorous confession the chronicle     margarita first possessed    if i remember well my breast          margarita first of all  and then follows a list as long as leporellos  what disqualifies ovid as a writer of vers de societe is not so much his lack of decorum as the monotonous singsong of his eternal elegiacs the lightest of light things the poet of society should possess more varied strains like horace martial thackeray not like ovid and here is a heresy praed  inimitably well as praed does his trick of antithesis i still feel that it is a trick and that most rhymers could follow him in a mere mechanic art  but here the judgment of mr locker would be opposed to this modest opinion and there would be opposition again where mr locker calls dr o w holmes perhaps the best living writer of this species of verse  but here we are straying among the moderns before exhausting the ancients of whom i fancy that martial at his best approaches most near the ideal  of course it is true that many of martials lyrics would be thought disgusting in any wellregulated convict establishment  his gallantry is rarely honourable  scaliger used to burn a copy of martial once a year on the altar of catullus who himself was far from prudish  but martial somehow kept his heart undepraved and his taste in books was excellent  how often he writes verses for the bibliophile delighting in the details of purple and gold the illustrations and ornaments for his new volume  these pieces are for the fewfor amateurs but we may all be touched by his grief for the little lass erotion  he commends her in hades to his own father and mother gone before him that the child may not be frightened in the dark friendless among the shades     parvula ne nigras horrescat erotion umbras    oraque tartarei prodigiosa canis  there is a kind of playfulness in the sorrow and the pity of a man for a child pity that shows itself in a smile  i try to render that other inscription for the tomb of little erotion     here lies the body of the little maid          erotion    from her sixth winters snows her eager shade          hath fleeted on    whoeer thou be that after me shalt sway          my scanty farm    to her slight shade the yearly offering pay          sosafe from harm    shall thou and thine revere the kindly lar          and this alone    be through thy brief dominion near or far          a mournful stone  certainly he had a heart this foulmouthed martial who claimed for the study of his book no serious hours but moments of mirth when men are glad with wine in the reign of the rose 9     haec hora est tua cum furit lyaeus    cum regnat rosa cum madent capilli    tunc mevel rigidi legant catones  but enough of the poets of old another day we may turn to carew and suckling praed and locker poets of our own speech lighter lyrists of our own time 10     on vers de societe   to mr gifted hopkins  dear giftedif you will permit me to use your christian and prophetic namewe improved the occasion lately with the writers of light verse in ancient times  we decided that the ancients were not great in verses of society because they had properly speaking no society to write verses for  women did not live in the christian freedom and social equality with men either in greece or romeat least not modest women as mr harry foker calls them in pendennis  about the others there is plenty of pretty verse in the anthology  what you need for verses of society is a period in which the social equality is recognized and in which people are peaceable enough and comfortable enough to play with light loves in the portal of the temple of hymen without any very definite intentions on either part of going inside and getting married  perhaps we should not expect vers de societe from the crusaders who were not peaceable and who were very earnest indeed in love or war  but as soon as you get a court and court life in france even though the times were warlike then ladies are lauded in artful strains and the lyre is struck leviore plectro  charles dorleans that captive and captivating prince wrote thousands of rondeaux even before his time a gallant company of gentlemen composed the livre des cent ballades one hundred ballades practically unreadable by modern men  then came clement marot with his gay and rather empty fluency and ronsard with his mythological compliments his sonnets decked with roses and led like lambs to the altar of helen or cassandra  a few here and there of his pieces are lighter more pleasant and in a quiet way immortal such as the verses to his fair flower of anjou a beauty of fifteen  so they ran on in france till voitures time and sarrazins with his merry ballade of an elopement and corneilles proud and graceful stanzas to marquise de gorla  but verses in the english tongue are more worthy of our attention  mr locker begins his collection of them lyra elegantiarum no longer a very rare book in england as far back as skeltons age and as thomas wyats and sidneys but those things the lighter lyrics of that day are rather songs than poems and probably were all meant to be sung to the virginals by our musical ancestors  drink to me only with thine eyes says the great ben jonson or sings it rather  the words that he versified out of the greek prose of philostratus cannot be thought of without the tune  it is the same with carews he that loves a rosy cheek or with roses their sharp spines being gone  the lighter poetry of carews day is all powdered with gold dust like the court ladies hair and is crowned and diapered with roses and heavy with fabulous scents from the arabian phoenixs nest little cupids flutter and twitter here and there among the boughs as in that feast of adonis which ptolemys sister gave in alexandria or as in eisens vignettes for dorats baisers     ask me no more whither do stray    the golden atoms of the day    for in pure love did heaven prepare    these powders to enrich your hair  it would be affectation gifted if you rhymed in that fashion for the lady of your love and presented her as it were with cosmical cosmetics and compliments drawn from the starry spaces and deserts from skies phoenixes and angels  but it was a natural and pretty way of writing when thomas carew was young  i prefer herrick the inexhaustible in dainties herrick that parsonpagan with the soul of a greek of the anthology and a cure of souls heaven help them in devonshire  his julia is the least mortal of these daughters of dreams and of stories whom poets celebrate she has a certain opulence of flesh and blood a cheek like a damask rose and rich eyes like keatss lady no vaporous beatrice she but a handsome english wench with     a cuff neglectful and thereby    ribbons to flow confusedly    a winning wave deserving note    in the tempestuous petticoat  then suckling strikes up a reckless military air a warrior he is who has seen many a siege of heartshearts that capitulated or held out like troytown and the impatient assailant whistles     quit quit for shame this will not move          this cannot take her    if of herself she will not love          nothing can make her          the devil take her  so he rides away curling his moustache hiding his defeat in a big inimitable swagger  it is a pleasanter piece in which suckling after a long leaguer of a ladys heart finds that captain honour is governor of the place and surrender hopeless  so he departs with a salute     march march quoth i the word straight give       lets lose no time but leave her    that giant upon air will live       and hold it out for ever  lovelace is even a better type in his rare good things of the military amorist and poet  what apology of lauzuns or bussy rabutins for faithlessness could equal this     why dost thou say i am forsworn       since thine i vowed to be    lady it is already morn       it was last night i swore to thee       that fond impossibility  has in memoriam nobler numbers than the poem from exile to lucasta     our faith and troth    all time and space controls    above the highest sphere we meet    unseen unknown and greet as angels greet  how comes it that in the fierce fighting days the soldiers were so tuneful and such scholars  in the first edition of lovelaces lucasta there is a flock of recommendatory verses english latin even greek by the gallant colonels messmates and comrades  what guardsman now writes like lovelace and how many of his friends could applaud him in greek you my gifted are happily of a pacific disposition and tune a gentle lyre  is it not lucky for swains like you that the soldiers have quite forsworn sonneting  when a man was a rake a poet a warrior all in one what chance had a peaceful minor poet like you or me gifted against his charms  sedley when sober must have been an invincible rivalinvincible above all when he pretended constancy     why then should i seek further store       and still make love anew    when change itself can give no more       tis easy to be true  how infinitely more delightful musical and captivating are those cavalier singerstheir numbers flowing fair like their scented lovelocksthan the prudish society poets of popes day  the rape of the lock is very witty but through it all dont you mark the sneer of the contemptuous unmanly little wit the crooked dandy  he jibes among his compliments and i do not wonder that mistress arabella fermor was not conciliated by his longdrawn cleverness and polished lines  i prefer sackvilles verses written at sea the night before an engagement     to all you ladies now on land       we men at sea indite  they are all alike the wits of queen anne and even matt prior when he writes of ladies occasionally writes down to them or at least glances up very saucily from his position on his knees  but prior is the best of them and the most candid     i court others in versebut i love thee in prose    and they have my whimsies but thou hast my heart  yes prior is probably the greatest of all who dally with the light lyre which thrills to the wings of fleeting lovesthe greatest english writer of vers de societe the most gay frank goodhumoured tuneful and engaging  landor is great too but in another kind the bees that hummed over platos cradle have left their honey on his lips none but landor or a greek could have written this on catullus     tell me not what too well i know    about the bard of sirmio       yes in thalias son    such stains there are as when a grace    sprinkles anothers laughing face       with nectar and runs on  that is poetry deserving of a place among the rarest things in the anthology  it is a sorrow to me that i cannot quite place praed with prior in my affections  with all his gaiety and wit he wearies one at last with that clever punning antithesis  i dont want to know how     captain hazard wins a bet       or beaulieu spoils a curry  and i prefer his sombre red fisherman the idea of which is borrowed wittingly or unwittingly from lucian  thackeray too careless in his measures yet comes nearer prior in breadth of humour and in unaffected tenderness  who can equal that song once you come to forty year or the lines on the venice lovelamp or the canebottomed chair  of living english writers of verse in the familiar style as cowper has it i prefer mr locker when he is tender and not untouched with melancholy as in the portrait of a lady and mr austin dobson when he is not flirting but in earnest as in the song of four seasons and the dead letter  he has ingenuity pathos mastery of his art and though the least pedantic of poets is conveniently learned  of contemporary americans if i may be frank i prefer the verse of mr bret harte verse with so many tunes and turns as comic as the heathen chinee as tender as the lay of the ship with its crew of children that slipped its moorings in the fog  to me it seems that mr bret hartes poems have never at least in this country been sufficiently esteemed mr lowell has written the biglow papers apart but little in this vein  mr wendell holmes your delightful godfather gifted has written much with perhaps some loss from the very quantity  a little of vers de societe my dear gifted goes a long way as you will think if ever you sit down steadily to read right through any collection of poems in this manner  so do not add too rapidly to your own store let them be few but roses all of them     richardson   by mrs andrew lang  dear miss somervillei was much interested in your fruitless struggle to read sir charles grandisonthe book whose separate numbers were awaited with such impatience by richardsons endless lady friends and correspondents and even by the rakish worldeven by colley cibber himself  i sympathize entirely with your estimate of its dulness yet dull as it is it is worth wading through to understand the kind of literature which could flutter the dovecotes of the last century in a generation earlier than the one that was moved to tears by the wearisome dramas of hannah more  there is only one character in the whole of sir charles grandison where richardson is in the least like himselfin the least like the richardson of pamela and clarissa  this character is miss charlotte grandison the sister of sir charles and later after many vicissitudes the wife of lord g  miss grandisons conduct falls infinitely beneath the high standard attained to by the rest of sir charless chosen friends  she is petulant and loves to tease is uncertain of what she wants she is lively and sarcastic and worse than all abandons the rounded periods of her brother and miss byron for free not to say slang expressions hang ceremony she often exclaims with much reason while what a deuce is her favourite expletive  the conscientious reader heaves a sigh of relief when this young lady and her many indiscretions appear on the scene when miss grandison like nature takes the pen from richardson and writes for him  but i gather that you my dear miss somerville never got far enough to make her acquaintance and therefore are still ignorant of the singular qualities of her brother sir charlesrichardsons idea of a perfect man for both brother and sister are introduced at almost the same moment  now it is nearly as difficult to realize that sir charles is a young man of twentysix as it is to feel that his antithesis the adorable pepys of the diary was of that precise age  sir charles might be borne with goodnaturedly for a short time as an old gentleman who had become garrulous from want of contradiction but in any other aspect he would be shunned conscientiously  yet richardson is not content with putting into his mouth lengthy discourses tending chiefly though expressed with mock humility to his own glorification but he keeps all the other characters perpetually dancing round the baronet in a chorus of praise  was there ever such a man my harriet so good so just so noble in his sentiments  ah my lucy dare i hope for the affection of the best of men  some people would have begged their friends to cease making them ridiculous but not so sir charles  but my dear trying as sir charles is at all moments he is infinitely at his worst when he attempts to be jocose when he rallies the stepmother of his friend beauchamp in a sprightly manner or exchanges quips with harriets cousins at the house of that excellent ancient her grandmother  it is a mammoth posing as a kitten though whatever he says or does his audience throw up their hands and eyes and ask was there ever such a man  thank heaven never the nineteenth century replies unanimously  secure as he is of the contemporary public verdict sir charles does not attempt to repress his love of pawing all his female acquaintances  he is eternally taking their hands putting his arm round their waists leading them up and down and permitting himself liberties that in a less perfect character would be considered intolerable  it is also interesting to note that he never addresses any of his female friends without the prefix my  my harriet my emily my charlotte are his usual forms and he is likewise very much addicted to the use of the third person which may however have been the result of his long residence in italy  little as you read of the book no doubt you were struckyou must have beenby the singular practice in this very matter of christian names and also by the enormous satisfaction with which every one promptly adopts every one else as his brother or sister  as regards names no sooner has sir charles rescued harriet from the clutches of sir hargrave pollexfen than he calls her his harriet though when he is once engaged to her then this is changed into infinitely obliging miss byron  his eldest sister one year his senior is always lady l to him and on her marriage his charlotte aged twentyfour becomes lady g but no one ever ventures to address him with anything more familiar than sir charles  harriet indeed once gets as far as my cha but this was in a moment of extreme emotionone of the excesses of youth  of course the method of telling his story in letters necessitates the acceptance of various improbabilities reticence has sometimes to be violated and confidences to be unduly made  still with all these allowances the gossip of every one with regard to the likelihood of sir charles returning harriets very thinly veiled attachment is highly undignified and often indecent  the object himself for whom no less than seven ladies were at that time openly sighing alone ignores harriets love or at any rate appears to do so  but his sisters freely and frequently charge her with having fallen in love with him  she writes pages to her whole family as to his behaviour on particular occasions while his ward emily jervois begs permission to take up her abode with harriet when she and sir charles are married  miss jervois who is richardsons idea of a jeune personne bien elevee is a compound of tears of servility and of undisguised love for her guardian  she is much more like the heroine of a french drama than an english girl of fourteen and i dread to think what effect she would have on a freeborn american  harriet as you know is not quite hopeless at first but the descent is easy and in the end we quite agree with all the admiring circle that they were made for each other  they were equally pompous and used stilts of equal height  sir charles grandison was the last the most socially ambitious and much the worst of richardsons novels  smollett came to his best in his last humphrey clinker  fielding sobered down into the kind excellence of his last amelia  neither had been flattered and coddled by literary ladies like richardson  what of pamela and clarissa  may a maiden read the book that the young lady studied over charles lambs shoulder  well i think as you have now passed your quarter of a century it would do you no harm to read the other two which are infinitely better than sir charles  the worthy miss byron aged only twenty indeed writes to her lucy to remind her that their grandmother had told them twenty and twenty frightful stories of the vile enterprises of men against innocent creatures and that they can both call to mind stories which had ended much worse than hers the affair with sir hargrave pollexfen had done  grandmothers now choose other topics of conversation for their descendants but in those old days when sedanchairs made enlevements so very easy it was considered necessary to caution girls against all the possible wiles of man  even little boys strange as it may sound were given pamela to read after the bible  more than this one small creature harry campbell by name so young that he always spoke of himself as little harry obtained the book by stealth in his guardians house and never stopped till he finished it  when richardson on being told of this sent him a copy for his own he nearly went out of his senses with delight  of course you know the outline of pamelas story  how at eleven she was taken and educated by a lady who on her death when pamela was sixteen left her not only more beautiful but more accomplished than any girl of her years  how pamelas young master fell in love with her persecuted her and after moving adventures of all kinds being convinced that she was not to be overcome married her and they lived happy with one brief exception ever after  the proper frame of mind in which to read pamela is to consider it in the light of an historical joke  the absolute want of dignity that is almost as marked a characteristic in richardson as his lack of humour shows itself again and again  after all mr b would never have married pamela if he could have persuaded her to live with him in any other way so the cringing gratitude expressed by pamela and her parents to the good gentleman and the dear obliger is only revolting  no woman with any delicacy of feeling could have sat complacently at her own table while her husband entertained his company with prolonged and minute accounts of his attempts on her virtue can you fancy fielding composing such a scene fielding whom richardson scouts as a profligate  it is impossible not to laugh at the bare idea and no less funny are pamelas poetical flights especially when like hamilton of bangour in exile she paraphrases the paraphrase of the 137th psalm about her captivity in lincolnshire  all through one has to remind ones self perpetually that pamela must not be expected to behave like a lady and that if her father had done as he ought and removed her from her place when she first told him of her uneasiness there would have been no story at all and some other book would have had to rank in the opinion of richardsons adorers next to the bible  still whatever may have to be said as to richardsons subjects he is never coarse in his treatment of them  the pursuit of pamela by mr b or of clarissa by lovelace through eight volumes may weary it does not corrupt  no man or maid on earth could lay it to his charge that he or she had been corrupted by these books while no man on earth could read clarissa without being touched by the noble ending  if clarissa had never been written we should have said that the goodnatured fussy essentially middleclass bookseller samuel richardson was unable to draw a lady and it is curious to see how clarissa stands out not only among richardsons female characters but among the female characters of all time eminent she is for purity of soul and nobility of feeling there is no cant about her anywhere no effort to pose or to strain after a state of mind which she cannot naturally experience  the businesslike manner in which she makes her preparations for death have nothing sentimental about them nothing that even faintly suggests the pretty deathbeds with which mr dickens and others have made us familiar but i doubt if the most practical moneymaker in wall street could read it without feeling uncomfortable  how after describing such a character as clarissa richardson could turn to the whalebone figures in sir charles grandison is quite incomprehensible  had he been ruined by his numerous female admirers and correspondents or by his desire to become fashionable or as is most likely by the wish to create in sir charles a virtuous foil to him whom he thought the wicked witty delightful and detestable lovelace whatever the reason it is a thousand pities that he gave way to his impulse  it would interest you as well as me to note little points of manners that are to be gathered from the three books  i have not time to write much more but will tell you two or three that have struck me  if you read them as i still hope you may you will see what early risers they all are even the wicked mr b while clarissa when in dover street usually gives lovelace his interviews at six in the morning  one hears of twooclockinthemorning courage  how much more wonderful is love that rises at six  richardson was a womans novelist as fielding was a mans  i sometimes think of dr johnsons mot claret for boys port for men and smiling brandy for heroes  so one might fancy him saying richardson for women fielding for men smollett for ruffians though some of his rough customers were heroes too  but we now confine ourselves so closely to the later writers of russia france england america that the woman who reads richardson may be called heroic  to the unknown heroine i dedicate my respect as the athenians dedicated an altar to the unknown hero  will you be the heroine  i am afraid you wont     gerard de nerval   to miss girton cambridge  dear miss girtonyes i fancy gerard de nerval is one of that rather select party of french writers whom mrs girton will allow you to read but even if you read him i do not think you will care very much for him he is a mans author not a womans and yet one can hardly say why  it is not that he offends the delicacy of your sex as tom jones calls it i think it is that his sentiment whereof he is full is not of the kind you like  let it be admitted that when his characters make love they might do it in a more human sort of way  in this respect and in some others gerard de nerval resembles edgar poe  not that his heroes are always attached to a belle morte in some distant aiden not that they have been for long in the family sepulchre not that their attire is a vastly becoming shroudno aurelie and sylvie in les filles de feu are nice and natural girls but their lover is not in love with them in a human sort of way  he is in love with some vaporous ideal of which they faintly remind him  he is as it were the eternal passerby he is a wanderer from his birth he sees the old chateau or the farmers cottage or even the bright theatre or the desert tent he sees the daughters of men that they are fair and dear in moonlight in sunlight in the glare of the footlights and he looks and longs and sighs and wanders on his fatal path  nothing can make him pause and at last his urgent spirit leads him over the limit of this earth and far from the human shores his delirious fancy haunts graveyards or the fabled harbours of happy stars and he who rested never rests in the grave forgetting his dreams or finding them true  all this is too vague for you i do not doubt but for me the man and his work have an attraction i cannot very well explain like the personal influence of one who is your friend though other people cannot see what you see in him  gerard de nerval that was only his penname was a young man of the young romantic school of 1830 one of the set of hugo and gautier  their gallant schoolboyish absurdities are too familiar to be dwelt upon they were much of scotts mind when he was young and translated burger and wished to heaven he had a skull and crossbones  two or three of them died early two or three subsided into ordinary literary gentlemen like m maquet lately deceased two nay three became poetsvictor hugo theophile gautier and gerard de nerval  it is not necessary to have heard of gerard even that queer sham the lady of culture admits without a blush that she knows not gerard  yet he is worth knowing  what he will live by is his story of sylvie it is one of the little masterpieces of the world  it has a greek perfection  one reads it and however old one is youth comes back and april and a thousand pleasant sounds of birds in hedges of wind in the boughs of brooks trotting merrily under the rustic bridges  and this fresh nature is peopled by girls eternally young natural gay or pensive standing with eager feet on the threshold of their life innocent expectant with the old ballads of old france on their lips  for the story is full of those artless lisping numbers of the popular french muse the ancient ballads that gerard collected and put in the mouth of sylvie the pretty peasant girl  do you know what it is to walk alone all day on the border and what good company to you the burn is that runs beside the highway  just so companionable is the music of the ballads in that enchanted country of gerards fancy in the land of the valois  all the while you read you have a sense of the briefness of the pleasure you know that the hero cannot rest here that the girls and their loves the cottage and its shelter are not for him  he is only passing by happy yet wistful far untravelled horizons are alluring him the great city is drawing him to herself and will slay him one day in her den as scylla slew her victims  conceive gerard living a wild life with wilder young men and women in a great barrack of an old hotel that the painters amused themselves by decorating  conceive him coming home from the play or rather from watching the particular actress for whom he had a distant fantastic passion  he leaves the theatre and takes up a newspaper where he reads that tomorrow the archers of senlis are to meet the archers of loisy these were places in his native district where he had been a boy  they recalled many memories he could not sleep that night the old scenes flashed before his halfdreaming eyes  this was one of the visions  in front of a chateau of the time of henri iv a chateau with peaked lichencovered roofs with a facing of red brick varied by stonework of a paler hue lay a wide green lawn set round with limes and elms and through the leaves fell the golden rays of the setting sun young girls were dancing in a circle on the mossy grass to the sound of airs that their mothers had sung airs with words so pure and natural that one felt ones self indeed in that old valois land where for a thousand years has beat the heart of france  i was the only boy in the circle whither i had led my little friend sylvie a child of a neighbouring hamlet sylvie so full of life so fresh with her dark eyes her regular profile her sunburnt face  i had loved nobody i had seen nobody but her till the daughter of the chateau fair and tall entered the circle of peasant girls  to obtain the right to join the ring she had to chant a scrap of a ballad  we sat round her and in a fresh clear voice she sang one of the old ballads of romance full of love and sadness    as she sang the shadow of the great trees grew deeper and the broad light of the risen moon fell on her alone she standing without the listening circle  her song was over and no one dared to break the silence  a light mist arose from the mossy ground trailing over the grass  we seemed to be in paradise  so the boy twisted a wreath for this new enchantress the daughter of a line of nobles with kings blood in her veins  and little brown deserted sylvie cried  all this gerard remembered and remembering hurried down to the old country place and met sylvie now a woman grown beautiful unspoiled still remembering the primitive songs and fairy tales  they walked together through the woods to the cottage of the aunt of sylvie an old peasant woman of the richer class  she prepared dinner for them and sent de nerval for the girl who had gone to ransack the peasant treasures in the garret  two portraits were hanging thereone that of a young man of the good old times smiling with red lips and brown eyes a pastel in an oval frame another medallion held the portrait of his wife gay piquante in a bodice with ribbons fluttering and with a bird perched on her finger  it was the old aunt in her youth and further search discovered her ancient festalgown of stiff brocade  sylvie arrayed herself in this splendour patches were found in a box of tarnished gold a fan a necklace of amber  the holiday attire of the dead uncle who had been a keeper in the royal woods was not far to seek and gerard and sylvie appeared before the aunt as her old self and her old lover  my children she cried and wept and smiled through her tears at the cruel and charming apparition of youth  presently she dried her tears and only remembered the pomp and pride of her wedding  we joined hands and sang the naive epithalamium of old france amorous and full of flowery turns as the song of songs we were the bride and the bridegroom all one sweet morning of summer  i translated these fragments long ago in one of the first things i ever tried to write  the passages are as touching and fresh the originals i mean as when first i read them and one hears the voice of sylvie singing     a dammartin ly a trois belles filles    ly en a zune plus belle que le jour  so sylvie married a confectioner and like marion in the ballad of forty years adriennes dead in a convent  that is all the story all the idyll  gerard also wrote the idyll of his own delirium and the proofs of it le reve et la vie were in his pocket when they found him dead in la rue de la vieille lanterne  some of his poems have a sweetness and careless grace like the grace of his favourite old ballads  one cannot translate things like this     ou sont nos amoureuses       elles sont au tombeau    elles sont plus heureuses       dans un sejour plus beau  but i shall try the couplets on a greek air        neither good morn nor good night     the sunset is not yet the morn is gone       yet in our eyes the light hath paled and passed    but twilight shall be lovely as the dawn       and night shall bring forgetfulness at last  gerards poems are few the best are his vision of a lady with gold hair and brown eyes whom he had loved in an earlier existence and his humorous little piece on a boys love for a fair cousin and on their winter walk together and the welcome smell of roast turkey which greets them on the stairs when they come home  there are also poems of his madness called chimeres and very beautiful in form  you read and admire and dont understand a line yet it seems that if we were a little more or a little less mad we would understand     et jai deux fois vainqueur traverse lacheron    modulant tour a tour sur la lyre dorphee    les soupirs de la sainte et les cris de la fee  here is an attempt to translate the untranslatable the sonnet called     el desdichado     i am that dark that disinherited       that all dishonoured prince of aquitaine       the star upon my scutcheon long hath fled    a black sun on my lute doth yet remain    oh thou that didst

laughter of a fay     on books about red men   to richard wilby esq eton college windsor  my dear dickit is very good of you among your severe studies at eton to write to your uncle  i am extremely pleased to hear that your football is appreciated in the highest circles and shall be happy to have as good an account of your skill in making latin verses  i am glad you like she mr rider haggards book which i sent you  it is something like as you say and i quite agree with you both in being in love with the heroine and in thinking that she preaches rather too much  but then as she was over two thousand years old and had lived for most of that time among cannibals who did not understand her one may excuse her for jawing as you say a good deal when she met white men  you want to know if she is a true story  of course it is  but you have read she and you have read all coopers and marryats and mr stevensons books and tom sawyer and huckleberry finn several times  so have i and am quite ready to begin again  but to my mind books about red indians have always seemed much the most interesting  at your age i remember i bought a tomahawk and as we had also lots of spears and boomerangs from australia the poultry used to have rather a rough time of it  i never could do very much with a boomerang but i could throw a spear to a hairs breadth as many a chicken had occasion to discover  when you go home for christmas i hope you will remember that all this was very wrong and that you will consider we are civilized people not mohicans nor pawnees  i also made a stone pipe like hiawathas but i never could drill a hole in the stem so it did not draw like a civilized pipe  by way of an awful warning to you on this score and also as you say you want a true book about red indians let me recommend to you the best book about them i ever came across  it is called a narrative of the captivity and adventures of john tanner during thirty years residence among the indians and it was published at new york by messrs carvill in 1830  if i were an american publisher instead of a british author how i wish i was id publish john tanner again or perhaps cut a good deal out and make a boys book of it  you are not likely to get it to buy but mr steevens the american bookseller has found me a copy  if i lend you it will you be kind enough to illustrate it on separate sheets of paper and not make drawings on the pages of the book  this will in the long run be more satisfactory to yourself as you will be able to keep your pictures for i want john tanner back again and dont lend him to your fagmaster  tanner was born about 1780 he lived in kentucky  dont you wish you had lived in kentucky in colonel boones time  the shawnees were roaming about the neighbourhood when tanner was a little boy  his uncle scalped one of them  this made bad feeling between the tanners and the shawnees but john like any boy of spirit wished never to learn lessons and wanted to be an indian brave  he soon had more of being a brave than he liked but he never learned any more lessons and could not even read or write  one day johns father told him not to leave the house because from the movements of the horses he knew that indians were in the woods  so john seized the first chance and nipped out and ran to a walnut tree in one of the fields where he began filling his straw hat with walnuts  at that very moment he was caught by two indians who spilled the nuts put his hat on his head and bolted with him  one of the old women of the tribe had lost her son and wanted to adopt a boy and so they adopted johnny tanner  they ran with him till he was out of breath till they reached the ohio where they threw him into a canoe paddled across and set off running again  in ten days hard marching they reached the camp and it was worse than going to a new school for all the indians kicked john tanner about and their dance he says was brisk and cheerful after the manner of the scalp dance  cheerful for john  he had to lie between the fire and the door of the lodge and every one who passed gave him a kick  one old man was particularly cruel  when tanner was grown up he came back to that neighbourhood and the first thing he asked was where is manitoo geezhik  dead two months since  it is well that he is dead said john tanner  but an old female chief netkokua adopted him and now it began to be fun  for he was sent to shoot game for the family  could anything be more delightful  his first shot was at pigeons with a pistol  the pistol knocked down tanner but it also knocked down the pigeon  he then caught martinsand measles which was less entertaining  even indians have measles  but even hunting is not altogether fun when you start with no breakfast and have no chance of supper unless you kill game  the other red indian books especially the cheap ones dont tell you that very often the indians are more than halfstarved  then some one builds a magic lodge and prays to the great spirit  tanner often did this and he would then dream how the great spirit appeared to him as a beautiful young man and told him where he would find game and prophesied other events in his life  it is curious to see a white man taking to the indian religion and having exactly the same sort of visions as their red converts described to the jesuit fathers nearly two hundred years before  tanner saw some indian ghosts too when he grew up  on the bank of the little saskawjewun there was a capital campingplace where the indians never camped  it was called jebingneezhoshinnautthe place of two dead men  two indians of the same totem had killed each other there now their totem was that which tanner bore the totem of his adopted indian mother  the story was that if any man camped there the ghosts would come out of their graves and that was just what happened  tanner made the experiment he camped and fell asleep  very soon i saw the two dead men come and sit down by my fire opposite me  i got up and sat opposite them by the fire and in this position i awoke  perhaps he fell asleep again for he now saw the two dead men who sat opposite to him and laughed and poked fun and sticks at him  he could neither speak nor run away  one of them showed him a horse on a hill and said there my brother is a horse i give you to ride on your journey home and on your way you can call and leave the horse and spend another night with us  so next morning he found the horse and rode it but he did not spend another night with the ghosts of his own totem  he had seen enough of them  though tanner believed in his own dreams of the great spirit he did not believe in those of his indian mother  he thought she used to prowl about in the daytime find tracks of a bear or deer watch where they went to and then say the beasts lair had been revealed to her in a dream  but tanners own visions were honest injun  once in a hard winter tanner played a trick on the old woman  all the food they had was a quart of frozen bears grease kept in a kettle with a skin fastened over it  but tanner caught a rabbit alive and popped him under the skin  so when the old woman went for the bears grease in the morning and found it alive she was not a little alarmed  but does not the notion of living on frozen pomatum rather take the gilt off the delight of being an indian  the old woman was as brave and resolute as a man but in one day she sold a hundred and twenty beaver skins and many buffalo robes for rum  she always entertained all the neighbouring indians as long as the rum lasted and tanner had a narrow escape of growing up a drunkard  he became such a savage that when an indian girl carelessly allowed his wigwam to be burned he stripped her of her blanket and turned her out for the night in the snow  so tanner grew up in spite of hunger and drink  once when starving and without bullets he met a buck moose  if he killed the moose he would be saved if he did not he would die  so he took the screws out of the lock of his rifle loaded with them in place of bullets tied the lock on with string fired and killed the moose  tanner was worried into marrying a young squaw at least he says he did it because the girl wanted it and this led to all his sorrowsthis and a quarrel with a medicineman  the medicineman accused him of being a wizard and his wife got another indian to shoot him  tanner was far from surgeons and he actually hacked out the bullet himself with an old razor  another wounded indian once amputated his own arm  the ancient spartans could not have been pluckier  the indians had other virtues as well as pluck  they were honest and so hospitable before they knew white mens ways that they would give poor strangers new mocassins and new buffalo cloaks  will it bore you my dear dick if i tell you of an old indians death it seems a pretty and touching story  old peshauba was a friend of tanner  one day he fell violently ill  he sent for tanner and said to him i remember before i came to live in this world i was with the great spirit above  i saw many good and desirable things and among others a beautiful woman  and the great spirit said peshauba do you love the woman  i told him i did  then he said go down and spend a few winters on earth  you cannot stay long and you must remember to be always kind and good to my children whom you see below  so i came down but i have never forgotten what was said to me  i have always stood in the smoke between the two bands when my people fought with their enemies    i now hear the same voice that talked to me before i came into the world  it tells me i can remain here no longer  he then walked out looked at the sun the sky the lake and the distant hills then came in lay down composedly in his place and in a few minutes ceased to breathe  if we would hardly care to live like indians after all and tanner tired of it and came back an old man to the states we might desire to die like peshauba if like him we had been good and kind to gods children whom we meet below  so here is a christmas moral for you out of a red indian book and i wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year     appendix i   reynoldss peter bell  when the article on john hamilton reynolds a friend of keats was written i had not seen his peter bell taylor and hessey london 1888  this lyrical ballad is described in a letter of keatss published by mr sidney colvin in macmillans magazine august 1888 the point of reynoldss joke was to produce a parody before the original reynolds was annoyed by what hood called the betty foybles of wordsworth and by the demeanour of a poet who was serious not only in season but out of season  moreover wordsworth had damned a pretty piece of heathenism by keats with praise which was faint even from wordsworth to a contemporary  in the circumstances as wordsworth was not yet a kind of solemn shade whom we see haunting the hills and hear chanting the swan song of the dying england perhaps reynoldss parody scarce needs excuse  mr ainger calls it insolent meaning that it has an unkind tone of personal attack  that is unluckily true but to myself the parody appears remarkably funny and quite worthy of the sneering brothers the vile smiths as lamb calls the authors of rejected addresses  lamb wrote to tell wordsworth that he did not see the fun of the parodyperhaps it is as well that we should fail to see the fun of jests broken on our friends  but will any wordsworthian deny today the humour of this     he is rurally related    peter bell hath country cousins    he had once a worthy mother    bells and peters by the dozens    but peter bell he hath no brothers    not a brother owneth he    peter bell he hath no brother    his mother had no other son    no other son eer called her mother    peter bell hath brother none  as keats says in a review he wrote for the examiner there is a pestilent humour in the rhymes and an inveterate cadence in some of the stanzas that must be lamented  in his review keats tried to hurt neither side but his heart was with reynolds it would be just as well to trounce lord byron in the same manner  people still make an outcry over the trouncing of keats  it was bludgeonly done but only part of a game a kind of horseplay at which most men of letters of the age were playing  who but regrets that in his life of keats mr colvin should speak as if sir walter scott had perhaps a guilty knowledge of the review of keats in blackwood  there is but a tittle of published evidence to the truth of a theory in itself utterly detestable and to every one who understands the character of scott wholly beyond possibility of belief  even if lockhart was the reviewer and if scott came to know it was scott responsible for what lockhart did in 1819 or 1820 the very time when mrs shelley thought he was defending shelley in blackwood where he had praised her frankenstein and when she spoke of sir walter as the only liberal man in the faction  unluckily keats died and his death was absurdly attributed to a pair of reviews which may have irritated him and which were coarse and cruel even for that period of robust reviewing  but keats knew very well the value of these critiques and probably resented them not much more than a football player resents being hacked in the course of the game  he was very willing to see byron and wordsworth trounced and as ready as peter corcoran in his friends poem to take punishment himself  the character of keats was plucky and his estimate of his own genius was perfectly sane  he knew that he was in the thick of a literary scrimmage and he was not the man to flinch or to repine at the consequences     appendix ii   portraits of virgil and lucretius  in the letter on virgil some remarks are made on a bust of the poet  it is wholly fanciful  our only vestiges of a portrait of virgil are in two mss the better of the two is in the vatican  the design represents a youth with dark hair and a pleasant face seated reading  a desk is beside him and a case for manuscript in shape like a bandbox  see visconti icon rom i 179 plate 13  martial tells us that portraits of virgil were illuminated on copies of his aeneid  the vatican ms is of the twelfth century  but every one who has followed the fortunes of books knows that a kind of tradition often preserves the illustrations which are copied and recopied without material change see mr jacobss fables of bidpai nutt 1888  thus the vatican ms may preserve at least a shadow of virgil  if there be any portrait of lucretius it is a profile on a sard published by mr munro in his famous edition of the poet  the letters lvcr are inscribed on the stone and appear to be contemporary with the gem  this at least is the opinion of mr a s murray of the late mr c w king braun and muller  on the other hand bernouilli rom icon i 247 regards this and apparently most other roman gems with inscriptions as apocryphal  the ring which was in the nott collection is now in my possession  if lucretius were the rather pedantic and sharpnosed roman of the gem his wife had little reason for the jealousy which took so deplorable a form  cold this lucretius may have been volatilenever 11     footnotes   1  this was written during the lifetime of mr arnold and mr browning  2  since this was written mr bridges has made his lyrics accessible in shorter poems  g bell and sons 1890  3  macmillans  4  reynolds was perhaps a little irreverent  he anticipated wordsworths peter bell by a premature parody peter bell the first  5  appendix on reynoldss peter bell  6  aucassin and nicolette has now been edited annotated and equipped with a translation by mr f w bourdillon kegan paul  trench 1887  7  edinburgh 1862  8  the elzevir piracy was rather earlier  9  pindar perhaps in one of his fragments suggested that pretty cum regnat rosa  10  see next letter  11  mr munro calls the stone a black agate and does not mention its provenance  the engraving in his book does no justice to the portrait there is another gem representing lucretius in the vatican of old it belonged to leo x  the two gems are in all respects similar  a seal with this head or one very like it belonged to evelyn the friend of mr pepys
