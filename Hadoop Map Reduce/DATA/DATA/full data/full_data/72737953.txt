before the reader is introduced to the modest country medical practitioner who is to be the chief personage of the following tale it will be well that he should be made acquainted with some particulars as to the locality in which and the neighbours among whom our doctor followed his profession  there is a county in the west of england not so full of life indeed nor so widely spoken of as some of its manufacturing leviathan brethren in the north but which is nevertheless very dear to those who know it well its green pastures its waving wheat its deep and shady andlet us adddirty lanes its paths and stiles its tawnycoloured wellbuilt rural churches its avenues of beeches and frequent tudor mansions its constant county hunt its social graces and the general air of clanship which pervades it has made it to its own inhabitants a favoured land of goshen it is purely agricultural agricultural in its produce agricultural in its poor and agricultural in its pleasures there are towns in it of course dépôts from whence are brought seeds and groceries ribbons and fireshovels in which markets are held and county balls are carried on which return members to parliament generallyin spite of reform bills past present and comingin accordance with the dictates of some neighbouring land magnate from whence emanate the country postmen and where is located the supply of posthorses necessary for county visitings but these towns add nothing to the importance of the county they consist with the exception of the assize town of dull all but deathlike single streets each possesses two pumps three hotels ten shops fifteen beerhouses a beadle and a marketplace  indeed the town population of the county reckons for nothing when the importance of the county is discussed with the exception as before said of the assize town which is also a cathedral city herein is a clerical aristocracy which is certainly not without its due weight a resident bishop a resident dean an archdeacon three or four resident prebendaries and all their numerous chaplains vicars and ecclesiastical satellites do make up a society sufficiently powerful to be counted as something by the county squirearchy in other respects the greatness of barsetshire depends wholly on the landed powers  barsetshire however is not now so essentially one whole as it was before the reform bill divided it there is in these days an east barsetshire and there is a west barsetshire and people conversant with barsetshire doings declare that they can already decipher some difference of feeling some division of interests the eastern moiety of the county is more purely conservative than the western there is or was a taint of peelism in the latter and then too the residence of two such great whig magnates as the duke of omnium and the earl de courcy in that locality in some degree overshadows and renders less influential the gentlemen who live near them  it is to east barsetshire that we are called when the division above spoken of was first contemplated in those stormy days in which gallant men were still combatting reform ministers if not with hope still with spirit the battle was fought by none more bravely than by john newbold gresham of greshamsbury the member for barsetshire fate however and the duke of wellington were adverse and in the following parliament john newbold gresham was only member for east barsetshire  whether or not it was true as stated at the time that the aspect of the men with whom he was called on to associate at st stephens broke his heart it is not for us now to inquire it is certainly true that he did not live to see the first year of the reformed parliament brought to a close the then mr gresham was not an old man at the time of his death and his eldest son francis newbold gresham was a very young man but notwithstanding his youth and notwithstanding other grounds of objection which stood in the way of such preferment and which must be explained he was chosen in his fathers place the fathers services had been too recent too well appreciated too thoroughly in unison with the feelings of those around him to allow of any other choice and in this way young frank gresham found himself member for east barsetshire although the very men who elected him knew that they had but slender ground for trusting him with their suffrages  frank gresham though then only twentyfour years of age was a married man and a father he had already chosen a wife and by his choice had given much ground of distrust to the men of east barsetshire he had married no other than lady arabella de courcy the sister of the great whig earl who lived at courcy castle in the west that earl who not only voted for the reform bill but had been infamously active in bringing over other young peers so to vote and whose name therefore stank in the nostrils of the staunch tory squires of the county  not only had frank gresham so wedded but having thus improperly and unpatriotically chosen a wife he had added to his sins by becoming recklessly intimate with his wifes relations it is true that he still called himself a tory belonged to the club of which his father had been one of the most honoured members and in the days of the great battle got his head broken in a row on the right side but nevertheless it was felt by the good men true and blue of east barsetshire that a constant sojourner at courcy castle could not be regarded as a consistent tory when however his father died that broken head served him in good stead his sufferings in the cause were made the most of these in unison with his fathers merits turned the scale and it was accordingly decided at a meeting held at the george and dragon at barchester that frank gresham should fill his fathers shoes  but frank gresham could not fill his fathers shoes they were too big for him he did become member for east barsetshire but he was such a memberso lukewarm so indifferent so prone to associate with the enemies of the good cause so little willing to fight the good fight that he soon disgusted those who most dearly loved the memory of the old squire  de courcy castle in those days had great allurements for a young man and all those allurements were made the most of to win over young gresham his wife who was a year or two older than himself was a fashionable woman with thorough whig tastes and aspirations such as became the daughter of a great whig earl she cared for politics or thought that she cared for them more than her husband did for a month or two previous to her engagement she had been attached to the court and had been made to believe that much of the policy of englands rulers depended on the political intrigues of englands women she was one who would fain be doing something if she only knew how and the first important attempt she made was to turn her respectable young tory husband into a secondrate whig bantling as this ladys character will it is hoped show itself in the following pages we need not now describe it more closely  it is not a bad thing to be soninlaw to a potent earl member of parliament for a county and a possessor of a fine old english seat and a fine old english fortune as a very young man frank gresham found the life to which he was thus introduced agreeable enough he consoled himself as best he might for the blue looks with which he was greeted by his own party and took his revenge by consorting more thoroughly than ever with his political adversaries foolishly like a foolish moth he flew to the bright light and like the moths of course he burnt his wings early in 1833 he had become a member of parliament and in the autumn of 1834 the dissolution came young members of three or fourandtwenty do not think much of dissolutions forget the fancies of their constituents and are too proud of the present to calculate much as to the future so it was with mr gresham his father had been member for barsetshire all his life and he looked forward to similar prosperity as though it were part of his inheritance but he failed to take any of the steps which had secured his fathers seat  in the autumn of 1834 the dissolution came and frank gresham with his honourable lady wife and all the de courcys at his back found that he had mortally offended the county to his great disgust another candidate was brought forward as a fellow to his late colleague and though he manfully fought the battle and spent ten thousand pounds in the contest he could not recover his position a high tory with a great whig interest to back him is never a popular person in england no one can trust him though there may be those who are willing to place him untrusted in high positions such was the case with mr gresham there were many who were willing for family considerations to keep him in parliament but no one thought that he was fit to be there the consequences were that a bitter and expensive contest ensued frank gresham when twitted with being a whig foreswore the de courcy family and then when ridiculed as having been thrown over by the tories foreswore his fathers old friends so between the two stools he fell to the ground and as a politician he never again rose to his feet  he never again rose to his feet but twice again he made violent efforts to do so elections in east barsetshire from various causes came quick upon each other in those days and before he was eightandtwenty years of age mr gresham had three times contested the county and been three times beaten to speak the truth of him his own spirit would have been satisfied with the loss of the first ten thousand pounds but lady arabella was made of higher mettle she had married a man with a fine place and a fine fortune but she had nevertheless married a commoner and had in so far derogated from her high birth she felt that her husband should be by rights a member of the house of lords but if not that it was at least essential that he should have a seat in the lower chamber she would by degrees sink into nothing if she allowed herself to sit down the mere wife of a mere country squire  thus instigated mr gresham repeated the useless contest three times and repeated it each time at a serious cost he lost his money lady arabella lost her temper and things at greshamsbury went on by no means as prosperously as they had done in the days of the old squire  in the first twelve years of their marriage children came fast into the nursery at greshamsbury the first that was born was a boy and in those happy halcyon days when the old squire was still alive great was the joy at the birth of an heir to greshamsbury bonfires gleamed through the countryside oxen were roasted whole and the customary paraphernalia of joy usual to rich britons on such occasions were gone through with wondrous éclat but when the tenth baby and the ninth little girl was brought into the world the outward show of joy was not so great  then other troubles came on some of these little girls were sickly some very sickly lady arabella had her faults and they were such as were extremely detrimental to her husbands happiness and her own but that of being an indifferent mother was not among them she had worried her husband daily for years because he was not in parliament she had worried him because he would not furnish the house in portman square she had worried him because he objected to have more people every winter at greshamsbury park than the house would hold but now she changed her tune and worried him because selina coughed because helena was hectic because poor sophys spine was weak and matildas appetite was gone  worrying from such causes was pardonable it will be said so it was but the manner was hardly pardonable selinas cough was certainly not fairly attributable to the oldfashioned furniture in portman square nor would sophys spine have been materially benefited by her father having a seat in parliament and yet to have heard lady arabella discussing those matters in family conclave one would have thought that she would have expected such results  as it was her poor weak darlings were carried about from london to brighton from brighton to some german baths from the german baths back to torquay and thenceas regarded the four we have namedto that bourne from whence no further journey could be made under the lady arabellas directions  the one son and heir to greshamsbury was named as his father francis newbold gresham he would have been the hero of our tale had not that place been preoccupied by the village doctor as it is those who please may so regard him it is he who is to be our favourite young man to do the love scenes to have his trials and his difficulties and to win through them or not as the case may be i am too old now to be a hardhearted author and so it is probable that he may not die of a broken heart those who dont approve of a middleaged bachelor country doctor as a hero may take the heir to greshamsbury in his stead and call the book if it so please them the loves and adventures of francis newbold gresham the younger  and master frank gresham was not ill adapted for playing the part of a hero of this sort he did not share his sisters illhealth and though the only boy of the family he excelled all his sisters in personal appearance the greshams from time immemorial had been handsome they were broad browed blue eyed fair haired born with dimples in their chins and that pleasant aristocratic dangerous curl of the upper lip which can equally express good humour or scorn young frank was every inch a gresham and was the darling of his fathers heart  the de courcys had never been plain there was too much hauteur too much pride we may perhaps even fairly say too much nobility in their gait and manners and even in their faces to allow of their being considered plain but they were not a race nurtured by venus or apollo they were tall and thin with high cheekbones high foreheads and large dignified cold eyes the de courcy girls had all good hair and as they also possessed easy manners and powers of talking they managed to pass in the world for beauties till they were absorbed in the matrimonial market and the world at large cared no longer whether they were beauties or not the misses gresham were made in the de courcy mould and were not on this account the less dear to their mother  the two eldest augusta and beatrice lived and were apparently likely to live the four next faded and died one after anotherall in the same sad yearand were laid in the neat new cemetery at torquay then came a pair born at one birth weak delicate frail little flowers with dark hair and dark eyes and thin long pale faces with long bony hands and long bony feet whom men looked on as fated to follow their sisters with quick steps hitherto however they had not followed them nor had they suffered as their sisters had suffered and some people at greshamsbury attributed this to the fact that a change had been made in the family medical practitioner  then came the youngest of the flock she whose birth we have said was not heralded with loud joy for when she came into the world four others with pale temples wan worn cheeks and skeleton white arms were awaiting permission to leave it  such was the family when in the year 1854 the eldest son came of age he had been educated at harrow and was now still at cambridge but of course on such a day as this he was at home that coming of age must be a delightful time to a young man born to inherit broad acres and wide wealth those fullmouthed congratulations those warm prayers with which his manhood is welcomed by the greyhaired seniors of the county the affectionate all but motherly caresses of neighbouring mothers who have seen him grow up from his cradle of mothers who have daughters perhaps fair enough and good enough and sweet enough even for him the softspoken halfbashful but tender greetings of the girls who now perhaps for the first time call him by his stern family name instructed by instinct rather than precept that the time has come when the familiar charles or familiar john must by them be laid aside the lucky dogs and hints of silver spoons which are poured into his ears as each young compeer slaps his back and bids him live a thousand years and then never die the shouting of the tenantry the good wishes of the old farmers who come up to wring his hand the kisses which he gets from the farmers wives and the kisses which he gives to the farmers daughters all these things must make the twentyfirst birthday pleasant enough to a young heir to a youth however who feels that he is now liable to arrest and that he inherits no other privilege the pleasure may very possibly not be quite so keen  the case with young frank gresham may be supposed to much nearer the former than the latter but yet the ceremony of his coming of age was by no means like that which fate had accorded to his father mr gresham was now an embarrassed man and though the world did not know it or at any rate did not know that he was deeply embarrassed he had not the heart to throw open his mansion and receive the county with a free hand as though all things were going well with him  nothing was going well with him lady arabella would allow nothing near him or around him to be well everything with him now turned to vexation he was no longer a joyous happy man and the people of east barsetshire did not look for gala doings on a grand scale when young gresham came of age  gala doings to a certain extent there were there it was in july and tables were spread under the oaks for the tenants tables were spread and meat and beer and wine were there and frank as he walked round and shook his guests by the hand expressed a hope that their relations with each other might be long close and mutually advantageous  we must say a few words now about the place itself greshamsbury park was a fine old english gentlemans seatwas and is but we can assert it more easily in past tense as we are speaking of it with reference to a past time we have spoken of greshamsbury park there was a park so called but the mansion itself was generally known as greshamsbury house and did not stand in the park we may perhaps best describe it by saying that the village of greshamsbury consisted of one long straggling street a mile in length which in the centre turned sharp round so that one half of the street lay directly at right angles to the other in this angle stood greshamsbury house and the gardens and grounds around it filled up the space so made there was an entrance with large gates at each end of the village and each gate was guarded by the effigies of two huge pagans with clubs such being the crest borne by the family from each entrance a broad road quite straight running through to a majestic avenue of limes led up to the house this was built in the richest perhaps we should rather say in the purest style of tudor architecture so much so that though greshamsbury is less complete than longleat less magnificent than hatfield it may in some sense be said to be the finest specimen of tudor architecture of which the country can boast  it stands amid a multitude of trim gardens and stonebuilt terraces divided one from another these to our eyes are not so attractive as that broad expanse of lawn by which our country houses are generally surrounded but the gardens of greshamsbury have been celebrated for two centuries and any gresham who would have altered them would have been considered to have destroyed one of the wellknown landmarks of the family  greshamsbury parkproperly so calledspread far away on the other side of the village opposite to the two great gates leading up to the mansion were two smaller gates the one opening on to the stables kennels and farmyard and the other to the deer park this latter was the principal entrance to the demesne and a grand and picturesque entrance it was the avenue of limes which on one side stretched up to the house was on the other extended for a quarter of a mile and then appeared to be terminated only by an abrupt rise in the ground at the entrance there were four savages and four clubs two to each portal and what with the massive iron gates surmounted by a stone wall on which stood the family arms supported by two other clubbearers the stonebuilt lodges the doric ivycovered columns which surrounded the circle the four grim savages and the extent of the space itself through which the high road ran and which just abutted on the village the spot was sufficiently significant of old family greatness  those who examined it more closely might see that under the arms was a scroll bearing the gresham motto and that the words were repeated in smaller letters under each of the savages gardez gresham had been chosen in the days of mottochoosing probably by some heraldatarms as an appropriate legend for signifying the peculiar attributes of the family now however unfortunately men were not of one mind as to the exact idea signified some declared with much heraldic warmth that it was an address to the savages calling on them to take care of their patron while others with whom i myself am inclined to agree averred with equal certainty that it was an advice to the people at large especially to those inclined to rebel against the aristocracy of the county that they should beware the gresham the latter signification would betoken strengthso said the holders of this doctrine the former weakness now the greshams were ever a strong people and never addicted to a false humility  we will not pretend to decide the question alas either construction was now equally unsuited to the family fortunes such changes had taken place in england since the greshams had founded themselves that no savage could any longer in any way protect them they must protect themselves like common folk or live unprotected nor now was it necessary that any neighbour should shake in his shoes when the gresham frowned it would have been to be wished that the present gresham himself could have been as indifferent to the frowns of some of his neighbours  but the old symbols remained and may such symbols long remain among us they are still lovely and fit to be loved they tell us of the true and manly feelings of other times and to him who can read aright they explain more fully more truly than any written history can do how englishmen have become what they are england is not yet a commercial country in the sense in which that epithet is used for her and let us still hope that she will not soon become so she might surely as well be called feudal england or chivalrous england if in western civilised europe there does exist a nation among whom there are high signors and with whom the owners of the land are the true aristocracy the aristocracy that is trusted as being best and fittest to rule that nation is the english choose out the ten leading men of each great european people choose them in france in austria sardinia prussia russia sweden denmark spain  and then select the ten in england whose names are best known as those of leading statesmen the result will show in which country there still exists the closest attachment to the sincerest trust in the old feudal and now socalled landed interests  england a commercial country yes as venice was she may excel other nations in commerce but yet it is not that in which she most prides herself in which she most excels merchants as such are not the first men among us though it perhaps be open barely open to a merchant to become one of them buying and selling is good and necessary it is very necessary and may possibly be very good but it cannot be the noblest work of man and let us hope that it may not in our time be esteemed the noblest work of an englishman  greshamsbury park was very large it lay on the outside of the angle formed by the village street and stretched away on two sides without apparent limit or boundaries visible from the village road or house indeed the ground on this side was so broken up into abrupt hills and conicalshaped oakcovered excrescences which were seen peeping up through and over each other that the true extent of the park was much magnified to the eye it was very possible for a stranger to get into it and to find some difficulty in getting out again by any of its known gates and such was the beauty of the landscape that a lover of scenery would be tempted thus to lose himself  i have said that on one side lay the kennels and this will give me an opportunity of describing here one especial episode a long episode in the life of the existing squire he had once represented his county in parliament and when he ceased to do so he still felt an ambition to be connected in some peculiar way with that countys greatness he still desired that gresham of greshamsbury should be something more in east barsetshire than jackson of the grange or baker of mill hill or bateson of annesgrove they were all his friends and very respectable country gentlemen but mr gresham of greshamsbury should be more than this even he had enough of ambition to be aware of such a longing therefore when an opportunity occurred he took to hunting the county  for this employment he was in every way well suitedunless it was in the matter of finance though he had in his very earliest manly years given such great offence by indifference to his family politics and had in a certain degree fostered the illfeeling by contesting the county in opposition to the wishes of his brother squires nevertheless he bore a loved and popular name men regretted that he should not have been what they wished him to be that he should not have been such as was the old squire but when they found that such was the case that he could not be great among them as a politician they were still willing that he should be great in any other way if there were county greatness for which he was suited now he was known as an excellent horseman as a thorough sportsman as one knowing in dogs and tenderhearted as a sucking mother to a litter of young foxes he had ridden in the county since he was fifteen had a fine voice for a viewhallo knew every hound by name and could wind a horn with sufficient music for all hunting purposes moreover he had come to his property as was well known through all barsetshire with a clear income of fourteen thousand a year  thus when some old wornout master of hounds was run to ground about a year after mr greshams last contest for the county it seemed to all parties to be a pleasant and rational arrangement that the hounds should go to greshamsbury pleasant indeed to all except the lady arabella and rational perhaps to all except the squire himself  all this time he was already considerably encumbered he had spent much more than he should have done and so indeed had his wife in those two splendid years in which they had figured as great among the great ones of the earth fourteen thousand a year ought to have been enough to allow a member of parliament with a young wife and two or three children to live in london and keep up their country family mansion but then the de courcys were very great people and lady arabella chose to live as she had been accustomed to do and as her sisterinlaw the countess lived now lord de courcy had much more than fourteen thousand a year then came the three elections with their vast attendant cost and then those costly expedients to which gentlemen are forced to have recourse who have lived beyond their income and find it impossible so to reduce their establishments as to live much below it thus when the hounds came to greshamsbury mr gresham was already a poor man  lady arabella said much to oppose their coming but lady arabella though it could hardly be said of her that she was under her husbands rule certainly was not entitled to boast that she had him under hers she then made her first grand attack as to the furniture in portman square and was then for the first time specially informed that the furniture there was not matter of much importance as she would not in future be required to move her family to that residence during the london seasons the sort of conversations which grew from such a commencement may be imagined had lady arabella worried her lord less he might perhaps have considered with more coolness the folly of encountering so prodigious an increase to the expense of his establishment had he not spent so much money in a pursuit which his wife did not enjoy she might perhaps have been more sparing in her rebukes as to his indifference to her london pleasures as it was the hounds came to greshamsbury and lady arabella did go to london for some period in each year and the family expenses were by no means lessened  the kennels however were now again empty two years previous to the time at which our story begins the hounds had been carried off to the seat of some richer sportsman this was more felt by mr gresham than any other misfortune which he had yet incurred he had been master of hounds for ten years and that work he had at any rate done well the popularity among his neighbours which he had lost as a politician he had regained as a sportsman and he would fain have remained autocratic in the hunt had it been possible but he so remained much longer than he should have done and at last they went away not without signs and sounds of visible joy on the part of lady arabella  but we have kept the greshamsbury tenantry waiting under the oaktrees by far too long yes when young frank came of age there was still enough left at greshamsbury still means enough at the squires disposal to light one bonfire to roast whole in its skin one bullock franks virility came on him not quite unmarked as that of the parsons son might do or the son of the neighbouring attorney it could still be reported in the barsetshire conservative standard that the beards wagged all at greshamsbury now as they had done for many centuries on similar festivals yes it was so reported but this like so many other such reports had but a shadow of truth in it they poured the liquor in certainly those who were there but the beards did not wag as they had been wont to wag in former years beards wont wag for the telling the squire was at his wits end for money and the tenants one and all had so heard rents had been raised on them timber had fallen fast the lawyer on the estate was growing rich tradesmen in barchester nay in greshamsbury itself were beginning to mutter and the squire himself would not be merry under such circumstances the throats of a tenantry will still swallow but their beards will not wag  i minds well said farmer oaklerath to his neighbour when the squoire hisself comed of age lord love ee there was fun going that day there was more yale drank then thans been brewed at the big house these two years told squoire was a oneer  and i minds when squoire was borned minds it well said an old farmer sitting opposite them was the days it ant that long ago neither squoire ant come o fifty yet no nor ant nigh it though he looks it things be altered at greemsburysuch was the rural pronunciationaltered sadly neebor oaklerath well well ill soon be gone i will and so it ant no use talking but arter paying one pound fifteen for them acres for more nor fifty year i didnt think id ever be axed for forty shilling  such was the style of conversation which went on at the various tables it had certainly been of a very different tone when the squire was born when he came of age and when just two years subsequently his son had been born on each of these events similar rural fêtes had been given and the squire himself had on these occasions been frequent among his guests on the first he had been carried round by his father a whole train of ladies and nurses following on the second he had himself mixed in all the sports the gayest of the gay and each tenant had squeezed his way up to the lawn to get a sight of the lady arabella who as was already known was to come from courcy castle to greshamsbury to be their mistress it was little they any of them cared now for the lady arabella on the third he himself had borne his child in his arms as his father had before borne him he was then in the zenith of his pride and though the tenantry whispered that he was somewhat less familiar with them than of yore that he had put on somewhat too much of the de courcy airs still he was their squire their master the rich man in whose hand they lay the old squire was then gone and they were proud of the young member and his lady bride in spite of a little hauteur none of them were proud of him now  he walked once round among the guests and spoke a few words of welcome at each table and as he did so the tenants got up and bowed and wished health to the old squire happiness to the young one and prosperity to greshamsbury but nevertheless it was but a tame affair  there were also other visitors of the gentle sort to do honour to the occasion but not such swarms not such a crowd at the mansion itself and at the houses of the neighbouring gentry as had always been collected on these former gala doings indeed the party at greshamsbury was not a large one and consisted chiefly of lady de courcy and her suite lady arabella still kept up as far as she was able her close connexion with courcy castle she was there as much as possible to which mr gresham never objected and she took her daughters there whenever she could though as regarded the two elder girls she was interfered with by mr gresham and not unfrequently by the girls themselves lady arabella had a pride in her son though he was by no means her favourite child he was however the heir of greshamsbury of which fact she was disposed to make the most and he was also a fine gainly openhearted young man who could not but be dear to any mother lady arabella did love him dearly though she felt a sort of disappointment in regard to him seeing that he was not so much like a de courcy as he should have been she did love him dearly and therefore when he came of age she got her sisterinlaw and all the ladies amelia rosina etc to come to greshamsbury and she also with some difficulty persuaded the honourable georges and the honourable johns to be equally condescending lord de courcy himself was in attendance at the courtor said that he wasand lord porlock the eldest son simply told his aunt when he was invited that he never bored himself with those sort of things  then there were the bakers and the batesons and the jacksons who all lived near and returned home at night there was the reverend caleb oriel the highchurch rector with his beautiful sister patience oriel there was mr yates umbleby the attorney and agent and there was dr thorne and the doctors modest quietlooking little niece miss mary     chapter ii  long long ago   as dr thorne is our heroor i should rather say my hero a privilege of selecting for themselves in this respect being left to all my readersand as miss mary thorne is to be our heroine a point on which no choice whatsoever is left to any one it is necessary that they shall be introduced and explained and described in a proper formal manner i quite feel that an apology is due for beginning a novel with two long dull chapters full of description i am perfectly aware of the danger of such a course in so doing i sin against the golden rule which requires us all to put our best foot foremost the wisdom of which is fully recognised by novelists myself among the number it can hardly be expected that any one will consent to go through with a fiction that offers so little of allurement in its first pages but twist it as i will i cannot do otherwise i find that i cannot make poor mr gresham hem and haw and turn himself uneasily in his armchair in a natural manner till i have said why he is uneasy i cannot bring in my doctor speaking his mind freely among the bigwigs till i have explained that it is in accordance with his usual character to do so this is unartistic on my part and shows want of imagination as well as want of skill whether or not i can atone for these faults by straightforward simple plain storytellingthat indeed is very doubtful  dr thorne belonged to a family in one sense as good and at any rate as old as that of mr gresham and much older he was apt to boast than that of the de courcys this trait in his character is mentioned first as it was the weakness for which he was most conspicuous he was second cousin to mr thorne of ullathorne a barsetshire squire living in the neighbourhood of barchester and who boasted that his estate had remained in his family descending from thorne to thorne longer than had been the case with any other estate or any other family in the county  but dr thorne was only a second cousin and therefore though he was entitled to talk of the blood as belonging to some extent to himself he had no right to lay claim to any position in the county other than such as he might win for himself if he chose to locate himself in it this was a fact of which no one was more fully aware than our doctor himself his father who had been first cousin of a former squire thorne had been a clerical dignitary in barchester but had been dead now many years he had had two sons one he had educated as a medical man but the other and the younger whom he had intended for the bar had not betaken himself in any satisfactory way to any calling this son had been first rusticated from oxford and then expelled and thence returning to barchester had been the cause to his father and brother of much suffering  old dr thorne the clergyman died when the two brothers were yet young men and left behind him nothing but some household and other property of the value of about two thousand pounds which he bequeathed to thomas the elder son much more than that having been spent in liquidating debts contracted by the younger up to that time there had been close harmony between the ullathorne family and that of the clergyman but a month or two before the doctors deaththe period of which we are speaking was about twoandtwenty years before the commencement of our storythe then mr thorne of ullathorne had made it understood that he would no longer receive at his house his cousin henry whom he regarded as a disgrace to the family  fathers are apt to be more lenient to their sons than uncles to their nephews or cousins to each other dr thorne still hoped to reclaim his black sheep and thought that the head of his family showed an unnecessary harshness in putting an obstacle in his way of doing so and if the father was warm in support of his profligate son the young medical aspirant was warmer in support of his profligate brother dr thorne junior was no roué himself but perhaps as a young man he had not sufficient abhorrence of his brothers vices at any rate he stuck to him manfully and when it was signified in the close that henrys company was not considered desirable at ullathorne dr thomas thorne sent word to the squire that under such circumstances his visits there would also cease  this was not very prudent as the young galen had elected to establish himself in barchester very mainly in expectation of the help which his ullathorne connexion would give him this however in his anger he failed to consider he was never known either in early or in middle life to consider in his anger those points which were probably best worth his consideration this perhaps was of the less moment as his anger was of an unenduring kind evaporating frequently with more celerity than he could get the angry words out of his mouth with the ullathorne people however he did establish a quarrel sufficiently permanent to be of vital injury to his medical prospects  and then the father died and the two brothers were left living together with very little means between them at this time there were living in barchester people of the name of scatcherd of that family as then existing we have only to do with two a brother and a sister they were in a low rank of life the one being a journeyman stonemason and the other an apprentice to a strawbonnet maker but they were nevertheless in some sort remarkable people the sister was reputed in barchester to be a model of female beauty of the strong and robuster cast and had also a better reputation as being a girl of good character and honest womanly conduct both of her beauty and of her reputation her brother was exceedingly proud and he was the more so when he learnt that she had been asked in marriage by a decent mastertradesman in the city  roger scatcherd had also a reputation but not for beauty or propriety of conduct he was known for the best stonemason in the four counties and as the man who could on occasion drink the most alcohol in a given time in the same localities as a workman indeed he had higher reputate even than this he was not only a good and very quick stonemason but he had also a capacity for turning other men into good stonemasons he had a gift of knowing what a man could and should do and by degrees he taught himself what five and ten and twentylatterly what a thousand and two thousand men might accomplish among them this also he did with very little aid from pen and paper with which he was not and never became very conversant he had also other gifts and other propensities he could talk in a manner dangerous to himself and others he could persuade without knowing that he did so and being himself an extreme demagogue in those noisy times just prior to the reform bill he created a hubbub in barchester of which he himself had had no previous conception  henry thorne among his other bad qualities had one which his friends regarded as worse than all the others and which perhaps justified the ullathorne people in their severity he loved to consort with low people he not only drankthat might have been forgivenbut he drank in taprooms with vulgar drinkers so said his friends and so said his enemies he denied the charge as being made in the plural number and declared that his only low coreveller was roger scatcherd with roger scatcherd at any rate he associated and became as democratic as roger was himself now the thornes of ullathorne were of the very highest order of tory excellence  whether or not mary scatcherd at once accepted the offer of the respectable tradesman i cannot say after the occurrence of certain events which must here shortly be told she declared that she never had done so her brother averred that she most positively had the respectable tradesman himself refused to speak on the subject  it is certain however that scatcherd who had hitherto been silent enough about his sister in those social hours which he passed with his gentleman friend boasted of the engagement when it was as he said made and then boasted also of the girls beauty scatcherd in spite of his occasional intemperance looked up in the world and the coming marriage of his sister was he thought suitable to his own ambition for his family  henry thorne had already heard of and already seen mary scatcherd but hitherto she had not fallen in the way of his wickedness now however when he heard that she was to be decently married the devil tempted him to tempt her it boots not to tell all the tale it came out clearly enough when all was told that he made her most distinct promises of marriage he even gave her such in writing and having in this way obtained from her her company during some of her little holidaysher sundays or summer eveningshe seduced her scatcherd accused him openly of having intoxicated her with drugs and thomas thorne who took up the case ultimately believed the charge it became known in barchester that she was with child and that the seducer was henry thorne  roger scatcherd when the news first reached him filled himself with drink and then swore that he would kill them both with manly wrath however he set forth first against the man and that with manly weapons he took nothing with him but his fists and a big stick as he went in search of henry thorne  the two brothers were then lodging together at a farmhouse close abutting on the town this was not an eligible abode for a medical practitioner but the young doctor had not been able to settle himself eligibly since his fathers death and wishing to put what constraint he could upon his brother had so located himself to this farmhouse came roger scatcherd one sultry summer evening his anger gleaming from his bloodshot eyes and his rage heightened to madness by the rapid pace at which he had run from the city and by the ardent spirits which were fermenting within him  at the very gate of the farmyard standing placidly with his cigar in his mouth he encountered henry thorne he had thought of searching for him through the whole premises of demanding his victim with loud exclamations and making his way to him through all obstacles in lieu of that there stood the man before him  well roger whats in the wind said henry thorne  they were the last words he ever spoke he was answered by a blow from the blackthorn a contest ensued which ended in scatcherd keeping his wordat any rate as regarded the worst offender how the fatal blow on the temple was struck was never exactly determined one medical man said it might have been done in a fight with a heavyheaded stick another thought that a stone had been used a third suggested a stonemasons hammer it seemed however to be proved subsequently that no hammer was taken out and scatcherd himself persisted in declaring that he had taken in his hand no weapon but the stick scatcherd however was drunk and even though he intended to tell the truth may have been mistaken there were however the facts that thorne was dead that scatcherd had sworn to kill him about an hour previously and that he had without delay accomplished his threat he was arrested and tried for murder all the distressing circumstances of the case came out on the trial he was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to be imprisoned for six months our readers will probably think that the punishment was too severe  thomas thorne and the farmer were on the spot soon after henry thorne had fallen the brother was at first furious for vengeance against his brothers murderer but as the facts came out as he learnt what had been the provocation given what had been the feelings of scatcherd when he left the city determined to punish him who had ruined his sister his heart was changed those were trying days for him it behoved him to do what in him lay to cover his brothers memory from the obloquy which it deserved it behoved him also to save or to assist to save from undue punishment the unfortunate man who had shed his brothers blood and it behoved him also at least so he thought to look after that poor fallen one whose misfortunes were less merited than those either of his brother or of hers  and he was not the man to get through these things lightly or with as much ease as he perhaps might conscientiously have done he would pay for the defence of the prisoner he would pay for the defence of his brothers memory and he would pay for the poor girls comforts he would do this and he would allow no one to help him he stood alone in the world and insisted on so standing old mr thorne of ullathorne offered again to open his arms to him but he had conceived a foolish idea that his cousins severity had driven his brother on to his bad career and he would consequently accept no kindness from ullathorne miss thorne the old squires daughtera cousin considerably older than himself to whom he had at one time been much attachedsent him money and he returned it to her under a blank cover he had still enough for those unhappy purposes which he had in hand as to what might happen afterwards he was then mainly indifferent  the affair made much noise in the county and was inquired into closely by many of the county magistrates by none more closely than by john newbold gresham who was then alive mr gresham was greatly taken with the energy and justice shown by dr thorne on the occasion and when the trial was over he invited him to greshamsbury the visit ended in the doctor establishing himself in that village  we must return for a moment to mary scatcherd she was saved from the necessity of encountering her brothers wrath for that brother was under arrest for murder before he could get at her her immediate lot however was a cruel one deep as was her cause for anger against the man who had so inhumanly used her still it was natural that she should turn to him with love rather than with aversion to whom else could she in such plight look for love when therefore she heard that he was slain her heart sank within her she turned her face to the wall and laid herself down to die to die a double death for herself and the fatherless babe that was now quick within her  but in fact life had still much to offer both to her and to her child for her it was still destined that she should in a distant land be the worthy wife of a good husband and the happy mother of many children for that embryo one it was destinedbut that may not be so quickly told to describe her destiny this volume has yet to be written  even in those bitterest days god tempered the wind to the shorn lamb dr thorne was by her bedside soon after the bloody tidings had reached her and did for her more than either her lover or her brother could have done when the baby was born scatcherd was still in prison and had still three months more confinement to undergo the story of her great wrongs and cruel usage was much talked of and men said that one who had been so injured should be regarded as having in nowise sinned at all  one man at any rate so thought at twilight one evening thorne was surprised by a visit from a demure barchester hardware dealer whom he did not remember ever to have addressed before this was the former lover of poor mary scatcherd he had a proposal to make and it was thisif mary would consent to leave the country at once to leave it without notice from her brother or talk or éclat on the matter he would sell all that he had marry her and emigrate there was but one condition she must leave her baby behind her the hardwareman could find it in his heart to be generous to be generous and true to his love but he could not be generous enough to father the seducers child  i could never abide it sir if i took it said he and shewhy in course she would always love it the best  in praising his generosity who can mingle any censure for such manifest prudence he would still make her the wife of his bosom defiled in the eyes of the world as she had been but she must be to him the mother of his own children not the mother of anothers child  and now again our doctor had a hard task to win through he saw at once that it was his duty to use his utmost authority to induce the poor girl to accept such an offer she liked the man and here was opened to her a course which would have been most desirable even before her misfortune but it is hard to persuade a mother to part with her first babe harder perhaps when the babe had been so fathered and so born than when the world has shone brightly on its earliest hours she at first refused stoutly she sent a thousand loves a thousand thanks profusest acknowledgements for his generosity to the man who showed her that he loved her so well but nature she said would not let her leave her child  and what will you do for her here mary said the doctor poor mary replied to him with a deluge of tears  she is my niece said the doctor taking up the tiny infant in his huge hands she is already the nearest thing the only thing that i have in this world i am her uncle mary if you will go with this man i will be father to her and mother to her of what bread i eat she shall eat of what cup i drink she shall drink see mary here is the bible and he covered the book with his hand leave her to me and by this word she shall be my child  the mother consented at last left her baby with the doctor married and went to america all this was consummated before roger scatcherd was liberated from jail some conditions the doctor made the first was that scatcherd should not know his sisters child was thus disposed of dr thorne in undertaking to bring up the baby did not choose to encounter any tie with persons who might hereafter claim to be the girls relations on the other side relations she would undoubtedly have had none had she been left to live or die as a workhouse bastard but should the doctor succeed in life should he ultimately be able to make this girl the darling of his own house and then the darling of some other house should she live and win the heart of some man whom the doctor might delight to call his friend and nephew then relations might spring up whose ties would not be advantageous  no man plumed himself on good blood more than dr thorne no man had greater pride in his genealogical tree and his hundred and thirty clearly proved descents from macadam no man had a stronger theory as to the advantage held by men who have grandfathers over those who have none or have none worth talking about let it not be thought that our doctor was a perfect character no indeed most far from perfect he had within him an inner stubborn selfadmiring pride which made him believe himself to be better and higher than those around him and this from some unknown cause which he could hardly explain to himself he had a pride in being a poor man of a high family he had a pride in repudiating the very family of which he was proud and he had a special pride in keeping his pride silently to himself his father had been a thorne and his mother a thorold there was no better blood to be had in england it was in the possession of such properties as these that he condescended to rejoice this man with a mans heart a mans courage and a mans humanity other doctors round the county had ditchwater in their veins he could boast of a pure ichor to which that of the great omnium family was but a muddy puddle it was thus that he loved to excel his brother practitioners he who might have indulged in the pride of excelling them both in talent and in energy we speak now of his early days but even in his maturer life the man though mellowed was the same  this was the man who now promised to take to his bosom as his own child a poor bastard whose father was already dead and whose mothers family was such as the scatcherds it was necessary that the childs history should be known to none except to the mothers brother it was an object of interest to no one the mother had for some short time been talked of but now the ninedays wonder was a wonder no longer she went off to her faraway home her husbands generosity was duly chronicled in the papers and the babe was left untalked of and unknown  it was easy to explain to scatcherd that the child had not lived there was a parting interview between the brother and sister in the jail during which with real tears and unaffected sorrow the mother thus accounted for the offspring of her shame then she started fortunate in her coming fortunes and the doctor took with him his charge to the new country in which they were both to live there he found for her a fitting home till she should be old enough to sit at his table and live in his bachelor house and no one but old mr gresham knew who she was or whence she had come  then roger scatcherd having completed his six months confinement came out of prison  roger scatcherd though his hands were now red with blood was to be pitied a short time before the days of henry thornes death he had married a young wife in his own class of life and had made many resolves that henceforward his conduct should be such as might become a married man and might not disgrace the respectable brotherinlaw he was about to have given him such was his condition when he first heard of his sisters plight as has been said he filled himself with drink and started off on the scent of blood  during his prison days his wife had to support herself as she might the decent articles of furniture which they had put together were sold she gave up their little house and bowed down by misery she also was brought near to death when he was liberated he at once got work but those who have watched the lives of such people know how hard it is for them to recover lost ground she became a mother immediately after his liberation and when her child was born they were in direst want for scatcherd was again drinking and his resolves were blown to the wind  the doctor was then living at greshamsbury he had gone over there before the day on which he undertook the charge of poor marys baby and soon found himself settled as the greshamsbury doctor this occurred very soon after the birth of the young heir his predecessor in this career had bettered himself or endeavoured to do so by seeking the practice of some large town and lady arabella at a very critical time was absolutely left with no other advice than that of a stranger picked up as she declared to lady de courcy somewhere about barchester jail or barchester courthouse she did not know which  of course lady arabella could not suckle the young heir herself ladies arabella never can they are gifted with the powers of being mothers but not nursingmothers nature gives them bosoms for show but not for use so lady arabella had a wetnurse at the end of six months the new doctor found master frank was not doing quite so well as he should do and after a little trouble it was discovered that the very excellent young woman who had been sent express from courcy castle to greshamsburya supply being kept up on the lords demesne for the family usewas fond of brandy she was at once sent back to the castle of course and as lady de courcy was too much in dudgeon to send another dr thorne was allowed to procure one he thought of the misery of roger scatcherds wife thought also of her health and strength and active habits and thus mrs scatcherd became the fostermother to young frank gresham  one other episode we must tell of past times previous to his fathers death dr thorne was in love nor had he altogether sighed and pleaded in vain though it had not quite come to that that the young ladys friends or even the young lady herself had actually accepted his suit at that time his name stood well in barchester his father was a prebendary his cousins and his best friends were the thornes of ullathorne and the lady who shall be nameless was not thought to be injudicious in listening to the young doctor but when henry thorne went so far astray when the old doctor died when the young doctor quarrelled with ullathorne when the brother was killed in a disgraceful quarrel and it turned out that the physician had nothing but his profession and no settled locality in which to exercise it then indeed the young ladys friends thought that she was injudicious and the young lady herself had not spirit enough or love enough to be disobedient in those stormy days of the trial she told dr thorne that perhaps it would be wise that they should not see each other any more  dr thorne so counselled at such a momentso informed then when he most required comfort from his love at once swore loudly that he agreed with her he rushed forth with a bursting heart and said to himself that the world was bad all bad he saw the lady no more and if i am rightly informed never again made matrimonial overtures to any one     chapter iii  dr thorne   and thus dr thorne became settled for life in the little village of greshamsbury as was then the wont with many country practitioners and as should be the wont with them all if they consulted their own dignity a little less and the comforts of their customers somewhat more he added the business of a dispensing apothecary to that of physician in doing so he was of course much reviled many people around him declared that he could not truly be a doctor or at any rate a doctor to be so called and his brethren in the art living around him though they knew that his diplomas degrees and certificates were all en règle rather countenanced the report there was much about this newcomer which did not endear him to his own profession in the first place he was a newcomer and as such was of course to be regarded by other doctors as being de trop greshamsbury was only fifteen miles from barchester where there was a regular dépôt of medical skill and but eight from silverbridge where a properly established physician had been in residence for the last forty years dr thornes predecessor at greshamsbury had been a humbleminded general practitioner gifted with a due respect for the physicians of the county and he though he had been allowed to physic the servants and sometimes the children of greshamsbury had never had the presumption to put himself on a par with his betters  then also dr thorne though a graduated physician though entitled beyond all dispute to call himself a doctor according to all the laws of all the colleges made it known to the east barsetshire world very soon after he had seated himself at greshamsbury that his rate of pay was to be sevenandsixpence a visit within a circuit of five miles with a proportionally increased charge at proportionally increased distances now there was something low mean unprofessional and democratic in this so at least said the children of Æsculapius gathered together in conclave at barchester in the first place it showed that this thorne was always thinking of his money like an apothecary as he was whereas it would have behoved him as a physician had he had the feelings of a physician under his hat to have regarded his own pursuits in a purely philosophical spirit and to have taken any gain which might have accrued as an accidental adjunct to his station in life a physician should take his fee without letting his left hand know what his right hand was doing it should be taken without a thought without a look without a move of the facial muscles the true physician should hardly be aware that the last friendly grasp of the hand had been made more precious by the touch of gold whereas that fellow thorne would lug out half a crown from his breeches pocket and give it in change for a ten shilling piece and then it was clear that this man had no appreciation of the dignity of a learned profession he might constantly be seen compounding medicines in the shop at the left hand of his front door not making experiments philosophically in materia medica for the benefit of coming ageswhich if he did he should have done in the seclusion of his study far from profane eyesbut positively putting together common powders for rural bowels or spreading vulgar ointments for agricultural ailments  a man of this sort was not fit society for dr fillgrave of barchester that must be admitted and yet he had been found to be fit society for the old squire of greshamsbury whose shoeribbons dr fillgrave would not have objected to tie so high did the old squire stand in the county just previous to his death but the spirit of the lady arabella was known by the medical profession of barsetshire and when that good man died it was felt that thornes short tenure of greshamsbury favour was already over the barsetshire regulars were however doomed to disappointment our doctor had already contrived to endear himself to the heir and though there was not even then much personal love between him and the lady arabella he kept his place at the great house unmoved not only in the nursery and in the bedrooms but also at the squires diningtable  now there was in this it must be admitted quite enough to make him unpopular with his brethren and this feeling was soon shown in a marked and dignified manner dr fillgrave who had certainly the most respectable professional connexion in the county who had a reputation to maintain and who was accustomed to meet on almost equal terms the great medical baronets from the metropolis at the houses of the nobilitydr fillgrave declined to meet dr thorne in consultation he exceedingly regretted he said most exceedingly the necessity which he felt of doing so he had never before had to perform so painful a duty but as a duty which he owed to his profession he must perform it with every feeling of respect for lady  a sick guest at greshamsburyand for mr gresham he must decline to attend in conjunction with dr thorne if his services could be made available under any other circumstances he would go to greshamsbury as fast as posthorses could carry him  then indeed there was war in barsetshire if there was on dr thornes cranium one bump more developed than another it was that of combativeness not that the doctor was a bully or even pugnacious in the usual sense of the word he had no disposition to provoke a fight no propense love of quarrelling but there was that in him which would allow him to yield to no attack neither in argument nor in contest would he ever allow himself to be wrong never at least to any one but to himself and on behalf of his special hobbies he was ready to meet the world at large  it will therefore be understood that when such a gauntlet was thus thrown in his very teeth by dr fillgrave he was not slow to take it up he addressed a letter to the barsetshire conservative standard in which he attacked dr fillgrave with some considerable acerbity dr fillgrave responded in four lines saying that on mature consideration he had made up his mind not to notice any remarks that might be made on him by dr thorne in the public press the greshamsbury doctor then wrote another letter more witty and much more severe than the last and as this was copied into the bristol exeter and gloucester papers dr fillgrave found it very difficult to maintain the magnanimity of his reticence it is sometimes becoming enough for a man to wrap himself in the dignified toga of silence and proclaim himself indifferent to public attacks but it is a sort of dignity which it is very difficult to maintain as well might a man when stung to madness by wasps endeavour to sit in his chair without moving a muscle as endure with patience and without reply the courtesies of a newspaper opponent dr thorne wrote a third letter which was too much for medical flesh and blood to bear dr fillgrave answered it not indeed in his own name but in that of a brother doctor and then the war raged merrily it is hardly too much to say that dr fillgrave never knew another happy hour had he dreamed of what materials was made that young compounder of doses at greshamsbury he would have met him in consultation morning noon and night without objection but having begun the war he was constrained to go on with it his brethren would allow him no alternative thus he was continually being brought up to the fight as a prizefighter may be seen to be who is carried up round after round without any hope on his own part and who in each round drops to the ground before the very wind of his opponents blows  but dr fillgrave though thus weak himself was backed in practice and in countenance by nearly all his brethren in the county the guinea fee the principle of giving advice and of selling no medicine the great resolve to keep a distinct barrier between the physician and the apothecary and above all the hatred of the contamination of a bill were strong in the medical mind of barsetshire dr thorne had the provincial medical world against him and so he appealed to the metropolis the lancet took the matter up in his favour but the journal of medical science was against him the weekly chirurgeon noted for its medical democracy upheld him as a medical prophet but the scalping knife a monthly periodical got up in dead opposition to the lancet showed him no mercy so the war went on and our doctor to a certain extent became a noted character  he had moreover other difficulties to encounter in his professional career it was something in his favour that he understood his business something that he was willing to labour at it with energy and resolved to labour at it conscientiously he had also other gifts such as conversational brilliancy an aptitude for true good fellowship firmness in friendship and general honesty of disposition which stood him in stead as he advanced in life but at his first starting much that belonged to himself personally was against him let him enter what house he would he entered it with a conviction often expressed to himself that he was equal as a man to the proprietor equal as a human being to the proprietress to age he would allow deference and to special recognised talentat least so he said to rank also he would pay that respect which was its clear and recognised prerogative he would let a lord walk out of a room before him if he did not happen to forget it in speaking to a duke he would address him as his grace and he would in no way assume a familiarity with bigger men than himself allowing to the bigger man the privilege of making the first advances but beyond this he would admit that no man should walk the earth with his head higher than his own  he did not talk of these things much he offended no rank by boasts of his own equality he did not absolutely tell the earl de courcy in words that the privilege of dining at courcy castle was to him no greater than the privilege of dining at courcy parsonage but there was that in his manner that told it the feeling in itself was perhaps good and was certainly much justified by the manner in which he bore himself to those below him in rank but there was folly in the resolution to run counter to the worlds recognised rules on such matters and much absurdity in his mode of doing so seeing that at heart he was a thorough conservative it is hardly too much to say that he naturally hated a lord at first sight but nevertheless he would have expended his means his blood and spirit in fighting for the upper house of parliament  such a disposition until it was thoroughly understood did not tend to ingratiate him with the wives of the country gentlemen among whom he had to look for practice and then also there was not much in his individual manner to recommend him to the favour of ladies he was brusque authoritative given to contradiction rough though never dirty in his personal belongings and inclined to indulge in a sort of quiet raillery which sometimes was not thoroughly understood people did not always know whether he was laughing at them or with them and some people were perhaps inclined to think that a doctor should not laugh at all when called in to act doctorially  when he was known indeed when the core of the fruit had been reached when the huge proportions of that loving trusting heart had been learned and understood and appreciated when that honesty had been recognised that manly and almost womanly tenderness had been felt then indeed the doctor was acknowledged to be adequate in his profession to trifling ailments he was too often brusque seeing that he accepted money for the cure of such he should we may say have cured them without an offensive manner so far he is without defence but to real suffering no one found him brusque no patient lying painfully on a bed of sickness ever thought him rough  another misfortune was that he was a bachelor ladies think and i for one think that ladies are quite right in so thinking that doctors should be married men all the world feels that a man when married acquires some of the attributes of an old womanhe becomes to a certain extent a motherly sort of being he acquires a conversance with womens ways and womens wants and loses the wilder and offensive sparks of his virility it must be easier to talk to such a one about matildas stomach and the growing pains in fannys legs than to a young bachelor this impediment also stood much in dr thornes way during his first years at greshamsbury  but his wants were not at first great and though his ambition was perhaps high it was not of an impatient nature the world was his oyster but circumstanced as he was he knew that it was not for him to open it with his lancet all at once he had bread to earn which he must earn wearily he had a character to make which must come slowly it satisfied his soul that in addition to his immortal hopes he had a possible future in this world to which he could look forward with clear eyes and advance with a heart that would know no fainting  on his first arrival at greshamsbury he had been put by the squire into a house which he still occupied when that squires grandson came of age there were two decent commodious private houses in the villagealways excepting the rectory which stood grandly in its own grounds and therefore was considered as ranking above the village residencesof these two dr thorne had the smaller they stood exactly at the angle before described on the outer side of it and at right angles to each other they both possessed good stables and ample gardens and it may be as well to specify that mr umbleby the agent and lawyer to the estate occupied the larger one  here dr thorne lived for eleven or twelve years all alone and then for ten or eleven more with his niece mary thorne mary was thirteen when she came to take up permanent abode as mistress of the establishmentor at any rate to act as the only mistress which the establishment possessed this advent greatly changed the tenor of the doctors ways he had been before pure bachelor not a room in his house had been comfortably furnished he at first commenced in a makeshift sort of way because he had not at his command the means of commencing otherwise and he had gone on in the same fashion because the exact time had never come at which it was imperative in him to set his house in order he had had no fixed hour for his meals no fixed place for his books no fixed wardrobe for his clothes he had a few bottles of good wine in his cellar and occasionally asked a brother bachelor to take a chop with him but beyond this he had touched very little on the cares of housekeeping a slopbowl full of strong tea together with bread and butter and eggs was produced for him in the morning and he expected that at whatever hour he might arrive in the evening some food should be presented to him wherewith to satisfy the cravings of nature if in addition to this he had another slopbowl of tea in the evening he got all that he ever required or all at least that he ever demanded  but when mary came or rather when she was about to come things were altogether changed at the doctors people had hitherto wonderedand especially mrs umblebyhow a gentleman like dr thorne could continue to live in so slovenly a manner and how people again wondered and again especially mrs umbleby how the doctor could possibly think it necessary to put such a lot of furniture into a house because a little chit of a girl of twelve years of age was coming to live with him  mrs umbleby had great scope for her wonder the doctor made a thorough revolution in his household and furnished his house from the ground to the roof completely he paintedfor the first time since the commencement of his tenancyhe papered he carpeted and curtained and mirrored and linened and blanketed as though a mrs thorne with a good fortune were coming home tomorrow and all for a girl of twelve years old and how said mrs umbleby to her friend miss gushing how did he find out what to buy as though the doctor had been brought up like a wild beast ignorant of the nature of tables and chairs and with no more developed ideas of drawingroom drapery than an hippopotamus  to the utter amazement of mrs umbleby and miss gushing the doctor did it all very well he said nothing about it to any onehe never did say much about such thingsbut he furnished his house well and discreetly and when mary thorne came home from her school at bath to which she had been taken some six years previously she found herself called upon to be the presiding genius of a perfect paradise  it has been said that the doctor had managed to endear himself to the new squire before the old squires death and that therefore the change at greshamsbury had had no professional ill effects upon him such was the case at the time but nevertheless all did not go smoothly in the greshamsbury medical department there was six or seven years difference in age between mr gresham and the doctor and moreover mr gresham was young for his age and the doctor old but nevertheless there was a very close attachment between them early in life this was never thoroughly sundered and backed by this the doctor did maintain himself for some years before the fire of lady arabellas artillery but drops falling if they fall constantly will bore through a stone  dr thornes pretensions mixed with his subversive professional democratic tendencies his sevenandsixpenny visits added to his utter disregard of lady arabellas airs were too much for her spirit he brought frank through his first troubles and that at first ingratiated her he was equally successful with the early dietary of augusta and beatrice but as his success was obtained in direct opposition to the courcy castle nursery principles this hardly did much in his favour when the third daughter was born he at once declared that she was a very weakly flower and sternly forbade the mother to go to london the mother loving her babe obeyed but did not the less hate the doctor for the order which she firmly believed was given at the instance and express dictation of mr gresham then another little girl came into the world and the doctor was more imperative than ever as to the nursery rules and the excellence of country air quarrels were thus engendered and lady arabella was taught to believe that this doctor of her husbands was after all no solomon in her husbands absence she sent for dr fillgrave giving very express intimation that he would not have to wound either his eyes or dignity by encountering his enemy and she found dr fillgrave a great comfort to her  then dr thorne gave mr gresham to understand that under such circumstances he could not visit professionally at greshamsbury any longer the poor squire saw there was no help for it and though he still maintained his friendly connexion with his neighbour the sevenandsixpenny visits were at an end dr fillgrave from barchester and the gentleman at silverbridge divided the responsibility between them and the nursery principles of courcy castle were again in vogue at greshamsbury  so things went on for years and those years were years of sorrow we must not ascribe to our doctors enemies the sufferings and sickness and deaths that occurred the four frail little ones that died would probably have been taken had lady arabella been more tolerant of dr thorne but the fact was that they did die and that the mothers heart then got the better of the womans pride and lady arabella humbled herself before dr thorne she humbled herself or would have done so had the doctor permitted her but he with his eyes full of tears stopped the utterance of her apology took her two hands in his pressed them warmly and assured her that his joy in returning would be great for the love that he bore to all that belonged to greshamsbury and so the sevenandsixpenny visits were recommenced and the great triumph of dr fillgrave came to an end  great was the joy in the greshamsbury nursery when the second change took place among the doctors attributes not hitherto mentioned was an aptitude for the society of children he delighted to talk to children and to play with them he would carry them on his back three or four at a time roll with them on the ground race with them in the garden invent games for them contrive amusements in circumstances which seemed quite adverse to all manner of delight and above all his physic was not nearly so nasty as that which came from silverbridge  he had a great theory as to the happiness of children and though he was not disposed altogether to throw over the precepts of solomonalways bargaining that he should under no circumstances be himself the executionerhe argued that the principal duty which a parent owed to a child was to make him happy not only was the man to be made happythe future man if that might be possiblebut the existing boy was to be treated with equal favour and his happiness so said the doctor was of much easier attainment  why struggle after future advantage at the expense of present pain seeing that the results were so very doubtful many an opponent of the doctor had thought to catch him on the hip when so singular a doctrine was broached but they were not always successful what said his sensible enemies is johnny not to be taught to read because he does not like it johnny must read by all means would the doctor answer but is it necessary that he should not like it if the preceptor have it in him may not johnny learn not only to read but to like to learn to read  but would say his enemies children must be controlled and so must men also would say the doctor i must not steal your peaches nor make love to your wife nor libel your character much as i might wish through my natural depravity to indulge in such vices i am debarred from them without pain and i may almost say without unhappiness  and so the argument went on neither party convincing the other but in the meantime the children of the neighbourhood became very fond of dr thorne  dr thorne and the squire were still fast friends but circumstances had occurred spreading themselves now over a period of many years which almost made the poor squire uneasy in the doctors company mr gresham owed a large sum of money and he had moreover already sold a portion of his property unfortunately it had been the pride of the greshams that their acres had descended from one to another without an entail so that each possessor of greshamsbury had had the full power to dispose of the property as he pleased any doubt as to its going to the male heir had never hitherto been felt it had occasionally been encumbered by charges for younger children but these charges had been liquidated and the property had come down without any burden to the present squire now a portion of this had been sold and it had been sold to a certain degree through the agency of dr thorne  this made the squire an unhappy man no man loved his family name and honour his old family blazon and standing more thoroughly than he did he was every whit a gresham at heart but his spirit had been weaker than that of his forefathers and in his days for the first time the greshams were to go to the wall ten years before the beginning of our story it had been necessary to raise a large sum of money to meet and pay off pressing liabilities and it was found that this could be done with more material advantage by selling a portion of the property than in any other way a portion of it about a third of the whole in value was accordingly sold  boxall hill lay halfway between greshamsbury and barchester and was known as having the best partridge shooting in the county as having on it also a celebrated fox cover boxall gorse held in very high repute by barsetshire sportsmen there was no residence on the immediate estate and it was altogether divided from the remainder of the greshamsbury property this with many inward and outward groans mr gresham permitted to be sold  it was sold and sold well by private contract to a native of barchester who having risen from the worlds ranks had made for himself great wealth somewhat of this mans character must hereafter be told it will suffice to say that he relied for advice in money matters upon dr thorne and that at dr thornes suggestion he had purchased boxall hill partridgeshooting and gorse cover all included he had not only bought boxall hill but had subsequently lent the squire large sums of money on mortgage in all which transactions the doctor had taken part it had therefore come to pass that mr gresham was not unfrequently called upon to discuss his money affairs with dr thorne and occasionally to submit to lectures and advice which might perhaps as well have been omitted  so much for dr thorne a few words must still be said about miss mary before we rush into our story the crust will then have been broken and the pie will be open to the guests little miss mary was kept at a farmhouse till she was six she was then sent to school at bath and transplanted to the doctors newly furnished house a little more than six years after that it must not be supposed that he had lost sight of his charge during her earlier years he was much too well aware of the nature of the promise which he had made to the departing mother to do that he had constantly visited his little niece and long before the first twelve years of her life were over had lost all consciousness of his promise and of his duty to the mother in the stronger ties of downright personal love for the only creature that belonged to him  when mary came home the doctor was like a child in his glee he prepared surprises for her with as much forethought and trouble as though he were contriving mines to blow up an enemy he took her first into the shop and then into the kitchen thence to the diningrooms after that to his and her bedrooms and so on till he came to the full glory of the new drawingroom enhancing the pleasure by little jokes and telling her that he should never dare to come into the last paradise without her permission and not then till he had taken off his boots child as she was she understood the joke and carried it on like a little queen and so they soon became the firmest of friends  but though mary was a queen it was still necessary that she should be educated those were the earlier days in which lady arabella had humbled herself and to show her humility she invited mary to share the musiclessons of augusta and beatrice at the great house a musicmaster from barchester came over three times a week and remained for three hours and if the doctor chose to send his girl over she could pick up what was going on without doing any harm so said the lady arabella the doctor with many thanks and with no hesitation accepted the offer merely adding that he had perhaps better settle separately with signor cantabili the musicmaster he was very much obliged to lady arabella for giving his little girl permission to join her lessons to those of the miss greshams  it need hardly be said that the lady arabella was on fire at once settle with signor cantabili no indeed she would do that there must be no expense whatever incurred in such an arrangement on miss thornes account but here as in most things the doctor carried his point it being the time of the ladys humility she could not make as good a fight as she would otherwise have done and thus she found to her great disgust that mary thorne was learning music in her schoolroom on equal terms as regarded payment with her own daughters the arrangement having been made could not be broken especially as the young lady in nowise made herself disagreeable and more especially as the miss greshams themselves were very fond of her  and so mary thorne learnt music at greshamsbury and with her music she learnt other things also how to behave herself among girls of her own age how to speak and talk as other young ladies do how to dress herself and how to move and walk all which she being quick to learn learnt without trouble at the great house something also she learnt of french seeing that the greshamsbury french governess was always in the room  and then some few years later there came a rector and a rectors sister and with the latter mary studied german and french also from the doctor himself she learnt much the choice namely of english books for her own reading and habits of thought somewhat akin to his own though modified by the feminine softness of her individual mind  and so mary thorne grew up and was educated of her personal appearance it certainly is my business as an author to say something she is my heroine and as such must necessarily be very beautiful but in truth her mind and inner qualities are more clearly distinct to my brain than her outward form and features i know that she was far from being tall and far from being showy that her feet and hands were small and delicate that her eyes were bright when looked at but not brilliant so as to make their brilliancy palpably visible to all around her her hair was dark brown and worn very plainly brushed from her forehead her lips were thin and her mouth perhaps in general inexpressive but when she was eager in conversation it would show itself to be animated with curves of wondrous energy and quiet as she was in manner sober and demure as was her usual settled appearance she could talk when the fit came on her with an energy which in truth surprised those who did not know her aye and sometimes those who did energy nay it was occasionally a concentration of passion which left her for the moment perfectly unconscious of all other cares but solicitude for that subject which she might then be advocating  all her friends including the doctor had at times been made unhappy by this vehemence of character but yet it was to that very vehemence that she owed it that all her friends so loved her it had once nearly banished her in early years from the greshamsbury schoolroom and yet it ended in making her claim to remain there so strong that lady arabella could no longer oppose it even when she had the wish to do so  a new french governess had lately come to greshamsbury and was or was to be a great pet with lady arabella having all the great gifts with which a governess can be endowed and being also a protégée from the castle the castle in greshamsbury parlance always meant that of courcy soon after this a valued little locket belonging to augusta gresham was missing the french governess had objected to its being worn in the schoolroom and it had been sent up to the bedroom by a young servantgirl the daughter of a small farmer on the estate the locket was missing and after a while a considerable noise in the matter having been made was found by the diligence of the governess somewhere among the belongings of the english servant great was the anger of lady arabella loud were the protestations of the girl mute the woe of her father piteous the tears of her mother inexorable the judgment of the greshamsbury world but something occurred it matters now not what to separate mary thorne in opinion from that world at large out she then spoke and to her face accused the governess of the robbery for two days mary was in disgrace almost as deep as that of the farmers daughter but she was neither quiet nor dumb in her disgrace when lady arabella would not hear her she went to mr gresham she forced her uncle to move in the matter she gained over to her side one by one the potentates of the parish and ended by bringing mamselle larron down on her knees with a confession of the facts from that time mary thorne was dear to the tenantry of greshamsbury and specially dear at one small household where a roughspoken father of a family was often heard to declare that for miss mary thorne hed face man or magistrate duke or devil  and so mary thorne grew up under the doctors eye and at the beginning of our tale she was one of the guests assembled at greshamsbury on the coming of age of the heir she herself having then arrived at the same period of her life     chapter iv  lessons from courcy castle   it was the first of july young frank greshams birthday and the london season was not yet over nevertheless lady de courcy had managed to get down into the country to grace the coming of age of the heir bringing with her all the ladies amelia rosina margaretta and alexandrina together with such of the honourable johns and georges as could be collected for the occasion  the lady arabella had contrived this year to spend ten weeks in town which by a little stretching she made to pass for the season and had managed moreover at last to refurnish not ingloriously the portman square drawingroom she had gone up to london under the pretext imperatively urged of augustas teethyoung ladies teeth are not unfrequently of value in this wayand having received authority for a new carpet which was really much wanted had made such dexterous use of that sanction as to run up an upholsterers bill of six or seven hundred pounds she had of course had her carriage and horses the girls of course had gone out it had been positively necessary to have a few friends in portman square and altogether the ten weeks had not been unpleasant and not inexpensive  for a few confidential minutes before dinner lady de courcy and her sisterinlaw sat together in the latters dressingroom discussing the unreasonableness of the squire who had expressed himself with more than ordinary bitterness as to the follyhe had probably used some stronger wordof these london proceedings  heavens said the countess with much eager animation what can the man expect what does he wish you to do  he would like to sell the house in london and bury us all here for ever mind i was there only for ten weeks  barely time for the girls to get their teeth properly looked at but arabella what does he say lady de courcy was very anxious to learn the exact truth of the matter and ascertain if she could whether mr gresham was really as poor as he pretended to be  why he said yesterday that he would have no more going to town at all that he was barely able to pay the claims made on him and keep up the house here and that he would not  would not what asked the countess  why he said that he would not utterly ruin poor frank  ruin frank  thats what he said  but surely arabella it is not so bad as that what possible reason can there be for him to be in debt  he is always talking of those elections  but my dear boxall hill paid all that off of course frank will not have such an income as there was when you married into the family we all know that and whom will he have to thank but his father but boxall hill paid all those debts and why should there be any difficulty now  it was those nasty dogs rosina said the lady arabella almost in tears  well i for one never approved of the hounds coming to greshamsbury when a man has once involved his property he should not incur any expenses that are not absolutely necessary that is a golden rule which mr gresham ought to have remembered indeed i put it to him nearly in those very words but mr gresham never did and never will receive with common civility anything that comes from me  i know rosina he never did and yet where would he have been but for the de courcys so exclaimed in her gratitude the lady arabella to speak the truth however but for the de courcys mr gresham might have been at this moment on the top of boxall hill monarch of all he surveyed  as i was saying continued the countess i never approved of the hounds coming to greshamsbury but yet my dear the hounds cant have eaten up everything a man with ten thousand a year ought to be able to keep hounds particularly as he had a subscription  he says the subscription was little or nothing  thats nonsense my dear now arabella what does he do with his money thats the question does he gamble  well said lady arabella very slowly i dont think he does if the squire did gamble he must have done it very slyly for he rarely went away from greshamsbury and certainly very few men looking like gamblers were in the habit of coming thither as guests i dont think he does gamble lady arabella put her emphasis on the word gamble as though her husband if he might perhaps be charitably acquitted of that vice was certainly guilty of every other known in the civilised world  i know he used said lady de courcy looking very wise and rather suspicious she certainly had sufficient domestic reasons for disliking the propensity i know he used and when a man begins he is hardly ever cured  well if he does i dont know it said the lady arabella  the money my dear must go somewhere what excuse does he give when you tell him you want this and thatall the common necessaries of life that you have always been used to  he gives no excuse sometimes he says the family is so large  nonsense girls cost nothing theres only frank and he cant have cost anything yet can he be saving money to buy back boxall hill  oh no said the lady arabella quickly he is not saving anything he never did and never will save though he is so stingy to me he is hard pushed for money i know that  then where has it gone said the countess de courcy with a look of stern decision  heaven only knows now augusta is to be married i must of course have a few hundred pounds you should have heard how he groaned when i asked him for it heaven only knows where the money goes and the injured wife wiped a piteous tear from her eye with her fine dress cambric handkerchief i have all the sufferings and privations of a poor mans wife but i have none of the consolations he has no confidence in me he never tells me anything he never talks to me about his affairs if he talks to any one it is to that horrid doctor  what dr thorne now the countess de courcy hated dr thorne with a holy hatred  yes dr thorne i believe that he knows everything and advises everything too whatever difficulties poor gresham may have i do believe dr thorne has brought them about i do believe it rosina  well that is surprising mr gresham with all his faults is a gentleman and how he can talk about his affairs with a low apothecary like that i for one cannot imagine lord de courcy has not always been to me all that he should have been far from it and lady de courcy thought over in her mind injuries of a much graver description than any that her sisterinlaw had ever suffered but i have never known anything like that at courcy castle surely umbleby knows all about it doesnt he  not half so much as the doctor said lady arabella  the countess shook her head slowly the idea of mr gresham a country gentleman of good estate like him making a confidant of a country doctor was too great a shock for her nerves and for a while she was constrained to sit silent before she could recover herself  one thing at any rate is certain arabella said the countess as soon as she found herself again sufficiently composed to offer counsel in a properly dictatorial manner one thing at any rate is certain if mr gresham be involved so deeply as you say frank has but one duty before him he must marry money the heir of fourteen thousand a year may indulge himself in looking for blood as mr gresham did my dearit must be understood that there was very little compliment in this as the lady arabella had always conceived herself to be a beautyor for beauty as some men do continued the countess thinking of the choice that the present earl de courcy had made but frank must marry money i hope he will understand this early do make him understand this before he makes a fool of himself when a man thoroughly understands this when he knows what his circumstances require why the matter becomes easy to him i hope that frank understands that he has no alternative in his position he must marry money  but alas alas frank gresham had already made a fool of himself  well my boy i wish you joy with all my heart said the honourable john slapping his cousin on the back as he walked round to the stableyard with him before dinner to inspect a setter puppy of peculiarly fine breed which had been sent to frank as a birthday present i wish i were an elder son but we cant all have that luck  who wouldnt sooner be the younger son of an earl than the eldest son of a plain squire said frank wishing to say something civil in return for his cousins civility  i wouldnt for one said the honourable john what chance have i theres porlock as strong as a horse and then george comes next and the governors good for these twenty years and the young man sighed as he reflected what small hope there was that all those who were nearest and dearest to him should die out of his way and leave him to the sweet enjoyment of an earls coronet and fortune now youre sure of your game some day and as youve no brothers i suppose the squirell let you do pretty well what you like besides hes not so strong as my governor though hes younger  frank had never looked at his fortune in this light before and was so slow and green that he was not much delighted at the prospect now that it was offered to him he had always however been taught to look to his cousins the de courcys as men with whom it would be very expedient that he should be intimate he therefore showed no offence but changed the conversation  shall you hunt with the barsetshire this season john i hope you will i shall  well i dont know its very slow its all tillage here or else woodland i rather fancy i shall go to leicestershire when the partridgeshooting is over what sort of a lot do you mean to come out with frank  frank became a little red as he answered oh i shall have two he said that is the mare i have had these two years and the horse my father gave me this morning  what only those two and the mare is nothing more than a pony  she is fifteen hands said frank offended  well frank i certainly would not stand that said the honourable john what go out before the county with one untrained horse and a pony and you the heir to greshamsbury  ill have him so trained before november said frank that nothing in barsetshire shall stop him peter sayspeter was the greshamsbury studgroomthat he tucks up his hind legs beautifully  but who the deuce would think of going to work with one horse or two either if you insist on calling the old pony a huntress ill put you up to a trick my lad if you stand that youll stand anything and if you dont mean to go in leadingstrings all your life now is the time to show it theres young bakerharry baker you knowhe came of age last year and he has as pretty a string of nags as any one would wish to set eyes on four hunters and a hack now if old baker has four thousand a year its every shilling he has got  this was true and frank gresham who in the morning had been made so happy by his fathers present of a horse began to feel that hardly enough had been done for him it was true that mr baker had only four thousand a year but it was also true that he had no other child than harry baker that he had no great establishment to keep up that he owed a shilling to no one and also that he was a great fool in encouraging a mere boy to ape all the caprices of a man of wealth nevertheless for a moment frank gresham did feel that considering his position he was being treated rather unworthily  take the matter in your own hands frank said the honourable john seeing the impression that he had made of course the governor knows very well that you wont put up with such a stable as that lord bless you i have heard that when he married my aunt and that was when he was about your age he had the best stud in the whole county and then he was in parliament before he was threeandtwenty  his father you know died when he was very young said frank  yes i know he had a stroke of luck that doesnt fall to everyone but  young franks face grew dark now instead of red when his cousin submitted to him the necessity of having more than two horses for his own use he could listen to him but when the same monitor talked of the chance of a fathers death as a stroke of luck frank was too much disgusted to be able to pretend to pass it over with indifference what was he thus to think of his father whose face was always lighted up with pleasure when his boy came near to him and so rarely bright at any other time frank had watched his father closely enough to be aware of this he knew how his father delighted in him he had had cause to guess that his father had many troubles and that he strove hard to banish the memory of them when his son was with him he loved his father truly purely and thoroughly liked to be with him and would be proud to be his confidant could he then listen quietly while his cousin spoke of the chance of his fathers death as a stroke of luck  i shouldnt think it a stroke of luck john i should think it the greatest misfortune in the world  it is so difficult for a young man to enumerate sententiously a principle of morality or even an expression of ordinary good feeling without giving himself something of a ridiculous air without assuming something of a mock grandeur  oh of course my dear fellow said the honourable john laughing thats a matter of course we all understand that without saying it porlock of course would feel exactly the same about the governor but if the governor were to walk i think porlock would console himself with the thirty thousand a year  i dont know what porlock would do hes always quarrelling with my uncle i know i only spoke of myself i never quarrelled with my father and i hope i never shall  all right my lad of wax all right i dare say you wont be tried but if you are youll find before six months are over that its a very nice thing to master of greshamsbury  im sure i shouldnt find anything of the kind  very well so be it you wouldnt do as young hatherly did at hatherly court in gloucestershire when his father kicked the bucket you know hatherly dont you  no i never saw him  hes sir frederick now and has or had one of the finest fortunes in england for a commoner the most of it is gone now well when he heard of his governors death he was in paris but he went off to hatherly as fast as special train and posthorses would carry him and got there just in time for the funeral as he came back to hatherly court from the church they were putting up the hatchment over the door and master fred saw that the undertakers had put at the bottom resurgam you know what that means  oh yes said frank  ill come back again said the honourable john construing the latin for the benefit of his cousin no said fred hatherly looking up at the hatchment im blessed if you do old gentleman that would be too much of a joke ill take care of that so he got up at night and he got some fellows with him and they climbed up and painted out resurgam and they painted into its place requiescat in pace which means you know youd a great deal better stay where you are now i call that good fred hatherly did that as sure asas sure asas sure as anything  frank could not help laughing at the story especially at his cousins mode of translating the undertakers mottoes and then they sauntered back from the stables into the house to dress for dinner  dr thorne had come to the house somewhat before dinnertime at mr greshams request and was now sitting with the squire in his own bookroomso calledwhile mary was talking to some of the girls upstairs  i must have ten or twelve thousand pounds ten at the very least said the squire who was sitting in his usual armchair close to his littered table with his head supported on his hand looking very unlike the father of an heir of a noble property who had that day come of age  it was the first of july and of course there was no fire in the grate but nevertheless the doctor was standing with his back to the fireplace with his coattails over his arms as though he were engaged now in summer as he so often was in winter in talking and roasting his hinder person at the same time  twelve thousand pounds its a very large sum of money  i said ten said the squire  ten thousand pounds is a very large sum of money there is no doubt hell let you have it scatcherd will let you have it but i know hell expect to have the title deeds  what for ten thousand pounds said the squire there is not a registered debt against the property but his own and armstrongs  but his own is very large already  armstrongs is nothing about fourandtwenty thousand pounds  yes but he comes first mr gresham  well what of that to hear you talk one would think that there was nothing left of greshamsbury whats fourandtwenty thousand pounds does scatcherd know what rentroll is  oh yes he knows it well enough i wish he did not  well then why does he make such a bother about a few thousand pounds the titledeeds indeed  what he means is that he must have ample security to cover what he has already advanced before he goes on i wish to goodness you had no further need to borrow i did think that things were settled last year  oh if theres any difficulty umbleby will get it for me  yes and what will you have to pay for it  id sooner pay double than be talked to in this way said the squire angrily and as he spoke he got up hurriedly from his chair thrust his hands into his trouserspockets walked quickly to the window and immediately walking back again threw himself once more into his chair  there are some things a man cannot bear doctor said he beating the devils tattoo on the floor with one of his feet though god knows i ought to be patient now for i am made to bear a good many things you had better tell scatcherd that i am obliged to him for his offer but that i will not trouble him  the doctor during this little outburst had stood quite silent with his back to the fireplace and his coattails hanging over his arms but though his voice said nothing his face said much he was very unhappy he was greatly grieved to find that the squire was so soon again in want of money and greatly grieved also to find that this want had made him so bitter and unjust mr gresham had attacked him but as he was determined not to quarrel with mr gresham he refrained from answering  the squire also remained silent for a few minutes but he was not endowed with the gift of silence and was soon as it were compelled to speak again  poor frank said he i could yet be easy about everything if it were not for the injury i have done him poor frank  the doctor advanced a few paces from off the rug and taking his hand out of his pocket he laid it gently on the squires shoulder frank will do very well yet said the he it is not absolutely necessary that a man should have fourteen thousand pounds a year to be happy  my father left me the property entire and i should leave it entire to my sonbut you dont understand this  the doctor did understand the feeling fully the fact on the other hand was that long as he had known him the squire did not understand the doctor  i would you could mr gresham said the doctor so that your mind might be happier but that cannot be and therefore i say again that frank will do very well yet although he will not inherit fourteen thousand pounds a year and i would have you say the same thing to yourself  ah you dont understand it persisted the squire you dont know how a man feels when heah well its no use my troubling you with what cannot be mended i wonder whether umbleby is about the place anywhere  the doctor was again standing with his back against the chimneypiece and with his hands in his pockets  you did not see umbleby as you came in again asked the squire  no i did not and if you will take my advice you will not see him now at any rate with reference to this money  i tell you i must get it from someone you say scatcherd wont let me have it  no mr gresham i did not say that  well you said what was as bad augusta is to be married in september and the money must be had i have agreed to give moffat six thousand pounds and he is to have the money down in hard cash  six thousand pounds said the doctor well i suppose that is not more than your daughter should have but then five times six are thirty thirty thousand pounds will be a large sum to make up  the father thought to himself that his younger girls were but children and that the trouble of arranging their marriage portions might well be postponed a while sufficient for the day is the evil thereof  that moffat is a griping hungry fellow said the squire i suppose augusta likes him and as regards money it is a good match  if miss gresham loves him that is everything i am not in love with him myself but then i am not a young lady  the de courcys are very fond of him lady de courcy says that he is a perfect gentleman and thought very much of in london  oh if lady de courcy says that of course its all right said the doctor with a quiet sarcasm that was altogether thrown away on the squire  the squire did not like any of the de courcys especially he did not like lady de courcy but still he was accessible to a certain amount of gratification in the near connexion which he had with the earl and countess and when he wanted to support his family greatness would sometimes weakly fall back upon the grandeur of courcy castle it was only when talking to his wife that he invariably snubbed the pretensions of his noble relatives  the two men after this remained silent for a while and then the doctor renewing the subject for which he had been summoned into the bookroom remarked that as scatcherd was now in the countryhe did not say was now at boxall hill as he did not wish to wound the squires earsperhaps he had better go and see him and ascertain in what way this affair of the money might be arranged there was no doubt he said that scatcherd would supply the sum required at a lower rate of interest than that at which it could be procured through umblebys means  very well said the squire ill leave it in your hands then i think ten thousand pounds will do and now ill dress for dinner and then the doctor left him  perhaps the reader will suppose after this that the doctor had some pecuniary interest of his own in arranging the squires loans or at any rate he will think that the squire must have so thought not in the least neither had he any such interest nor did the squire think that he had any what dr thorne did in this matter the squire well knew was done for love but the squire of greshamsbury was a great man at greshamsbury and it behoved him to maintain the greatness of his squirehood when discussing his affairs with the village doctor so much he had at any rate learnt from his contact with the de courcys  and the doctorproud arrogant contradictory headstrong as he waswhy did he bear to be thus snubbed because he knew that the squire of greshamsbury when struggling with debt and poverty required an indulgence for his weakness had mr gresham been in easy circumstances the doctor would by no means have stood so placidly with his hands in his pockets and have had mr umbleby thus thrown in his teeth the doctor loved the squire loved him as his own oldest friend but he loved him ten times better as being in adversity than he could ever have done had things gone well at greshamsbury in his time  while this was going on downstairs mary was sitting upstairs with beatrice gresham in the schoolroom the old schoolroom so called was now a sittingroom devoted to the use of the grownup young ladies of the family whereas one of the old nurseries was now the modern schoolroom mary well knew her way to the sanctum and without asking any questions walked up to it when her uncle went to the squire on entering the room she found that augusta and the lady alexandrina were also there and she hesitated for a moment at the door  come in mary said beatrice you know my cousin alexandrina mary came in and having shaken hands with her two friends was bowing to the lady when the lady condescended put out her noble hand and touched miss thornes fingers  beatrice was marys friend and many heartburnings and much mental solicitude did that young lady give to her mother by indulging in such a friendship but beatrice with some faults was true at heart and she persisted in loving mary thorne in spite of the hints which her mother so frequently gave as to the impropriety of such an affection  nor had augusta any objection to the society of miss thorne augusta was a strongminded girl with much of the de courcy arrogance but quite as well inclined to show it in opposition to her mother as in any other form to her alone in the house did lady arabella show much deference she was now going to make a suitable match with a man of large fortune who had been procured for her as an eligible parti by her aunt the countess she did not pretend had never pretended that she loved mr moffat but she knew she said that in the present state of her fathers affairs such a match was expedient mr moffat was a young man of very large fortune in parliament inclined to business and in every way recommendable he was not a man of birth to be sure that was to be lamentedin confessing that mr moffat was not a man of birth augusta did not go so far as to admit that he was the son of a tailor such however was the rigid truth in this matterhe was not a man of birth that was to be lamented but in the present state of affairs at greshamsbury she understood well that it was her duty to postpone her own feelings in some respect mr moffat would bring fortune she would bring blood and connexion and as she so said her bosom glowed with strong pride to think that she would be able to contribute so much more towards the proposed future partnership than her husband would do  twas thus that miss gresham spoke of her match to her dear friends her cousins the de courcys for instance to miss oriel her sister beatrice and even to mary thorne she had no enthusiasm she admitted but she thought she had good judgment she thought she had shown good judgment in accepting mr moffats offer though she did not pretend to any romance of affection and having so said she went to work with considerable mental satisfaction choosing furniture carriages and clothes not extravagantly as her mother would have done not in deference to sterner dictates of the latest fashion as her aunt would have done with none of the girlish glee in new purchases which beatrice would have felt but with sound judgment she bought things that were rich for her husband was to be rich and she meant to avail herself of his wealth she bought things that were fashionable for she meant to live in the fashionable world but she bought what was good and strong and lasting and worth its money  augusta gresham had perceived early in life that she could not obtain success either as an heiress or as a beauty nor could she shine as a wit she therefore fell back on such qualities as she had and determined to win the world as a strongminded useful woman that which she had of her own was blood having that she would in all ways do what in her lay to enhance its value had she not possessed it it would to her mind have been the vainest of pretences  when mary came in the wedding preparations were being discussed the number and names of the bridesmaids were being settled the dresses were on the tapis the invitations to be given were talked over sensible as augusta was she was not above such feminine cares she was indeed rather anxious that the wedding should go off well she was a little ashamed of her tailors son and therefore anxious that things should be as brilliant as possible  the bridesmaids names had just been written on a card as mary entered the room there were the ladies amelia rosina margaretta and alexandrina of course at the head of it then came beatrice and the twins then miss oriel who though only a parsons sister was a person of note birth and fortune after this there had been here a great discussion whether or not there should be any more if there were to be one more there must be two now miss moffat had expressed a direct wish and augusta though she would much rather have done without her hardly knew how to refuse alexandrinawe hope we may be allowed to drop the lady for the sake of brevity for the present scene onlywas dead against such an unreasonable request we none of us know her you know and it would not be comfortable beatrice strongly advocated the future sisterinlaws acceptance into the bevy she had her own reasons she was pained that mary thorne should not be among the number and if miss moffat were accepted perhaps mary might be brought in as her colleague  if you have miss moffat said alexandrina you must have dear pussy too and i really think that pussy is too young it will be troublesome pussy was the youngest miss gresham who was now only eight years old and whose real name was nina  augusta said beatrice speaking with some slight hesitation some soupçon of doubt before the high authority of her noble cousin if you do have miss moffat would you mind asking mary thorne to join her i think mary would like it because you see patience oriel is to be one and we have known mary much longer than we have known patience  then out and spake the lady alexandrina  beatrice dear if you think of what you are asking i am sure you will see that it would not do would not do at all miss thorne is a very nice girl i am sure and indeed what little i have seen of her i highly approve but after all who is she mamma i know thinks that aunt arabella has been wrong to let her be here so much but  beatrice became rather red in the face and in spite of the dignity of her cousin was preparing to defend her friend  mind i am not saying a word against miss thorne  if i am married before her she shall be one of my bridesmaids said beatrice  that will probably depend on circumstances said the lady alexandrina i find that i cannot bring my courteous pen to drop the title but augusta is very peculiarly situated mr moffat is you see not of the very highest birth and therefore she should take care that on her side every one about her is well born  then you cannot have miss moffat said beatrice  no i would not if i could help it said the cousin  but the thornes are as good a family as the greshams said beatrice she had not quite the courage to say as good as the de courcys  i dare say they are and if this was miss thorne of ullathorne augusta probably would not object to her but can you tell me who miss mary thorne is  she is dr thornes niece  you mean that she is called so but do you know who her father was or who her mother was i for one must own i do not mamma i believe does but  at this moment the door opened gently and mary thorne entered the room  it may easily be conceived that while mary was making her salutations the three other young ladies were a little cast aback the lady alexandrina however quickly recovered herself and by her inimitable presence of mind and facile grace of manner soon put the matter on a proper footing  we were discussing miss greshams marriage said she i am sure i may mention to an acquaintance of so long standing as miss thorne that the first of september has been now fixed for the wedding  miss gresham acquaintance of so long standing why mary and augusta gresham had for years we will hardly say now for how many passed their mornings together in the same schoolroom had quarrelled and squabbled and caressed and kissed and been all but as sisters to each other acquaintance indeed beatrice felt that her ears were tingling and even augusta was a little ashamed mary however knew that the cold words had come from a de courcy and not from a gresham and did not therefore resent them  so its settled augusta is it said she the first of september i wish you joy with all my heart and coming round she put her arm over augustas shoulder and kissed her the lady alexandrina could not but think that the doctors niece uttered her congratulations very much as though she were speaking to an equal very much as though she had a father and mother of her own  you will have delicious weather continued mary september and the beginning of october is the nicest time of the year if i were going honeymooning it is just the time of year i would choose  i wish you were mary said beatrice  so do not i dear till i have found some decent sort of a body to honeymoon along with me i wont stir out of greshamsbury till i have sent you off before me at any rate and where will you go augusta  we have not settled that said augusta mr moffat talks of paris  who ever heard of going to paris in september said the lady alexandrina  or who ever heard of the gentleman having anything to say on the matter said the doctors niece of course mr moffat will go wherever you are pleased to take him  the lady alexandrina was not pleased to find how completely the doctors niece took upon herself to talk and sit and act at greshamsbury as though she was on a par with the young ladies of the family that beatrice should have allowed this would not have surprised her but it was to be expected that augusta would have shown better judgment  these things require some tact in their management some delicacy when high interests are at stake said she i agree with miss thorne in thinking that in ordinary circumstances with ordinary people perhaps the lady should have her way rank however has its drawbacks miss thorne as well as its privileges  i should not object to the drawbacks said the doctors niece presuming them to be of some use but i fear i might fail in getting on so well with the privileges  the lady alexandrina looked at her as though not fully aware whether she intended to be pert in truth the lady alexandrina was rather in the dark on the subject it was almost impossible it was incredible that a fatherless motherless doctors niece should be pert to an earls daughter at greshamsbury seeing that that earls daughter was the cousin of the miss greshams and yet the lady alexandrina hardly knew what other construction to put on the words she had just heard  it was at any rate clear to her that it was not becoming that she should just then stay any longer in that room whether she intended to be pert or not miss mary thorne was to say the least very free the de courcy ladies knew what was due to themno ladies better and therefore the lady alexandrina made up her mind at once to go to her own bedroom  augusta she said rising slowly from her chair with much stately composure it is nearly time to dress will you come with me we have a great deal to settle you know  so she swam out of the room and augusta telling mary that she would see her again at dinner swamno tried to swimafter her miss gresham had had great advantages but she had not been absolutely brought up at courcy castle and could not as yet quite assume the courcy style of swimming  there said mary as the door closed behind the rustling muslins of the ladies there i have made an enemy for ever perhaps two thats satisfactory  and why have you done it mary when i am fighting your battles behind your back why do you come and upset it all by making the whole family of the de courcys dislike you in such a matter as that theyll all go together  i am sure they will said mary whether they would be equally unanimous in a case of love and charity that indeed is another question  but why should you try to make my cousin angry you that ought to have so much sense dont you remember what you were saying yourself the other day of the absurdity of combatting pretences which the world sanctions  i do trichy i do dont scold me now it is so much easier to preach than to practise i do so wish i was a clergyman  but you have done so much harm mary  have i said mary kneeling down on the ground at her friends feet if i humble myself very low if i kneel through the whole evening in a corner if i put my neck down and let all your cousins trample on it and then your aunt would not that make atonement i would not object to wearing sackcloth either and id eat a little ashesor at any rate id try  i know youre clever mary but still i think youre a fool i do indeed  i am a fool trichy i do confess it and am not a bit clever but dont scold me you see how humble i am not only humble but umble which i look upon to be the comparative or indeed superlative degree or perhaps there are four degrees humble umble stumble tumble and then when one is absolutely in the dirt at their feet perhaps these big people wont wish one to stoop any further  oh mary  and oh trichy you dont mean to say i maynt speak out before you there perhaps youd like to put your foot on my neck and then she put her head down to the footstool and kissed beatrices feet  id like if i dared to put my hand on your cheek and give you a good slap for being such a goose  do do trichy you shall tread on me or slap me or kiss me whichever you like  i cant tell you how vexed i am said beatrice i wanted to arrange something  arrange something what arrange what i love arranging i fancy myself qualified to be an arrangergeneral in female matters i mean pots and pans and such like of course i dont allude to extraordinary people and extraordinary circumstances that require tact and delicacy and drawbacks and that sort of thing  very well mary  but its not very well its very bad if you look like that well my pet there i wont i wont allude to the noble blood of your noble relatives either in joke or in earnest what is it you want to arrange trichy  i want you to be one of augustas bridesmaids  good heavens beatrice are you mad what put me even for a morning into the same category of finery as the noble blood from courcy castle  patience is to be one  but that is no reason why impatience should be another and i should be very impatient under such honours no trichy joking apart do not think of it even if augusta wished it i should refuse i should be obliged to refuse i too suffer from pride a pride quite as unpardonable as that of others i could not stand with your four ladycousins behind your sister at the altar in such a galaxy they would be the stars and i  why mary all the world knows that you are prettier than any of them  i am all the worlds very humble servant but trichy i should not object if i were as ugly as the veiled prophet and they all as beautiful as zuleika the glory of that galaxy will be held to depend not on its beauty but on its birth you know how they would look at me how they would scorn me and there in church at the altar with all that is solemn round us i could not return their scorn as i might do elsewhere in a room im not a bit afraid of them all and mary was again allowing herself to be absorbed by that feeling of indomitable pride of antagonism to the pride of others which she herself in her cooler moments was the first to blame  you often say mary that that sort of arrogance should be despised and passed over without notice  so it should trichy i tell you that as a clergyman tells you to hate riches but though the clergyman tells you so he is not the less anxious to be rich himself  i particularly wish you to be one of augustas bridesmaids  and i particularly wish to decline the honour which honour has not been and will not be offered to me no trichy i will not be augustas bridesmaid butbutbut  but what dearest  but trichy when some one else is married when the new wing has been built to a house that you know of  now mary hold your tongue or you know youll make me angry  i do so like to see you angry and when that time comes when that wedding does take place then i will be a bridesmaid trichy yes even though i am not invited yes though all the de courcys in barsetshire should tread upon me and obliterate me though i should be as dust among the stars though i should creep up in calico among their satins and lace i will nevertheless be there close close to the bride to hold something for her to touch her dress to feel that i am near to her tototo and she threw her arms round her companion and kissed her over and over again no trichy i wont be augustas bridesmaid ill bide my time for bridesmaiding  what protestations beatrice made against the probability of such an event as foreshadowed in her friends promise we will not repeat the afternoon was advancing and the ladies also had to dress for dinner to do honour to the young heir     chapter v  frank greshams first speech   we have said that over and above those assembled in the house there came to the greshamsbury dinner on franks birthday the jacksons of the grange consisting of mr and mrs jackson the batesons from annesgrove viz mr and mrs bateson and miss bateson their daughteran unmarried lady of about fifty the bakers of mill hill father and son and mr caleb oriel the rector with his beautiful sister patience dr thorne and his niece mary we count among those already assembled at greshamsbury  there was nothing very magnificent in the number of the guests thus brought together to do honour to young frank but he perhaps was called on to take a more prominent part in the proceedings to be made more of a hero than would have been the case had half the county been there in that case the importance of the guests would have been so great that frank would have got off with a halfmuttered speech or two but now he had to make a separate oration to every one and very weary work he found it  the batesons bakers and jacksons were very civil no doubt the more so from an unconscious feeling on their part that as the squire was known to be a little out at elbows as regards money any deficiency on their part might be considered as owing to the present state of affairs at greshamsbury fourteen thousand a year will receive honour in that case there is no doubt and the man absolutely possessing it is not apt to be suspicious as to the treatment he may receive but the ghost of fourteen thousand a year is not always so selfassured mr baker with his moderate income was a very much richer man than the squire and therefore he was peculiarly forward in congratulating frank on the brilliancy of his prospects  poor frank had hardly anticipated what there would be to do and before dinner was announced he was very tired of it he had no warmer feeling for any of the grand cousins than a very ordinary cousinly love and he had resolved forgetful of birth and blood and all those gigantic considerations which now that manhood had come upon him he was bound always to bear in mindhe had resolved to sneak out to dinner comfortably with mary thorne if possible and if not with mary then with his other love patience oriel  great therefore was his consternation at finding that after being kept continually in the foreground for half an hour before dinner he had to walk out to the diningroom with his aunt the countess and take his fathers place for the day at the bottom of the table  it will now depend altogether upon yourself frank whether you maintain or lose that high position in the county which has been held by the greshams for so many years said the countess as she walked through the spacious hall resolving to lose no time in teaching to her nephew that great lesson which it was so imperative that he should learn  frank took this as an ordinary lecture meant to inculcate general good conduct such as old bores of aunts are apt to inflict on youthful victims in the shape of nephews and nieces  yes said frank i suppose so and i mean to go along all square aunt and no mistake when i get back to cambridge ill read like bricks  his aunt did not care two straws about his reading it was not by reading that the greshams of greshamsbury had held their heads up in the county but by having high blood and plenty of money the blood had come naturally to this young man but it behoved him to look for the money in a great measure himself she lady de courcy could doubtless help him she might probably be able to fit him with a wife who would bring her money onto his birth his reading was a matter in which she could in no way assist him whether his taste might lead him to prefer books or pictures or dogs and horses or turnips in drills or old italian plates and dishes was a matter which did not much signify with which it was not at all necessary that his noble aunt should trouble herself  oh you are going to cambridge again are you well if your father wishes itthough very little is ever gained now by a university connexion  i am to take my degree in october aunt and i am determined at any rate that i wont be plucked  plucked  no i wont be plucked baker was plucked last year and all because he got into the wrong set at johns hes an excellent fellow if you knew him he got among a set of men who did nothing but smoke and drink beer malthusians we call them  malthusians  malt you know aunt and use meaning that they drink beer so poor harry baker got plucked i dont know that a fellows any the worse however i wont get plucked  by this time the party had taken their place round the long board mr gresham sitting at the top in the place usually occupied by lady arabella she on the present occasion sat next to her son on the one side as the countess did on the other if therefore frank now went astray it would not be from want of proper leading  aunt will you have some beef said he as soon as the soup and fish had been disposed of anxious to perform the rites of hospitality now for the first time committed to his charge  do not be in a hurry frank said his mother the servants will  oh ah i forgot there are cutlets and those sort of things my hand is not in yet for this work aunt well as i was saying about cambridge  is frank to go back to cambridge arabella said the countess to her sisterinlaw speaking across her nephew  so his father seems to say  is it not a waste of time asked the countess  you know i never interfere said the lady arabella i never liked the idea of cambridge myself at all all the de courcys were christ church men but the greshams it seems were always at cambridge  would it not be better to send him abroad at once  much better i would think said the lady arabella but you know i never interfere perhaps you would speak to mr gresham  the countess smiled grimly and shook her head with a decidedly negative shake had she said out loud to the young man your father is such an obstinate pigheaded ignorant fool that it is no use speaking to him it would be wasting fragrance on the desert air she could not have spoken more plainly the effect on frank was this that he said to himself speaking quite as plainly as lady de courcy had spoken by her shake of the face my mother and aunt are always down on the governor always but the more they are down on him the more ill stick to him i certainly will take my degree i will read like bricks and ill begin tomorrow  now will you take some beef aunt this was said out loud  the countess de courcy was very anxious to go on with her lesson without loss of time but she could not while surrounded by guests and servants enunciate the great secret you must marry money frank that is your one great duty that is the matter to be borne steadfastly in your mind she could not now with sufficient weight and impress of emphasis pour this wisdom into his ears the more especially as he was standing up to his work of carving and was deep to his elbows in horseradish fat and gravy so the countess sat silent while the banquet proceeded  beef harry shouted the young heir to his friend baker oh but i see it isnt your turn yet i beg your pardon miss bateson and he sent to that lady a pound and a half of excellent meat cut out with great energy in one slice about half an inch thick  and so the banquet went on  before dinner frank had found himself obliged to make numerous small speeches in answer to the numerous individual congratulations of his friends but these were as nothing to the one great accumulated onus of an oration which he had long known that he should have to sustain after the cloth was taken away someone of course would propose his health and then there would be a clatter of voices ladies and gentlemen men and girls and when that was done he would find himself standing on his legs with the room about him going round and round and round  having had a previous hint of this he had sought advice from his cousin the honourable george whom he regarded as a dab at speaking at least so he had heard the honourable george say of himself  what the deuce is a fellow to say george when he stands up after the clatter is done  oh its the easiest thing in life said the cousin only remember this you mustnt get astray that is what they call presence of mind you know ill tell you what i do and im often called up you know at our agriculturals i always propose the farmers daughters well what i do is thisi keep my eye steadfastly fixed on one of the bottles and never move it  on one of the bottles said frank wouldnt it be better if i made a mark of some old coveys head i dont like looking at the table  the old coveyd move and then youd be done besides there isnt the least use in the world in looking up ive heard people say who go to those sort of dinners every day of their lives that whenever anything witty is said the fellow who says it is sure to be looking at the mahogany  oh you know i shant say anything witty ill be quite the other way  but theres no reason you shouldnt learn the manner thats the way i succeeded fix your eye on one of the bottles put your thumbs in your waistcoat pockets stick out your elbows bend your knees a little and then go ahead  oh ah go ahead thats all very well but you cant go ahead if you havent got any steam  a very little does it there can be nothing so easy as your speech when one has to say something new every year about the farmers daughters why one has to use ones brains a bit lets see how will you begin of course youll say that you are not accustomed to this sort of thing that the honour conferred upon you is too much for your feelings that the bright array of beauty and talent around you quite overpowers your tongue and all that sort of thing then declare youre a gresham to the backbone  oh they know that  well tell them again then of course you must say something about us or youll have the countess as black as old nick  abut my aunt george what on earth can i say about her when shes there herself before me  before you of course thats just the reason oh say any lie you can think of you must say something about us you know weve come down from london on purpose  frank in spite of the benefit he was receiving from his cousins erudition could not help wishing in his heart that they had all remained in london but this he kept to himself he thanked his cousin for his hints and though he did not feel that the trouble of his mind was completely cured he began to hope that he might go through the ordeal without disgracing himself  nevertheless he felt rather sick at heart when mr baker got up to propose the toast as soon as the servants were gone the servants that is were gone officially but they were there in a body men and women nurses cooks and ladies maids coachmen grooms and footmen standing in two doorways to hear what master frank would say the old housekeeper headed the maids at one door standing boldly inside the room and the butler controlled the men at the other marshalling them back with a drawn corkscrew  mr baker did not say much but what he did say he said well they had all seen frank gresham grow up from a child and were now required to welcome as a man amongst them one who was well qualified to carry on the honour of that loved and respected family his young friend frank was every inch a gresham mr baker omitted to make mention of the infusion of de courcy blood and the countess therefore drew herself up on her chair and looked as though she were extremely bored he then alluded tenderly to his own long friendship with the present squire francis newbold gresham the elder and sat down begging them to drink health prosperity long life and an excellent wife to their dear young friend francis newbold gresham the younger  there was a great jingling of glasses of course made the merrier and the louder by the fact that the ladies were still there as well as the gentlemen ladies dont drink toasts frequently and therefore the occasion coming rarely was the more enjoyed god bless you frank your good health frank and especially a good wife frank two or three of them frank good health and prosperity to you mr gresham more power to you frank my boy may god bless you and preserve you my dear boy and then a merry sweet eager voice from the far end of the table frank frank do look at me pray do frank i am drinking your health in real wine aint i papa such were the addresses which greeted mr francis newbold gresham the younger as he essayed to rise up on his feet for the first time since he had come to mans estate  when the clatter was at an end and he was fairly on his legs he cast a glance before him on the table to look for a decanter he had not much liked his cousins theory of sticking to the bottle nevertheless in the difficulty of the moment it was well to have any system to go by but as misfortune would have it though the table was covered with bottles his eye could not catch one indeed his eye first could catch nothing for the things swam before him and the guests all seemed to dance in their chairs  up he got however and commenced his speech as he could not follow his preceptors advice as touching the bottle he adopted his own crude plan of making a mark on some old coveys head and therefore looked dead at the doctor  upon my word i am very much obliged to you gentlemen and ladies ladies and gentlemen i should say for drinking my health and doing me so much honour and all that sort of thing upon my word i am especially to mr baker i dont mean you harry youre not mr baker  as much as youre mr gresham master frank  but i am not mr gresham and i dont mean to be for many a long year if i can help it not at any rate till we have had another coming of age here  bravo frank and whose will that be  that will be my son and a very fine lad he will be and i hope hell make a better speech than his father mr baker said i was every inch a gresham well i hope i am here the countess began to look cold and angry i hope the day will never come when my father wont own me for one  theres no fear no fear said the doctor who was almost put out of countenance by the orators intense gaze the countess looked colder and more angry and muttered something to herself about a beargarden  gardez gresham eh harry mind that when youre sticking in a gap and im coming after you well i am sure i am very obliged to you for the honour you have all done me especially the ladies who dont do this sort of thing on ordinary occasions i wish they did dont you doctor and talking of the ladies my aunt and cousins have come all the way from london to hear me make this speech which certainly is not worth the trouble but all the same i am very much obliged to them and he looked round and made a little bow at the countess and so i am to mr and mrs jackson and mr and mrs and miss bateson and mr bakerim not at all obliged to you harryand to mr oriel and miss oriel and to mr umbleby and to dr thorne and to maryi beg her pardon i mean miss thorne and then he sat down amid the loud plaudits of the company and a string of blessings which came from the servants behind him  after this the ladies rose and departed as she went lady arabella kissed her sons forehead and then his sisters kissed him and one or two of his ladycousins and then miss bateson shook him by the hand oh miss bateson said he i thought the kissing was to go all round so miss bateson laughed and went her way and patience oriel nodded at him but mary thorne as she quietly left the room almost hidden among the extensive draperies of the grander ladies hardly allowed her eyes to meet his  he got up to hold the door for them as they passed and as they went he managed to take patience by the hand he took her hand and pressed it for a moment but dropped it quickly in order that he might go through the same ceremony with mary but mary was too quick for him  frank said mr gresham as soon as the door was closed bring your glass here my boy and the father made room for his son close beside himself the ceremony is now over so you may have your place of dignity frank sat himself down where he was told and mr gresham put his hand on his sons shoulder and half caressed him while the tears stood in his eyes i think the doctor is right baker i think hell never make us ashamed of him  i am sure he never will said mr baker  i dont think he ever will said dr thorne  the tones of the mens voices were very different mr baker did not care a straw about it why should he he had an heir of his own as well as the squire one also who was the apple of his eye but the doctorhe did care he had a niece to be sure whom he loved perhaps as well as these men loved their sons but there was room in his heart also for young frank gresham  after this small exposé of feeling they sat silent for a moment or two but silence was not dear to the heart of the honourable john and so he took up the running  thats a niceish nag you gave frank this morning he said to his uncle i was looking at him before dinner he is a monsoon isnt he  well i cant say i know how he was bred said the squire he shows a good deal of breeding  hes a monsoon im sure said the honourable john theyve all those ears and that peculiar dip in the back i suppose you gave a goodish figure for him  not so very much said the squire  hes a trained hunter i suppose  if not he soon will be said the squire  let frank alone for that said harry baker  he jumps beautifully sir said frank i havent tried him myself but peter made him go over the bar two or three times this morning  the honourable john was determined to give his cousin a helping hand as he considered it he thought that frank was very illused in being put off with so incomplete a stud and thinking also that the son had not spirit enough to attack his father himself on the subject the honourable john determined to do it for him  hes the making of a very nice horse i dont doubt i wish you had a string like him frank  frank felt the blood rush to his face he would not for worlds have his father think that he was discontented or otherwise than pleased with the present he had received that morning he was heartily ashamed of himself in that he had listened with a certain degree of complacency to his cousins tempting but he had no idea that the subject would be repeatedand then repeated too before his father in a manner to vex him on such a day as this before such people as were assembled there he was very angry with his cousin and for a moment forgot all his hereditary respect for a de courcy  i tell you what john said he do you choose your day some day early in the season and come out on the best thing you have and ill bring not the black horse but my old mare and then do you try and keep near me if i dont leave you at the back of godspeed before long ill give you the mare and the horse too  the honourable john was not known in barsetshire as one of the most forward of its riders he was a man much addicted to hunting as far as the getup of the thing was concerned he was great in boots and breeches wondrously conversant with bits and bridles he had quite a collection of saddles and patronised every newest invention for carrying spare shoes sandwiches and flasks of sherry he was prominent at the cover sidesome people including the master of hounds thought him perhaps a little too loudly prominent he affected a familiarity with the dogs and was on speaking acquaintance with every mans horse but when the work was cut out when the pace began to be sharp when it behoved a man either to ride or visibly to decline to ride thenso at least said they who had not the de courcy interest quite closely at heartthen in those heartstirring moments the honourable john was too often found deficient  there was therefore a considerable laugh at his expense when frank instigated to his innocent boast by a desire to save his father challenged his cousin to a trial of prowess the honourable john was not perhaps as much accustomed to the ready use of his tongue as was his honourable brother seeing that it was not his annual business to depict the glories of the farmers daughters at any rate on this occasion he seemed to be at some loss for words he shut up as the slang phrase goes and made no further allusion to the necessity of supplying young gresham with a proper string of hunters  but the old squire had understood it all had understood the meaning of his nephews attack had thoroughly understood also the meaning of his sons defence and the feeling which actuated it he also had thought of the stableful of horses which had belonged to himself when he came of age and of the much more humble position which his son would have to fill than that which his father had prepared for him he thought of this and was sad enough though he had sufficient spirit to hide from his friends around him the fact that the honourable johns arrow had not been discharged in vain  he shall have champion said the father to himself it is time for me to give it up  now champion was one of the two fine old hunters which the squire kept for his own use and it might have been said of him now at the period of which we are speaking that the only really happy moments of his life were those which he spent in the field so much as to its being time for him to give up     chapter vi  frank greshams early loves   it was we have said the first of july and such being the time of the year the ladies after sitting in the drawingroom for half an hour or so began to think that they might as well go through the drawingroom windows on to the lawn first one slipped out a little way and then another and then they got on to the lawn and then they talked of their hats till by degrees the younger ones of the party and at last of the elder also found themselves dressed for walking  the windows both of the drawingroom and the diningroom looked out on to the lawn and it was only natural that the girls should walk from the former to the latter it was only natural that they being there should tempt their swains to come to them by the sight of their broadbrimmed hats and evening dresses and natural also that the temptation should not be resisted the squire therefore and the elder male guests soon found themselves alone round their wine  upon my word we were enchanted by your eloquence mr gresham were we not said miss oriel turning to one of the de courcy girls who was with her  miss oriel was a very pretty girl a little older than frank greshamperhaps a year or so she had dark hair large round dark eyes a nose a little too broad a pretty mouth a beautiful chin and as we have said before a large fortunethat is moderately largelet us say twenty thousand pounds there or thereabouts she and her brother had been living at greshamsbury for the last two years the living having been purchased for himsuch were mr greshams necessitiesduring the lifetime of the last old incumbent miss oriel was in every respect a nice neighbour she was goodhumoured ladylike lively neither too clever nor too stupid belonging to a good family sufficiently fond of this worlds good things as became a pretty young lady so endowed and sufficiently fond also of the other worlds good things as became the mistress of a clergymans house  indeed yes said the lady margaretta frank is very eloquent when he described our rapid journey from london he nearly moved me to tears but well as he talks i think he carves better  i wish youd had to do it margaretta both the carving and talking  thank you frank youre very civil  but theres one comfort miss oriel its over now and done a fellow cant be made to come of age twice  but youll take your degree mr gresham and then of course therell be another speech and then youll get married and there will be two or three more  ill speak at your wedding miss oriel long before i do at my own  i shall not have the slightest objection it will be so kind of you to patronise my husband  but by jove will he patronise me i know youll marry some awful bigwig or some terribly clever fellow wont she margaretta  miss oriel was saying so much in praise of you before you came out said margaretta that i began to think that her mind was intent on remaining at greshamsbury all her life  frank blushed and patience laughed there was but a years difference in their age frank however was still a boy though patience was fully a woman  i am ambitious lady margaretta said she i own it but i am moderate in my ambition i do love greshamsbury and if mr gresham had a younger brother perhaps you know  another just like myself i suppose said frank  oh yes i could not possibly wish for any change  just as eloquent as you are frank said the lady margaretta  and as good a carver said patience  miss bateson has lost her heart to him for ever because of his carving said the lady margaretta  but perfection never repeats itself said patience  well you see i have not got any brothers said frank so all i can do is to sacrifice myself  upon my word mr gresham i am under more than ordinary obligations to you i am indeed and miss oriel stood still in the path and made a very graceful curtsy dear me only think lady margaretta that i should be honoured with an offer from the heir the very moment he is legally entitled to make one  and done with so much true gallantry too said the other expressing himself quite willing to postpone any views of his own or your advantage  yes said patience thats what i value so much had he loved me now there would have been no merit on his part but a sacrifice you know  yes ladies are so fond of such sacrifices frank upon my word i had no idea you were so very excellent at making speeches  well said frank i shouldnt have said sacrifice that was a slip what i meant was  oh dear me said patience wait a minute now we are going to have a regular declaration lady margaretta you havent got a scentbottle have you and if i should faint wheres the gardenchair  oh but im not going to make a declaration at all said frank  are you not oh now lady margaretta i appeal to you did you not understand him to say something very particular  certainly i thought nothing could be plainer said the lady margaretta  and so mr gresham i am to be told that after all it means nothing said patience putting her handkerchief up to her eyes  it means that you are an excellent hand at quizzing a fellow like me  quizzing no but you are an excellent hand at deceiving a poor girl like me well remember i have got a witness here is lady margaretta who heard it all what a pity it is that my brother is a clergyman you calculated on that i know or you would never had served me so  she said so just as her brother joined them or rather just as he had joined lady margaretta de courcy for her ladyship and mr oriel walked on in advance by themselves lady margaretta had found it rather dull work making a third in miss oriels flirtation with her cousin the more so as she was quite accustomed to take a principal part herself in all such transactions she therefore not unwillingly walked on with mr oriel mr oriel it must be conceived was not a common everyday parson but had points about him which made him quite fit to associate with an earls daughter and as it was known that he was not a marrying man having very exalted ideas on that point connected with his profession the lady margaretta of course had the less objection to trust herself alone with him  but directly she was gone miss oriels tone of banter ceased it was very well making a fool of a lad of twentyone when others were by but there might be danger in it when they were alone together  i dont know any position on earth more enviable than yours mr gresham said she quite soberly and earnestly how happy you ought to be  what in being laughed at by you miss oriel for pretending to be a man when you choose to make out that i am only a boy i can bear to be laughed at pretty well generally but i cant say that your laughing at me makes me feel so happy as you say i ought to be  frank was evidently of an opinion totally different from that of miss oriel miss oriel when she found herself têteàtête with him thought it was time to give over flirting frank however imagined that it was just the moment for him to begin so he spoke and looked very languishing and put on him quite the airs of an orlando  oh mr gresham such good friends as you and i may laugh at each other may we not  you may do what you like miss oriel beautiful women i believe always may but you remember what the spider said to the fly that which is sport to you may be death to me anyone looking at franks face as he said this might well have imagined that he was breaking his very heart for love of miss oriel oh master frank master frank if you act thus in the green leaf what will you do in the dry  while frank gresham was thus misbehaving himself and going on as though to him belonged the privilege of falling in love with pretty faces as it does to ploughboys and other ordinary people his great interests were not forgotten by those guardian saints who were so anxious to shower down on his head all manner of temporal blessings  another conversation had taken place in the greshamsbury gardens in which nothing light had been allowed to present itself nothing frivolous had been spoken the countess the lady arabella and miss gresham had been talking over greshamsbury affairs and they had latterly been assisted by the lady amelia than whom no de courcy ever born was more wise more solemn more prudent or more proud the ponderosity of her qualifications for nobility was sometimes too much even for her mother and her devotion to the peerage was such that she would certainly have declined a seat in heaven if offered to her without the promise that it should be in the upper house  the subject first discussed had been augustas prospects mr moffat had been invited to courcy castle and augusta had been taken thither to meet him with the express intention on the part of the countess that they should be man and wife the countess had been careful to make it intelligible to her sisterinlaw and niece that though mr moffat would do excellently well for a daughter of greshamsbury he could not be allowed to raise his eyes to a female scion of courcy castle  not that we personally dislike him said the lady amelia but rank has its drawbacks augusta as the lady amelia was now somewhat nearer forty than thirty and was still allowed to walk      in maiden meditation fancy free   it may be presumed that in her case rank had been found to have serious drawbacks  to this augusta said nothing in objection whether desirable by a de courcy or not the match was to be hers and there was no doubt whatever as to the wealth of the man whose name she was to take the offer had been made not to her but to her aunt the acceptance had been expressed not by her but by her aunt had she thought of recapitulating in her memory all that had ever passed between mr moffat and herself she would have found that it did not amount to more than the most ordinary conversation between chance partners in a ballroom nevertheless she was to be mrs moffat all that mr gresham knew of him was that when he met the young man for the first and only time in his life he found him extremely hard to deal with in the matter of money he had insisted on having ten thousand pounds with his wife and at last refused to go on with the match unless he got six thousand pounds this latter sum the poor squire had undertaken to pay him  mr moffat had been for a year or two mp for barchester having been assisted in his views on that ancient city by all the de courcy interest he was a whig of course not only had barchester departing from the light of other days returned a whig member of parliament but it was declared that at the next election now near at hand a radical would be sent up a man pledged to the ballot to economies of all sorts one who would carry out barchester politics in all their abrupt obnoxious pestilent virulence this was one scatcherd a great railway contractor a man who was a native of barchester who had bought property in the neighbourhood and who had achieved a sort of popularity there and elsewhere by the violence of his democratic opposition to the aristocracy according to this mans political tenets the conservatives should be laughed at as fools but the whigs should be hated as knaves  mr moffat was now coming down to courcy castle to look after his electioneering interests and miss gresham was to return with her aunt to meet him the countess was very anxious that frank should also accompany them her great doctrine that he must marry money had been laid down with authority and received without doubt she now pushed it further and said that no time should be lost that he should not only marry money but do so very early in life there was always danger in delay the greshamsof course she alluded only to the males of the familywere foolishly softhearted no one could say what might happen there was that miss thorne always at greshamsbury  this was more than the lady arabella could stand she protested that there was at least no ground for supposing that frank would absolutely disgrace his family  still the countess persisted perhaps not she said but when young people of perfectly different ranks were allowed to associate together there was no saying what danger might arise they all knew that old mr batesonthe present mr batesons fatherhad gone off with the governess and young mr everbeery near taunton had only the other day married a cookmaid  but mr everbeery was always drunk aunt said augusta feeling called upon to say something for her brother  never mind my dear these things do happen and they are very dreadful  horrible said the lady amelia diluting the best blood of the country and paving the way for revolutions this was very grand but nevertheless augusta could not but feel that she perhaps might be about to dilute the blood of her coming children in marrying the tailors son she consoled herself by trusting that at any rate she paved the way for no revolutions  when a thing is so necessary said the countess it cannot be done too soon now arabella i dont say that anything will come of it but it may miss dunstable is coming down to us next week now we all know that when old dunstable died last year he left over two hundred thousand to his daughter  it is a great deal of money certainly said lady arabella  it would pay off everything and a great deal more said the countess  it was ointment was it not aunt said augusta  i believe so my dear something called the ointment of lebanon or something of that sort but theres no doubt about the money  but how old is she rosina asked the anxious mother  about thirty i suppose but i dont think that much signifies  thirty said lady arabella rather dolefully and what is she like i think that frank already begins to like girls that are young and pretty  but surely aunt said the lady amelia now that he has come to mans discretion he will not refuse to consider all that he owes to his family a mr gresham of greshamsbury has a position to support the de courcy scion spoke these last words in the sort of tone that a parish clergyman would use in warning some young farmers son that he should not put himself on an equal footing with the ploughboys  it was at last decided that the countess should herself convey to frank a special invitation to courcy castle and that when she got him there she should do all that lay in her power to prevent his return to cambridge and to further the dunstable marriage  we did think of miss dunstable for porlock once she said naïvely but when we found that it wasnt much over two hundred thousand why that idea fell to the ground the terms on which the de courcy blood might be allowed to dilute itself were it must be presumed very high indeed  augusta was sent off to find her brother and to send him to the countess in the small drawingroom here the countess was to have her tea apart from the outer common world and here without interruption she was to teach her great lesson to her nephew  augusta did find her brother and found him in the worst of bad societyso at least the stern de courcys would have thought old mr bateson and the governess mr everbeery and his cooks diluted blood and ways paved for revolutions all presented themselves to augustas mind when she found her brother walking with no other company than mary thorne and walking with her too in much too close proximity  how he had contrived to be off with the old love and so soon on with the new or rather to be off with the new love and again on with the old we will not stop to inquire had lady arabella in truth known all her sons doings in this way could she have guessed how very nigh he had approached the iniquity of old mr bateson and to the folly of young mr everbeery she would in truth have been in a hurry to send him off to courcy castle and miss dunstable some days before the commencement of our story young frank had sworn in sober earnestin what he intended for his most sober earnest his most earnest sobrietythat he loved mary thorne with a love for which words could find no sufficient expressionwith a love that could never die never grow dim never become less which no opposition on the part of others could extinguish which no opposition on her part could repel that he might could would and should have her for his wife and that if she told him she didnt love him he would  oh oh mary do you love me dont you love me wont you love me say you will oh mary dearest mary will you wont you do you dont you come now you have a right to give a fellow an answer  with such eloquence had the heir of greshamsbury when not yet twentyone years of age attempted to possess himself of the affections of the doctors niece and yet three days afterwards he was quite ready to flirt with miss oriel  if such things are done in the green wood what will be done in the dry  and what had mary said when these fervent protestations of an undying love had been thrown at her feet mary it must be remembered was very nearly of the same age as frank but as i and others have so often said before women grow on the sunny side of the wall though frank was only a boy it behoved mary to be something more than a girl frank might be allowed without laying himself open to much just reproach to throw all of what he believed to be his heart into a protestation of what he believed to be love but mary was in duty bound to be more thoughtful more reticent more aware of the facts of their position more careful of her own feelings and more careful also of his  and yet she could not put him down as another young lady might put down another young gentleman it is very seldom that a young man unless he be tipsy assumes an unwelcome familiarity in his early acquaintance with any girl but when acquaintance has been long and intimate familiarity must follow as a matter of course frank and mary had been so much together in his holidays had so constantly consorted together as boys and girls that as regarded her he had not that innate fear of a woman which represses a young mans tongue and she was so used to his goodhumour his fun and high jovial spirits and was withal so fond of them and him that it was very difficult for her to mark with accurate feeling and stop with reserved brow the shade of change from a boys liking to a mans love  and beatrice too had done harm in this matter with a spirit painfully unequal to that of her grand relatives she had quizzed mary and frank about their early flirtations this she had done but had instinctively avoided doing so before her mother and sister and had thus made a secret of it as it were between herself mary and her brotherhad given currency as it were to the idea that there might be something serious between the two not that beatrice had ever wished to promote a marriage between them or had even thought of such a thing she was girlish thoughtless imprudent inartistic and very unlike a de courcy very unlike a de courcy she was in all that but nevertheless she had the de courcy veneration for blood and more than that she had the gresham feeling joined to that of the de courcys the lady amelia would not for worlds have had the de courcy blood defiled but gold she thought could not defile now beatrice was ashamed of her sisters marriage and had often declared within her own heart that nothing could have made her marry a mr moffat  she had said so also to mary and mary had told her that she was right mary also was proud of blood was proud of her uncles blood and the two girls talked together in all the warmth of girlish confidence of the great glories of family traditions and family honours beatrice had talked in utter ignorance as to her friends birth and mary poor mary she had talked being as ignorant but not without a strong suspicion that at some future time a day of sorrow would tell her some fearful truth  on one point marys mind was strongly made up no wealth no mere worldly advantage could make any one her superior if she were born a gentlewoman then was she fit to match with any gentleman let the most wealthy man in europe pour all his wealth at her feet she could if so inclined give him back at any rate more than that that offered at her feet she knew she would never tempt her to yield up the fortress of her heart the guardianship of her soul the possession of her mind not that alone nor that even as any possible slightest fraction of a makeweight  if she were born a gentlewoman and then came to her mind those curious questions what makes a gentleman what makes a gentlewoman what is the inner reality the spiritualised quintessence of that privilege in the world which men call rank which forces the thousands and hundreds of thousands to bow down before the few elect what gives or can give it or should give it  and she answered the question absolute intrinsic acknowledged individual merit must give it to its possessor let him be whom and what and whence he might so far the spirit of democracy was strong with her beyond this it could be had but by inheritance received as it were secondhand or twentysecondhand and so far the spirit of aristocracy was strong within her all this she had as may be imagined learnt in early years from her uncle and all this she was at great pains to teach beatrice gresham the chosen of her heart  when frank declared that mary had a right to give him an answer he meant that he had a right to expect one mary acknowledged this right and gave it to him  mr gresham she said  oh mary mr gresham  yes mr gresham it must be mr gresham after that and moreover it must be miss thorne as well  ill be shot if it shall mary  well i cant say that i shall be shot if it be not so but if it be not so if you do not agree that it shall be so i shall be turned out of greshamsbury  what you mean my mother said frank  indeed i mean no such thing said mary with a flash from her eye that made frank almost start i mean no such thing i mean you not your mother i am not in the least afraid of lady arabella but i am afraid of you  afraid of me mary  miss thorne pray pray remember it must be miss thorne do not turn me out of greshamsbury do not separate me from beatrice it is you that will drive me out no one else i could stand my ground against your motheri feel i could but i cannot stand against you if you treat me otherwise thanthan  otherwise than what i want to treat you as the girl i have chosen from all the world as my wife  i am sorry you should so soon have found it necessary to make a choice but mr gresham we must not joke about this at present i am sure you would not willingly injure me but if you speak to me or of me again in that way you will injure me injure me so much that i shall be forced to leave greshamsbury in my own defence i know you are too generous to drive me to that  and so the interview had ended frank of course went upstairs to see if his new pocketpistols were all ready properly cleaned loaded and capped should he find after a few days experience that prolonged existence was unendurable  however he managed to live through the subsequent period doubtless with a view of preventing any disappointment to his fathers guests     chapter vii  the doctors garden   mary had contrived to quiet her lover with considerable propriety of demeanour then came on her the somewhat harder task of quieting herself young ladies on the whole are perhaps quite as susceptible of the softer feelings as young gentlemen are now frank gresham was handsome amiable by no means a fool in intellect excellent in heart and he was moreover a gentleman being the son of mr gresham of greshamsbury mary had been as it were brought up to love him had aught but good happened to him she would have cried as for a brother it must not therefore be supposed that when frank gresham told her that he loved her she had heard it altogether unconcerned  he had not perhaps made his declaration with that propriety of language in which such scenes are generally described as being carried on ladies may perhaps think that mary should have been deterred by the very boyishness of his manner from thinking at all seriously on the subject his will you wont youdo you dont you does not sound like the poetic raptures of a highly inspired lover but nevertheless there had been warmth and a reality in it not in itself repulsive and marys angeranger no not angerher objections to the declarations were probably not based on the absurdity of her lovers language  we are inclined to think that these matters are not always discussed by mortal lovers in the poetically passionate phraseology which is generally thought to be appropriate for their description a man cannot well describe that which he has never seen nor heard but the absolute words and acts of one such scene did once come to the authors knowledge the couple were by no means plebeian or below the proper standard of high bearing and high breeding they were a handsome pair living among educated people sufficiently given to mental pursuits and in every way what a pair of polite lovers ought to be the allimportant conversation passed in this wise the site of the passionate scene was the seashore on which they were walking in autumn  gentleman well miss  the long and short of it is this here i am you can take me or leave me  ladyscratching a gutter on the sand with her parasol so as to allow a little salt water to run out of one hole into another of course i know thats all nonsense  gentleman nonsense by jove it isnt nonsense at all come jane here i am come at any rate you can say something  lady yes i suppose i can say something  gentleman well which is it to be take me or leave me  ladyvery slowly and with a voice perhaps hardly articulate carrying on at the same time her engineering works on a wider scale well i dont exactly want to leave you  and so the matter was settled settled with much propriety and satisfaction and both the lady and gentleman would have thought had they ever thought about the matter at all that this the sweetest moment of their lives had been graced by all the poetry by which such moments ought to be hallowed  when mary had as she thought properly subdued young frank the offer of whose love she at any rate knew was at such a period of his life an utter absurdity then she found it necessary to subdue herself what happiness on earth could be greater than the possession of such a love had the true possession been justly and honestly within her reach what man could be more lovable than such a man as would grow from such a boy and then did she not love himlove him already without waiting for any change did she not feel that there was that about him about him and about herself too which might so well fit them for each other it would be so sweet to be the sister of beatrice the daughter of the squire to belong to greshamsbury as a part and parcel of itself  but though she could not restrain these thoughts it never for a moment occurred to her to take franks offer in earnest though she was a grown woman he was still a boy he would have to see the world before he settled in it and would change his mind about woman half a score of times before he married then too though she did not like the lady arabella she felt that she owed something if not to her kindness at least to her forbearance and she knew felt inwardly certain that she would be doing wrong that the world would say she was doing wrong that her uncle would think her wrong if she endeavoured to take advantage of what had passed  she had not for an instant doubted not for a moment had she contemplated it as possible that she should ever become mrs gresham because frank had offered to make her so but nevertheless she could not help thinking of what had occurredof thinking of it most probably much more than frank did himself  a day or two afterwards on the evening before franks birthday she was alone with her uncle walking in the garden behind their house and she then essayed to question him with the object of learning if she were fitted by her birth to be the wife of such a one as frank gresham they were in the habit of walking there together when he happened to be at home of a summers evening this was not often the case for his hours of labour extended much beyond those usual to the upper working world the hours namely between breakfast and dinner but those minutes that they did thus pass together the doctor regarded as perhaps the pleasantest of his life  uncle said she after a while what do you think of this marriage of miss greshams  well minniesuch was his name of endearment for heri cant say i have thought much about it and i dont suppose anybody else has either  she must think about it of course and so must he i suppose  im not so sure of that some folks would never get married if they had to trouble themselves with thinking about it  i suppose thats why you never got married uncle  either that or thinking of it too much one is as bad as the other  mary had not contrived to get at all near her point as yet so she had to draw off and after a while begin again  well i have been thinking about it at any rate uncle  thats very good of you that will save me the trouble and perhaps save miss gresham too if you have thought it over thoroughly that will do for all  i believe mr moffat is a man of no family  hell mend in that point no doubt when he has got a wife  uncle youre a goose and what is worse a very provoking goose  niece youre a gander and what is worse a very silly gander what is mr moffats family to you and me mr moffat has that which ranks above family honours he is a very rich man  yes said mary i know he is rich and a rich man i suppose can buy anythingexcept a woman that is worth having  a rich man can buy anything said the doctor not that i meant to say that mr moffat has bought miss gresham i have no doubt that they will suit each other very well he added with an air of decisive authority as though he had finished the subject  but his niece was determined not to let him pass so now uncle said she you know you are pretending to a great deal of worldly wisdom which after all is not wisdom at all in your eyes  am i  you know you are and as for the impropriety of discussing miss greshams marriage  i did not say it was improper  oh yes you did of course such things must be discussed how is one to have an opinion if one does not get it by looking at the things which happen around us  now i am going to be blown up said dr thorne  dear uncle do be serious with me  well then seriously i hope miss gresham will be very happy as mrs moffat  of course you do so do i i hope it as much as i can hope what i dont at all see ground for expecting  people constantly hope without any such ground  well then ill hope in this case but uncle  well my dear  i want your opinion truly and really if you were a girl  i am perfectly unable to give any opinion founded on so strange an hypothesis  well but if you were a marrying man  the hypothesis is quite as much out of my way  but uncle i am a girl and perhaps i may marryor at any rate think of marrying some day  the latter alternative is certainly possible enough  therefore in seeing a friend taking such a step i cannot but speculate on the matter as though i were myself in her place if i were miss gresham should i be right  but minnie you are not miss gresham  no i am mary thorne it is a very different thing i know i suppose i might marry any one without degrading myself  it was almost illnatured of her to say this but she had not meant to say it in the sense which the sounds seemed to bear she had failed in being able to bring her uncle to the point she wished by the road she had planned and in seeking another road she had abruptly fallen into unpleasant places  i should be very sorry that my niece should think so said he and am sorry too that she should say so but mary to tell the truth i hardly know at what you are driving you are i think not so clear mindedcertainly not so clear wordedas is usual with you  i will tell you uncle and instead of looking up into his face she turned her eyes down on the green lawn beneath her feet  well minnie what is it and he took both her hands in his  i think that miss gresham should not marry mr moffat i think so because her family is high and noble and because he is low and ignoble when one has an opinion on such matters one cannot but apply it to things and people around one and having applied my opinion to her the next step naturally is to apply it to myself were i miss gresham i would not marry mr moffat though he rolled in gold i know where to rank miss gresham what i want to know is where i ought to rank myself  they had been standing when she commenced her last speech but as she finished it the doctor moved on again and she moved with him he walked on slowly without answering her and she out of her full mind pursued aloud the tenor of her thoughts  if a woman feels that she would not lower herself by marrying in a rank beneath herself she ought also to feel that she would not lower a man that she might love by allowing him to marry into a rank beneath his ownthat is to marry her  that does not follow said the doctor quickly a man raises a woman to his own standard but a woman must take that of the man she marries  again they were silent and again they walked on mary holding her uncles arm with both her hands she was determined however to come to the point and after considering for a while how best she might do it she ceased to beat any longer about the bush and asked him a plain question  the thornes are as good a family as the greshams are they not  in absolute genealogy they are my dear that is when i choose to be an old fool and talk of such matters in a sense different from that in which they are spoken of by the world at large i may say that the thornes are as good or perhaps better than the greshams but i should be sorry to say so seriously to any one the greshams now stand much higher in the county than the thornes do  but they are of the same class  yes yes wilfred thorne of ullathorne and our friend the squire here are of the same class  but uncle i and augusta greshamare we of the same class  well minnie you would hardly have me boast that i am the same class with the squirei a poor country doctor  you are not answering me fairly dear uncle dearest uncle do you not know that you are not answering me fairly you know what i mean have i a right to call the thornes of ullathorne my cousins  mary mary mary said he after a minutes pause still allowing his arm to hang loose that she might hold it with both her hands mary mary mary i would that you had spared me this  i could not have spared it to you for ever uncle  i would that you could have done so i would that you could  it is over now uncle it is told now i will grieve you no more dear dear dearest i should love you more than ever now i would i would i would if that were possible what should i be but for you what must i have been but for you and she threw herself on his breast and clinging with her arms round his neck kissed his forehead cheeks and lips  there was nothing more said then on the subject between them mary asked no further question nor did the doctor volunteer further information she would have been most anxious to ask about her mothers history had she dared to do so but she did not dare to ask she could not bear to be told that her mother had been perhaps was a worthless woman that she was truly a daughter of a brother of the doctor that she did know little as she had heard of her relatives in her early youth few as had been the words which had fallen from her uncle in her hearing as to her parentage she did know this that she was the daughter of henry thorne a brother of the doctor and a son of the old prebendary trifling little things that had occurred accidents which could not be prevented had told her this but not a word had ever passed any ones lips as to her mother the doctor when speaking of his youth had spoken of her father but no one had spoken of her mother she had long known that she was the child of a thorne now she knew also that she was no cousin of the thornes of ullathorne no cousin at least in the worlds ordinary language no niece indeed of her uncle unless by his special permission that she should be so  when the interview was over she went up alone to the drawingroom and there she sat thinking she had not been there long before her uncle came up to her he did not sit down or even take off the hat which he still wore but coming close to her and still standing he spoke thus  mary after what has passed i should be very unjust and very cruel to you not to tell you one thing more than you have now learned your mother was unfortunate in much not in everything but the world which is very often stern in such matters never judged her to have disgraced herself i tell you this my child in order that you may respect her memory and so saying he again left her without giving her time to speak a word  what he then told her he had told in mercy he felt what must be her feelings when she reflected that she had to blush for her mother that not only could she not speak of her mother but that she might hardly think of her with innocence and to mitigate such sorrow as this and also to do justice to the woman whom his brother had so wronged he had forced himself to reveal so much as is stated above  and then he walked slowly by himself backwards and forwards through the garden thinking of what he had done with reference to this girl and doubting whether he had done wisely and well he had resolved when first the little infant was given over to his charge that nothing should be known of her or by her as to her mother he was willing to devote himself to this orphan child of his brother this last seedling of his fathers house but he was not willing so to do this as to bring himself in any manner into familiar contact with the scatcherds he had boasted to himself that he at any rate was a gentleman and that she if she were to live in his house sit at his table and share his hearth must be a lady he would tell no lie about her he would not to any one make her out to be aught other or aught better than she was people would talk about her of course only let them not talk to him he conceived of himselfand the conception was not without due groundthat should any do so he had that within him which would silence them he would never claim for this little creaturethus brought into the world without a legitimate position in which to standhe would never claim for her any station that would not properly be her own he would make for her a station as best he could as he might sink or swim so should she  so he had resolved but things had arranged themselves as they often do rather than been arranged by him during ten or twelve years no one had heard of mary thorne the memory of henry thorne and his tragic death had passed away the knowledge that an infant had been born whose birth was connected with that tragedy a knowledge never widely spread had faded down into utter ignorance at the end of these twelve years dr thorne had announced that a young niece a child of a brother long since dead was coming to live with him as he had contemplated no one spoke to him but some people did no doubt talk among themselves whether or not the exact truth was surmised by any it matters not to say with absolute exactness probably not with great approach to it probably yes by one person at any rate no guess whatever was made no thought relative to dr thornes niece ever troubled him no idea that mary scatcherd had left a child in england ever occurred to him and that person was roger scatcherd marys brother  to one friend and only one did the doctor tell the whole truth and that was to the old squire i have told you said the doctor partly that you may know that the child has no right to mix with your children if you think much of such things do you however see to this i would rather that no one else should be told  no one else had been told and the squire had seen to it by accustoming himself to look at mary thorne running about the house with his own children as though she were of the same brood indeed the squire had always been fond of mary had personally noticed her and in the affair of mamselle larron had declared that he would have her placed at once on the bench of magistratesmuch to the disgust of the lady arabella  and so things had gone on and on and had not been thought of with much downright thinking till now when she was oneandtwenty years of age his niece came to him asking as to her position and inquiring in what rank of life she was to look for a husband  and so the doctor walked backwards and forwards through the garden slowly thinking now with some earnestness what if after all he had been wrong about his niece what if by endeavouring to place her in the position of a lady he had falsely so placed her and robbed her of all legitimate position what if there was no rank of life to which she could now properly attach herself  and then how had it answered that plan of his of keeping her all to himself he dr thorne was still a poor man the gift of saving money had not been his he had ever had a comfortable house for her to live in and in spite of doctors fillgrave century rerechild and others had made from his profession an income sufficient for their joint wants but he had not done as others do he had no three or four thousand pounds in the three per cents on which mary might live in some comfort when he should die late in life he had insured his life for eight hundred pounds and to that and that only had he to trust for marys future maintenance how had it answered then this plan of letting her be unknown to and undreamed of by those who were as near to her on her mothers side as he was on the fathers on that side though there had been utter poverty there was now absolute wealth  but when he took her to himself had he not rescued her from the very depths of the lowest misery from the degradation of the workhouse from the scorn of honestborn charitychildren from the lowest of the worlds low conditions was she not now the apple of his eye his one great sovereign comforthis pride his happiness his glory was he to make her over to make any portion of her over to others if by doing so she might be able to share the wealth as well as the coarse manners and uncouth society of her at present unknown connexions he who had never worshipped wealth on his own behalf he who had scorned the idol of gold and had ever been teaching her to scorn it was he now to show that his philosophy had all been false as soon as the temptation to do so was put in his way  but yet what man would marry this bastard child without a sixpence and bring not only poverty but ill blood also on his own children it might be very well for him dr thorne for him whose career was made whose name at any rate was his own for him who had a fixed standingground in the world it might be well for him to indulge in large views of a philosophy antagonistic to the worlds practice but had he a right to do it for his niece what man would marry a girl so placed for those among whom she might have legitimately found a level education had now utterly unfitted her and then he well knew that she would never put out her hand in token of love to any one without telling all she knew and all she surmised as to her own birth  and that question of this evening had it not been instigated by some appeal to her heart was there not already within her breast some cause for disquietude which had made her so pertinacious why else had she told him then for the first time that she did not know where to rank herself if such an appeal had been made to her it must have come from young frank gresham what in such case would it behove him to do should he pack up his all his lancetcases pestle and mortar and seek anew fresh ground in a new world leaving behind a huge triumph to those learned enemies of his fillgrave century and rerechild better that than remain at greshamsbury at the cost of his childs heart and pride  and so he walked slowly backwards and forwards through his garden meditating these things painfully enough     chapter viii  matrimonial prospects   it will of course be remembered that marys interview with the other girls at greshamsbury took place some two or three days subsequently to franks generous offer of his hand and heart mary had quite made up her mind that the whole thing was to be regarded as a folly and that it was not to be spoken of to any one but yet her heart was sore enough she was full of pride and yet she knew she must bow her neck to the pride of others being as she was herself nameless she could not but feel a stern unflinching antagonism the antagonism of a democrat to the pretensions of others who were blessed with that of which she had been deprived she had this feeling and yet of all the things that she coveted she most coveted that for glorying in which she was determined to heap scorn on others she said to herself proudly that gods handiwork was the inner man the inner woman the naked creature animated by a living soul that all other adjuncts were but mans clothing for the creature all others whether stitched by tailors or contrived by kings was it not within her capacity to do as nobly to love as truly to worship her god in heaven with as perfect a faith and her god on earth with as leal a troth as though blood had descended to her purely through scores of purely born progenitors so to herself she spoke and yet as she said it she knew that were she a man such a man as the heir of greshamsbury should be nothing would tempt her to sully her childrens blood by mating herself with any one that was base born she felt that were she an augusta gresham no mr moffat let his wealth be what it might should win her hand unless he too could tell of family honours and a line of ancestors  and so with a mind at war with itself she came forth armed to do battle against the worlds prejudices those prejudices she herself loved so well  and was she to give up her old affections her feminine loves because she found that she was a cousin to nobody was she no longer to pour out her heart to beatrice gresham with all the girlish volubility of an equal was she to be severed from patience oriel and banishedor rather was she to banish herselffrom the free place she had maintained in the various youthful female conclaves held within that parish of greshamsbury  hitherto what mary thorne would say what miss thorne suggested in such or such a matter was quite as frequently asked as any opinion from augusta greshamquite as frequently unless when it chanced that any of the de courcy girls were at the house was this to be given up these feelings had grown up among them since they were children and had not hitherto been questioned among them now they were questioned by mary thorne was she in fact to find that her position had been a false one and must be changed  such had been her feelings when she protested that she would not be augusta greshams bridesmaid and offered to put her neck beneath beatrices foot when she drove the lady margaretta out of the room and gave her own opinion as to the proper grammatical construction of the word humble such also had been her feelings when she kept her hand so rigidly to herself while frank held the diningroom door open for her to pass through  patience oriel said she to herself can talk to him of her father and mother let patience take his hand let her talk to him and then not long afterwards she saw that patience did talk to him and seeing it she walked along silent among some of the old people and with much effort did prevent a tear from falling down her cheek  but why was the tear in her eye had she not proudly told frank that his lovemaking was nothing but a boys silly rhapsody had she not said so while she had yet reason to hope that her blood was as good as his own had she not seen at a glance that his love tirade was worthy of ridicule and of no other notice and yet there was a tear now in her eye because this boy whom she had scolded from her whose hand offered in pure friendship she had just refused because he so rebuffed by her had carried his fun and gallantry to one who would be less cross to him  she could hear as she was walking that while lady margaretta was with them their voices were loud and merry and her sharp ear could also hear when lady margaretta left them that franks voice became low and tender so she walked on saying nothing looking straight before her and by degrees separating herself from all the others  the greshamsbury grounds were on one side somewhat too closely hemmed in by the village on this side was a path running the length of one of the streets of the village and far down the path near to the extremity of the gardens and near also to a wicketgate which led out into the village and which could be opened from the inside was a seat under a big yewtree from which through a breach in the houses might be seen the parish church standing in the park on the other side hither mary walked alone and here she seated herself determined to get rid of her tears and their traces before she again showed herself to the world  i shall never be happy here again said she to herself never i am no longer one of them and i cannot live among them unless i am so and then an idea came across her mind that she hated patience oriel and then instantly another idea followed itquick as such thoughts are quickthat she did not hate patience oriel at all that she liked her nay loved her that patience oriel was a sweet girl and that she hoped the time would come when she might see her the lady of greshamsbury and then the tear which had been no whit controlled which indeed had now made itself master of her came to a head and bursting through the floodgates of the eye came rolling down and in its fall wetted her hand as it lay on her lap what a fool what an idiot what an emptyheaded cowardly fool i am said she springing up from the bench on her feet  as she did so she heard voices close to her at the little gate they were those of her uncle and frank gresham  god bless you frank said the doctor as he passed out of the grounds you will excuse a lecture wont you from so old a friendthough you are a man now and discreet of course by act of parliament  indeed i will doctor said frank i will excuse a longer lecture than that from you  at any rate it wont be tonight said the doctor as he disappeared and if you see mary tell her that i am obliged to go and that i will send janet down to fetch her  now janet was the doctors ancient maidservant  mary could not move on without being perceived she therefore stood still till she heard the click of the door and then began walking rapidly back to the house by the path which had brought her thither the moment however that she did so she found that she was followed and in a very few moments frank was alongside of her  oh mary said he calling to her but not loudly before he quite overtook her how odd that i should come across you just when i have a message for you and why are you all alone  marys first impulse was to reiterate her command to him to call her no more by her christian name but her second impulse told her that such an injunction at the present moment would not be prudent on her part the traces of her tears were still there and she well knew that a very little the slightest show of tenderness on his part the slightest effort on her own to appear indifferent would bring down more than one other such intruder it would moreover be better for her to drop all outward sign that she remembered what had taken place so long then as he and she were at greshamsbury together he should call her mary if he pleased he would soon be gone and while he remained she would keep out of his way  your uncle has been obliged to go away to see an old woman at silverbridge  at silverbridge why he wont be back all night why could not the old woman send for dr century  i suppose she thought two old women could not get on well together  mary could not help smiling she did not like her uncle going off so late on such a journey but it was always felt as a triumph when he was invited into the strongholds of his enemies  and janet is to come over for you however i told him it was quite unnecessary to disturb another old woman for that i should of course see you home  oh no mr gresham indeed youll not do that  indeed and indeed i shall  what on this great day when every lady is looking for you and talking of you i suppose you want to set the countess against me for ever think too how angry lady arabella will be if you are absent on such an errand as this  to hear you talk mary one would think that you were going to silverbridge yourself  perhaps i am  if i did not go with you some of the other fellows would john or george  good gracious frank fancy either of the mr de courcys walking home with me  she had forgotten herself and the strict propriety on which she had resolved in the impossibility of forgoing her little joke against the de courcy grandeur she had forgotten herself and had called him frank in her old former eager free tone of voice and then remembering she had done so she drew herself up but her lips and determined to be doubly on her guard in the future  well it shall be either one of them or i said frank perhaps you would prefer my cousin george to me  i should prefer janet to either seeing that with her i should not suffer the extreme nuisance of knowing that i was a bore  a bore mary to me  yes mr gresham a bore to you having to walk home through the mud with village young ladies is boring all gentlemen feel it to be so  there is no mud if there were you would not be allowed to walk at all  oh village young ladies never care for such things though fashionable gentlemen do  i would carry you home mary if it would do you a service said frank with considerable pathos in his voice  oh dear me pray do not mr gresham i should not like it at all said she a wheelbarrow would be preferable to that  of course anything would be preferable to my arm i know  certainly anything in the way of a conveyance if i were to act baby and you were to act nurse it really would not be comfortable for either of us  frank gresham felt disconcerted though he hardly knew why he was striving to say something tender to his ladylove but every word that he spoke she turned into joke mary did not answer him coldly or unkindly but nevertheless he was displeased one does not like to have ones little offerings of sentimental service turned into burlesque when one is in love in earnest marys jokes had appeared so easy too they seemed to come from a heart so little troubled this also was cause of vexation to frank if he could but have known all he would perhaps have been better pleased  he determined not to be absolutely laughed out of his tenderness when three days ago he had been repulsed he had gone away owning to himself that he had been beaten owning so much but owning it with great sorrow and much shame since that he had come of age since that he had made speeches and speeches had been made to him since that he had gained courage by flirting with patience oriel no faint heart ever won a fair lady as he was well aware he resolved therefore that his heart should not be faint and that he would see whether the fair lady might not be won by becoming audacity  mary said he stopping in the pathfor they were now near the spot where it broke out upon the lawn and they could already hear the voices of the guestsmary you are unkind to me  i am not aware of it mr gresham but if i am do not you retaliate i am weaker than you and in your power do not you therefore be unkind to me  you refused my hand just now continued he of all the people here at greshamsbury you are the only one that has not wished me joy the only one  i do wish you joy i will wish you joy there is my hand and she frankly put out her ungloved hand you are quite man enough to understand me there is my hand i trust you use it only as it is meant to be used  he took it in his and pressed it cordially as he might have done that of any other friend in such a case and thendid not drop it as he should have done he was not a st anthony and it was most imprudent in miss thorne to subject him to such a temptation  mary said he dear mary dearest mary if you did but know how i love you  as he said this holding miss thornes hand he stood on the pathway with his back towards the lawn and house and therefore did not at first see his sister augusta who had just at that moment come upon them mary blushed up to her straw hat and with a quick jerk recovered her hand augusta saw the motion and mary saw that augusta had seen it  from my tedious way of telling it the reader will be led to imagine that the handsqueezing had been protracted to a duration quite incompatible with any objection to such an arrangement on the part of the lady but the fault is mine in no part hers were i possessed of a quick spasmodic style of narrative i should have been able to include it allfranks misbehaviour marys immediate anger augustas arrival and keen arguseyed inspection and then marys subsequent miseryin five words and half a dozen dashes and inverted commas the thing should have been so told for to do mary justice she did not leave her hand in franks a moment longer than she could help herself  frank feeling the hand withdrawn and hearing when it was too late the step on the gravel turned sharply round oh its you is it augusta well what do you want  augusta was not naturally very illnatured seeing that in her veins the high de courcy blood was somewhat tempered by an admixture of the gresham attributes nor was she predisposed to make her brother her enemy by publishing to the world any of his little tender peccadilloes but she could not but bethink herself of what her aunt had been saying as to the danger of any such encounters as that she just now had beheld she could not but start at seeing her brother thus on the very brink of the precipice of which the countess had specially forewarned her mother she augusta was as she well knew doing her duty by her family by marrying a tailors son for whom she did not care a chip seeing the tailors son was possessed of untold wealth now when one member of a household is making a struggle for a family it is painful to see the benefit of that struggle negatived by the folly of another member the future mrs moffat did feel aggrieved by the fatuity of the young heir and consequently took upon herself to look as much like her aunt de courcy as she could do  well what is it said frank looking rather disgusted what makes you stick your chin up and look in that way frank had hitherto been rather a despot among his sisters and forgot that the eldest of them was now passing altogether from under his sway to that of the tailors son  frank said augusta in a tone of voice which did honour to the great lessons she had lately received aunt de courcy wants to see you immediately in the small drawingroom and as she said so she resolved to say a few words of advice to miss thorne as soon as her brother should have left them  in the small drawingroom does she well mary we may as well go together for i suppose it is teatime now  you had better go at once frank said augusta the countess will be angry if you keep her waiting she has been expecting you these twenty minutes mary thorne and i can return together  there was something in the tone in which the words mary thorne were uttered which made mary at once draw herself up i hope said she that mary thorne will never be any hindrance to either of you  franks ear had also perceived that there was something in the tone of his sisters voice not boding comfort to mary he perceived that the de courcy blood in augustas veins was already rebelling against the doctors niece on his part though it had condescended to submit itself to the tailors son on her own part  well i am going said he but look here augusta if you say one word of mary  oh frank frank you boy you very boy you goose you silly goose is that the way you make love desiring one girl not to tell of another as though you were three children tearing your frocks and trousers in getting through the same hedge together oh frank frank you the fullblown heir of greshamsbury you a man already endowed with a mans discretion you the forward rider that did but now threaten young harry baker and the honourable john to eclipse them by prowess in the field you of age why thou canst not as yet have left thy mothers apronstring  if you say one word of mary  so far had he got in his injunction to his sister but further than that in such a case was he never destined to proceed marys indignation flashed upon him striking him dumb long before the sound of her voice reached his ears and yet she spoke as quick as the words would come to her call and somewhat loudly too  say one word of mary mr gresham and why should she not say as many words of mary as she may please i must tell you all now augusta and i must also beg you not to be silent for my sake as far as i am concerned tell it to whom you please this was the second time your brother  mary mary said frank deprecating her loquacity  i beg your pardon mr gresham you have made it necessary that i should tell your sister all he has now twice thought it well to amuse himself by saying to me words which it was illnatured in him to speak and  illnatured mary  illnatured in him to speak continued mary and to which it would be absurd for me to listen he probably does the same to others she added being unable in heart to forget that sharpest of her wounds that flirtation of his with patience oriel but to me it is almost cruel another girl might laugh at him or listen to him as she would choose but i can do neither i shall now keep away from greshamsbury at any rate till he has left it and augusta i can only beg you to understand that as far as i am concerned there is nothing which may not be told to all the world  and so saying she walked on a little in advance of them as proud as a queen had lady de courcy herself met her at this moment she would almost have felt herself forced to shrink out of the pathway not say a word of me she repeated to herself but still out loud no word need be left unsaid on my account none none  augusta followed her dumfounded at her indignation and frank also followed but not in silence when his first surprise at marys great anger was over he felt himself called upon to say some word that might tend to exonerate his ladylove and some word also of protestation as to his own purpose  there is nothing to be told nothing at least of mary he said speaking to his sister but of me you may tell this if you choose to disoblige your brotherthat i love mary thorne with all my heart and that i will never love any one else  by this time they had reached the lawn and mary was able to turn away from the path which led up to the house as she left them she said in a voice now low enough i cannot prevent him from talking nonsense augusta but you will bear me witness that i do not willingly hear it and so saying she started off almost in a run towards the distant part of the gardens in which she saw beatrice  frank as he walked up to the house with his sister endeavoured to induce her to give him a promise that she would tell no tales as to what she had heard and seen  of course frank it must be all nonsense she had said and you shouldnt amuse yourself in such a way  well but guss come we have always been friends dont let us quarrel just when you are going to be married but augusta would make no promise  frank when he reached the house found the countess waiting for him sitting in the little drawingroom by herselfsomewhat impatiently as he entered he became aware that there was some peculiar gravity attached to the coming interview three persons his mother one of his younger sisters and the lady amelia each stopped him to let him know that the countess was waiting and he perceived that a sort of guard was kept upon the door to save her ladyship from any undesirable intrusion  the countess frowned at the moment of his entrance but soon smoothed her brow and invited him to take a chair ready prepared for him opposite to the elbow of the sofa on which she was leaning she had a small table before her on which was her teacup so that she was able to preach at him nearly as well as though she had been ensconced in a pulpit  my dear frank said she in a voice thoroughly suitable to the importance of the communication you have today come of age  frank remarked that he understood that such was the case and added that that was the reason for all the fuss  yes you have today come of age perhaps i should have been glad to see such an occasion noticed at greshamsbury with some more suitable signs of rejoicing  oh aunt i think we did it all very well  greshamsbury frank is or at any rate ought to be the seat of the first commoner in barsetshire  well so it is i am quite sure there isnt a better fellow than father anywhere in the county  the countess sighed her opinion of the poor squire was very different from franks it is no use now said she looking back to that which cannot be cured the first commoner in barsetshire should hold a positioni will not of course say equal to that of a peer  oh dear no of course not said frank and a bystander might have thought that there was a touch of satire in his tone  no not equal to that of a peer but still of very paramount importance of course my first ambition is bound up in porlock  of course said frank thinking how very weak was the staff on which his aunts ambition rested for lord porlocks youthful career had not been such as to give unmitigated satisfaction to his parents  is bound up in porlock and then the countess plumed herself but the mother sighed and next to porlock frank my anxiety is about you  upon my honour aunt i am very much obliged i shall be all right youll see  greshamsbury my dear boy is not now what it used to be  isnt it asked frank  no frank by no means i do not wish to say a word against your father it may perhaps have been his misfortune rather than his fault  she is always down on the governor always said frank to himself resolving to stick bravely to the side of the house to which he had elected to belong  but there is the fact frank too plain to us all greshamsbury is not what it was it is your duty to restore it to its former importance  my duty said frank rather puzzled  yes frank your duty it all depends on you now of course you know that your father owes a great deal of money  frank muttered something tidings had in some shape reached his ear that his father was not comfortably circumstances as regarded money  and then he has sold boxall hill it cannot be expected that boxall hill shall be repurchased as some horrid man a railwaymaker i believe  yes thats scatcherd  well he has built a house there im told so i presume that it cannot be bought back but it will be your duty frank to pay all the debts that there are on the property and to purchase what at any rate will be equal to boxall hill  frank opened his eyes wide and stared at his aunt as though doubting much whether or no she were in her right mind he pay off the family debts he buy up property of four thousand pounds a year he remained however quite quiet waiting the elucidation of the mystery  frank of course you understand me  frank was obliged to declare that just at the present moment he did not find his aunt so clear as usual  you have but one line of conduct left you frank your position as heir to greshamsbury is a good one but your father has unfortunately so hampered you with regard to money that unless you set the matter right yourself you can never enjoy that position of course you must marry money  marry money said he considering for the first time that in all probability mary thornes fortune would not be extensive marry money  yes frank i know no man whose position so imperatively demands it and luckily for you no man can have more facility for doing so in the first place you are very handsome  frank blushed like a girl of sixteen  and then as the matter is made plain to you at so early an age you are not of course hampered by any indiscreet tie by any absurd engagement  frank blushed again and then saying to himself how much the old girl knows about it felt a little proud of his passion for mary thorne and of the declaration he had made to her  and your connexion with courcy castle continued the countess now carrying up the list of franks advantages to its great climax will make the matter so easy for you that really you will hardly have any difficulty  frank could not but say how much obliged he felt to courcy castle and its inmates  of course i would not wish to interfere with you in any underhand way frank but i will tell you what has occurred to me you have heard probably of miss dunstable  the daughter of the ointment of lebanon man  and of course you know that her fortune is immense continued the countess not deigning to notice her nephews allusion to the ointment quite immense when compared with the wants and position of any commoner now she is coming to courcy castle and i wish you to come and meet her  but aunt just at this moment i have to read for my degree like anything i go up you know in october  degree said the countess why frank i am talking to you of your prospects in life of your future position of that on which everything hangs and you tell me of your degree  frank however obstinately persisted that he must take his degree and that he should commence reading hard at six am tomorrow morning  you can read just as well at courcy castle miss dunstable will not interfere with that said his aunt who knew the expediency of yielding occasionally but i must beg you will come over and meet her you will find her a most charming young woman remarkably well educated i am told and  how old is she asked frank  i really cannot say exactly said the countess but it is not i imagine matter of much moment  is she thirty asked frank who looked upon an unmarried woman of that age as quite an old maid  i dare say she may be about that age said the countess who regarded the subject from a very different point of view  thirty said frank out loud but speaking nevertheless as though to himself  it is a matter of no moment said his aunt almost angrily when the subject itself is of such vital importance objections of no real weight should not be brought into view if you wish to hold up your head in the country if you wish to represent your county in parliament as has been done by your father your grandfather and your greatgrandfathers if you wish to keep a house over your head and to leave greshamsbury to your son after you you must marry money what does it signify whether miss dunstable be twentyeight or thirty she has got money and if you marry her you may then consider that your position in life is made  frank was astonished at his aunts eloquence but in spite of that eloquence he made up his mind that he would not marry miss dunstable how could he indeed seeing that his troth was already plighted to mary thorne in the presence of his sister this circumstance however he did not choose to plead to his aunt so he recapitulated any other objections that presented themselves to his mind  in the first place he was so anxious about his degree that he could not think of marrying at present then he suggested that it might be better to postpone the question till the seasons hunting should be over he declared that he could not visit courcy castle till he got a new suit of clothes home from the tailor and ultimately remembered that he had a particular engagement to go flyfishing with mr oriel on that day week  none however of these valid reasons were sufficiently potent to turn the countess from her point  nonsense frank said she i wonder that you can talk of flyfishing when the property of greshamsbury is at stake you will go with augusta and myself to courcy castle tomorrow  tomorrow aunt he said in the tone in which a condemned criminal might make his ejaculation on hearing that a very near day had been named for his execution tomorrow  yes we return tomorrow and shall be happy to have your company my friends including miss dunstable come on thursday i am quite sure you will like miss dunstable i have settled all that with your mother so we need say nothing further about it and now goodnight frank  frank finding that there was nothing more to be said took his departure and went out to look for mary but mary had gone home with janet half an hour since so he betook himself to his sister beatrice  beatrice said he i am to go to courcy castle tomorrow  so i heard mamma say  well i only came of age today and i will not begin by running counter to them but i tell you what i wont stay above a week at courcy castle for all the de courcys in barsetshire tell me beatrice did you ever hear of a miss dunstable     chapter ix  sir roger scatcherd   enough has been said in this narrative to explain to the reader that roger scatcherd who was whilom a drunken stonemason in barchester and who had been so prompt to avenge the injury done to his sister had become a great man in the world he had become a contractor first for little things such as half a mile or so of a railway embankment or three or four canal bridges and then a contractor for great things such as government hospitals locks docks and quays and had latterly had in his hands the making of whole lines of railway  he had been occasionally in partnership with one man for one thing and then with another for another but had on the whole kept his interests to himself and now at the time of our story he was a very rich man  and he had acquired more than wealth there had been a time when the government wanted the immediate performance of some extraordinary piece of work and roger scatcherd had been the man to do it there had been some extremely necessary bit of a railway to be made in half the time that such work would properly demand some speculation to be incurred requiring great means and courage as well and roger scatcherd had been found to be the man for the time he was then elevated for the moment to the dizzy pinnacle of a newspaper hero and became one of those whom the king delighteth to honour he went up one day to kiss her majestys hand and come down to his new grand house at boxall hill sir roger scatcherd bart  and now my lady said he when he explained to his wife the high state to which she had been called by his exertions and the queens prerogative lets have a bit of dinner and a drop of somat hot now the drop of somat hot signified a dose of alcohol sufficient to send three ordinary men very drunk to bed  while conquering the world roger scatcherd had not conquered his old bad habits indeed he was the same man at all points that he had been when formerly seen about the streets of barchester with his stonemasons apron tucked up round his waist the apron he had abandoned but not the heavy prominent thoughtful brow with the wildly flashing eye beneath it he was still the same good companion and still also the same hardworking hero in this only had he changed that now he would work and some said equally well whether he were drunk or sober those who were mostly inclined to make a miracle of himand there was a school of worshippers ready to adore him as their idea of a divine superhuman miraclemoving inspired prophetdeclared that his wondrous work was best done his calculations most quickly and most truly made that he saw with most accurate eye into the fardistant balance of profit and loss when he was under the influence of the rosy god to these worshippers his breakingsout as his periods of intemperance were called in his own set were his moments of peculiar inspirationhis divine frenzies in which he communicated most closely with those deities who preside over trade transactions his eleusinian mysteries to approach him in which was permitted only to a few of the most favoured  scatcherd has been drunk this week past they would say one to another when the moment came at which it was to be decided whose offer should be accepted for constructing a harbour to hold all the commerce of lancashire or to make a railway from bombay to canton scatcherd has been drunk this week past i am told that he has taken over three gallons of brandy and then they felt sure that none but scatcherd would be called upon to construct the dock or make the railway  but be this as it may be it true or false that sir roger was most efficacious when in his cups there can be no doubt that he could not wallow for a week in brandy six or seven times every year without in a great measure injuring and permanently injuring the outward man whatever immediate effect such symposiums might have on the inner mindsymposiums indeed they were not posiums i will call them if i may be allowed for in latter life when he drank heavily he drank alonehowever little for evil or however much for good the working of his brain might be affected his body suffered greatly it was not that he became feeble or emaciated oldlooking or inactive that his hand shook or that his eye was watery but that in the moments of his intemperance his life was often not worth a days purchase the frame which god had given to him was powerful beyond the power of ordinary men powerful to act in spite of these violent perturbations powerful to repress and conquer the qualms and headaches and inward sicknesses to which the votaries of bacchus are ordinarily subject but this power was not without its limit if encroached on too far it would break and fall and come asunder and then the strong man would at once become a corpse  scatcherd had but one friend in the world and indeed this friend was no friend in the ordinary acceptance of the word he neither ate with him nor drank with him nor even frequently talked with him their pursuits in life were wide asunder their tastes were all different the society in which each moved very seldom came together scatcherd had nothing in unison with this solitary friend but he trusted him and he trusted no other living creature on gods earth  he trusted this man but even him he did not trust thoroughly not at least as one friend should trust another he believed that this man would not rob him would probably not lie to him would not endeavour to make money of him would not count him up or speculate on him and make out a balance of profit and loss and therefore he determined to use him but he put no trust whatever in his friends counsel in his modes of thought none in his theory and none in his practice he disliked his friends counsel and in fact disliked his society for his friend was somewhat apt to speak to him in a manner approaching to severity now roger scatcherd had done many things in the world and made much money whereas his friend had done but few things and made no money it was not to be endured that the practical efficient man should be taken to task by the man who proved himself to be neither practical nor efficient not to be endured certainly by roger scatcherd who looked on men of his own class as the men of the day and on himself as by no means the least among them  the friend was our friend dr thorne  the doctors first acquaintance with scatcherd has been already explained he was necessarily thrown into communication with the man at the time of the trial and scatcherd then had not only sufficient sense but sufficient feeling also to know that the doctor behaved very well this communication had in different ways been kept up between them soon after the trial scatcherd had begun to rise and his first savings had been entrusted to the doctors care this had been the beginning of a pecuniary connexion which had never wholly ceased and which had led to the purchase of boxall hill and to the loan of large sums of money to the squire  in another way also there had been a close alliance between them and one not always of a very pleasant description the doctor was and long had been sir rogers medical attendant and in his unceasing attempts to rescue the drunkard from the fate which was so much to be dreaded he not unfrequently was driven into a quarrel with his patient  one thing further must be told of sir roger in politics he was as violent a radical as ever and was very anxious to obtain a position in which he could bring his violence to bear with this view he was about to contest his native borough of barchester in the hope of being returned in opposition to the de courcy candidate and with this object he had now come down to boxall hill  nor were his claims to sit for barchester such as could be despised if money were to be of avail he had plenty of it and was prepared to spend it whereas rumour said that mr moffat was equally determined to do nothing so foolish then again sir roger had a sort of rough eloquence and was able to address the men of barchester in language that would come home to their hearts in words that would endear him to one party while they made him offensively odious to the other but mr moffat could make neither friends nor enemies by his eloquence the barchester roughs called him a dumb dog that could not bark and sometimes sarcastically added that neither could he bite the de courcy interest however was at his back and he had also the advantage of possession sir roger therefore knew that the battle was not to be won without a struggle  dr thorne got safely back from silverbridge that evening and found mary waiting to give him his tea he had been called there to a consultation with dr century that amiable old gentleman having so far fallen away from the high fillgrave tenets as to consent to the occasional endurance of such degradation  the next morning he breakfasted early and having mounted his strong irongrey cob started for boxall hill not only had he there to negotiate the squires further loan but also to exercise his medical skill sir roger having been declared contractor for cutting a canal from sea to sea through the isthmus of panama had been making a week of it and the result was that lady scatcherd had written rather peremptorily to her husbands medical friend  the doctor consequently trotted off to boxall hill on his irongrey cob among his other merits was that of being a good horseman and he did much of his work on horseback the fact that he occasionally took a day with the east barsetshires and that when he did so he thoroughly enjoyed it had probably not failed to add something to the strength of the squires friendship  well my lady how is he not much the matter i hope said the doctor as he shook hands with the titled mistress of boxall hill in a small breakfastparlour in the rear of the house the showrooms of boxall hill were furnished most magnificently but they were set apart for company and as the company never cameseeing that they were never invitedthe grand rooms and the grand furniture were not of much material use to lady scatcherd  indeed then doctor hes just bad enough said her ladyship not in a very happy tone of voice just bad enough theres been someat at the back of his head rapping and rapping and rapping and if you dont do something im thinking it will rap him too hard yet  is he in bed  why yes he is in bed for when he was first took he couldnt very well help hisself so we put him to bed and then he dont seem to be quite right yet about the legs so he hasnt got up but hes got that winterbones with him to write for him and when winterbones is there scatcherd might as well be up for any good that bedll do him  mr winterbones was confidential clerk to sir roger that is to say he was a writingmachine of which sir roger made use to do certain work which could not well be adjusted without some contrivance he was a little withered dissipated brokendown man whom gin and poverty had nearly burnt to a cinder and dried to an ash mind he had none left nor care for earthly things except the smallest modicum of substantial food and the largest allowance of liquid sustenance all that he had ever known he had forgotten except how to count up figures and to write the results of his counting and his writing never stayed with him from one hour to another nay not from one folio to another let him however be adequately screwed up with gin and adequately screwed down by the presence of his master and then no amount of counting and writing would be too much for him this was mr winterbones confidential clerk to the great sir roger scatcherd  we must send winterbones away i take it said the doctor  indeed doctor i wish you would i wish youd send him to bath or anywhere else out of the way there is scatcherd he takes brandy and there is winterbones he takes gin and itd puzzle a woman to say which is worst master or man  it will seem from this that lady scatcherd and the doctor were on very familiar terms as regarded her little domestic inconveniences  tell sir roger i am here will you said the doctor  youll take a drop of sherry before you go up said the lady  not a drop thank you said the doctor  or perhaps a little cordial  not of drop of anything thank you i never do you know  just a thimbleful of this said the lady producing from some recess under a sideboard a bottle of brandy just a thimbleful its what he takes himself  when lady scatcherd found that even this argument failed she led the way to the great mans bedroom  well doctor well doctor well doctor was the greeting with which our son of galen was saluted some time before he entered the sickroom his approaching step was heard and thus the cidevant barchester stonemason saluted his coming friend the voice was loud and powerful but not clear and sonorous what voice that is nurtured on brandy can ever be clear it had about it a peculiar huskiness a dissipated guttural tone which thorne immediately recognised and recognised as being more marked more guttural and more husky than heretofore  so youve smelt me out have you and come for your fee ha ha ha well i have had a sharpish bout of it as her ladyship there no doubt has told you let her alone to make the worst of it but you see youre too late man ive bilked the old gentleman again without troubling you  anyway im glad youre something better scatcherd  something i dont know what you call something i never was better in my life ask winterbones there  indeed now scatcherd you aint youre bad enough if you only knew it and as for winterbones he has no business here up in your bedroom which stinks of gin so it does dont you believe him doctor he aint well nor yet nigh well  winterbones when the above illnatured allusion was made to the aroma coming from his libations might be seen to deposit surreptitiously beneath the little table at which he sat the cup with which he had performed them  the doctor in the meantime had taken sir rogers hand on the pretext of feeling his pulse but was drawing quite as much information from the touch of the sick mans skin and the look of the sick mans eye  i think mr winterbones had better go back to the london office said he lady scatcherd will be your best clerk for some time sir roger  then ill be d if mr winterbones does anything of the kind said he so theres an end of that  very well said the doctor a man can die but once it is my duty to suggest measures for putting off the ceremony as long as possible perhaps however you may wish to hasten it  well i am not very anxious about it one way or the other said scatcherd and as he spoke there came a fierce gleam from his eye which seemed to sayif thats the bugbear with which you wish to frighten me you will find that you are mistaken  now doctor dont let him talk that way dont said lady scatcherd with her handkerchief to her eyes  now my lady do you cut it cut at once said sir roger turning hastily round to his betterhalf and his betterhalf knowing that the province of a woman is to obey did cut it but as she went she gave the doctor a pull by the coats sleeve so that thereby his healing faculties might be sharpened to the very utmost  the best woman in the world doctor the very best said he as the door closed behind the wife of his bosom  im sure of it said the doctor  yes till you find a better one said scatcherd ha ha ha but good or bad there are some things which a woman cant understand and some things which she ought not to be let to understand  its natural she should be anxious about your health you know  i dont know that said the contractor shell be very well off all that whining wont keep a man alive at any rate  there was a pause during which the doctor continued his medical examination to this the patient submitted with a bad grace but still he did submit  we must turn over a new leaf sir roger indeed we must  bother said sir roger  well scatcherd i must do my duty to you whether you like it or not  that is to say i am to pay you for trying to frighten me  no human nature can stand such shocks as these much longer  winterbones said the contractor turning to his clerk go down go down i say but dont be out of the way if you go to the publichouse by g you may stay there for me when i take a dropthat is if i ever do it does not stand in the way of work so mr winterbones picking up his cup again and concealing it in some way beneath his coat flap retreated out of the room and the two friends were alone  scatcherd said the doctor you have been as near your god as any man ever was who afterwards ate and drank in this world  have i now said the railway hero apparently somewhat startled  indeed you have indeed you have  and now im all right again  all right how can you be all right when you know that your limbs refuse to carry you all right why the blood is still beating round your brain with a violence that would destroy any other brain but yours  ha ha ha laughed scatcherd he was very proud of thinking himself to be differently organised from other men ha ha ha well and what am i to do now  the whole of the doctors prescription we will not give at length to some of his ordinances sir roger promised obedience to others he objected violently and to one or two he flatly refused to listen the great stumblingblock was this that total abstinence from business for two weeks was enjoined and that it was impossible so sir roger said that he should abstain for two days  if you work said the doctor in your present state you will certainly have recourse to the stimulus of drink and if you drink most assuredly you will die  stimulus why do you think i cant work without dutch courage  scatcherd i know that there is brandy in the room at this moment and that you have been taking it within these two hours  you smell that fellows gin said scatcherd  i feel the alcohol working within your veins said the doctor who still had his hand on his patients arm  sir roger turned himself roughly in the bed so as to get away from his mentor and then he began to threaten in his turn  ill tell you what it is doctor ive made up my mind and ill do it ill send for fillgrave  very well said he of greshamsbury send for fillgrave your case is one in which even he can hardly go wrong  you think you can hector me and do as you like because you had me under your thumb in other days youre a very good fellow thorne but i aint sure that you are the best doctor in all england  you may be sure i am not you may take me for the worst if you will but while i am here as your medical adviser i can only tell you the truth to the best of my thinking now the truth is this that another bout of drinking will in all probability kill you and any recourse to stimulus in your present condition may do so  ill send for fillgrave  well send for fillgrave only do it at once believe me at any rate in this that whatever you do you should do at once oblige me in this let lady scatcherd take away that brandy bottle till dr fillgrave comes  im d if i do do you think i cant have a bottle of brandy in my room without swigging  i think youll be less likely to swig it if you cant get at it  sir roger made another angry turn in his bed as well as his halfparalysed limbs would let him and then after a few moments peace renewed his threats with increased violence  yes ill have fillgrave over here if a man be ill really ill he should have the best advice he can get ill have fillgrave and ill have that other fellow from silverbridge to meet him whats his namecentury  the doctor turned his head away for though the occasion was serious he could not help smiling at the malicious vengeance with which his friend proposed to gratify himself  i will and rerechild too whats the expense i suppose five or six pound apiece will do it eh thorne  oh yes that will be liberal i should say but sir roger will you allow me to suggest what you ought to do i dont know how far you may be joking  joking shouted the baronet you tell a man hes dying and joking in the same breath youll find im not joking  well i dare say not but if you have not full confidence in me  i have no confidence in you at all  then why not send to london expense is no object to you  it is an object a great object  nonsense send to london for sir omicron pie send for some man whom you will really trust when you see him  theres not one of the lot id trust as soon as fillgrave ive known fillgrave all my life and i trust him ill send for fillgrave and put my case in his hands if any one can do anything for me fillgrave is the man  then in gods name send for fillgrave said the doctor and now goodbye scatcherd and as you do send for him give him a fair chance do not destroy yourself by more brandy before he comes  thats my affair and his not yours said the patient  so be it give me your hand at any rate before i go i wish you well through it and when you are well ill come and see you  goodbyegoodbye and look here thorne youll be talking to lady scatcherd downstairs i know now no nonsense you understand me eh no nonsense you know     chapter x  sir rogers will   dr thorne left the room and went downstairs being fully aware that he could not leave the house without having some communication with lady scatcherd he was not sooner within the passage than he heard the sick mans bell ring violently and then the servant passing him on the staircase received orders to send a mounted messenger immediately to barchester dr fillgrave was to be summoned to come as quickly as possible to the sick mans room and mr winterbones was to be sent up to write the note  sir roger was quite right in supposing that there would be some words between the doctor and her ladyship how indeed was the doctor to get out of the house without such let him wish it ever so much there were words and these were protracted while the doctors cob was being ordered round till very many were uttered which the contractor would probably have regarded as nonsense  lady scatcherd was no fit associate for the wives of english baronetswas no doubt by education and manners much better fitted to sit in their servants halls but not on that account was she a bad wife or a bad woman she was painfully fearfully anxious for that husband of hers whom she honoured and worshipped as it behoved her to do above all other men she was fearfully anxious as to his life and faithfully believed that if any man could prolong it it was that old and faithful friend whom she had known to be true to her lord since their early married troubles  when therefore she found that he had been dismissed and that a stranger was to be sent for in his place her heart sank low within her  but doctor she said with her apron up to her eyes you aint going to leave him are you  dr thorne did not find it easy to explain to her ladyship that medical etiquette would not permit him to remain in attendance on her husband after he had been dismissed and another physician called in his place  etiquette said she crying whats etiquette to do with it when a man is akilling hisself with brandy  fillgrave will forbid that quite as strongly as i can do  fillgrave said she fiddlesticks fillgrave indeed  dr thorne could almost have embraced her for the strong feeling of thorough confidence on the one side and thorough distrust on the other which she contrived to throw into those few words  ill tell you what doctor i wont let the messenger go ill bear the brunt of it he cant do much now he aint up you know ill stop the boy we wont have no fillgraves here  this however was a step to which dr thorne would not assent he endeavoured to explain to the anxious wife that after what had passed he could not tender his medical services till they were again asked for  but you can slip in as a friend you know and then by degrees you can come round him eh cant you now doctor and as to the payment  all that dr thorne said on the subject may easily be imagined and in this way and in partaking of the lunch which was forced upon him an hour had nearly passed between his leaving sir rogers bedroom and putting his foot in the stirrup but no sooner had the cob begun to move on the gravelsweep before the house than one of the upper windows opened and the doctor was summoned to another conference with the sick man  he says you are to come back whether or no said mr winterbones screeching out of the window and putting all his emphasis on the last words  thorne thorne thorne shouted the sick man from his sickbed so loudly that the doctor heard him seated as he was on horseback out before the house  youre to come back whether or no repeated winterbones with more emphasis evidently conceiving that there was a strength of injunction in that whether or no which would be found quite invincible  whether actuated by these magic words or by some internal process of thought we will not say but the doctor did slowly and as though unwillingly dismount again from his steed and slowly retrace his steps into the house  it is no use he said to himself for that messenger has already gone to barchester  i have sent for dr fillgrave were the first words which the contractor said to him when he again found himself by the bedside  did you call me back to tell me that said thorne who now realy felt angry at the impertinent petulance of the man before him you should consider scatcherd that my time may be of value to others if not to you  now dont be angry old fellow said scatcherd turning to him and looking at him with a countenance quite different from any that he had shown that day a countenance in which there was a show of manhoodsome show also of affection you aint angry now because ive sent for fillgrave  not in the least said the doctor very complacently not in the least fillgrave will do as much good as i can do you  and thats none at all i suppose eh thorne  that depends on yourself he will do you good if you will tell him the truth and will then be guided by him your wife your servant any one can be as good a doctor to you as either he or i as good that is in the main point but you have sent for fillgrave now and of course you must see him i have much to do and you must let me go  scatcherd however would not let him go but held his hand fast thorne said he if you like it ill make them put fillgrave under the pump directly he comes here i will indeed and pay all the damage myself  this was another proposition to which the doctor could not consent but he was utterly unable to refrain from laughing there was an earnest look of entreaty about sir rogers face as he made the suggestion and joined to this there was a gleam of comic satisfaction in his eye which seemed to promise that if he received the least encouragement he would put his threat into execution now our doctor was not inclined to taking any steps towards subjecting his learned brother to pump discipline but he could not but admit to himself that the idea was not a bad one  ill have it done i will by heavens if youll only say the word protested sir roger  but the doctor did not say the word and so the idea was passed off  you shouldnt be so testy with a man when he is ill said scatcherd still holding the doctors hand of which he had again got possession specially not an old friend and specially again when youre been ablowing of him up  it was not worth the doctors while to aver that the testiness had all been on the other side and that he had never lost his goodhumour so he merely smiled and asked sir roger if he could do anything further for him  indeed you can doctor and thats why i sent for youwhy i sent for you yesterday get out of the room winterbones he then said gruffly as though he were dismissing from his chamber a dirty dog winterbones not a whit offended again hid his cup under his coattail and vanished  sit down thorne sit down said the contractor speaking quite in a different manner from any that he had yet assumed i know youre in a hurry but you must give me half an hour i may be dead before you can give me another who knows  the doctor of course declared that he hoped to have many a halfhours chat with him for many a year to come  well thats as may be you must stop now at any rate you can make the cob pay for it you know  the doctor took a chair and sat down thus entreated to stop he had hardly any alternative but to do so  it wasnt because im ill that i sent for you or rather let her ladyship send for you lord bless you thorne do you think i dont know what it is that makes me like this when i see that poor wretch winterbones killing himself with gin do you think i dont know whats coming to myself as well as him  why do you take it then why do you do it your life is not like his oh scatcherd scatcherd and the doctor prepared to pour out the flood of his eloquence in beseeching this singular man to abstain from his wellknown poison  is that all you know of human nature doctor abstain can you abstain from breathing and live like a fish does under water  but nature has not ordered you to drink scatcherd  habit is second nature man and a stronger nature than the first and why should i not drink what else has the world given me for all that i have done for it what other resource have i what other gratification  oh my god have you not unbounded wealth can you not do anything you wish be anything you choose  no and the sick man shrieked with an energy that made him audible all through the house i can do nothing that i would choose to do be nothing that i would wish to be what can i do what can i be what gratification can i have except the brandy bottle if i go among gentlemen can i talk to them if they have anything to say about a railway they will ask me a question if they speak to me beyond that i must be dumb if i go among my workmen can they talk to me no i am their master and a stern master they bob their heads and shake in their shoes when they see me where are my friends here said he and he dragged a bottle from under his very pillow where are my amusements here and he brandished the bottle almost in the doctors face where is my one resource my one gratification my only comfort after all my toils here doctor here here here and so saying he replaced his treasure beneath his pillow  there was something so horrifying in this that dr thorne shrank back amazed and was for a moment unable to speak  but scatcherd he said at last surely you would not die for such a passion as that  die for it aye would i live for it while i can live and die for it when i can live no longer die for it what is that for a man to do do not men die for a shilling a day what is a man the worse for dying what can i be the worse for dying a man can die but once you said just now id die ten times for this  you are speaking now either in madness or else in folly to startle me  folly enough perhaps and madness enough also such a life as mine makes a man a fool and makes him mad too what have i about me that i should be afraid to die im worth three hundred thousand pounds and id give it all to be able to go to work tomorrow with a hod and mortar and have a fellow clap his hand upon my shoulder and say well roger shall us have that ere other halfpint this morning ill tell you what thorne when a man has made three hundred thousand pounds theres nothing left for him but to die its all hes good for then when moneys been made the next thing is to spend it now the man who makes it has not the heart to do that  the doctor of course in hearing all this said something of a tendency to comfort and console the mind of his patient not that anything he could say would comfort or console the man but that it was impossible to sit there and hear such fearful truthsfor as regarded scatcherd they were truthswithout making some answer  this is as good as a play isnt doctor said the baronet you didnt know how i could come out like one of those actor fellows well now come at last ill tell you why i have sent for you before that last burst of mine i made my will  you had a will made before that  yes i had that will is destroyed i burnt it with my own hand so that there should be no mistake about it in that will i had named two executors you and jackson i was then partner with jackson in the york and yeovil grand central i thought a deal of jackson then hes not worth a shilling now  well im exactly in the same category  no youre not jackson is nothing without money but moneyll never make you  no nor i shant make money said the doctor  no you never will nevertheless theres my other will there under that desk there and ive put you in as sole executor  you must alter that scatcherd you must indeed with three hundred thousand pounds to be disposed of the trust is far too much for any one man besides you must name a younger man you and i are of the same age and i may die the first  now doctor doctor no humbug lets have no humbug from you remember this if youre not true youre nothing  well but scatcherd  well but doctor theres the will its already made i dont want to consult you about that you are named as executor and if you have the heart to refuse to act when im dead why of course you can do so  the doctor was no lawyer and hardly knew whether he had any means of extricating himself from this position in which his friend was determined to place him  youll have to see that will carried out thorne now ill tell you what i have done  youre not going to tell me how you have disposed of your property  not exactly at least not all of it one hundred thousand ive left in legacies including you know what lady scatcherd will have  have you not left the house to lady scatcherd  no what the devil would she do with a house like this she doesnt know how to live in it now she has got it i have provided for her it matters not how the house and the estate and the remainder of my money i have left to louis philippe  what two hundred thousand pounds said the doctor  and why shouldnt i leave two hundred thousand pounds to my son even to my eldest son if i had more than one does not mr gresham leave all his property to his heir why should not i make an eldest son as well as lord de courcy or the duke of omnium i suppose a railway contractor ought not to be allowed an eldest son by act of parliament wont my son have a title to keep up and thats more than the greshams have among them  the doctor explained away what he said as well as he could he could not explain that what he had really meant was this that sir roger scatcherds son was not a man fit to be trusted with the entire control of an enormous fortune  sir roger scatcherd had but one child that child which had been born in the days of his early troubles and had been dismissed from his mothers breast in order that the mothers milk might nourish the young heir of greshamsbury the boy had grown up but had become strong neither in mind nor body his father had determined to make a gentleman of him and had sent to eton and to cambridge but even this receipt generally as it is recognised will not make a gentleman it is hard indeed to define what receipt will do so though people do have in their own minds some certain undefined but yet tolerably correct ideas on the subject be that as it may two years at eton and three terms at cambridge did not make a gentleman of louis philippe scatcherd  yes he was christened louis philippe after the king of the french if one wishes to look out in the world for royal nomenclature to find children who have been christened after kings and queens or the uncles and aunts of kings and queens the search should be made in the families of democrats none have so servile a deference for the very nailparings of royalty none feel so wondering an awe at the exaltation of a crowned head none are so anxious to secure themselves some shred or fragment that has been consecrated by the royal touch it is the distance which they feel to exist between themselves and the throne which makes them covet the crumbs of majesty the odds and ends and chance splinters of royalty  there was nothing royal about louis philippe scatcherd but his name he had now come to mans estate and his father finding the cambridge receipt to be inefficacious had sent him abroad to travel with a tutor the doctor had from time to time heard tidings of this youth he knew that he had already shown symptoms of his fathers vices but no symptoms of his fathers talents he knew that he had begun life by being dissipated without being generous and that at the age of twentyone he had already suffered from delirium tremens  it was on this account that he had expressed disapprobation rather than surprise when he heard that his father intended to bequeath the bulk of his large fortune to the uncontrolled will of this unfortunate boy  i have toiled for my money hard and i have a right to do as i like with it what other satisfaction can it give me  the doctor assured him that he did not at all mean to dispute this  louis philippe will do well enough youll find continued the baronet understanding what was passing within his companions breast let a young fellow sow his wild oats while he is young and hell be steady enough when he grows old  but what if he never lives to get through the sowing thought the doctor to himself what if the wildoats operation is carried on in so violent a manner as to leave no strength in the soil for the product of a more valuable crop it was of no use saying this however so he allowed scatcherd to continue  if id had a free fling when i was a youngster i shouldnt have been so fond of the brandy bottle now but any way my son shall be my heir ive had the gumption to make the money but i havent the gumption to spend it my son however shall be able to ruffle it with the best of them ill go bail he shall hold his head higher than ever young gresham will be able to hold his they are much of the same age as well i have cause to rememberand so has her ladyship there  now the fact was that sir roger scatcherd felt in his heart no special love for young gresham but with her ladyship it might almost be a question whether she did not love the youth whom she had nursed almost as well as that other one who was her own proper offspring  and will you not put any check on thoughtless expenditure if you live ten or twenty years as we hope you may it will become unnecessary but in making a will a man should always remember he may go off suddenly  especially if he goes to bed with a brandy bottle under his head eh doctor but mind thats a medical secret you know not a word of that out of the bedroom  dr thorne could but sigh what could he say on such a subject to such a man as this  yes i have put a check on his expenditure i will not let his daily bread depend on any man i have therefore left him five hundred a year at his own disposal from the day of my death let him make what ducks and drakes of that he can  five hundred a year certainly is not much said the doctor  no nor do i want to keep him to that let him have whatever he wants if he sets about spending it properly but the bulk of the propertythis estate of boxall hill and the greshamsbury mortgage and those other mortgagesi have tied up in this way they shall be all his at twentyfive and up to that age it shall be in your power to give him what he wants if he shall die without children before he shall be twentyfive years of age they are all to go to marys eldest child  now mary was sir rogers sister the mother therefore of miss thorne and consequently the wife of the respectable ironmonger who went to america and the mother of a family there  marys eldest child said the doctor feeling that the perspiration had nearly broken out on his forehead and that he could hardly control his feelings marys eldest child scatcherd you should be more particular in your description or you will leave your best legacy to the lawyers  i dont know and never heard the name of one of them  but do you mean a boy or a girl  they may be all girls for what i know or all boys besides i dont care which it is a girl would probably do best with it only youd have to see that she married some decent fellow youd be her guardian  pooh nonsense said the doctor louis will be fiveandtwenty in a year or two  in about four years  and for all thats come and gone yet scatcherd you are not going to leave us yourself quite so soon as all that  not if i can help it doctor but thats as may be  the chances are ten to one that such a clause in your will will never come to bear  quite so quite so if i die louis philippe wont but i thought it right to put in something to prevent his squandering it all before he comes to his senses  oh quite right quite right i think i would have named a later age than twentyfive  so would not i louis philippe will be all right by that time thats my lookout and now doctor you know my will and if i die tomorrow you will know what i want you to do for me  you have merely said the eldest child scatcherd  thats all give it here and ill read it to you  no no never mind the eldest child you should be more particular scatcherd you should indeed consider what an enormous interest may have to depend on those words  why what the devil could i say i dont know their names never even heard them but the eldest is the eldest all the world over perhaps i ought to say the youngest seeing that i am only a railway contractor  scatcherd began to think that the doctor might now as well go away and leave him to the society of winterbones and the brandy but much as our friend had before expressed himself in a hurry he now seemed inclined to move very leisurely he sat there by the bedside resting his hands on his knees and gazing unconsciously at the counterpane at last he gave a deep sigh and then he said scatcherd you must be more particular in this if i am to have anything to do with it you must indeed be more explicit  why how the deuce can i be more explicit isnt her eldest living child plain enough whether he be jack or she be gill  what did your lawyer say to this scatcherd  lawyer you dont suppose i let my lawyer know what i was putting no i got the form and the paper and all that from him and had him here in one room while winterbones and i did it in another its all right enough though winterbones wrote it he did it in such a way he did not know what he was writing  the doctor sat a while longer still looking at the counterpane and then got up to depart ill see you again soon said he tomorrow probably  tomorrow said sir roger not at all understanding why dr thorne should talk of returning so soon tomorrow why i aint so bad as that man am i if you come so often as that youll ruin me  oh not as a medical man not as that but about this will scatcherd i must think if over i must indeed  you need not give yourself the least trouble in the world about my will till im dead not the least and who knowsmaybe i may be settling your affairs yet eh doctor looking after your niece when youre dead and gone and getting a husband for her eh ha ha ha  and then without further speech the doctor went his way     chapter xi  the doctor drinks his tea   the doctor got on his cob and went his way returning duly to greshamsbury but in truth as he went he hardly knew whither he was going or what he was doing sir roger had hinted that the cob would be compelled to make up for lost time by extra exertion on the road but the cob had never been permitted to have his own way as to pace more satisfactorily than on the present occasion the doctor indeed hardly knew that he was on horseback so completely was he enveloped in the cloud of his own thoughts  in the first place that alternative which it had become him to put before the baronet as one unlikely to occurthat of the speedy death of both father and sonwas one which he felt in his heart of hearts might very probably come to pass  the chances are ten to one that such a clause will never be brought to bear this he had said partly to himself so as to ease the thoughts which came crowding on his brain partly also in pity for the patient and the father but now that he thought the matter over he felt that there were no such odds were not the odds the other way was it not almost probable that both these men might be gathered to their long account within the next four years one the elder was a strong man indeed one who might yet live for years to come if he would but give himself fair play but then he himself protested and protested with a truth too surely grounded that fair play to himself was beyond his own power to give the other the younger had everything against him not only was he a poor puny creature without physical strength one of whose life a friend could never feel sure under any circumstances but he also was already addicted to his fathers vices he also was already killing himself with alcohol  and then if these two men did die within the prescribed period if this clause in sir rogers will were brought to bear if it should become his dr thornes duty to see that clause carried out how would he be bound to act that womans eldest child was his own niece his adopted bairn his darling the pride of his heart the cynosure of his eye his child also his own mary of all his duties on this earth next to that one great duty to his god and conscience was his duty to her what under these circumstances did his duty to her require of him  but then that one great duty that duty which she would be the first to expect from him what did that demand of him had scatcherd made his will without saying what its clauses were it seemed to thorne that mary must have been the heiress should that clause become necessarily operative whether she were so or not would at any rate be for lawyers to decide but now the case was very different this rich man had confided in him and would it not be a breach of confidence an act of absolute dishonestyan act of dishonesty both to scatcherd and to that fardistant american family to that father who in former days had behaved so nobly and to that eldest child of his would it not be gross dishonesty to them all if he allowed this man to leave a will by which his property might go to a person never intended to be his heir  long before he had arrived at greshamsbury his mind on this point had been made up indeed it had been made up while sitting there by scatcherds bedside it had not been difficult to make up his mind to so much but then his way out of this dishonesty was not so easy for him to find how should he set this matter right so as to inflict no injury on his niece and no sorrow to himselfif that indeed could be avoided  and then other thoughts crowded on his brain he had always professedprofessed at any rate to himself and to herthat of all the vile objects of a mans ambition wealth wealth merely for its own sake was the vilest they in their joint school of inherent philosophy had progressed to ideas which they might find it not easy to carry out should they be called on by events to do so and if this would have been difficult to either when acting on behalf of self alone how much more difficult when one might have to act for the other this difficulty had now come to the uncle should he in this emergency take upon himself to fling away the golden chance which might accrue to his niece if scatcherd should be encouraged to make her partly his heir  hed want her to go and live thereto live with him and his wife all the money in the bank of england would not pay her for such misery said the doctor to himself as he slowly rode into is own yard  on one point and one only had he definitely made up his mind on the following day he would go over again to boxall hill and would tell scatcherd the whole truth come what might the truth must be the best and so with some gleam of comfort he went into the house and found his niece in the drawingroom with patience oriel  mary and i have been quarrelling said patience she says the doctor is the greatest man in a village and i say the parson is of course  i only say that the doctor is the most looked after said mary theres another horrid message for you to go to silverbridge uncle why cant that dr century manage his own people  she says continued miss oriel that if a parson was away for a month no one would miss him but that a doctor is so precious that his very minutes are counted  i am sure uncles are they begrudge him his meals mr oriel never gets called away to silverbridge  no we in the church manage our parish arrangements better than you do we dont let strange practitioners in among our flocks because the sheep may chance to fancy them our sheep have to put up with our spiritual doses whether they like them or not in that respect we are much the best off i advise you mary to marry a clergyman by all means  i will when you marry a doctor said she  i am sure nothing on earth would give me greater pleasure said miss oriel getting up and curtseying very low to dr thorne but i am not quite prepared for the agitation of an offer this morning so ill run away  and so she went and the doctor getting on his other horse started again for silverbridge wearily enough shes happy now where she is said he to himself as he rode along they all treat her there as an equal at greshamsbury what though she be no cousin to the thornes of ullathorne she has found her place there among them all and keeps it on equal terms with the best of them there is miss oriel her family is high she is rich fashionable a beauty courted by every one but yet she does not look down on mary they are equal friends together but how would it be if she were taken to boxall hill even as a recognised niece of the rich man there would patience oriel and beatrice gresham go there after her could she be happy there as she is in my house here poor though it be it would kill her to pass a month with lady scatcherd and put up with that mans humours to see his mode of life to be dependent on him to belong to him and then the doctor hurrying on to silverbridge again met dr century at the old ladys bedside and having made his endeavours to stave off the inexorable coming of the grim visitor again returned to his own niece and his own drawingroom  you must be dead uncle said mary as she poured out his tea for him and prepared the comforts of that most comfortable mealtea dinner and supper all in one i wish silverbridge was fifty miles off  that would only make the journey worse but i am not dead yet and what is more to the purpose neither is my patient and as he spoke he contrived to swallow a jorum of scalding tea containing in measure somewhat near a pint mary not a whit amazed at this feat merely refilled the jorum without any observation and the doctor went on stirring the mixture with his spoon evidently oblivious that any ceremony had been performed by either of them since the first supply had been administered to him  when the clatter of knives and forks was over the doctor turned himself to the hearthrug and putting one leg over the other he began to nurse it as he looked with complacency at his third cup of tea which stood untasted beside him the fragments of the solid banquet had been removed but no sacrilegious hand had been laid on the teapot and the creamjug  mary said he suppose you were to find out tomorrow morning that by some accident you had become a great heiress would you be able to suppress your exultation  the first thing id do would be to pronounce a positive edict that you should never go to silverbridge again at least without a days notice  well and what next what would you do next  the next thingthe next thing would be to send to paris for a french bonnet exactly like the one patience oriel had on did you see it  well i cant say i did bonnets are invisible now besides i never remark anybodys clothes except yours  oh do look at miss oriels bonnet the next time you see her i cannot understand why it should be so but i am sure of thisno english fingers could put together such a bonnet as that and i am nearly sure that no french fingers could do it in england  but you dont care so much about bonnets mary this the doctor said as an assertion but there was nevertheless somewhat of a question involved in it  dont i though said she i do care very much about bonnets especially since i saw patience this morning i asked how much it costguess  oh i dont knowa pound  a pound uncle  what a great deal more ten pounds  oh uncle  what more than ten pounds then i dont think even patience oriel ought to give it  no of course she would not but uncle it really cost a hundred francs  oh a hundred francs thats four pounds isnt it well and how much did your last new bonnet cost  mine oh nothingfive and ninepence perhaps i trimmed it myself if i were left a great fortune id send to paris tomorrow no id go myself to paris to buy a bonnet and id take you with me to choose it  the doctor sat silent for a while meditating about this during which he unconsciously absorbed the tea beside him and mary again replenished his cup  come mary said he at last im in a generous mood and as i am rather more rich than usual well send to paris for a french bonnet the going for it must wait a while longer i am afraid  youre joking  no indeed if you know the way to sendthat i must confess would puzzle me but if youll manage the sending ill manage the paying and you shall have a french bonnet  uncle said she looking up at him  oh im not joking i owe you a present and ill give you that  and if you do ill tell you what ill do with it ill cut it into fragments and burn them before your face why uncle what do you take me for youre not a bit nice tonight to make such an offer as that to me not a bit not a bit and then she came over from her seat at the teatray and sat down on a footstool close at his knee because id have a french bonnet if i had a large fortune is that a reason why i should like one now if you were to pay four pounds for a bonnet for me it would scorch my head every time i put it on  i dont see that four pounds would not ruin me however i dont think youd look a bit better if you had it and certainly i should not like to scorch these locks and putting his hand upon her shoulders he played with her hair  patience has a ponyphaeton and id have one if i were rich and id have all my books bound as she does and perhaps id give fifty guineas for a dressingcase  fifty guineas  patience did not tell me but so beatrice says patience showed it to me once and it is a darling i think id have the dressingcase before the bonnet but uncle  well  you dont suppose i want such things  not improperly i am sure you do not  not properly or improperly not much or little i covet many things but nothing of that sort you know or should know that i do not why did you talk of buying a french bonnet for me  dr thorne did not answer this question but went on nursing his leg  after all said he money is a fine thing  very fine when it is well come by she answered that is without detriment to the heart or soul  i should be a happier man if you were provided for as is miss oriel suppose now i could give you up to a rich man who would be able to insure you against all wants  insure me against all wants oh that would be a man that would be selling me wouldnt it uncle yes selling me and the price you would receive would be freedom from future apprehensions as regards me it would be a cowardly sale for you to make and then as to meme the victim no uncle you must bear the misery of having to provide for mebonnets and all we are in the same boat and you shant turn me overboard  but if i were to die what would you do then  and if i were to die what would you do people must be bound together they must depend on each other of course misfortunes may come but it is cowardly to be afraid of them beforehand you and i are bound together uncle and though you say these things to tease me i know you do not wish to get rid of me  well well we shall win through doubtless if not in one way then in another  win through of course we shall who doubts our winning but uncle  but mary  well  you havent got another cup of tea have you  oh uncle you have had five  no my dear not five only fouronly four i assure you i have been very particular to count i had one while i was  five uncle indeed and indeed  well then as i hate the prejudice which attaches luck to an odd number ill have a sixth to show that i am not superstitious  while mary was preparing the sixth jorum there came a knock at the door those late summonses were hateful to marys ear for they were usually the forerunners of a midnight ride through the dark lanes to some farmers house the doctor had been in the saddle all day and as janet brought the note into the room mary stood up as though to defend her uncle from any further invasion on his rest  a note from the house miss said janet now the house in greshamsbury parlance always meant the squires mansion  no one ill at the house i hope said the doctor taking the note from marys hand ohahyes its from the squiretheres nobody ill wait a minute janet and ill write a line mary lend me your desk  the squire anxious as usual for money had written to ask what success the doctor had had in negotiating the new loan with sir roger the fact however was that in his visit at boxall hill the doctor had been altogether unable to bring on the carpet the matter of this loan subjects had crowded themselves in too quickly during that interviewthose two interviews at sir rogers bedside and he had been obliged to leave without even alluding to the question  i must at any rate go back now said he to himself so he wrote to the squire saying that he was to be at boxall hill again on the following day and that he would call at the house on his return  thats settled at any rate said he  whats settled said mary  why i must go to boxall hill again tomorrow i must go early too so wed better both be off to bed tell janet i must breakfast at halfpast seven  you couldnt take me could you i should so like to see that sir roger  to see sir roger why hes ill in bed  thats an objection certainly but some day when hes well could not you take me over i have the greatest desire to see a man like that a man who began with nothing and now has more than enough to buy the whole parish of greshamsbury  i dont think youd like him at all  why not i am sure i should i am sure i should like him and lady scatcherd too ive heard you say that she is an excellent woman  yes in her way and he too is good in his way but they are neither of them in your way they are extremely vulgar  oh i dont mind that that would make them more amusing one doesnt go to those sort of people for polished manners  i dont think youd find the scatcherds pleasant acquaintances at all said the doctor taking his bedcandle and kissing his nieces forehead as he left the room     chapter xii  when greek meets greek then comes the tug of war   the doctor that is our doctor had thought nothing more of the message which had been sent to that other doctor dr fillgrave nor in truth did the baronet lady scatcherd had thought of it but her husband during the rest of the day was not in a humour which allowed her to remind him that he would soon have a new physician on his hands so she left the difficulty to arrange itself waiting in some little trepidation till dr fillgrave should show himself  it was well that sir roger was not dying for want of his assistance for when the message reached barchester dr fillgrave was some five or six miles out of town at plumstead and as he did not get back till late in the evening he felt himself necessitated to put off his visit to boxall hill till next morning had he chanced to have been made acquainted with that little conversation about the pump he would probably have postponed it even yet a while longer  he was however by no means sorry to be summoned to the bedside of sir roger scatcherd it was well known at barchester and very well known to dr fillgrave that sir roger and dr thorne were old friends it was very well known to him also that sir roger in all his bodily ailments had hitherto been contented to entrust his safety to the skill of his old friend sir roger was in his way a great man and much talked of in barchester and rumour had already reached the ears of the barchester galen that the great railway contractor was ill when therefore he received a peremptory summons to go over to boxall hill he could not but think that some pure light had broken in upon sir rogers darkness and taught him at last where to look for true medical accomplishment  and then also sir roger was the richest man in the county and to county practitioners a new patient with large means is a godsend how much greater a godsend when he be not only acquired but taken also from some rival practitioner need hardly be explained  dr fillgrave therefore was somewhat elated when after a very early breakfast he stepped into the postchaise which was to carry him to boxall hill dr fillgraves professional advancement had been sufficient to justify the establishment of a brougham in which he paid his ordinary visits round barchester but this was a special occasion requiring special speed and about to produce no doubt a special guerdon and therefore a pair of posthorses were put into request  it was hardly yet nine when the postboy somewhat loudly rang the bell at sir rogers door and then dr fillgrave for the first time found himself in the new grand hall of boxall hill house  ill tell my lady said the servant showing him into the grand diningroom and there for some fifteen minutes or twenty minutes dr fillgrave walked up and down the length of the turkey carpet all alone  dr fillgrave was not a tall man and was perhaps rather more inclined to corpulence than became his height in his stockingfeet according to the usually received style of measurement he was five feet five and he had a little round abdominal protuberance which an inch and a half added to the heels of his boots hardly enabled him to carry off as well as he himself would have wished of this he was apparently conscious and it gave to him an air of not being entirely at his ease there was however a personal dignity in his demeanour a propriety in his gait and an air of authority in his gestures which should prohibit one from stigmatizing those efforts at altitude as a failure no doubt he did achieve much but nevertheless the effort would occasionally betray itself and the story of the frog and the ox would irresistibly force itself into ones mind at those moments when it most behoved dr fillgrave to be magnificent  but if the bulgy roundness of his person and the shortness of his legs in any way detracted from his personal importance these trifling defects were he was well aware more than atoned for by the peculiar dignity of his countenance if his legs were short his face was not if there was any undue preponderance below the waistcoat all was in due symmetry above the necktie his hair was grey not grizzled nor white but properly grey and stood up straight from off his temples on each side with an unbending determination of purpose his whiskers which were of an admirable shape coming down and turning gracefully at the angle of his jaw were grey also but somewhat darker than his hair his enemies in barchester declared that their perfect shade was produced by a leaden comb his eyes were not brilliant but were very effective and well under command he was rather shortsighted and a pair of eyeglasses was always on his nose or in his hand his nose was long and well pronounced and his chin also was sufficiently prominent but the great feature of his face was his mouth the amount of secret medical knowledge of which he could give assurance by the pressure of those lips was truly wonderful by his lips also he could be most exquisitely courteous or most sternly forbidding and not only could he be either the one or the other but he could at his will assume any shade of difference between the two and produce any mixture of sentiment  when dr fillgrave was first shown into sir rogers diningroom he walked up and down the room for a while with easy jaunty step with his hands joined together behind his back calculating the price of the furniture and counting the heads which might be adequately entertained in a room of such noble proportions but in seven or eight minutes an air of impatience might have been seen to suffuse his face why could he not be shown into the sick mans room what necessity could there be for keeping him there as though he were some apothecary with a box of leeches in his pocket he then rang the bell perhaps a little violently does sir roger know that i am here he said to the servant ill tell my lady said the man again vanishing  for five minutes more he walked up and down calculating no longer the value of the furniture but rather that of his own importance he was not wont to be kept waiting in this way and though sir roger scatcherd was at present a great and rich man dr fillgrave had remembered him a very small and a very poor man he now began to think of sir roger as the stonemason and to chafe somewhat more violently at being so kept by such a man  when one is impatient five minutes is as the duration of all time and a quarter of an hour is eternity at the end of twenty minutes the step of dr fillgrave up and down the room had become very quick and he had just made up his mind that he would not stay there all day to the serious detriment perhaps fatal injury of his other expectant patients his hand was again on the bell and was about to be used with vigour when the door opened and lady scatcherd entered  the door opened and lady scatcherd entered but she did so very slowly as though she were afraid to come into her own diningroom we must go back a little and see how she had been employed during those twenty minutes  oh laws such had been her first exclamation on hearing that the doctor was in the diningroom she was standing at the time with her housekeeper in a small room in which she kept her linen and jam and in which in company with the same housekeeper she spent the happiest moments of her life  oh laws now hannah what shall we do  send un up at once to master my lady let john take un up  therell be such a row in the house hannah i know there will  but surely didnt he send for un let the master have the row himself then thats what id do my lady added hannah seeing that her ladyship still stood trembling in doubt biting her thumbnail  you couldnt go up to the master yourself could you now hannah said lady scatcherd in her most persuasive tone  why no said hannah after a little deliberation no im afeard i couldnt  then i must just face it myself and up went the wife to tell her lord that the physician for whom he had sent had come to attend his bidding  in the interview which then took place the baronet had not indeed been violent but he had been very determined nothing on earth he said should induce him to see dr fillgrave and offend his dear old friend dr thorne  but roger said her ladyship half crying or rather pretending to cry in her vexation what shall i do with the man how shall i get him out of the house  put him under the pump said the baronet and he laughed his peculiar low guttural laugh which told so plainly of the havoc which brandy had made in his throat  thats nonsense roger you know i cant put him under the pump now you are ill and youd better see him just for five minutes ill make it all right with dr thorne  ill be d if i do my lady all the people about boxall hill called poor lady scatcherd my lady as if there was some excellent joke in it and so indeed there was  you know you neednt mind nothing he says nor yet take nothing he sends and ill tell him not to come no more now do ee see him roger  but there was no coaxing roger over now or indeed ever he was a wilful headstrong masterful man a tyrant always though never a cruel one and accustomed to rule his wife and household as despotically as he did his gangs of workmen such men it is not easy to coax over  you go down and tell him i dont want him and wont see him and thats an end of it if he chose to earn his money why didnt he come yesterday when he was sent for im well now and dont want him and whats more i wont have him winterbones lock the door  so winterbones who during this interview had been at work at his little table got up to lock the door and lady scatcherd had no alternative but to pass through it before the last edict was obeyed  lady scatcherd with slow step went downstairs and again sought counsel with hannah and the two putting their heads together agreed that the only cure for the present evil was to found in a good fee so lady scatcherd with a fivepound note in her hand and trembling in every limb went forth to encounter the august presence of dr fillgrave  as the door opened dr fillgrave dropped the bellrope which was in his hand and bowed low to the lady those who knew the doctor well would have known from his bow that he was not well pleased it was as much as though he said lady scatcherd i am your most obedient humble servant at any rate it appears that it is your pleasure to treat me as such  lady scatcherd did not understand all this but she perceived at once that the man was angry  i hope sir roger does not find himself worse said the doctor the morning is getting on shall i step up and see him  hem ha oh why you see dr fillgrave sir roger finds hisself vastly better this morning vastly so  im very glad to hear it but as the morning is getting on shall i step up to see sir roger  why dr fillgrave sir you see he finds hisself so much hisself this morning that he amost thinks it would be a shame to trouble you  a shame to trouble me this was the sort of shame which dr fillgrave did not at all comprehend a shame to trouble me why lady scatcherd  lady scatcherd saw that she had nothing for it but to make the whole matter intelligible moreover seeing that she appreciated more thoroughly the smallness of dr fillgraves person than she did the peculiar greatness of his demeanour she began to be a shade less afraid of him than she had thought she should have been  yes dr fillgrave you see when a man like he gets well he cant abide the idea of doctors now yesterday he was all for sending for you but today he comes to hisself and dont seem to want no doctor at all  then did dr fillgrave seem to grow out of his boots so suddenly did he take upon himself sundry modes of expansive attitudeto grow out of his boots and to swell upwards till his angry eyes almost looked down on lady scatcherd and each erect hair bristled up towards the heavens  this is very singular very singular lady scatcherd very singular indeed very singular quite unusual i have come here from barchester at some considerable inconvenience at some very considerable inconvenience i may say to my regular patients andandandi dont know that anything so very singular ever occurred to me before and then dr fillgrave with a compression of his lips which almost made the poor woman sink into the ground moved towards the door  then lady scatcherd bethought her of her great panacea it isnt about the money you know doctor said she of course sir roger dont expect you to come here with posthorses for nothing in this by the by lady scatcherd did not stick quite close to veracity for sir roger had he known it would by no means have assented to any payment and the note which her ladyship held in her hand was taken from her own private purse it aint at all about the money doctor and then she tendered the banknote which she thought would immediately make all things smooth  now dr fillgrave dearly loved a fivepound fee what physician is so unnatural as not to love it he dearly loved a fivepound fee but he loved his dignity better he was angry also and like all angry men he loved his grievance he felt that he had been badly treated but if he took the money he would throw away his right to indulge in any such feeling at that moment his outraged dignity and his cherished anger were worth more than a fivepound note he looked at it with wishful but still averted eyes and then sternly refused the tender  no madam said he no no and with his right hand raised with his eyeglasses in it he motioned away the tempting paper no i should have been happy to have given sir roger the benefit of any medical skill i may have seeing that i was specially called in  but doctor if the mans well you know  oh of course if hes well and does not choose to see me theres an end of it should he have any relapse as my time is valuable he will perhaps oblige me by sending elsewhere madam good morning i will if you will allow me ring for my carriagethat is postchaise  but doctor youll take the money you must take the money indeed youll take the money said lady scatcherd who had now become really unhappy at the idea that her husbands unpardonable whim had brought this man with posthorses all the way from barchester and that he was to be paid nothing for his time nor costs  no madam no i could not think of it sir roger i have no doubt will know better another time it is not a question of money not at all  but it is a question of money doctor and you really shall you must and poor lady scatcherd in her anxiety to acquit herself at any rate of any pecuniary debt to the doctor came to personal close quarters with him with the view of forcing the note into his hands  quite impossible quite impossible said the doctor still cherishing his grievance and valiantly rejecting the root of all evil i shall not do anything of the kind lady scatcherd  now doctor do ee to oblige me  quite out of the question and so with his hands and hat behind his back in token of his utter refusal to accept any pecuniary accommodation of his injury he made his way backwards to the door her ladyship perseveringly pressing him in front so eager had been the attack on him that he had not waited to give his order about the postchaise but made his way at once towards the hall  now do ee take it do ee pressed lady scatcherd  utterly out of the question said dr fillgrave with great deliberation as he backed his way into the hall as he did so of course he turned roundand he found himself almost in the arms of dr thorne  as burley must have glared at bothwell when they rushed together in the dread encounter on the mountain side as achilles may have glared at hector when at last they met each resolved to test in fatal conflict the prowess of the other so did dr fillgrave glare at his foe from greshamsbury when on turning round on his exalted heel he found his nose on a level with the top button of dr thornes waistcoat  and here if it be not too tedious let us pause a while to recapitulate and add up the undoubted grievances of the barchester practitioner he had made no effort to ingratiate himself into the sheepfold of that other shepherddog it was not by his seeking that he was now at boxall hill much as he hated dr thorne full sure as he felt of that mans utter ignorance of his incapacity to administer properly even a black dose of his murdering propensities and his low mean unprofessional style of practice nevertheless he had done nothing to undermine him with these scatcherds dr thorne might have sent every mothers son at boxall hill to his long account and dr fillgrave would not have interferedwould not have interfered unless specially and duly called upon to do so  but he had been specially and duly called on before such a step was taken some words must undoubtedly have passed on the subject between thorne and the scatcherds thorne must have known what was to be done having been so called dr fillgrave had comehad come all the way in a postchaisehad been refused admittance to the sick mans room on the plea that the sick man was no longer sick and just as he was about to retire feelessfor the want of the fee was not the less a grievance from the fact of its having been tendered and refusedfeeless dishonoured and in dudgeon he encountered this other doctorthis very rival whom he had been sent to supplant he encountered him in the very act of going to the sick mans room  what mad fanatic burley what godsuccoured insolent achilles ever had such cause to swell with wrath as at that moment had dr fillgrave had i the pen of moliere i could fitly tell of such medical anger but with no other pen can it be fitly told he did swell and when the huge bulk of his wrath was added to his natural proportions he loomed gigantic before the eyes of the surrounding followers of sir roger  dr thorne stepped back three steps and took his hat from his head having in the passage from the halldoor to the diningroom hitherto omitted to do so it must be borne in mind that he had no conception whatever that sir roger had declined to see the physician for whom he had sent none whatever that the physician was now about to return feeless to barchester  dr thorne and dr fillgrave were doubtless wellknown enemies all the world of barchester and all that portion of the world of london which is concerned with the lancet and the scalpingknife were well aware of this they were continually writing against each other continually speaking against each other but yet they had never hitherto come to that positive personal collision which is held to justify a cut direct they very rarely saw each other and when they did meet it was in some casual way in the streets of barchester or elsewhere and on such occasions their habit had been to bow with very cold propriety  on the present occasion dr thorne of course felt that dr fillgrave had the whiphand of him and with a sort of manly feeling on such a point he conceived it to be most compatible with his own dignity to show under such circumstances more than his usual courtesysomething perhaps amounting almost to cordiality he had been supplanted quoad doctor in the house of this rich eccentric railway baronet and he would show that he bore no malice on that account  so he smiled blandly as he took off his hat and in a civil speech he expressed a hope that dr fillgrave had not found his patient to be in any very unfavourable state  here was an aggravation to the already lacerated feelings of the injured man he had been brought thither to be scoffed at and scorned at that he might be a laughingstock to his enemies and food for mirth to the vileminded he swelled with noble anger till he would have burst had it not been for the opportune padding of his frockcoat  sir said he sir and he could hardly get his lips open to give vent to the tumult of his heart perhaps he was not wrong for it may be that his lips were more eloquent than would have been his words  whats the matter said dr thorne opening his eyes wide and addressing lady scatcherd over the head and across the hairs of the irritated man below him what on earth is the matter is anything wrong with sir roger  oh laws doctor said her ladyship oh laws im sure it aint my fault heres dr fillgrave in a taking and im quite ready to pay himquite if a man gets paid what more can he want and she again held out the fivepound note over dr fillgraves head  what more indeed lady scatcherd can any of us want if only we could keep our tempers and feelings a little in abeyance dr fillgrave however could not so keep his and therefore he did want something more though at the present moment he could have hardly said what  lady scatcherds courage was somewhat resuscitated by the presence of her ancient trusty ally and moreover she began to conceive that the little man before her was unreasonable beyond all conscience in his anger seeing that that for which he was ready to work had been offered to him without any work at all  madam said he again turning round at lady scatcherd i was never before treated in such a way in any house in barchester nevernever  good heavens dr fillgrave said he of greshamsbury what is the matter  ill let you know what is the matter sir said he turning round again as quickly as before ill let you know what is the matter ill publish this sir to the medical world and as he shrieked out the words of the threat he stood on tiptoes and brandished his eyeglasses up almost into his enemys face  dont be angry with dr thorne said lady scatcherd any ways you neednt be angry with him if you must be angry with anybody  i shall be angry with him madam ejaculated dr fillgrave making another sudden demipirouette i am angry with himor rather i despise him and completing the circle dr fillgrave again brought himself round in full front of his foe  dr thorne raised his eyebrows and looked inquiringly at lady scatcherd but there was a quiet sarcastic motion round his mouth which by no means had the effect of throwing oil on the troubled waters  ill publish the whole of this transaction to the medical world dr thornethe whole of it and if that has not the effect of rescuing the people of greshamsbury out of your hands thenthenthen i dont know what will is my carriagethat is postchaise there and dr fillgrave speaking very loudly turned majestically to one of the servants  what have i done to you dr fillgrave said dr thorne now absolutely laughing that you should determined to take my bread out of my mouth i am not interfering with your patient i have come here simply with reference to money matters appertaining to sir roger  money matters very wellvery well money matters that is your idea of medical practice very wellvery well is my postchaise at the door ill publish it all to the medical worldevery wordevery word of it every word of it  publish what you unreasonable man  man sir whom do you call a man ill let you know whether im a manpostchaise there  dont ee call him names now doctor dont ee pray dont ee said lady scatcherd  by this time they had all got somewhere nearer the halldoor but the scatcherd retainers were too fond of the row to absent themselves willingly at dr fillgraves bidding and it did not appear that any one went in search of the postchaise  man sir ill let you know what it is to speak to me in that style i think sir you hardly know who i am  all that i know of you at present is that you are my friend sir rogers physician and i cannot conceive what has occurred to make you so angry and as he spoke dr thorne looked carefully at him to see whether that pumpdiscipline had in truth been applied there were no signs whatever that cold water had been thrown upon dr fillgrave  my postchaiseis my postchaise there the medical world shall know all you may be sure sir the medical world shall know it all and thus ordering his postchaise and threatening dr thorne with the medical world dr fillgrave made his way to the door  but the moment he put on his hat he returned no madam said he no it is quite out of the question such an affair is not to be arranged by such means ill publish it all to the medical worldpostchaise there and then using all his force he flung as far as he could into the hall a light bit of paper it fell at dr thornes feet who raising it found that it was a fivepound note  i put it into his hat just while he was in his tantrum said lady scatcherd and i thought that perhaps he would not find it till he got to barchester well i wish hed been paid certainly although sir roger wouldnt see him and in this manner dr thorne got some glimpse of understanding into the cause of the great offence  i wonder whether sir roger will see me said he laughing     chapter xiii  the two uncles   ha ha ha ha ha ha laughed sir roger lustily as dr thorne entered the room well if that aint rich i dont know what is ha ha ha but why did they not put him under the pump doctor  the doctor however had too much tact and too many things of importance to say to allow of his giving up much time to the discussion of dr fillgraves wrath he had come determined to open the baronets eyes as to what would be the real effect of his will and he had also to negotiate a loan for mr gresham if that might be possible dr thorne therefore began about the loan that being the easier subject and found that sir roger was quite clearheaded as to his money concerns in spite of his illness sir roger was willing enough to lend mr gresham more moneysix eight ten twenty thousand but then in doing so he should insist on obtaining possession of the titledeeds  what the titledeeds of greshamsbury for a few thousand pounds said the doctor  i dont know whether you call ninety thousand pounds a few thousands but the debt will about amount to that  ah thats the old debt  old and new together of course every shilling i lend more weakens my security for what i have lent before  but you have the first claim sir roger  it ought to be first and last to cover such a debt as that if he wants further accommodation he must part with his deeds doctor  the point was argued backwards and forwards for some time without avail and the doctor then thought it well to introduce the other subject  well sir roger youre a hard man  no i aint said sir roger not a bit hard that is not a bit too hard money is always hard i know i found it hard to come by and there is no reason why squire gresham should expect to find me so very soft  very well there is an end of that i thought you would have done as much to oblige me that is all  what take bad security to oblige you  well theres an end of that  ill tell you what ill do as much to oblige a friend as any one ill lend you five thousand pounds you yourself without security at all if you want it  but you know i dont want it or at any rate shant take it  but to ask me to go on lending money to a third party and he over head and ears in debt by way of obliging you why its a little too much  well theres and end of it now ive something to say to you about that will of yours  oh thats settled  no scatcherd it isnt settled it must be a great deal more settled before we have done with it as youll find when you hear what i have to tell you  what you have to tell me said sir roger sitting up in bed and what have you to tell me  your will says you sisters eldest child  yes but thats only in the event of louis philippe dying before he is twentyfive  exactly and now i know something about your sisters eldest child and therefore i have come to tell you  you know something about marys eldest child  i do scatcherd it is a strange story and maybe it will make you angry i cannot help it if it does so i should not tell you this if i could avoid it but as i do tell you for your sake as you will see and not for my own i must implore you not to tell my secret to others  sir roger now looked at him with an altered countenance there was something in his voice of the authoritative tone of other days something in the doctors look which had on the baronet the same effect which in former days it had sometimes had on the stonemason  can you give me a promise scatcherd that what i am about to tell you shall not be repeated  a promise well i dont know what its about you know i dont like promises in the dark  then i must leave it to your honour for what i have to say must be said you remember my brother scatcherd  remember his brother thought the rich man to himself the name of the doctors brother had not been alluded to between them since the days of that trial but still it was impossible but that scatcherd should well remember him  yes yes certainly i remember your brother said he i remember him well theres no doubt about that  well scatcherd and as he spoke the doctor laid his hand with kindness on the others arm marys eldest child was my brothers child as well  but there is no such child living said sir roger and in his violence as he spoke he threw from off him the bedclothes and tried to stand upon the floor he found however that he had no strength for such an effort and was obliged to remain leaning on the bed and resting on the doctors arm  there was no such child ever lived said he what do you mean by this  dr thorne would say nothing further till he had got the man into bed again this he at last effected and then he went on with the story in his own way  yes scatcherd that child is alive and for fear that you should unintentionally make her your heir i have thought it right to tell you this  a girl is it  yes a girl  and why should you want to spite her if she is marys child she is your brothers child also if she is my niece she must be your niece too why should you want to spite her why should you try to do her such a terrible injury  i do not want to spite her  where is she who is she what is she called where does she live  the doctor did not at once answer all these questions he had made up his mind that he would tell sir roger that this child was living but he had not as yet resolved to make known all the circumstances of her history he was not even yet quite aware whether it would be necessary to say that this foundling orphan was the cherished darling of his own house  such a child is at any rate living said he of that i give you my assurance and under your will as now worded it might come to pass that that child should be your heir i do not want to spite her but i should be wrong to let you make your will without such knowledge seeing that i am possessed of it myself  but where is the girl  i do not know that that signifies  signifies yes it does signify a great deal but thorne thorne now that i remember it now that i can think of things it waswas it not you yourself who told me that the baby did not live  very possibly  and was it a lie that you told me  if so yes but it is no lie that i tell you now  i believed you then thorne then when i was a poor brokendown daylabourer lying in jail rotting there but i tell you fairly i do not believe you now you have some scheme in this  whatever scheme i may have you can frustrate by making another will what can i gain by telling you this i only do so to induce you to be more explicit in naming your heir  they both remained silent for a while during which the baronet poured out from his hidden resource a glass of brandy and swallowed it  when a man is taken aback suddenly by such tidings as these he must take a drop of something eh doctor  dr thorne did not see the necessity but the present he felt was no time for arguing the point  come thorne where is the girl you must tell me that she is my niece and i have a right to know she shall come here and i will do something for her by the lord i would as soon she had the money as any one else if she is anything of a good unsome of it that is is she a good un  good said the doctor turning away his face yes she is good enough  she must be grown up by now none of your light skirts eh  she is a good girl said the doctor somewhat loudly and sternly he could hardly trust himself to say much on this point  mary was a good girl a very good girl tilland sir roger raised himself up in his bed with his fist clenched as though he were again about to strike that fatal blow at the farmyard gate but come its no good thinking of that you behaved well and manly always and so poor marys child is alive at least you say so  i say so and you may believe it why should i deceive you  no no i dont see why but then why did you deceive me before  to this the doctor chose to make no answer and again there was silence for a while  what do you call her doctor  her name is mary  the prettiest womens name going theres no name like it said the contractor with an unusual tenderness in his voice maryyes but mary what what other name does she go by  here the doctor hesitated  mary scatcherdeh  no not mary scatcherd  not mary scatcherd mary what then you with your d pride wouldnt let her be called mary thorne i know  this was too much for the doctor he felt that there were tears in his eyes so he walked away to the window to dry them unseen had he had fifty names each more sacred than the other the most sacred of them all would hardly have been good enough for her  mary what doctor come if the girl is to belong to me if i am to provide for her i must know what to call her and where to look for her  who talked of your providing for her said the doctor turning round at the rival uncle who said that she was to belong to you she will be no burden to you you are only told of this that you may not leave your money to her without knowing it she is provided forthat is she wants nothing she will do well enough you need not trouble yourself about her  but if shes marys child marys child in real truth i will trouble myself about her who else should do so for the matter of that id as soon say her as any of those others in america what do i care about blood i shant mind her being a bastard that is to say of course if shes decently good did she ever get any kind of teaching booklearning or anything of that sort  dr thorne at this moment hated his friend the baronet with almost a deadly hatred that he rough brute as he wasfor he was a rough brutethat he should speak in such language of the angel who gave to that home in greshamsbury so many of the joys of paradisethat he should speak of her as in some degree his own that he should inquire doubtingly as to her attributes and her virtues and then the doctor thought of her italian and french readings of her music of her nice books and sweet lady ways of her happy companionship with patience oriel and her dear bosom friendship with beatrice gresham he thought of her grace and winning manners and soft polished feminine beauty and as he did so he hated sir roger scatcherd and regarded him with loathing as he might have regarded a wallowing hog  at last a light seemed to break in upon sir rogers mind dr thorne he perceived did not answer his last question he perceived also that the doctor was affected with some more than ordinary emotion why should it be that this subject of mary scatcherds child moved him so deeply sir roger had never been at the doctors house at greshamsbury had never seen mary thorne but he had heard that there lived with the doctor some young female relative and thus a glimmering light seemed to come in upon sir rogers bed  he had twitted the doctor with his pride had said that it was impossible that the girl should be called mary thorne what if she were so called what if she were now warming herself at the doctors hearth  well come thorne what is it you call her tell it out man and look you if its your name she bears i shall think more of you a deal more than ever i did yet come thorne im her uncle too i have a right to know she is mary thorne isnt she  the doctor had not the hardihood nor the resolution to deny it yes said he that is her name she lives with me  yes and lives with all those grand folks at greshamsbury too i have heard of that  she lives with me and belongs to me and is as my daughter  she shall come over here lady scatcherd shall have her to stay with her she shall come to us and as for my will ill make another ill  yes make another willor else alter that one but as to miss thorne coming here  what mary  well mary as to mary thorne coming here that i fear will not be possible she cannot have two homes she has cast her lot with one of her uncles and she must remain with him now  do you mean to say that she must never have any relation but one  but one such as i am she would not be happy over here she does not like new faces you have enough depending on you i have but her  enough why i have only louis philippe i could provide for a dozen girls  well well well we will not talk about that  ah but thorne you have told me of this girl now and i cannot but talk of her if you wished to keep the matter dark you should have said nothing about it she is my niece as much as yours and thorne i loved my sister mary quite as well as you loved your brother quite as well  any one who might now have heard and seen the contractor would have hardly thought him to be the same man who a few hours before was urging that the barchester physician should be put under the pump  you have your son scatcherd i have no one but that girl  i dont want to take her from you i dont want to take her but surely there can be no harm in her coming here to see us i can provide for her thorne remember that i can provide for her without reference to louis philippe what are ten or fifteen thousand pounds to me remember that thorne  dr thorne did remember it in that interview he remembered many things and much passed through his mind on which he felt himself compelled to resolve somewhat too suddenly would he be justified in rejecting on behalf of mary the offer of pecuniary provision which this rich relative seemed so well inclined to make or if he accepted it would he in truth be studying her interests scatcherd was a selfwilled obstinate mannow indeed touched by unwonted tenderness but he was one to whose lasting tenderness dr thorne would be very unwilling to trust his darling he did resolve that on the whole he should best discharge his duty even to her by keeping her to himself and rejecting on her behalf any participation in the baronets wealth as mary herself had said some people must be bound together and their destiny that of himself and his niece seemed to have so bound them she had found her place at greshamsbury her place in the world and it would be better for her now to keep it than to go forth and seek another that would be richer but at the same time less suited to her  no scatcherd he said at last she cannot come here she would not be happy here and to tell the truth i do not wish her to know that she has other relatives  ah she would be ashamed of her mother you mean and of her mothers brother too eh shes too fine a lady i suppose to take me by the hand and give me a kiss and call me her uncle i and lady scatcherd would not be grand enough for her eh  you may say what you please scatcherd i of course cannot stop you  but i dont know how youll reconcile what you are doing to your conscience what right can you have to throw away the girls chance now that she has a chance what fortune can you give her  i have done what little i could said thorne proudly  well well well well i never heard such a thing in my life never marys child my own marys child and im not to see her but thorne i tell you what i will see her ill go over to her ill go to greshamsbury and tell her who i am and what i can do for her i tell you fairly i will you shall not keep her away from those who belong to her and can do her a good turn marys daughter another mary scatcherd i almost wish she were called mary scatcherd is she like her thorne come tell me that is she like her mother  i do not remember her mother at least not in health  not remember her ah well she was the handsomest girl in barchester anyhow that was given up to her well i didnt think to be talking of her again thorne you cannot but expect that i shall go over and see marys child  now scatcherd look here and the doctor coming away from the window where he had been standing sat himself down by the bedside you must not come over to greshamsbury  oh but i shall  listen to me scatcherd i do not want to praise myself in any way but when that girl was an infant six months old she was like to be a thorough obstacle to her mothers fortune in life tomlinson was willing to marry your sister but he would not marry the child too then i took the baby and i promised her mother that i would be to her as a father i have kept my word as fairly as i have been able she has sat at my hearth and drunk of my cup and been to me as my own child after that i have a right to judge what is best for her her life is not like your life and her ways are not as your ways  ah that is just it we are too vulgar for her  you may take it as you will said the doctor who was too much in earnest to be in the least afraid of offending his companion i have not said so but i do say that you and she are unlike in your way of living  she wouldnt like an uncle with a brandy bottle under his head eh  you could not see her without letting her know what is the connexion between you of that i wish to keep her in ignorance  i never knew any one yet who was ashamed of a rich connexion how do you mean to get a husband for her eh  i have told you of her existence continued the doctor not appearing to notice what the baronet had last said because i found it necessary that you should know the fact of your sister having left this child behind her you would otherwise have made a will different from that intended and there might have been a lawsuit and mischief and misery when we are gone you must perceive that i have done this in honesty to you and you yourself are too honest to repay me by taking advantage of this knowledge to make me unhappy  oh very well doctor at any rate you are a brick i will say that but ill think of all this ill think of it but it does startle me to find that poor mary has a child living so near to me  and now scatcherd i will say goodbye we part as friends dont we  oh but doctor you aint going to leave me so what am i to do what doses shall i take how much brandy may i drink may i have a grill for dinner d me doctor you have turned fillgrave out of the house you mustnt go and desert me  dr thorne laughed and then sitting himself down to write medically gave such prescriptions and ordinances as he found to be necessary they amounted but to this that the man was to drink if possible no brandy and if that were not possible then as little as might be  this having been done the doctor again proceeded to take his leave but when he got to the door he was called back thorne thorne about that money for mr gresham do what you like do just what you like ten thousand is it well he shall have it ill make winterbones write about it at once five per cent isnt it no four and a half well he shall have ten thousand more  thank you scatcherd thank you i am really very much obliged to you i am indeed i wouldnt ask it if i was not sure your money is safe goodbye old fellow and get rid of that bedfellow of yours and again he was at the door  thorne said sir roger once more thorne just come back for a minute you wouldnt let me send a present would youfifty pounds or sojust to buy a few flounces  the doctor contrived to escape without giving a definite answer to this question and then having paid his compliments to lady scatcherd remounted his cob and rode back to greshamsbury     chapter xiv  sentence of exile   dr thorne did not at once go home to his own house when he reached the greshamsbury gates he sent his horse to its own stable by one of the people at the lodge and then walked on to the mansion he had to see the squire on the subject of the forthcoming loan and he had also to see lady arabella  the lady arabella though she was not personally attached to the doctor with quite so much warmth as some others of her family still had reasons of her own for not dispensing with his visits to the house she was one of his patients and a patient fearful of the disease with which she was threatened though she thought the doctor to be arrogant deficient as to properly submissive demeanour towards herself an instigator to marital parsimony in her lord one altogether opposed to herself and her interest in greshamsbury politics nevertheless she did feel trust in him as a medical man she had no wish to be rescued out of his hands by any dr fillgrave as regarded that complaint of hers much as she may have desired and did desire to sever him from all greshamsbury councils in all matters not touching the healing art  now the complaint of which the lady arabella was afraid was cancer and her only present confidant in this matter was dr thorne  the first of the greshamsbury circle whom he saw was beatrice and he met her in the garden  oh doctor said she where has mary been this age she has not been up here since franks birthday  well that was only three days ago why dont you go down and ferret her out in the village  so i have done i was there just now and found her out she was out with patience oriel patience is all and all with her now patience is all very well but if they throw me over  my dear miss gresham patience is and always was a virtue  a poor beggarly sneaking virtue after all doctor they should have come up seeing how deserted i am here theres absolutely nobody left  has lady de courcy gone  oh yes all the de courcys have gone i think between ourselves mary stays away because she does not love them too well they have all gone and taken augusta and frank with them  has frank gone to courcy castle  oh yes did you not hear there was rather a fight about it master frank wanted to get off and was as hard to catch as an eel and then the countess was offended and papa said he didnt see why frank was to go if he didnt like it papa is very anxious about his degree you know  the doctor understood it all as well as though it had been described to him at full length the countess had claimed her prey in order that she might carry him off to miss dunstables golden embrace the prey not yet old enough and wise enough to connect the worship of plutus with that of venus had made sundry futile feints and dodges in the vain hope of escape then the anxious mother had enforced the de courcy behests with all a mothers authority but the father whose ideas on the subject of miss dunstables wealth had probably not been consulted had as a matter of course taken exactly the other side of the question the doctor did not require to be told all this in order to know how the battle had raged he had not yet heard of the great dunstable scheme but he was sufficiently acquainted with greshamsbury tactics to understand that the war had been carried on somewhat after this fashion  as a rule when the squire took a point warmly to heart he was wont to carry his way against the de courcy interest he could be obstinate enough when it so pleased him and had before now gone so far as to tell his wife that her thricenoble sisterinlaw might remain at home at courcy castleor at any rate not come to greshamsburyif she could not do so without striving to rule him and every one else when she got here this had of course been repeated to the countess who had merely replied to it by a sisterly whisper in which she sorrowfully intimated that some men were born brutes and always would remain so  i think they all are the lady arabella had replied wishing perhaps to remind her sisterinlaw that the breed of brutes was as rampant in west barsetshire as in the eastern division of the county  the squire however had not fought on this occasion with all his vigour there had of course been some passages between him and his son and it had been agreed that frank should go for a fortnight to courcy castle  we mustnt quarrel with them you know if we can help it said the father and therefore you must go sooner or later  well i suppose so but you dont know how dull it is governor  dont i said gresham  theres a miss dunstable to be there did you ever hear of her sir  no never  shes a girl whose father used to make ointment or something of that sort  oh yes to be sure the ointment of lebanon he used to cover all the walls in london i havent heard of him this year past  no thats because hes dead well she carries on the ointment now i believe at any rate she has got all the money i wonder what shes like  youd better go and see said the father who now began to have some inkling of an idea why the two ladies were so anxious to carry his son off to courcy castle at this exact time and so frank had packed up his best clothes given a last fond look at the new black horse repeated his last special injunctions to peter and had then made one of the stately cortège which proceeded through the county from greshamsbury to courcy castle  i am very glad of that very said the squire when he heard that the money was to be forthcoming i shall get it on easier terms from him than elsewhere and it kills me to have continual bother about such things and mr gresham feeling that that difficulty was tided over for a time and that the immediate pressure of little debts would be abated stretched himself on his easy chair as though he were quite comfortableone may say almost elated  how frequent it is that men on their road to ruin feel elation such as this a man signs away a moiety of his substance nay that were nothing but a moiety of the substance of his children he puts his pen to the paper that ruins him and them but in doing so he frees himself from a score of immediate little pestering stinging troubles and therefore feels as though fortune has been almost kind to him  the doctor felt angry with himself for what he had done when he saw how easily the squire adapted himself to this new loan it will make scatcherds claim upon you very heavy said he  mr gresham at once read all that was passing through the doctors mind well what else can i do said he you wouldnt have me allow my daughter to lose this match for the sake of a few thousand pounds it will be well at any rate to have one of them settled look at that letter from moffat  the doctor took the letter and read it it was a long wordy illwritten rigmarole in which that amorous gentleman spoke with much rapture of his love and devotion for miss gresham but at the same time declared and most positively swore that the adverse cruelty of his circumstances was such that it would not allow him to stand up like a man at the hymeneal altar until six thousand pounds hard cash had been paid down at his bankers  it may be all right said the squire but in my time gentlemen were not used to write such letters as that to each other  the doctor shrugged his shoulders he did not know how far he would be justified in saying much even to his friend the squire in dispraise of his future soninlaw  i told him that he should have the money and one would have thought that that would have been enough for him well i suppose augusta likes him i suppose she wishes the match otherwise i would give him such an answer to that letter as would startle him a little  what settlement is he to make said thorne  oh thats satisfactory enough couldnt be more so a thousand a year and the house at wimbledon for her thats all very well but such a lie you know thorne hes rolling in money and yet he talks of this beggarly sum as though he couldnt possibly stir without it  if i might venture to speak my mind said thorne  well said the squire looking at him earnestly  i should be inclined to say that mr moffat wants to cry off himself  oh impossible quite impossible in the first place he was so very anxious for the match in the next place it is such a great thing for him and then he would never dare you see he is dependent on the de courcys for his seat  but suppose he loses his seat  but there is not much fear of that i think scatcherd may be a very fine fellow but i think theyll hardly return him at barchester  i dont understand much about it said thorne but such things do happen  and you believe that this man absolutely wants to get off the match absolutely thinks of playing such a trick as that on my daughteron me  i dont say he intends to do it but it looks to me as though he were making a door for himself or trying to make a door if so your having the money will stop him there  but thorne dont you think he loves the girl if i thought not  the doctor stood silent for a moment and then he said i am not a lovemaking man myself but i think that if i were much in love with a young lady i should not write such a letter as that to her father  by heavens if i thought so said the squirebut thorne we cant judge of those fellows as one does of gentlemen they are so used to making money and seeing money made that they have an eye to business in everything  perhaps so perhaps so muttered the doctor showing evidently that he still doubted the warmth of mr moffats affection  the match was none of my making and i cannot interfere now to break it off it will give her a good position in the world for after all money goes a great way and it is something to be in parliament i can only hope she likes him i do truly hope she likes him and the squire also showed by the tone of his voice that though he might hope that his daughter was in love with her intended husband he hardly conceived it to be possible that she should be so  and what was the truth of the matter miss gresham was no more in love with mr moffat than you areoh sweet young blooming beauty not a whit more not at least in your sense of the word nor in mine she had by no means resolved within her heart that of all the men whom she had ever seen or ever could see he was far away the nicest and best that is what you will do when you are in love if you be good for anything she had no longing to sit near to himthe nearer the better she had no thought of his taste and his choice when she bought her ribbons and bonnets she had no indescribable desire that all her female friends should be ever talking to her about him when she wrote to him she did not copy her letters again and again so that she might be as it were ever speaking to him she took no special pride in herself because he had chosen her to be his lifes partner in point of fact she did not care one straw about him  and yet she thought she loved him was indeed quite confident that she did so told her mother that she was sure gustavus would wish this she knew gustavus would like that and so on but as for gustavus himself she did not care a chip for him  she was in love with her match just as farmers are in love with wheat at eighty shillings a quarter or shareholdersinnocent gudgeonswith seven and half per cent interest on their paidup capital eighty shillings a quarter and seven and half per cent interest such were the returns which she had been taught to look for in exchange for her young heart and having obtained them or being thus about to obtain them why should not her young heart be satisfied had she not sat herself down obediently at the feet of her lady gamaliel and should she not be rewarded yes indeed she shall be rewarded  and then the doctor went to the lady on their medical secrets we will not intrude but there were other matters bearing on the course of our narrative as to which lady arabella found it necessary to say a word or so to the doctor and it is essential that we should know what was the tenor of those few words so spoken  how the aspirations and instincts and feelings of a household become changed as the young birds begin to flutter with feathered wings and have halfformed thoughts of leaving the parental nest a few months back frank had reigned almost autocratic over the lesser subjects of the kingdom of greshamsbury the servants for instance always obeyed him and his sisters never dreamed of telling anything which he directed should not be told all his mischief all his troubles and all his loves were confided to them with the sure conviction that they would never be made to stand in evidence against him  trusting to this wellascertained state of things he had not hesitated to declare his love for miss thorne before his sister augusta but his sister augusta had now as it were been received into the upper house having duly received and duly profited by the lessons of her great instructress she was now admitted to sit in conclave with the higher powers her sympathies of course became changed and her confidence was removed from the young and giddy and given to the ancient and discreet she was as a schoolboy who having finished his schooling and being fairly forced by necessity into the stern breadearning world undertakes the new duties of tutoring yesterday he was taught and fought of course against the schoolmaster today he teaches and fights as keenly for him so it was with augusta gresham when with careful brow she whispered to her mother that there was something wrong between frank and mary thorne  stop it at once arabella stop it at once the countess had said that indeed will be ruin if he does not marry money he is lost good heavens the doctors niece a girl that nobody knows where she comes from  hes going with you tomorrow you know said the anxious mother  yes and that is so far well if he will be led by me the evil may be remedied before he returns but it is very very hard to lead young men arabella you must forbid that girl to come to greshamsbury again on any pretext whatever the evil must be stopped at once  but she is here so much as a matter of course  then she must be here as a matter of course no more there has been folly very great folly in having her here of course she would turn out to be a designing creature with such temptation before her with such a prize within her reach how could she help it  i must say aunt she answered him very properly said augusta  nonsense said the countess before you of course she did arabella the matter must not be left to the girls propriety i never knew the propriety of a girl of that sort to be fit to be depended upon yet if you wish to save the whole family from ruin you must take steps to keep her away from greshamsbury now at once now is the time now that frank is to be away where so much so very much depends on a young mans marrying money not one day ought to be lost  instigated in this manner lady arabella resolved to open her mind to the doctor and to make it intelligible to him that under present circumstances marys visits at greshamsbury had better be discontinued she would have given much however to have escaped this business she had in her time tried one or two falls with the doctor and she was conscious that she had never yet got the better of him and then she was in a slight degree afraid of mary herself she had a presentiment that it would not be so easy to banish mary from greshamsbury she was not sure that that young lady would not boldly assert her right to her place in the schoolroom appeal loudly to the squire and perhaps declare her determination of marrying the heir out before them all the squire would be sure to uphold her in that or in anything else  and then too there would be the greatest difficulty in wording her request to the doctor and lady arabella was sufficiently conscious of her own weakness to know that she was not always very good at words but the doctor when hard pressed was never at fault he could say the bitterest things in the quietest tone and lady arabella had a great dread of these bitter things what also if he should desert her himself withdraw from her his skill and knowledge of her bodily wants and ailments now that he was so necessary to her she had once before taken that measure of sending to barchester for dr fillgrave but it had answered with her hardly better than with sir roger and lady scatcherd  when therefore lady arabella found herself alone with the doctor and called upon to say out her say in what best language she could select for the occasion she did not feel to very much at her ease there was that about the man before her which cowed her in spite of her being the wife of the squire the sister of an earl a person quite acknowledged to be of the great world and the mother of the very important young man whose affections were now about to be called in question nevertheless there was the task to be done and with a mothers courage she essayed it  dr thorne said she as soon as their medical conference was at an end i am very glad you came over today for i had something special which i wanted to say to you so far she got and then stopped but as the doctor did not seem inclined to give her any assistance she was forced to flounder on as best she could  something very particular indeed you know what a respect and esteem and i may say affection we all have for youhere the doctor made a low bowand i may say for mary also here the doctor bowed himself again we have done what little we could to be pleasant neighbours and i think youll believe me when i say that i am a true friend to you and dear mary  the doctor knew that something very unpleasant was coming but he could not at all guess what might be its nature he felt however that he must say something so he expressed a hope that he was duly sensible of all the acts of kindness he had ever received from the squire and the family at large  i hope therefore my dear doctor you wont take amiss what i am going to say  well lady arabella ill endeavour not to do so  i am sure i would not give any pain if i could help it much less to you but there are occasions doctor in which duty must be paramount paramount to all other considerations you know and certainly this occasion is one of them  but what is the occasion lady arabella  ill tell you doctor you know what franks position is  franks position as regards what  why his position in life an only son you know  oh yes i know his position in that respect an only son and his fathers heir and a very fine fellow he is you have but one son lady arabella and you may well be proud of him  lady arabella sighed she did not wish at the present moment to express herself as being in any way proud of frank she was desirous rather on the other hand of showing that she was a good deal ashamed of him only not quite so much ashamed of him as it behoved the doctor to be of his niece  well perhaps so yes said lady arabella he is i believe a very good young man with an excellent disposition but doctor his position is very precarious and he is just at that time of life when every caution is necessary  to the doctors ears lady arabella was now talking of her son as a mother might of her infant when whoopingcough was abroad or croup imminent there is nothing on earth the matter with him i should say said the doctor he has every possible sign of perfect health  oh yes his health yes thank god his health is good that is a great blessing and lady arabella thought of her four flowerets that had already faded i am sure i am most thankful to see him growing up so strong but it is not that i mean doctor  then what is it lady arabella  why doctor you know the squires position with regard to money matters  now the doctor undoubtedly did know the squires position with regard to money mattersknew it much better than did lady arabella but he was by no means inclined to talk on that subject to her ladyship he remained quite silent therefore although lady arabellas last speech had taken the form of a question lady arabella was a little offended at this want of freedom on his part and become somewhat sterner in her tonea thought less condescending in her manner  the squire has unfortunately embarrassed the property and frank must look forward to inherit it with very heavy encumbrances i fear very heavy indeed though of what exact nature i am kept in ignorance  looking at the doctors face she perceived that there was no probability whatever that her ignorance would be enlightened by him  and therefore it is highly necessary that frank should be very careful  as to his private expenditure you mean said the doctor  no not exactly that though of course he must be careful as to that too thats of course but that is not what i mean doctor his only hope of retrieving his circumstances is by marrying money  with every other conjugal blessing that a man can have i hope he may have that also so the doctor replied with imperturbable face but not the less did he begin to have a shade of suspicion of what might be the coming subject of the conference it would be untrue to say that he had ever thought it probable that the young heir should fall in love with his niece that he had ever looked forward to such a chance either with complacency or with fear nevertheless the idea had of late passed through his mind some word had fallen from mary some closely watched expression of her eye or some quiver in her lip when franks name was mentioned had of late made him involuntarily think that such might not be impossible and then when the chance of mary becoming the heiress to so large a fortune had been forced upon his consideration he had been unable to prevent himself from building happy castles in the air as he rode slowly home from boxall hill but not a whit the more on that account was he prepared to be untrue to the squires interest or to encourage a feeling which must be distasteful to all the squires friends  yes doctor he must marry money  and worth lady arabella and a pure feminine heart and youth and beauty i hope he will marry them all  could it be possible that in speaking of a pure feminine heart and youth and beauty and such like gewgaws the doctor was thinking of his niece could it be that he had absolutely made up his mind to foster and encourage this odious match  the bare idea made lady arabella wrathful and her wrath gave her courage he must marry money or he will be a ruined man now doctor i am informed that thingswords that ishave passed between him and mary which never ought to have been allowed  and now also the doctor was wrathful what things what words said he appearing to lady arabella as though he rose in his anger nearly a foot in altitude before her eyes what has passed between them and who says so  doctor there have been lovemakings you may take my word for it lovemakings of a very very very advanced description  this the doctor could not stand no not for greshamsbury and its heir not for the squire and all his misfortunes not for lady arabella and the blood of all the de courcys could he stand quiet and hear mary thus accused he sprang up another foot in height and expanded equally in width as he flung back the insinuation  who says so whoever says so whoever speaks of miss thorne in such language says what is not true i will pledge my word  my dear doctor my dear doctor what took place was quite clearly heard there was no mistake about it indeed  what took place what was heard  well then i dont want you know to make more of it than can be helped the thing must be stopped that is all  what thing speak out lady arabella i will not have marys conduct impugned by innuendoes what is it that eavesdroppers have heard  dr thorne there have been no eavesdroppers  and no talebearers either will you ladyship oblige me by letting me know what is the accusation which you bring against my niece  there has been most positively an offer made dr thorne  and who made it  oh of course i am not going to say but what frank must have been very imprudent of course he has been to blame there has been fault on both sides no doubt  i utterly deny it i positively deny it i know nothing of the circumstances have heard nothing about it  then of course you cant say said lady arabella  i know nothing of the circumstance have heard nothing about it continued dr thorne but i do know my niece and am ready to assert that there has not been fault on both sides whether there has been any fault on any side that i do not yet know  i can assure you dr thorne that an offer was made by frank such an offer cannot be without its allurements to a young lady circumstanced like your niece  allurements almost shouted the doctor and as he did so lady arabella stepped back a pace or two retreating from the fire which shot out of his eyes but the truth is lady arabella you do not know my niece if you will have the goodness to let me understand what it is that you desire i will tell you whether i can comply with your wishes  of course it will be very inexpedient that the young people should be thrown together againfor the present i mean  well  frank has now gone to courcy castle and he talks of going from thence to cambridge but he will doubtless be here backwards and forwards and perhaps it will be better for all partiessafer that is doctorif miss thorne were to discontinue her visits to greshamsbury for a while  very well thundered out the doctor her visits to greshamsbury shall be discontinued  of course doctor this wont change the intercourse between us between you and the family  not change it said he do you think that i will break bread in a house from whence she has been ignominiously banished do you think that i can sit down in friendship with those who have spoken of her as you have now spoken you have many daughters what would you say if i accused one of them as you have accused her  accused doctor no i dont accuse her but prudence you know does sometimes require us  very well prudence requires you to look after those who belong to you and prudence requires me to look after my one lamb good morning lady arabella  but doctor you are not going to quarrel with us you will come when we want you eh wont you  quarrel quarrel with greshamsbury angry as he was the doctor felt that he could ill bear to quarrel with greshamsbury a man past fifty cannot easily throw over the ties that have taken twenty years to form and wrench himself away from the various close ligatures with which in such a period he has become bound he could not quarrel with the squire he could ill bear to quarrel with frank though he now began to conceive that frank had used him badly he could not do so he could not quarrel with the children who had almost been born into his arms nor even with the very walls and trees and grassy knolls with which he was so dearly intimate he could not proclaim himself an enemy to greshamsbury and yet he felt that fealty to mary required of him that for the present he should put on an enemys guise  if you want me lady arabella and send for me i will come to you otherwise i will if you please share the sentence which has been passed on mary i will now wish you good morning and then bowing low to her he left the room and the house and sauntered slowly away to his own home  what was he to say to mary he walked very slowly down the greshamsbury avenue with his hands clasped behind his back thinking over the whole matter thinking of it or rather trying to think of it when a mans heart is warmly concerned in any matter it is almost useless for him to endeavour to think of it instead of thinking he gives play to his feelings and feeds his passion by indulging it allurements he said to himself repeating lady arabellas words a girl circumstanced like my niece how utterly incapable is such a woman as that to understand the mind and heart and soul of such a one as mary thorne and then his thoughts recurred to frank it has been ill done of him ill done of him young as he is he should have had feeling enough to have spared me this a thoughtless word has been spoken which will now make her miserable and then as he walked on he could not divest his mind of the remembrance of what had passed between him and sir roger what if after all mary should become the heiress to all that money what if she should become in fact the owner of greshamsbury for indeed it seemed too possible that sir rogers heir would be the owner of greshamsbury  the idea was one which he disliked to entertain but it would recur to him again and again it might be that a marriage between his niece and the nominal heir to the estate might be of all the matches the best for young gresham to make how sweet would be the revenge how glorious the retaliation on lady arabella if after what had now been said it should come to pass that all the difficulties of greshamsbury should be made smooth by marys love and marys hand it was a dangerous subject on which to ponder and as he sauntered down the road the doctor did his best to banish it from his mindnot altogether successfully  but as he went he again encountered beatrice tell mary i went to her today said she and that i expect her up here tomorrow if she does not come i shall be savage  do not be savage said he putting out his hand even though she should not come  beatrice immediately saw that his manner with her was not playful and that his face was serious i was only in joke said she of course i was only joking but is anything the matter is mary ill  oh no not ill at all but she will not be here tomorrow nor probably for some time but miss gresham you must not be savage with her  beatrice tried to interrogate him but he would not wait to answer her questions while she was speaking he bowed to her in his usual oldfashioned courteous way and passed on out of hearing she will not come up for some time said beatrice to herself then mamma must have quarrelled with her and at once in her heart she acquitted her friend of all blame in the matter whatever it might be and condemned her mother unheard  the doctor when he arrived at his own house had in nowise made up his mind as to the manner in which he would break the matter to mary but by the time that he had reached the drawingroom he had made up his mind to this that he would put off the evil hour till the morrow he would sleep on the matterlie awake on it more probablyand then at breakfast as best he could tell her what had been said of her  mary that evening was more than usually inclined to be playful she had not been quite certain till the morning whether frank had absolutely left greshamsbury and had therefore preferred the company of miss oriel to going up to the house there was a peculiar cheerfulness about her friend patience a feeling of satisfaction with the world and those in it which mary always shared with her and now she had brought home to the doctors fireside in spite of her young troubles a smiling face if not a heart altogether happy  uncle she said at last what makes you so sombre shall i read to you  no not tonight dearest  why uncle what is the matter  nothing nothing  ah but it is something and you shall tell me getting up she came over to his armchair and leant over his shoulder  he looked at her for a minute in silence and then getting up from his chair passed his arm round her waist and pressed her closely to his heart  my darling he said almost convulsively my best own truest darling and mary looking up into his face saw that big tears were running down his cheeks  but still he told her nothing that night     chapter xv  courcy   when frank gresham expressed to his father an opinion that courcy castle was dull the squire as may be remembered did not pretend to differ from him to men such as the squire and such as the squires son courcy castle was dull to what class of men it would not be dull the author is not prepared to say but it may be presumed that the de courcys found it to their liking or they would have made it other than it was  the castle itself was a huge brick pile built in the days of william iii which though they were grand for days of the construction of the constitution were not very grand for architecture of a more material description it had no doubt a perfect right to be called a castle as it was entered by a castlegate which led into a court the porters lodge for which was built as it were into the wall there were attached to it also two round stumpy adjuncts which were perhaps properly called towers though they did not do much in the way of towering and moreover along one side of the house over what would otherwise have been the cornice there ran a castellated parapet through the assistance of which the imagination no doubt was intended to supply the muzzles of defiant artillery but any artillery which would have so presented its muzzle must have been very small and it may be doubted whether even a bowman could have obtained shelter there  the grounds about the castle were not very inviting nor as grounds very extensive though no doubt the entire domain was such as suited the importance of so puissant a nobleman as earl de courcy what indeed should have been the park was divided out into various large paddocks the surface was flat and unbroken and though there were magnificent elmtrees standing in straight lines like hedgerows the timber had not that beautiful wild scattered look which generally gives the great charm to english scenery  the town of courcyfor the place claimed to rank as a townwas in many particulars like the castle it was built of dingyred brickalmost more brown than redand was solid dulllooking ugly and comfortable it consisted of four streets which were formed by two roads crossing each other making at the point of junction a centre for the town here stood the red lion had it been called the brown lion the nomenclature would have been more strictly correct and here in the old days of coaching some life had been wont to stir itself at those hours in the day and night when the freetraders tallyhoes and royal mails changed their horses but now there was a railway station a mile and a half distant and the moving life of the town of courcy was confined to the red lion omnibus which seemed to pass its entire time in going up and down between the town and the station quite unembarrassed by any great weight of passengers  there were so said the courcyites when away from courcy excellent shops in the place but they were not the less accustomed when at home among themselves to complain to each other of the vile extortion with which they were treated by their neighbours the ironmonger therefore though he loudly asserted that he could beat bristol in the quality of his wares in one direction and undersell gloucester in another bought his tea and sugar on the sly in one of those larger towns and the grocer on the other hand equally distrusted the pots and pans of home production trade therefore at courcy had not thriven since the railway had opened and indeed had any patient inquirer stood at the cross through one entire day counting customers who entered the neighbouring shops he might well have wondered that any shops in courcy could be kept open  and how changed has been the bustle of that once noisy inn to the present deathlike silence of its green courtyard there a lame ostler crawls about with his hands thrust into the capacious pockets of his jacket feeding on memory that weary pair of omnibus jades and three sorry posters are all that now grace those stables where horses used to be stalled in close contiguity by the dozen where twenty grains apiece abstracted from every feed of oats consumed during the day would have afforded a daily quart to the lucky pilferer  come my friend and discourse with me let us know what are thy ideas of the inestimable benefits which science has conferred on us in these our latter days how dost thou among others appreciate railways and the power of steam telegraphs telegrams and our new expresses but indifferently you say time was ive zeed vifteen pair o osses go out of this ere yard in vourandtwenty hour and

money did fly in them days but now and the feeling of scorn and contempt which the lame ostler was enabled by his native talent to throw into the word now was quite as eloquent against the power of steam as anything that has been spoken at dinners or written in pamphlets by the keenest admirers of latterday lights  why luke at this ere town continued he of the sieve the grass be agrowing in the

maister harns enough with that there bus to put hiron on them osses feet illbeblowed and as he uttered this hypothetical denunciation on himself he spoke very slowly bringing out every word as it were separately and lowering himself at his knees at every sound moving at the same time his right hand up and down when he had finished he fixed his eyes upon the ground pointing downwards as if there was to be the site of his doom if the curse that he had called down upon himself should ever come to pass and then waiting no further converse he hobbled away melancholy to his deserted stables  oh my friend my poor lame friend it will avail nothing to tell thee of liverpool and manchester of the glories of glasgow with her flourishing banks of london with its third millions of inhabitants of the great things which commerce is doing for this nation of thine what is commerce to thee unless it be commerce in posting on that wornout all but useless great western turnpikeroad there is nothing left for thee but to be carted away as rubbishfor thee and for many of us in these now prosperous days oh my melancholy careridden friend  courcy castle was certainly a dull place to look at and frank in his former visits had found that the appearance did not belie the reality he had been but little there when the earl had been at courcy and as he had always felt from his childhood a peculiar distaste to the governance of his aunt the countess this perhaps may have added to his feeling of dislike now however the castle was to be fuller than he had ever before known it the earl was to be at home there was some talk of the duke of omnium coming for a day or two though that seemed doubtful there was some faint doubt of lord porlock mr moffat intent on the coming electionand also let us hope on his coming blisswas to be one of the guests and there was also to be the great miss dunstable  frank however found that those grandees were not expected quite immediately i might go back to greshamsbury for three or four days as she is not to be here he said naïvely to his aunt expressing with tolerable perspicuity his feeling that he regarded his visit to courcy castle quite as a matter of business but the countess would hear of no such arrangement now that she had got him she was not going to let him fall back into the perils of miss thornes intrigues or even of miss thornes propriety it is quite essential she said that you should be here a few days before her so that she may see that you are at home frank did not understand the reasoning but he felt himself unable to rebel and he therefore remained there comforting himself as best he might with the eloquence of the honourable george and the sporting humours of the honourable john  mr moffats was the earliest arrival of any importance frank had not hitherto made the acquaintance of his future brotherinlaw and there was therefore some little interest in the first interview mr moffat was shown into the drawingroom before the ladies had gone up to dress and it so happened that frank was there also as no one else was in the room but his sister and two of his cousins he had expected to see the lovers rush into each others arms but mr moffat restrained his ardour and miss gresham seemed contented that he should do so  he was a nice dapper man rather above the middle height and goodlooking enough had he had a little more expression in his face he had dark hair very nicely brushed small black whiskers and a small black moustache his boots were excellently well made and his hands were very white he simpered gently as he took hold of augustas fingers and expressed a hope that she had been quite well since last he had the pleasure of seeing her then he touched the hands of the lady rosina and the lady margaretta  mr moffat allow me to introduce you to my brother  most happy im sure said mr moffat again putting out his hand and allowing it to slip through franks grasp as he spoke in a pretty mincing voice lady arabella quite welland your father and sisters very warm isnt itquite hot in town i do assure you  i hope augusta likes him said frank to himself arguing on the subject exactly as his father had done but for an engaged lover he seems to me to have a very queer way with him frank poor fellow who was of a coarser mould would under such circumstances have been all for kissingsometimes indeed even under other circumstances  mr moffat did not do much towards improving the conviviality of the castle he was of course a good deal intent upon his coming election and spent much of his time with mr nearthewinde the celebrated parliamentary agent it behoved him to be a good deal at barchester canvassing the electors and undermining by mr nearthewindes aid the mines for blowing him out of his seat which were daily being contrived by mr closerstil on behalf of sir roger the battle was to be fought on the internecine principle no quarter being given or taken on either side and of course this gave mr moffat as much as he knew how to do  mr closerstil was well known to be the sharpest man at his business in all england unless the palm should be given to his great rival mr nearthewinde and in this instance he was to be assisted in the battle by a very clever young barrister mr romer who was an admirer of sir rogers career in life some people in barchester when they saw sir roger closerstil and mr romer saunter down the high street arm in arm declared that it was all up with poor moffat but others in whose head the bump of veneration was strongly pronounced whispered to each other that great shibboleththe name of the duke of omniumand mildly asserted it to be impossible that the dukes nominee should be thrown out  our poor friend the squire did not take much interest in the matter except in so far that he liked his soninlaw to be in parliament both the candidates were in his eye equally wrong in their opinions he had long since recanted those errors of his early youth which had cost him his seat for the county and had abjured the de courcy politics he was staunch enough as a tory now that his being so would no longer be of the slightest use to him but the duke of omnium and lord de courcy and mr moffat were all whigs whigs however differing altogether in politics from sir roger who belonged to the manchester school and whose pretensions through some of those inscrutable twists in modern politics which are quite unintelligible to the minds of ordinary men outside the circle were on this occasion secretly favoured by the high conservative party  how mr moffat who had been brought into the political world by lord de courcy obtained all the weight of the dukes interest i never could exactly learn for the duke and the earl did not generally act as twinbrothers on such occasions  there is a great difference in whigs lord de courcy was a court whig following the fortunes and enjoying when he could get it the sunshine of the throne he was a sojourner at windsor and a visitor at balmoral he delighted in gold sticks and was never so happy as when holding some cap of maintenance or spur of precedence with due dignity and acknowledged grace in the presence of all the court his means had been somewhat embarrassed by early extravagance and therefore as it was to his taste to shine it suited him to shine at the cost of the court rather than at his own  the duke of omnium was a whig of a very different calibre he rarely went near the presence of majesty and when he did do so he did it merely as a disagreeable duty incident to his position he was very willing that the queen should be queen so long as he was allowed to be duke of omnium nor had he begrudged prince albert any of his honours till he was called prince consort then indeed he had to his own intimate friends made some remark in three words not flattering to the discretion of the prime minister the queen might be queen so long as he was duke of omnium their revenues were about the same with the exception that the dukes were his own and he could do what he liked with them this remembrance did not unfrequently present itself to the dukes mind in person he was a plain thin man tall but undistinguished in appearance except that there was a gleam of pride in his eye which seemed every moment to be saying i am the duke of omnium he was unmarried and if report said true a great debauchee but if so he had always kept his debaucheries decently away from the eyes of the world and was not therefore open to that loud condemnation which should fall like a hailstorm round the ears of some more open sinners  why these two mighty nobles put their heads together in order that the tailors son should represent barchester in parliament i cannot explain mr moffat was as has been said lord de courcys friend and it may be that lord de courcy was able to repay the duke for his kindness as touching barchester with some little assistance in the county representation  the next arrival was that of the bishop of barchester a meek good worthy man much attached to his wife and somewhat addicted to his ease she apparently was made in a different mould and by her energy and diligence atoned for any want in those qualities which might be observed in the bishop himself when asked his opinion his lordship would generally reply by sayingmrs proudie and i think so and so but before that opinion was given mrs proudie would take up the tale and she in her more concise manner was not wont to quote the bishop as having at all assisted in the consideration of the subject it was well known in barsetshire that no married pair consorted more closely or more tenderly together and the example of such conjugal affection among persons in the upper classes is worth mentioning as it is believed by those below them and too often with truth that the sweet bliss of connubial reciprocity is not so common as it should be among the magnates of the earth  but the arrival even of the bishop and his wife did not make the place cheerful to frank gresham and he began to long for miss dunstable in order that he might have something to do he could not get on at all with mr moffat he had expected that the man would at once have called him frank and that he would have called the man gustavus but they did not even get beyond mr moffat and mr gresham very hot in barchester today very was the nearest approach to conversation which frank could attain with him and as far as he frank could see augusta never got much beyond it there might be têteàtête meetings between them but if so frank could not detect when they took place and so opening his heart at last to the honourable george for the want of a better confidant he expressed his opinion that his future brotherinlaw was a muff  a muffi believe you too what do you think now i have been with him and nearthewinde in barchester these three days past looking up the electors wives and daughters and that kind of thing  i say if there is any fun in it you might as well take me with you  oh there is not much fun they are mostly so slobbered and dirty a sharp fellow in nearthewinde and knows what he is about well  does he look up the wives and daughters too  oh he goes on every tack just as its wanted but there was moffat yesterday in a room behind the milliners shop near cuthberts gate i was with him the womans husband is one of the choristers and an elector you know and moffat went to look for his vote now there was no one there when we got there but the three young women the wife that is and her two girlsvery pretty women they are too  i say george ill go and get the choristers vote for moffat i ought to do it as hes to be my brotherinlaw  but what do you think moffat said to the women  cant guesshe didnt kiss any of them did he  kiss any of them no but he begged to give them his positive assurance as a gentleman that if he was returned to parliament he would vote for an extension of the franchise and the admission of the jews into parliament  well he is a muff said frank     chapter xvi  miss dunstable   at last the great miss dunstable came frank when he heard that the heiress had arrived felt some slight palpitation at his heart he had not the remotest idea in the world of marrying her indeed during the last week past absence had so heightened his love for mary thorne that he was more than ever resolved that he would never marry any one but her he knew that he had made her a formal offer for her hand and that it behoved him to keep to it let the charms of miss dunstable be what they might but nevertheless he was prepared to go through a certain amount of courtship in obedience to his aunts behests and he felt a little nervous at being brought up in that way face to face to do battle with two hundred thousand pounds  miss dunstable has arrived said his aunt to him with great complacency on his return from an electioneering visit to the beauties of barchester which he made with his cousin george on the day after the conversation which was repeated at the end of the last chapter she has arrived and is looking remarkably well she has quite a distingué air and will grace any circle to which she may be introduced i will introduce you before dinner and you can take her out  i couldnt propose to her tonight i suppose said frank maliciously  dont talk nonsense frank said the countess angrily i am doing what i can for you and taking on an infinity of trouble to endeavour to place you in an independent position and now you talk nonsense to me  frank muttered some sort of apology and then went to prepare himself for the encounter  miss dunstable though she had come by train had brought with her her own carriage her own horses her own coachman and footman and her own maid of course she had also brought with her half a score of trunks full of wearing apparel some of them nearly as rich as that wonderful box which was stolen a short time since from the top of a cab but she brought all these things not in the least because she wanted them herself but because she had been instructed to do so  frank was a little more than ordinarily careful in dressing he spoilt a couple of white neckties before he was satisfied and was rather fastidious as the set of his hair there was not much of the dandy about him in the ordinary meaning of the word but he felt that it was incumbent on him to look his best seeing what it was expected that he should now do he certainly did not mean to marry miss dunstable but as he was to have a flirtation with her it was well that he should do so under the best possible auspices  when he entered the drawingroom he perceived at once that the lady was there she was seated between the countess and mrs proudie and mammon in her person was receiving worship from the temporalities and spiritualities of the land he tried to look unconcerned and remained in the farther part of the room talking with some of his cousins but he could not keep his eye off the future possible mrs frank gresham and it seemed as though she was as much constrained to scrutinise him as he felt to scrutinise her  lady de courcy had declared that she was looking extremely well and had particularly alluded to her distingué appearance frank at once felt that he could not altogether go along with his aunt in this opinion miss dunstable might be very well but her style of beauty was one which did not quite meet with his warmest admiration  in age she was about thirty but frank who was no great judge in these matters and who was accustomed to have very young girls round him at once put her down as being ten years older she had a very high colour very red cheeks a large mouth big white teeth a broad nose and bright small black eyes her hair also was black and bright but very crisp and strong and was combed close round her face in small crisp black ringlets since she had been brought out into the fashionable world some one of her instructors in fashion had given her to understand that curls were not the thing theyll always pass muster miss dunstable had replied when they are done up with banknotes it may therefore be presumed that miss dunstable had a will of her own  frank said the countess in the most natural and unpremeditated way as soon as she caught her nephews eye come here i want to introduce you to miss dunstable the introduction was then made mrs proudie would you excuse me i must positively go and say a few words to mrs barlow or the poor woman will feel herself huffed and so saying she moved off leaving the coast clear for master frank  he of course slipped into his aunts place and expressed a hope that miss dunstable was not fatigued by her journey  fatigued said she in a voice rather loud but very goodhumoured and not altogether unpleasing i am not to be fatigued by such a thing as that why in may we came through all the way from rome to paris without sleepingthat is without sleeping in a bedand we were upset three times out of the sledges coming over the simplon it was such fun why i wasnt to say tired even then  all the way from rome to paris said mrs proudiein a tone of astonishment meant to flatter the heiressand what made you in such a hurry  something about money matters said miss dunstable speaking rather louder than usual something to do with the ointment i was selling the business just then  mrs proudie bowed and immediately changed the conversation idolatry is i believe more rampant than ever in rome said she and i fear there is no such thing at all as sabbath observance  oh not in the least said miss dunstable with rather a joyous air sundays and weekdays are all the same there  how very frightful said mrs proudie  but its a delicious place i do like rome i must say and as for the pope if he wasnt quite so fat he would be the nicest old fellow in the world have you been in rome mrs proudie  mrs proudie sighed as she replied in the negative and declared her belief that danger was to be apprehended from such visits  ohahthe malariaof courseyes if you go at the wrong time but nobody is such a fool as that now  i was thinking of the soul miss dunstable said the ladybishop in her peculiar grave tone a place where there are no sabbath observances  and have you been in rome mr gresham said the young lady turning almost abruptly round to frank and giving a somewhat uncivilly cold shoulder to mrs proudies exhortation she poor lady was forced to finish her speech to the honourable george who was standing near to her he having an idea that bishops and all their belongings like other things appertaining to religion should if possible be avoided but if that were not possible should be treated with much assumed gravity immediately put on a long face and remarked thatit was a deuced shame for his part he always liked to see people go quiet on sundays the parsons had only one day out of seven and he thought they were fully entitled to that satisfied with which or not satisfied mrs proudie had to remain silent till dinnertime  no said frank i never was in rome i was in paris once and thats all and then feeling a not unnatural anxiety as to the present state of miss dunstables worldly concerns he took an opportunity of falling back on that part of the conversation which mrs proudie had exercised so much tact in avoiding  and was it sold said he  sold what sold  you were saying about the businessthat you came back without going to bed because of selling the business  ohthe ointment no it was not sold after all the affair did not come off and i might have remained and had another roll in the snow wasnt it a pity  so said frank to himself if i should do it i should be owner of the ointment of lebanon how odd and then he gave her his arm and handed her down to dinner  he certainly found that the dinner was less dull than any other he had sat down to at courcy castle he did not fancy that he should ever fall in love with miss dunstable but she certainly was an agreeable companion she told him of her tour and the fun she had in her journeys how she took a physician with her for the benefit of her health whom she generally was forced to nurse of the trouble it was to her to look after and wait upon her numerous servants of the tricks she played to bamboozle people who came to stare at her and lastly she told him of a lover who followed her from country to country and was now in hot pursuit of her having arrived in london the evening before she left  a lover said frank somewhat startled by the suddenness of the confidence  a loveryesmr gresham why should i not have a lover  ohnoof course not i dare say you have a good many  only three or four upon my word that is only three or four that i favour one is not bound to reckon the others you know  no theyd be too numerous and so you have three whom you favour miss dunstable and frank sighed as though he intended to say that the number was too many for his peace of mind  is not that quite enough but of course i change them sometimes and she smiled on him very goodnaturedly it would be very dull if i were always to keep the same  very dull indeed said frank who did not quite know what to say  do you think the countess would mind my having one or two of them here if i were to ask her  i am quite sure she would said frank very briskly she would not approve of it at all nor should i  youwhy what have you to do with it  a great dealso much so that i positively forbid it but miss dunstable  well mr gresham  we will contrive to make up for the deficiency as well as possible if you will permit us to do so now for myself  well for yourself  at this moment the countess gleamed her accomplished eye round the table and miss dunstable rose from her chair as frank was preparing his attack and accompanied the other ladies into the drawingroom  his aunt as she passed him touched his arm lightly with her fan so lightly that the action was perceived by no one else but frank well understood the meaning of the touch and appreciated the approbation which it conveyed he merely blushed however at his own dissimulation for he felt more certain that ever that he would never marry miss dunstable and he felt nearly equally sure that miss dunstable would never marry him  lord de courcy was now at home but his presence did not add much hilarity to the claretcup the young men however were very keen about the election and mr nearthewinde who was one of the party was full of the most sanguine hopes  i have done one good at any rate said frank i have secured the choristers vote  what bagley said nearthewinde the fellow kept out of my way and i couldnt see him  i havent exactly seen him said frank but ive got his vote all the same  what by a letter said mr moffat  no not by letter said frank speaking rather low as he looked at the bishop and the earl i got a promise from his wife i think hes a little in the henpecked line  hahaha laughed the good bishop who in spite of franks modulation of voice had overheard what had passed is that the way you manage electioneering matters in our cathedral city hahaha the idea of one of his choristers being in the henpecked line was very amusing to the bishop  oh i got a distinct promise said frank in his pride and then added incautiously but i had to order bonnets for the whole family  hushhhhh said mr nearthewinde absolutely flabbergasted by such imprudence on the part of one of his clients friends i am quite sure that your order had no effect and was intended to have no effect on mr bagleys vote  is that wrong said frank upon my word i thought that it was quite legitimate  one should never admit anything in electioneering matters should one said george turning to mr nearthewinde  very little mr de courcy very little indeedthe less the better its hard to say in these days what is wrong and what is not now theres reddypalm the publican the man who has the brown bear well i was there of course hes a voter and if any man in barchester ought to feel himself bound to vote for a friend of the dukes he ought now i was so thirsty when i was in that mans house that i was dying for a glass of beer but for the life of me i didnt dare order one  why not said frank whose mind was only just beginning to be enlightened by the great doctrine of purity of election as practised in english provincial towns  oh closerstil had some fellow looking at me why i cant walk down that town without having my very steps counted i like sharp fighting myself but i never go so sharp as that  nevertheless i got bagleys vote said frank persisting in praise of his own electioneering prowess and you may be sure of this mr nearthewinde none of closerstils men were looking at me when i got it  wholl pay for the bonnets frank said george  oh ill pay for them if moffat wont i think i shall keep an account there they seem to have good gloves and those sort of things  very good i have no doubt said george  i suppose your lordship will be in town soon after the meeting of parliament said the bishop questioning the earl  oh yes i suppose i must be there i am never allowed to remain very long in quiet it is a great nuisance but it is too late to think of that now  men in high places my lord never were and never will be allowed to consider themselves they burn their torches not in their own behalf said the bishop thinking perhaps as much of himself as he did of his noble friend rest and quiet are the comforts of those who have been content to remain in obscurity  perhaps so said the earl finishing his glass of claret with an air of virtuous resignation perhaps so his own martyrdom however had not been severe for the rest and quiet of home had never been peculiarly satisfactory to his tastes soon after this they all went to the ladies  it was some little time before frank could find an opportunity of recommencing his allotted task with miss dunstable she got into conversation with the bishop and some other people and except that he took her teacup and nearly managed to squeeze one of her fingers as he did so he made very little further progress till towards the close of the evening  at last he found her so nearly alone as to admit of his speaking to her in his low confidential voice  have you managed that matter with my aunt  what matter said miss dunstable and her voice was not low nor particularly confidential  about those three or four gentlemen whom you wish to invite here  oh my attendant knights no indeed you gave me such very slight hope of success besides you said something about my not wanting them  yes i did i really think theyd be quite unnecessary if you should want any one to defend you  at these coming elections for instance  then or at any other time there are plenty here who will be ready to stand up for you  plenty i dont want plenty one good lance in the olden days was always worth more than a score of ordinary menatarms  but you talked about three or four  yes but then you see mr gresham i have never yet found the one good lanceat least not good enough to suit my ideas of true prowess  what could frank do but declare that he was ready to lay his own in rest now and always in her behalf his aunt had been quite angry with him and had thought that he turned her into ridicule when he spoke of making an offer to her guest that very evening and yet here he was so placed that he had hardly an alternative let his inward resolution to abjure the heiress be ever so strong he was now in a position which allowed him no choice in the matter even mary thorne could hardly have blamed him for saying that so far as his own prowess went it was quite at miss dunstables service had mary been looking on she perhaps might have thought that he could have done so with less of that look of devotion which he threw into his eyes  well mr gresham thats very civilvery civil indeed said miss dunstable upon my word if a lady wanted a true knight she might do worse than trust to you only i fear that your courage is of so exalted a nature that you would be ever ready to do battle for any beauty who might be in distressor indeed who might not you could never confine your valour to the protection of one maiden  oh yes but i would though if i liked her said frank there isnt a more constant fellow in the world than i am in that wayyou try me miss dunstable  when young ladies make such trials as that they sometimes find it too late to go back if the trial doesnt succeed mr gresham  oh of course theres always some risk its like hunting there would be no fun if there was no danger  but if you get a tumble one day you can retrieve your honour the next but a poor girl if she once trusts a man who says that he loves her has no such chance for myself i would never listen to a man unless id known him for seven years at least  seven years said frank who could not help thinking that in seven years time miss dunstable would be almost an old woman seven days is enough to know any person  or perhaps seven hours eh mr gresham  seven hourswell perhaps seven hours if they happen to be a good deal together during the time  theres nothing after all like love at first sight is there mr gresham  frank knew well enough that she was quizzing him and could not resist the temptation he felt to be revenged on her i am sure its very pleasant said he but as for myself i have never experienced it  ha ha ha laughed miss dunstable upon my word mr gresham i like you amazingly i didnt expect to meet anybody down here that i should like half so much you must come and see me in london and ill introduce you to my three knights and so saying she moved away and fell into conversation with some of the higher powers  frank felt himself to be rather snubbed in spite of the strong expression which miss dunstable had made in his favour it was not quite clear to him that she did not take him for a boy he was to be sure avenged on her for that by taking her for a middleaged woman but nevertheless he was hardly satisfied with himself i might give her a heartache yet said he to himself and she might find afterwards that she was left in the lurch with all her money and so he retired solitary into a far part of the room and began to think of mary thorne as he did so and as his eyes fell upon miss dunstables stiff curls he almost shuddered  and then the ladies retired his aunt with a goodnatured smile on her face come to him as she was leaving the room the last of the bevy and putting her hand on his arm led him out into a small unoccupied chamber which opened from the grand saloon  upon my word master frank said she you seem to be losing no time with the heiress you have quite made an impression already  i dont know much about that aunt said he looking rather sheepish  oh i declare you have but frank my dear boy you should not precipitate these sort of things too much it is well to take a little more time it is more valued and perhaps you know on the whole  perhaps frank might know but it was clear that lady de courcy did not at any rate she did not know how to express herself had she said out her mind plainly she would probably have spoken thus i want you to make love to miss dunstable certainly or at any rate to make an offer to her but you need not make a show of yourself and of her too by doing it so openly as all that the countess however did not want to reprimand her obedient nephew and therefore did not speak out her thoughts  well said frank looking up into her face  take a leetle more timethat is all my dear boy slow and sure you know so the countess again patted his arm and went away to bed  old fool muttered frank to himself as he returned to the room where the men were still standing he was right in this she was an old fool or she would have seen that there was no chance whatever that her nephew and miss dunstable should become man and wife  well frank said the honourable john so youre after the heiress already  he wont give any of us a chance said the honourable george if he goes on in that way shell be mrs gresham before a month is over but frank what will she say of your manner of looking for barchester votes  mr gresham is certainly an excellent hand at canvassing said mr nearthewinde only a little too open in his manner of proceeding  i got that chorister for you at any rate said frank and you would never have had him without me  i dont think half so much of the choristers vote as that of miss dunstable said the honourable george thats the interest that is really worth looking after  but surely said mr moffat miss dunstable has no property in barchester poor man his heart was so intent on his election that he had not a moment to devote to the claims of love     chapter xvii  the election   and now the important day of the election had arrived and some mens hearts beat quickly enough to be or not to a member of the british parliament is a question of very considerable moment in a mans mind much is often said of the great penalties which the ambitious pay for enjoying this honour of the tremendous expenses of elections of the long tedious hours of unpaid labour of the weary days passed in the house but nevertheless the prize is one very well worth the price paid for itwell worth any price that can be paid for it short of wading through dirt and dishonour  no other great european nation has anything like it to offer to the ambition of its citizens for in no other great country of europe not even in those which are free has the popular constitution obtained as with us true sovereignty and power of rule here it is so and when a man lays himself out to be a member of parliament he plays the highest game and for the highest stakes which the country affords  to some men born silverspooned a seat in parliament comes as a matter of course from the time of their early manhood they hardly know what it is not to sit there and the honour is hardly appreciated being too much a matter of course as a rule they never know how great a thing it is to be in parliament though when reverse comes as reverses occasionally will come they fully feel how dreadful it is to be left out  but to men aspiring to be members or to those who having been once fortunate have again to fight the battle without assurance of success the coming election must be matter of dread concern oh how delightful to hear that the longtalkedof rival has declined the contest and that the course is clear or to find by a short canvass that ones majority is safe and the pleasures of crowing over an unlucky friendless foe quite secured  no such gratification as this filled the bosom of mr moffat on the morning of the barchester election to him had been brought no positive assurance of success by his indefatigable agent mr nearthewinde it was admitted on all sides that the contest would be a very close one and mr nearthewinde would not do more than assert that they ought to win unless things went very wrong with them  mr nearthewinde had other elections to attend to and had not been remaining at courcy castle ever since the coming of miss dunstable but he had been there and at barchester as often as possible and mr moffat was made greatly uneasy by reflecting how very high the bill would be  the two parties had outdone each other in the loudness of their assertions that each would on his side conduct the election in strict conformity to law there was to be no bribery bribery who indeed in these days would dare to bribe to give absolute money for an absolute vote and pay for such an article in downright palpable sovereigns no purity was much too rampant for that and the means of detection too well understood but purity was to be carried much further than this there should be no treating no hiring of two hundred voters to act as messengers at twenty shillings a day in looking up some four hundred other voters no bands were to be paid for no carriages furnished no ribbons supplied british voters were to vote if vote they would for the love and respect they bore to their chosen candidate if so actuated they would not vote they might stay away no other inducement would be offered  so much was said loudlyvery loudlyby each party but nevertheless mr moffat early in these election days began to have some misgivings about the bill the proclaimed arrangement had been one exactly suitable to his taste for mr moffat loved his money he was a man in whose breast the ambition of being great in the world and of joining himself to aristocratic people was continually at war with the great cost which such tastes occasioned his last election had not been a cheap triumph in one way or another money had been dragged from him for purposes which had been to his mind unintelligible and when about the middle of his first session he had with much grumbling settled all demands he had questioned with himself whether his whistle was worth its cost  he was therefore a great stickler for purity of election although had he considered the matter he should have known that with him money was his only passport into that elysium in which he had now lived for two years he probably did not consider it for when in those canvassing days immediately preceding the election he had seen that all the beerhouses were open and half the population was drunk he had asked mr nearthewinde whether this violation of the treaty was taking place only on the part of his opponent and whether in such case it would not be duly noticed with a view to a possible future petition  mr nearthewinde assured him triumphantly that half at least of the wallowing swine were his own especial friends and that somewhat more than half of the publicans of the town were eagerly engaged in fighting his mr moffats battle mr moffat groaned and would have expostulated had mr nearthewinde been willing to hear him but that gentlemans services had been put into requisition by lord de courcy rather than by the candidate for the candidate he cared but little to pay the bill would be enough for him he mr nearthewinde was doing his business as he well knew how to do it and it was not likely that he should submit to be lectured by such as mr moffat on a trumpery score of expense  it certainly did appear on the morning of the election as though some great change had been made in that resolution of the candidates to be very pure from an early hour rough bands of music were to be heard in every part of the usually quiet town carts and gigs omnibuses and flys all the old carriages from all the innyards and every vehicle of any description which could be pressed into the service were in motion if the horses and postboys were not to be paid for by the candidates the voters themselves were certainly very liberal in their mode of bringing themselves to the poll the election district of the city of barchester extended for some miles on each side of the city so that the omnibuses and flys had enough to do beer was to be had at the publichouses almost without question by all who chose to ask for it and rum and brandy were dispensed to select circles within the bars with equal profusion as for ribbons the mercers shops must have been emptied of that article as far as scarlet and yellow were concerned scarlet was sir rogers colour while the friends of mr moffat were decked with yellow seeing what he did see mr moffat might well ask whether there had not been a violation of the treaty of purity  at the time of this election there was some question whether england should go to war with all her energy or whether it would not be better for her to save her breath to cool her porridge and not meddle more than could be helped with foreign quarrels the last view of the matter was advocated by sir roger and his motto of course proclaimed the merits of domestic peace and quiet peace abroad and a big loaf at home was consequently displayed on four or five huge scarlet banners and carried waving over the heads of the people but mr moffat was a staunch supporter of the government who were already inclined to be belligerent and englands honour was therefore the legend under which he selected to do battle it may however be doubted whether there was in all barchester one inhabitantlet alone one electorso fatuous as to suppose that englands honour was in any special manner dear to mr moffat or that he would be a whit more sure of a big loaf than he was now should sir roger happily become a member of the legislature  and then the fine arts were resorted to seeing that language fell short in telling all that was found necessary to be told poor sir rogers failing as regards the bottle was too well known and it was also known that in acquiring his title he had not quite laid aside the rough mode of speech which he had used in his early years there was consequently a great daub painted up on sundry walls on which a navvy with a pimply bloated face was to be seen standing on a railway bank leaning on a spade holding a bottle in one hand while he invited a comrade to drink come jack shall us have a drop of someat short were the words coming out of the navvys mouth and under this was painted in huge letters      the last new baronet   but mr moffat hardly escaped on easier terms the trade by which his father had made his money was as well known as that of the railway contractor and every possible symbol of tailordom was displayed in graphic portraiture on the walls and hoardings of the city he was drawn with his goose with his scissors with his needle with his tapes he might be seen measuring cutting stitching pressing carrying home his bundle and presenting his little bill and under each of these representations was repeated his own motto englands honour  such were the pleasant little amenities with which the people of barchester greeted the two candidates who were desirous of the honour of serving them in parliament  the polling went on briskly and merrily there were somewhat above nine hundred registered voters of whom the greater portion recorded their votes early in the day at two oclock according to sir rogers committee the numbers were as follows      scatcherd    275    moffat       268   whereas by the light afforded by mr moffats people they stood in a slightly different ratio to each other being written thus      moffat       277    scatcherd    269   this naturally heightened the excitement and gave additional delight to the proceedings at halfpast two it was agreed by both sides that mr moffat was ahead the moffatites claiming a majority of twelve and the scatcherdites allowing a majority of one but by three oclock sundry good men and true belonging to the railway interest had made their way to the booth in spite of the efforts of a band of roughs from courcy and sir roger was again leading by ten or a dozen according to his own showing  one little transaction which took place in the earlier part of the day deserves to be recorded there was in barchester an honest publicanhonest as the world of publicans goeswho not only was possessed of a vote but possessed also of a son who was a voter he was one reddypalm and in former days before he had learned to appreciate the full value of an englishmans franchise he had been a declared liberal and an early friend of roger scatcherds in latter days he had governed his political feelings with more decorum and had not allowed himself to be carried away by such foolish fervour as he had evinced in his youth on this special occasion however his line of conduct was so mysterious as for a while to baffle even those who knew him best  his house was apparently open in sir rogers interest beer at any rate was flowing there as elsewhere and scarlet ribbons going innot perhaps in a state of perfect steadinesscame out more unsteady than before still had mr reddypalm been deaf to the voice of that charmer closerstil though he had charmed with all his wisdom mr reddypalm had stated first his unwillingness to vote at allhe had he said given over politics and was not inclined to trouble his mind again with the subject then he had spoken of his great devotion to the duke of omnium under whose grandfathers his grandfather had been bred mr nearthewinde had as he said been with him and proved to him beyond a shadow of a doubt that it would show the deepest ingratitude on his part to vote against the dukes candidate  mr closerstil thought he understood all this and sent more and still more men to drink beer he even causedtaking infinite trouble to secure secrecy in the matterthree gallons of british brandy to be ordered and paid for as the best french but nevertheless mr reddypalm made no sign to show that he considered that the right thing had been done on the evening before the election he told one of mr closerstils confidential men that he had thought a good deal about it and that he believed he should be constrained by his conscience to vote for mr moffat  we have said that mr closerstil was accompanied by a learned friend of his one mr romer a barrister who was greatly interested in sir roger and who being a strong liberal was assisting in the canvass with much energy he hearing how matters were likely to go with this conscientious publican and feeling himself peculiarly capable of dealing with such delicate scruples undertook to look into the case in hand early therefore on the morning of the election he sauntered down the cross street in which hung out the sign of the brown bear and as he expected found mr reddypalm near his own door  now it was quite an understood thing that there was to be no bribery this was understood by no one better than by mr romer who had in truth drawn up many of the published assurances to that effect and to give him his due he was fully minded to act in accordance with these assurances the object of all the parties was to make it worth the voters while to give their votes but to do so without bribery mr romer had repeatedly declared that he would have nothing to do with any illegal practising but he had also declared that as long as all was done according to law he was ready to lend his best efforts to assist sir roger how he assisted sir roger and adhered to the law will now be seen  oh mr romer mr romer is it not the case with thee that thou wouldst not play false and yet wouldst wrongly win not in electioneering mr romer any more than in other pursuits can a man touch pitch and not be defiled as thou innocent as thou art wilt soon learn to thy terrible cost  well reddypalm said mr romer shaking hands with him mr romer had not been equally cautious as nearthewinde and had already drunk sundry glasses of ale at the brown bear in the hope of softening the stern bearwarden how is it to be today which is to be the man  if any one knows that mr romer you must be the man a poor numbskull like me knows nothing of them matters how should i all i looks to mr romer is selling a trifle of drink now and thenselling it and getting paid for it you know mr romer  yes thats important no doubt but come reddypalm such an old friend of sir roger as you are a man he speaks of as one of his intimate friends i wonder how you can hesitate about it now with another man i should think that he wanted to be paid for voting  oh mr romerfiefiefie  i know its not the case with you it would be an insult to offer you money even if money were going i should not mention this only as money is not going neither on our side nor on the other no harm can be done  mr romer if you speak of such a thing youll hurt me i know the value of an englishmans franchise too well to wish to sell it i would not demean myself so low no not though fiveandtwenty pound a vote was going as there was in the good old timesand thats not so long ago neither  i am sure you wouldnt reddypalm im sure you wouldnt but an honest man like you should stick to old friends now tell me and putting his arm through reddypalms he walked with him into the passage of his own house now tell meis there anything wrong its between friends you know is there anything wrong  i wouldnt sell my vote for untold gold said reddypalm who was perhaps aware that untold gold would hardly be offered to him for it  i am sure you would not said mr romer  but said reddypalm a man likes to be paid his little bill  surely surely said the barrister  and i did say two years since when your friend mr closerstil brought a friend of his down to stand hereit wasnt sir roger thenbut when he brought a friend of his down and when i drew two or three hogsheads of ale on their side and when my bill was questioned and only halfsettled i did say that i wouldnt interfere with no election no more and no more i will mr romerunless it be to give a quiet vote for the nobleman under whom i and mine always lived respectable  oh said mr romer  a man do like to have his bill paid you know mr romer  mr romer could not but acknowledge that this was a natural feeling on the part of an ordinary mortal publican  it goes agin the grain with a man not to have his little bill paid and specially at election time again urged mr reddypalm  mr romer had not much time to think about it but he knew well that matters were so nearly balanced that the votes of mr reddypalm and his son were of inestimable value  if its only about your bill said mr romer ill see to have that settled ill speak to closerstil about that  all right said reddypalm seizing the young barristers hand and shaking it warmly all right and late in the afternoon when a vote or two became matter of intense interest mr reddypalm and his son came up to the hustings and boldly tendered theirs for their old friend sir roger  there was a great deal of eloquence heard in barchester on that day sir roger had by this time so far recovered as to be able to go through the dreadfully hard work of canvassing and addressing the electors from eight in the morning till near sunset a very perfect recovery most men will say yes a perfect recovery as regarded the temporary use of his faculties both physical and mental though it may be doubted whether there can be any permanent recovery from such disease as his what amount of brandy he consumed to enable him to perform this election work and what lurking evil effect the excitement might have on himof these matters no record was kept in the history of those proceedings  sir rogers eloquence was of a rough kind but not perhaps the less operative on those for whom it was intended the aristocracy of barchester consisted chiefly of clerical dignitaries bishops deans prebendaries and such like on them and theirs it was not probable that anything said by sir roger would have much effect those men would either abstain from voting or vote for the railway hero with the view of keeping out the de courcy candidate then came the shopkeepers who might also be regarded as a stiffnecked generation impervious to electioneering eloquence they would generally support mr moffat but there was an inferior class of voters tenpound freeholders and such like who at this period were somewhat given to have an opinion of their own and over them it was supposed that sir roger did obtain some power by his gift of talking  now gentlemen will you tell me this said he bawling at the top of his voice from off the portico which graced the door of the dragon of wantley at which celebrated inn sir rogers committee satwho is mr moffat and what has he done for us there have been some picturemakers about the town this week past the lord knows who they are i dont these clever fellows do tell you who i am and what ive done i aint very proud of the way theyve painted me though theres something about it i aint ashamed of either see here and he held up on one side of him one of the great daubs of himselfjust hold it there till i can explain it and he handed the paper to one of his friends thats me said sir roger putting up his stick and pointing to the pimplynosed representation of himself  hurrah hurrrah more power to youwe all know who you are roger youre the boy when did you get drunk last suchlike greetings together with a dead cat which was flung at him from the crowd and which he dexterously parried with his stick were the answers which he received to this exordium  yes said he quite undismayed by this little missile which had so nearly reached him thats me and look here this brown dirtylooking broad streak here is intended for a railway and that thing in my handnot the right hand ill come to that presently  how about the brandy roger  ill come to that presently ill tell you about the brandy in good time but that thing in my left hand is a spade now i never handled a spade and never could but boys i handled a chisel and mallet and many a hundred block of stone has come out smooth from under that hand and sir roger lifted up his great broad palm wide open  so you did roger and well we minds it  the meaning however of that spade is to show that i made the railway now im very much obliged to those gentlemen over at the white horse for putting up this picture of me its a true picture and it tells you who i am i did make that railway i have made thousands of miles of railway i am making thousands of miles of railwayssome in europe some in asia some in america its a true picture and he poked his stick through it and held it up to the crowd a true picture but for that spade and that railway i shouldnt be now here asking your votes and when next february comes i shouldnt be sitting in westminster to represent you as by gods grace i certainly will do that tells you who i am but now will you tell me who mr moffat is  how about the brandy roger  oh yes the brandy i was forgetting that and the little speech that is coming out of my moutha deal shorter speech and a better one than what i am making now here in the right hand you see a brandy bottle well boys im not a bit ashamed of that as long as a man does his workand the spade shows thatits only fair he should have something to comfort him im always able to work and few men work much harder im always able to work and no man has a right to expect more of me i never expect more than that from those who work for me  no more you dont roger a little drops very good aint it roger keeps the cold from the stomach eh roger  then as to this speech come jack lets have a drop of someat short why thats a good speech too when i do drink i like to share with a friend and i dont care how humble that friend is  hurrah more power thats true too roger may you never be without a drop to wet your whistle  they say im the last new baronet well i aint ashamed of that not a bit when will mr moffat get himself made a baronet no man can truly say im too proud of it i have never stuck myself up no nor stuck my wife up either but i dont see much to be ashamed of because the bigwigs chose to make a baronet of me  nor no more thee hant roger wed all be barrownites if so be we knew the way  but now having polished off this bit of picture let me ask you who mr moffat is there are pictures enough about him too though heaven knows where they all come from i think sir edwin landseer must have done this one of the goose it is so deadly natural look at it there he is upon my word whoever did that ought to make his fortune at some of these exhibitions here he is again with a big pair of scissors he calls himself englands honour what the deuce englands honour has to do with tailoring i cant tell you perhaps mr moffat can but mind you my friends i dont say anything against tailoring some of you are tailors i dare say  yes we be said a little squeaking voice from out of the crowd  and a good trade it is when i first knew barchester there were tailors here could lick any stonemason in the trade i say nothing against tailors but it isnt enough for a man to be a tailor unless hes something else along with it youre not so fond of tailors that youll send one up to parliament merely because he is a tailor  we wont have no tailors no nor yet no cabbaging take a go of brandy roger youre blown  no im not blown yet ive a deal more to say about mr moffat before i shall be blown what has he done to entitle him to come here before you and ask you to send him to parliament why he isnt even a tailor i wish he were theres always some good in a fellow who knows how to earn his own bread but he isnt a tailor he cant even put a stitch in towards mending englands honour his father was a tailor not a barchester tailor mind you so as to give him any claim on your affections but a london tailor now the question is do you want to send the son of a london tailor up to parliament to represent you  no we dont nor yet we wont either  i rather think not youve had him once and what has he done for you has he said much for you in the house of commons why hes so dumb a dog that he cant bark even for a bone im told its quite painful to hear him fumbling and mumbling and trying to get up a speech there over at the white horse he doesnt belong to the city he hasnt done anything for the city and he hasnt the power to do anything for the city then why on earth does he come here ill tell you the earl de courcy brings him hes going to marry the earl de courcys niece for they say hes very richthis tailors sononly they do say also that he doesnt much like to spend his money hes going to marry lord de courcys niece and lord de courcy wishes that his nephew should be in parliament there thats the claim which mr moffat has here on the people of barchester hes lord de courcys nominee and those who feel themselves bound hand and foot heart and soul to lord de courcy had better vote for him such men have my leave if there are enough of such at barchester to send him to parliament the city in which i was born must be very much altered since i was a young man  and so finishing his speech sir roger retired within and recruited himself in the usual manner  such was the flood of eloquence at the dragon of wantly at the white horse meanwhile the friends of the de courcy interest were treated perhaps to sounder political views though not expressed in periods so intelligibly fluent as those of sir roger  mr moffat was a young man and there was no knowing to what proficiency in the parliamentary gift of public talking he might yet attain but hitherto his proficiency was not great he had however endeavoured to make up by study for any want of readiness of speech and had come to barchester daily for the last four days fortified with a very pretty harangue which he had prepared for himself in the solitude of his chamber on the three previous days matters had been allowed to progress with tolerable smoothness and he had been permitted to deliver himself of his elaborate eloquence with few other interruptions than those occasioned by his own want of practice but on this the day of days the barchesterian roughs were not so complaisant it appeared to mr moffat when he essayed to speak that he was surrounded by enemies rather than friends and in his heart he gave great blame to mr nearthewinde for not managing matters better for him  men of barchester he began in a voice which was every now and then preternaturally loud but which at each fourth or fifth word gave way from want of power and descended to its natural weak tone men of barchesterelectors and nonelectors  we is hall electors hall on us my young kiddy  electors and nonelectors i now ask your suffrages not for the first time  oh weve tried you we know what youre made on go on snip dont you let em put you down  ive had the honour of representing you in parliament for the last two years and  and a deuced deal you did for us didnt you  what could you expect from the ninth part of a man never mind snipgo on dont you be out by any of them stick to your wax and thread like a manlike the ninth part of a mango on a little faster snip  for the last two yearsandand here mr moffat looked round to his friends for some little support and the honourable george who stood close behind him suggested that he had gone through it like a brick  andand i went through it like a brick said mr moffat with the gravest possible face taking up in his utter confusion the words that were put into his mouth  hurrayso you didyoure the real brick well done snip go it again with the wax and thread  i am a thoroughpaced reformer continued mr moffat somewhat reassured by the effect of the opportune words which his friend had whispered into his ear a thoroughpaced reformera thoroughpaced reformer  go on snip we all know what that means  a thoroughpaced reformer  never mind your paces man but get on tell us something new were all reformers we are  poor mr moffat was a little thrown back it wasnt so easy to tell these gentlemen anything new harnessed as he was at this moment so he looked back at his honourable supporter for some further hint say something about their daughters whispered george whose own flights of oratory were always on that subject had he counselled mr moffat to say a word or two about the tides his advice would not have been less to the purpose  gentlemen he began againyou all know that i am a thoroughpaced reformer  oh drat your reform hes a dumb dog go back to your goose snippy you never were made for this work go to courcy castle and reform that  mr moffat grieved in his soul was becoming inextricably bewildered by such facetiæ as these when an eggand it may be feared not a fresh eggflung with unerring precision struck him on the open part of his wellplaited shirt and reduced him to speechless despair  an egg is a means of delightful support when properly administered but it is not calculated to add much spirit to a mans eloquence or to ensure his powers of endurance when supplied in the manner above described men there are doubtless whose tongues would not be stopped even by such an argument as this but mr moffat was not one of them as the insidious fluid trickled down beneath his waistcoat he felt that all further powers of coaxing the electors out of their votes by words flowing from his tongue sweeter than honey was for that occasion denied to him he could not be selfconfident energetic witty and goodhumoured with a rotten egg drying through his clothes he was forced therefore to give way and with sadly disconcerted air retired from the open window at which he had been standing  it was in vain that the honourable george mr nearthewinde and frank endeavoured again to bring him to the charge he was like a beaten prizefighter whose pluck has been cowed out of him and who if he stands up only stands up to fall mr moffat got sulky also and when he was pressed said that barchester and the people in it might be d with all my heart said mr nearthewinde that wouldnt have any effect on their votes  but in truth it mattered very little whether mr moffat spoke or whether he didnt speak four oclock was the hour for closing the poll and that was now fast coming tremendous exertions had been made about halfpast three by a safe emissary sent from nearthewinde to prove to mr reddypalm that all manner of contingent advantages would accrue to the brown bear if it should turn out that mr moffat should take his seat for barchester no bribe was of course offered or even hinted at the purity of barchester was not contaminated during the day by one such curse as this but a man and a publican would be required to do some great deed in the public line to open some colossal tap to draw beer for the million and no one would be so fit as mr reddypalmif only it might turn out that mr moffat should in the coming february take his seat as member for barchester  but mr reddypalm was a man of humble desires whose ambitions soared no higher than thisthat his little bills should be duly settled it is wonderful what love an innkeeper has for his bill in its entirety an account with a respectable total of five or six pounds is brought to you and you complain but of one article that fire in the bedroom was never lighted or that second glass of brandy and water was never called for you desire to have the shilling expunged and all your hosts pleasure in the whole transaction is destroyed oh my friends pay for the brandy and water though you never drank it suffer the fire to pass though it never warmed you why make a good man miserable for such a trifle  it became notified to reddypalm with sufficient clearness that his bill for the past election should be paid without further question and therefore at five oclock the mayor of barchester proclaimed the results of the contest in the following figures      scatcherd    378    moffat       376   mr reddypalms two votes had decided the question mr nearthewinde immediately went up to town and the dinner party at courcy castle that evening was not a particularly pleasant meal  this much however had been absolutely decided before the yellow committee concluded their labour at the white horse there should be a petition mr nearthewinde had not been asleep and already knew something of the manner in which mr reddypalms mind had been quieted     chapter xviii  the rivals   the intimacy between frank and miss dunstable grew and prospered that is to say it prospered as an intimacy though perhaps hardly as a love affair there was a continued succession of jokes between them which no one else in the castle understood but the very fact of there being such a good understanding between them rather stood in the way of than assisted that consummation which the countess desired people when they are in love with each other or even when they pretend to be do not generally show it by loud laughter nor is it frequently the case that a wife with two hundred thousand pounds can be won without some little preliminary despair now there was no despair at all about frank gresham  lady de courcy who thoroughly understood that portion of the world in which she herself lived saw that things were not going quite as they should do and gave much and repeated advice to frank on the subject she was the more eager in doing this because she imagined frank had done what he could to obey her first precepts he had not turned up his nose at miss dunstables curls nor found fault with her loud voice he had not objected to her as ugly nor even shown any dislike to her age a young man who had been so amenable to reason was worthy of further assistance and so lady de courcy did what she could to assist him  frank my dear boy she would say you are a little too noisy i think i dont mean for myself you know i dont mind it but miss dunstable would like it better if you were a little more quiet with her  would she aunt said frank looking demurely up into the countesss face i rather think she likes fun and noise and that sort of thing you know shes not very quiet herself  ahbut frank there are times you know when that sort of thing should be laid aside fun as you call it is all very well in its place indeed no one likes it better than i do but thats not the way to show admiration young ladies like to be admired and if youll be a little more softmannered with miss dunstable im sure youll find it will answer better  and so the old bird taught the young bird how to flyvery needlesslyfor in this matter of flying nature gives her own lessons thoroughly and the ducklings will take the water even though the maternal hen warn them against the perfidious element never so loudly  soon after this lady de courcy began to be not very well pleased in the matter she took it into her head that miss dunstable was sometimes almost inclined to laugh at her and on one or two occasions it almost seemed as though frank was joining miss dunstable in doing so the fact indeed was that miss dunstable was fond of fun and endowed as she was with all the privileges which two hundred thousand pounds may be supposed to give to a young lady did not very much care at whom she laughed she was able to make a tolerably correct guess at lady de courcys plan towards herself but she did not for a moment think that frank had any intention of furthering his aunts views she was therefore not at all illinclined to have her revenge on the countess  how very fond your aunt is of you she said to him one wet morning as he was sauntering through the house now laughing and almost romping with herthen teasing his sister about mr moffatand then bothering his ladycousins out of all their propriety  oh very said frank she is a dear good woman is my aunt de courcy  i declare she takes more notice of you and your doings than of any of your cousins i wonder they aint jealous  oh theyre such good people bless me theyd never be jealous  you are so much younger than they are that i suppose she thinks you want more of her care  yes thats it you see shes fond of having a baby to nurse  tell me mr gresham what was it she was saying to you last night i know we had been misbehaving ourselves dreadfully it was all your fault you would make me laugh so  thats just what i said to her  she was talking about me then  how on earth should she talk of any one else as long as you are here dont you know that all the world is talking about you  is itdear me how kind but i dont care a straw about any world just at present but lady de courcys world what did she say  she said you were very beautiful  did shehow good of her  no i forgot itit was i that said that and she saidwhat was it she said she said that after all beauty was but skin deepand that she valued you for your virtues and prudence rather than your good looks  virtues and prudence she said i was prudent and virtuous  yes  and you talked of my beauty that was so kind of you you didnt either of you say anything about other matters  what other matters  oh i dont know only some people are sometimes valued rather for what theyve got than for any good qualities belonging to themselves intrinsically  that can never be the case with miss dunstable especially not at courcy castle said frank bowing easily from the corner of the sofa over which he was leaning  of course not said miss dunstable and frank at once perceived that she spoke in a tone of voice differing much from that halfbantering halfgoodhumoured manner that was customary with her of course not any such idea would be quite out of the question with lady de courcy she paused for a moment and then added in a tone different again and unlike any that he had yet heard from herit is at any rate out of the question with mr frank greshamof that i am quite sure  frank ought to have understood her and have appreciated the good opinion which she intended to convey but he did not entirely do so he was hardly honest himself towards her and he could not at first perceive that she intended to say that she thought him so he knew very well that she was alluding to her own huge fortune and was alluding also to the fact that people of fashion sought her because of it but he did not know that she intended to express a true acquittal as regarded him of any such baseness  and did he deserve to be acquitted yes upon the whole he didto be acquitted of that special sin his desire to make miss dunstable temporarily subject to his sway arose not from a hankering after her fortune but from an ambition to get the better of a contest in which other men around him seemed to be failing  for it must not be imagined that with such a prize to be struggled for all others stood aloof and allowed him to have his own way with the heiress undisputed the chance of a wife with two hundred thousand pounds is a godsend which comes in a mans life too seldom to be neglected let that chance be never so remote  frank was the heir to a large embarrassed property and therefore the heads of families putting their wisdoms together had thought it most meet that this daughter of plutus should if possible fall to his lot but not so thought the honourable george and not so thought another gentleman who was at that time an inmate of courcy castle  these suitors perhaps somewhat despised their young rivals efforts it may be that they had sufficient worldly wisdom to know that so important a crisis of life is not settled among quips and jokes and that frank was too much in jest to be in earnest but be that as it may his lovemaking did not stand in the way of their lovemaking nor his hopes if he had any in the way of their hopes  the honourable george had discussed the matter with the honourable john in a properly fraternal manner it may be that john had also an eye to the heiress but if so he had ceded his views to his brothers superior claims for it came about that they understood each other very well and john favoured george with salutary advice on the occasion  if it is to be done at all it should be done very sharp said john  as sharp as you like said george im not the fellow to be studying three months in what attitude ill fall at a girls feet  no and when you are there you mustnt take three months more to study how youll get up again if you do it at all you must do it sharp repeated john putting great stress on his advice  i have said a few soft words to her already and she didnt seem to take them badly said george  shes no chicken you know remarked john and with a woman like that beating about the bush never does any good the chances are she wont have youthats of course plums like that dont fall into a mans mouth merely for shaking the tree but its possible she may and if she will shes as likely to take you today as this day six months if i were you id write her a letter  write her a lettereh said george who did not altogether dislike the advice for it seemed to take from his shoulders the burden of preparing a spoken address though he was so glib in speaking about the farmers daughters he felt that he should have some little difficulty in making known his passion to miss dunstable by word of mouth  yes write a letter if shell take you at all shell take you that way half the matches going are made up by writing letters write her a letter and get it put on her dressingtable george said that he would and so he did  george spoke quite truly when he hinted that he had said a few soft things to miss dunstable miss dunstable however was accustomed to hear soft things she had been carried much about in society among fashionable people since on the settlement of her fathers will she had been pronounced heiress to all the ointment of lebanon and many men had made calculations respecting her similar to those which were now animating the brain of the honourable george de courcy she was already quite accustomed to being the target at which spendthrifts and the needy rich might shoot their arrows accustomed to being shot at and tolerably accustomed to protect herself without making scenes in the world or rejecting the advantageous establishments offered to her with any loud expressions of disdain the honourable george therefore had been permitted to say soft things very much as a matter of course  and very little more outward fracas arose from the correspondence which followed than had arisen from the soft things so said george wrote the letter and had it duly conveyed to miss dunstables bedchamber miss dunstable duly received it and had her answer conveyed back discreetly to georges hands the correspondence ran as follows      courcy castle aug  185     my dearest miss dunstable     i cannot but flatter myself that you must have perceived    from my manner that you are not indifferent to me indeed    indeed you are not i may truly say and swear these    last strong words had been put in by the special counsel    of the honourable john that if ever a man loved a woman    truly i truly love you you may think it very odd that    i should say this in a letter instead of speaking it out    before your face but your powers of raillery are so great    touch her up about her wit had been the advice of the    honourable john that i am all but afraid to encounter    them dearest dearest marthaoh do not blame me for so    addressing youif you will trust your happiness to me    you shall never find that you have been deceived my    ambition shall be to make you shine in that circle which    you are so well qualified to adorn and to see you firmly    fixed in that sphere of fashion for which all your tastes    adapt you     i may safely assertand i do assert it with my hand on    my heartthat i am actuated by no mercenary motives far    be it from me to marry any womanno not a princesson    account of her money no marriage can be happy without    mutual affection and i do fully trustno not trust but    hopethat there may be such between you and me dearest    miss dunstable whatever settlements you might propose    i should accede to it is you your sweet person that i    love not your money     for myself i need not remind you that i am the second son    of my father and that as such i hold no inconsiderable    station in the world my intention is to get into    parliament and to make a name for myself if i can among    those who shine in the house of commons my elder brother    lord porlock is you are aware unmarried and we    all fear that the family honours are not likely to be    perpetuated by him as he has all manner of troublesome    liaisons which will probably prevent his settling in life    there is nothing at all of that kind in my way it will    indeed be a delight to place a coronet on the head of my    lovely martha a coronet which can give no fresh grace to    her but which will be so much adorned by her wearing it     dearest miss dunstable i shall wait with the utmost    impatience for your answer and now burning with hope    that it may not be altogether unfavourable to my love i    beg permission to sign myself     your own most devoted     george de courcy   the ardent lover had not to wait long for an answer from his mistress she found this letter on her toilettable one night as she went to bed the next morning she came down to breakfast and met her swain with the most unconcerned air in the world so much so that he began to think as he munched his toast with rather a shamefaced look that the letter on which so much was to depend had not yet come safely to hand but his suspense was not of a prolonged duration after breakfast as was his wont he went out to the stables with his brother and frank gresham and while there miss dunstables man coming up to him touched his hat and put a letter into his hand  frank who knew the man glanced at the letter and looked at his cousin but he said nothing he was however a little jealous and felt that an injury was done to him by any correspondence between miss dunstable and his cousin george  miss dunstables reply was as follows and it may be remarked that it was written in a very clear and wellpenned hand and one which certainly did not betray much emotion of the heart      my dear mr de courcy     i am sorry to say that i had not perceived from your    manner that you entertained any peculiar feelings towards    me as had i done so i should at once have endeavoured    to put an end to them i am much flattered by the way in    which you speak of me but i am in too humble a position    to return your affection and can therefore only express    a hope that you may be soon able to eradicate it from your    bosom a letter is a very good way of making an offer and    as such i do not think it at all odd but i certainly did    not expect such an honour last night as to my raillery i    trust it has never yet hurt you i can assure you it never    shall i hope you will soon have a worthier ambition than    that to which you allude for i am well aware that no    attempt will ever make me shine anywhere     i am quite sure you have had no mercenary motives such    motives in marriage are very base and quite below your    name and lineage any little fortune that i may have must    be a matter of indifference to one who looks forward as    you do to put a coronet on his wifes brow nevertheless    for the sake of the family i trust that lord porlock in    spite of his obstacles may live to do the same for a wife    of his own some of these days i am glad to hear that    there is nothing to interfere with your own prospects of    domestic felicity     sincerely hoping that you may be perfectly successful in    your proud ambition to shine in parliament and regretting    extremely that i cannot share that ambition with you i    beg to subscribe myself with very great respect     your sincere wellwisher     martha dunstable   the honourable george with that modesty which so well became him accepted miss dunstables reply as a final answer to his little proposition and troubled her with no further courtship as he said to his brother john no harm had been done and he might have better luck next time but there was an inmate of courcy castle who was somewhat more pertinacious in his search after love and wealth this was no other than mr moffat a gentleman whose ambition was not satisfied by the cares of his barchester contest or the possession of one affianced bride  mr moffat was as we have said a man of wealth but we all know from the lessons of early youth how the love of money increases and gains strength by its own success nor was he a man of so mean a spirit as to be satisfied with mere wealth he desired also place and station and gracious countenance among the great ones of the earth hence had come his adherence to the de courcys hence his seat in parliament and hence also his perhaps illconsidered match with miss gresham  there is no doubt but that the privilege of matrimony offers opportunities to moneyloving young men which ought not to be lightly abused too many young men marry without giving any consideration to the matter whatever it is not that they are indifferent to money but that they recklessly miscalculate their own value and omit to look around and see how much is done by those who are more careful a man can be young but once and except in cases of a special interposition of providence can marry but once the chance once thrown away may be said to be irrevocable how in afterlife do men toil and turmoil through long years to attain some prospect of doubtful advancement half that trouble half that care a tithe of that circumspection would in early youth have probably secured to them the enduring comfort of a wifes wealth  you will see men labouring night and day to become bank directors and even a bank direction may only be the road to ruin others will spend years in degrading subserviency to obtain a niche in a will and the niche when at last obtained and enjoyed is but a sorry payment for all that has been endured others again struggle harder still and go through even deeper waters they make wills for themselves forge stockshares and fight with unremitting painful labour to appear to be the thing that they are not now in many of these cases all this might have been spared had the men made adequate use of those opportunities which youth and youthful charms afford onceand once only there is no road to wealth so easy and respectable as that of matrimony that is of course provided that the aspirant declines the slow course of honest work but then we can so seldom put old heads on young shoulders  in the case of mr moffat we may perhaps say that a specimen was produced of this bird so rare in the land his shoulders were certainly young seeing that he was not yet sixandtwenty but his head had ever been old from the moment when he was first put forth to go aloneat the age of twentyonehis life had been one calculation how he could make the most of himself he had allowed himself to be betrayed into no folly by an unguarded heart no youthful indiscretion had marred his prospects he had made the most of himself without wit or depth or any mental giftwithout honesty of purpose or industry for good workhe had been for two years sitting member for barchester was the guest of lord de courcy was engaged to the eldest daughter of one of the best commoners families in england and was when he first began to think of miss dunstable sanguine that his reelection to parliament was secure  when however at this period he began to calculate what his position in the world really was it occurred to him that he was doing an illjudged thing in marrying miss gresham why marry a penniless girlfor augustas trifle of a fortune was not a penny in his estimationwhile there was miss dunstable in the world to be won his own six or seven thousand a year quite unembarrassed as it was was certainly a great thing but what might he not do if to that he could add the almost fabulous wealth of the great heiress was she not here put absolutely in his path would it not be a wilful throwing away of a chance not to avail himself of it he must to be sure lose the de courcy friendship but if he should then have secured his barchester seat for the usual term of parliamentary session he might be able to spare that he would also perhaps encounter some gresham enmity this was a point on which he did think more than once but what will not a man encounter for the sake of two hundred thousand pounds  it was thus that mr moffat argued with himself with much prudence and brought himself to resolve that he would at any rate become a candidate for the great prize he also therefore began to say soft things and it must be admitted that he said them with more considerate propriety than had the honourable george mr moffat had an idea that miss dunstable was not a fool and that in order to catch her he must do more than endeavour to lay salt on her tail in the guise of flattery it was evident to him that she was a bird of some cunning not to be caught by an ordinary gin such as those commonly in use with the honourable georges of society  it seemed to mr moffat that though miss dunstable was so sprightly so full of fun and so ready to chatter on all subjects she well knew the value of her own money and of her position as dependent on it he perceived that she never flattered the countess and seemed to be no whit absorbed by the titled grandeur of her hosts family he gave her credit therefore for an independent spirit and an independent spirit in his estimation was one that placed its sole dependence on a respectable balance at its bankers  working on these ideas mr moffat commenced operations in such manner that his overtures to the heiress should not if unsuccessful interfere with the greshamsbury engagement he began by making common cause with miss dunstable their positions in the world he said to her were closely similar they had both risen from the lower class by the strength of honest industry they were both now wealthy and had both hitherto made such use of their wealth as to induce the highest aristocracy of england to admit them into their circles  yes mr moffat had miss dunstable remarked and if all that i hear be true to admit you into their very families  at this mr moffat slightly demurred he would not affect he said to misunderstand what miss dunstable meant there had been something said on the probability of such an event but he begged miss dunstable not to believe all that she heard on such subjects  i do not believe much said she but i certainly did think that that might be credited  mr moffat then went on to show how it behoved them both in holding out their hands halfway to meet the aristocratic overtures that were made to them not to allow themselves to be made use of the aristocracy according to mr moffat were people of a very nice sort the best acquaintance in the world a portion of mankind to be noticed by whom should be one of the first objects in the life of the dunstables and the moffats but the dunstables and moffats should be very careful to give little or nothing in return much very much in return would be looked for the aristocracy said mr moffat were not a people to allow the light of their countenance to shine forth without looking for a quid pro quo for some compensating value in all their intercourse with the dunstables and moffats they would expect a payment it was for the dunstables and moffats to see that at any rate they did not pay more for the article they got than its market value  the way in which she miss dunstable and he mr moffat would be required to pay would be by taking each of them some poor scion of the aristocracy in marriage and thus expending their hardearned wealth in procuring highpriced pleasures for some wellborn pauper against this peculiar caution was to be used of course the further induction to be shown was this that people so circumstanced should marry among themselves the dunstables and the moffats each with the other and not tumble into the pitfalls prepared for them  whether these great lessons had any lasting effect on miss dunstables mind may be doubted perhaps she had already made up her mind on the subject which mr moffat so well discussed she was older than mr moffat and in spite of his two years of parliamentary experience had perhaps more knowledge of the world with which she had to deal but she listened to what he said with complacency understood his object as well as she had that of his aristocratic rival was no whit offended but groaned in her spirit as she thought of the wrongs of augusta gresham  but all this good advice however would not win the money for mr moffat without some more decided step and that step he soon decided on taking feeling assured that what he had said would have its due weight with the heiress  the party at courcy castle was now soon about to be broken up the male de courcys were going down to a scotch mountain the female de courcys were to be shipped off to an irish castle mr moffat was to go up to town to prepare his petition miss dunstable was again about to start on a foreign tour in behalf of her physician and attendants and frank gresham was at last to be allowed to go to cambridge that is to say unless his success with miss dunstable should render such a step on his part quite preposterous  i think you may speak now frank said the countess i really think you may you have known her now for a considerable time and as far as i can judge she is very fond of you  nonsense aunt said frank she doesnt care a button for me  i think differently and lookerson you know always understand the game best i suppose you are not afraid to ask her  afraid said frank in a tone of considerable scorn he almost made up his mind that he would ask her to show that he was not afraid his only obstacle to doing so was that he had not the slightest intention of marrying her  there was to be but one other great event before the party broke up and that was a dinner at the duke of omniums the duke had already declined to come to courcy but he had in a measure atoned for this by asking some of the guests to join a great dinner which he was about to give to his neighbours  mr moffat was to leave courcy castle the day after the dinnerparty and he therefore determined to make his great attempt on the morning of that day it was with some difficulty that he brought about an opportunity but at last he did so and found himself alone with miss dunstable in the walks of courcy park  it is a strange thing is it not said he recurring to his old view of the same subject that i should be going to dine with the duke of omniumthe richest man they say among the whole english aristocracy  men of that kind entertain everybody i believe now and then said miss dunstable not very civilly  i believe they do but i am not going as one of the everybodies i am going from lord de courcys house with some of his own family i have no pride in thatnot the least i have more pride in my fathers honest industry but it shows what money does in this country of ours  yes indeed money does a great deal many queer things in saying this miss dunstable could not but think that money had done a very queer thing in inducing miss gresham to fall in love with mr moffat  yes wealth is very powerful here we are miss dunstable the most honoured guests in the house  oh i dont know about that you may be for you are a member of parliament and all that  no not a member now miss dunstable  well you will be and thats all the same but i have no such title to honour thank god  they walked on in silence for a little while for mr moffat hardly knew how to manage the business he had in hand it is quite delightful to watch these people he said at last now they accuse us of being tufthunters  do they said miss dunstable upon my word i didnt know that anybody ever so accused me  i didnt mean you and me personally  oh im glad of that  but that is what the world says of persons of our class now it seems to me that the toadying is all on the other side the countess here does toady you and so do the young ladies  do they if so upon my word i didnt know it but to tell the truth i dont think much of such things i live mostly to myself mr moffat  i see that you do and i admire you for it but miss dunstable you cannot always live so and mr moffat looked at her in a manner which gave her the first intimation of his coming burst of tenderness  thats as may be mr moffat said she  he went on beating about the bush for some timegiving her to understand how necessary it was that persons situated as they were should live either for themselves or for each other and that above all things they should beware of falling into the mouths of voracious aristocratic lions who go about looking for preytill they came to a turn in the grounds at which miss dunstable declared her determination of going in she had walked enough she said as by this time mr moffats immediate intentions were becoming visible she thought it prudent to retire dont let me take you in mr moffat but my boots are a little damp and dr easyman will never forgive me if i do not hurry in as fast as i can  your feet dampi hope not i do hope not said he with a look of the greatest solicitude  oh its nothing to signify but its well to be prudent you know good morning mr moffat  miss dunstable  ehyes and miss dunstable stopped in the grand path i wont let you return with me mr moffat because i know you were not coming in so soon  miss dunstable i shall be leaving this tomorrow  yes and i go myself the day after  i know it i am going to town and you are going abroad it may be longvery longbefore we meet again  about easter said miss dunstable that is if the doctor doesnt knock up on the road  and i had had wished to say something before we part for so long a time miss dunstable  stopmr moffat let me ask you one question ill hear anything that you have got to say but on one condition that is that miss augusta gresham shall be by while you say it will you consent to that  miss augusta gresham said he has no right to listen to my private conversation  has she not mr moffat then i think she should have i at any rate will not so far interfere with what i look on as her undoubted privileges as to be a party to any secret in which she may not participate  but miss dunstable  and to tell you fairly mr moffat any secret that you do tell me i shall most undoubtedly repeat to her before dinner good morning mr moffat my feet are certainly a little damp and if i stay a moment longer dr easyman will put off my foreign trip for at least a week and so she left him standing alone in the middle of the gravelwalk  for a moment or two mr moffat consoled himself in his misfortune by thinking how he might best avenge himself on miss dunstable soon however such futile ideas left his brain why should he give over the chase because the rich galleon had escaped him on this his first cruise in pursuit of her such prizes were not to be won so easily her present objection clearly consisted in his engagement to miss gresham and in that only let that engagement be at an end notoriously and publicly broken off and this objection would fall to the ground yes ships so richly freighted were not to be run down in one summer mornings plain sailing instead of looking for his revenge on miss dunstable it would be more prudent in himmore in keeping with his characterto pursue his object and overcome such difficulties as he might find in his way     chapter xix  the duke of omnium   the duke of omnium was as we have said a bachelor not the less on that account did he on certain rare gala days entertain the beauty of the county at his magnificent rural seat or the female fashion of london in belgrave square but on this occasion the dinner at gatherum castlefor such was the name of his mansionwas to be confined to the lords of the creation it was to be one of those days on which he collected round his board all the notables of the county in order that his popularity might not wane or the established glory of his hospitable house become dim  on such an occasion it was not probable that lord de courcy would be one of the guests the party indeed who went from courcy castle was not large and consisted of the honourable george mr moffat and frank gresham they went in a taxcart with a tandem horse driven very knowingly by george de courcy and the fourth seat on the back of the vehicle was occupied by a servant who was to look after the horses at gatherum  the honourable george drove either well or luckily for he reached the dukes house in safety but he drove very fast poor miss dunstable what would have been her lot had anything but good happened to that vehicle so richly freighted with her three lovers they did not quarrel as to the prize and all reached gatherum castle in good humour with each other  the castle was new building of white stone lately erected at an enormous cost by one of the first architects of the day it was an immense pile and seemed to cover ground enough for a moderatesized town but nevertheless report said that when it was completed the noble owner found that he had no rooms to live in and that on this account when disposed to study his own comfort he resided in a house of perhaps onetenth the size built by his grandfather in another county  gatherum castle would probably be called italian in its style of architecture though it may i think be doubted whether any such edifice or anything like it was ever seen in any part of italy it was a vast edifice irregular in heightor it appeared to be sohaving long wings on each side too high to be passed over by the eye as mere adjuncts to the mansion and a portico so large as to make the house behind it look like another building of a greater altitude this portico was supported by ionic columns and was in itself doubtless a beautiful structure it was approached by a flight of steps very broad and very grand but as an approach by a flight of steps hardly suits an englishmans house to the immediate entrance of which it is necessary that his carriage should drive there was another front door in one of the wings which was commonly used a carriage however could on very stupendously grand occasionsthe visits for instance of queens and kings and royal dukesbe brought up under the portico as the steps had been so constructed as to admit of a road with a rather stiff ascent being made close in front of the wing up into the very porch  opening from the porch was the grand hall which extended up to the top of the house it was magnificent indeed being decorated with manycoloured marbles and hung round with various trophies of the house of omnium banners were there and armour the sculptured busts of many noble progenitors fulllength figures in marble of those who had been especially prominent and every monument of glory that wealth long years and great achievements could bring together if only a man could but live in his hall and be for ever happy there but the duke of omnium could not live happily in his hall and the fact was that the architect in contriving this magnificent entrance for his own honour and fame had destroyed the dukes house as regards most of the ordinary purposes of residence  nevertheless gatherum castle is a very noble pile and standing as it does on an eminence has a very fine effect when seen from many a distant knoll and verdantwooded hill  at seven oclock mr de courcy and his friends got down from their drag at the smaller doorfor this was no day on which to mount up under the portico nor was that any suitable vehicle to have been entitled to such honour frank felt some excitement a little stronger than that usual to him at such moments for he had never yet been in company with the duke of omnium and he rather puzzled himself to think on what points he would talk to the man who was the largest landowner in that county in which he himself had so great an interest he however made up his mind that he would allow the duke to choose his own subjects merely reserving to himself the right of pointing out how deficient in gorse covers was west barsetshirethat being the dukes division  they were soon divested of their coats and hats and without entering on the magnificence of the great hall were conducted through rather a narrow passage into rather a small drawingroomsmall that is in proportion to the number of gentlemen there assembled there might be about thirty and frank was inclined to think that they were almost crowded a man came forward to greet them when their names were announced but our hero at once knew that he was not the duke for this man was fat and short whereas the duke was thin and tall  there was a great hubbub going on for everybody seemed to be talking to his neighbour or in default of a neighbour to himself it was clear that the exalted rank of their host had put very little constraint on his guests tongues for they chatted away with as much freedom as farmers at an ordinary  which is the duke at last frank contrived to whisper to his cousin  ohhes not here said george i suppose hell be in presently i believe he never shows till just before dinner  frank of course had nothing further to say but he already began to feel himself a little snubbed he thought that the duke duke though he was when he asked people to dinner should be there to tell them that he was glad to see them  more people flashed into the room and frank found himself rather closely wedged in with a stout clergyman of his acquaintance he was not badly off for mr athill was a friend of his own who had held a living near greshamsbury lately however at the lamented decease of dr stanhopewho had died of apoplexy at his villa in italymr athill had been presented with the better preferment of eiderdown and had therefore removed to another part of the county he was somewhat of a bonvivant and a man who thoroughly understood dinnerparties and with much good nature he took frank under his special protection  you stick to me mr gresham he said when we go into the diningroom im an old hand at the dukes dinners and know how to make a friend comfortable as well as myself  but why doesnt the duke come in demanded frank  hell be here as soon as dinner is ready said mr athill or rather the dinner will be ready as soon as he is here i dont care therefore how soon he comes  frank did not understand this but he had nothing to do but to wait and see how things went  he was beginning to be impatient for the room was now nearly full and it seemed evident that no other guests were coming when suddenly a bell rang and a gong was sounded and at the same instant a door that had not yet been used flew open and a very plainly dressed plain tall man entered the room frank at once knew that he was at last in the presence of the duke of omnium  but his grace late as he was in commencing the duties as host seemed in no hurry to make up for lost time he quietly stood on the rug with his back to the empty grate and spoke one or two words in a very low voice to one or two gentlemen who stood nearest to him the crowd in the meanwhile became suddenly silent frank when he found that the duke did not come and speak to him felt that he ought to go and speak to the duke but no one else did so and when he whispered his surprise to mr athill that gentleman told him that this was the dukes practice on all such occasions  fothergill said the dukeand it was the only word he had yet spoken out loudi believe we are ready for dinner now mr fothergill was the dukes landagent and he it was who had greeted frank and his friends at their entrance  immediately the gong was again sounded and another door leading out of the drawingroom into the diningroom was opened the duke led the way and then the guests followed stick close to me mr gresham said athill well get about the middle of the table where we shall be cosyand on the other side of the room out of this dreadful draughti know the place well mr gresham stick to me  mr athill who was a pleasant chatty companion had hardly seated himself and was talking to frank as quickly as he could when mr fothergill who sat at the bottom of the table asked him to say grace it seemed to be quite out of the question that the duke should take any trouble with his guests whatever mr athill consequently dropped the word he was speaking and uttered a prayerif it was a prayerthat they might all have grateful hearts for that which god was about to give them  if it was a prayer as far as my own experience goes such utterances are seldom prayers seldom can be prayers and if not prayers what then to me it is unintelligible that the full tide of glibbest chatter can be stopped at a moment in the midst of profuse good living and the giver thanked becomingly in words of heartfelt praise setting aside for the moment what one daily hears and sees may not one declare that a change so sudden is not within the compass of the human mind but then to such reasoning one cannot but add what one does hear and see one cannot but judge of the ceremony by the manner in which one sees it performeduttered that isand listened to clergymen there areone meets them now and thenwho endeavour to give to the dinnertable grace some of the solemnity of a church ritual and what is the effect much the same as though one were to be interrupted for a minute in the midst of one of our church liturgies to hear a drinkingsong  and it will be argued that a man need be less thankful because at the moment of receiving he utters no thanksgiving or will it be thought that a man is made thankful because what is called a grace is uttered after dinner it can hardly be imagined that any one will so argue or so think  dinnergraces are probably the last remaining relic of certain daily services 1 which the church in olden days enjoined nones complines and vespers were others of the nones and complines we have happily got quit and it might be well if we could get rid of the dinnergraces also let any man ask himself whether on his own part they are acts of prayer and thanksgivingand if not that what then      footnote 1 it is i know alleged that graces are said    before dinner because our saviour uttered a blessing before    his last supper i cannot say that the idea of such analogy    is pleasing to me   when the large party entered the diningroom one or two gentlemen might be seen to come in from some other door and set themselves at the table near to the dukes chair these were guests of his own who were staying in the house his particular friends the men with whom he lived the others were strangers whom he fed perhaps once a year in order that his name might be known in the land as that of one who distributed food and wine hospitably through the county the food and wine the attendance also and the view of the vast repository of plate he vouchsafed willingly to his county neighboursbut it was beyond his good nature to talk to them to judge by the present appearance of most of them they were quite as well satisfied to be left alone  frank was altogether a stranger there but mr athill knew every one at the table  thats apjohn said he dont you know mr apjohn the attorney from barchester hes always here he does some of fothergills law business and makes himself useful if any fellow knows the value of a good dinner he does youll see that the dukes hospitality will not be thrown away on him  its very much thrown away upon me i know said frank who could not at all put up with the idea of sitting down to dinner without having been spoken to by his host  oh nonsense said his clerical friend youll enjoy yourself amazingly by and by there is not such champagne in any other house in barsetshire and then the claret and mr athill pressed his lips together and gently shook his head meaning to signify by the motion that the claret of gatherum castle was sufficient atonement for any penance which a man might have to go through in his mode of obtaining it  whos that funny little man sitting there next but one to mr de courcy i never saw such a queer fellow in my life  dont you know old bolus well i thought every one in barsetshire knew bolus you especially should do so as he is such a dear friend of dr thorne  a dear friend of dr thorne  yes he was apothecary at scarington in the old days before dr fillgrave came into vogue i remember when bolus was thought to be a very good sort of doctor  is heis he whispered frank is he by way of a gentleman  ha ha ha well i suppose we must be charitable and say that he is quite as good at any rate as many others there are here and mr athill as he spoke whispered into franks ear you see theres finnie here another barchester attorney now i really think where finnie goes bolus may go too  the more the merrier i suppose said frank  well something a little like that i wonder why thorne is not here im sure he was asked  perhaps he did not particularly wish to meet finnie and bolus do you know mr athill i think he was quite right not to come as for myself i wish i was anywhere else  ha ha ha you dont know the dukes ways yet and whats more youre young you happy fellow but thorne should have more sense he ought to show himself here  the gormandizing was now going on at a tremendous rate though the volubility of their tongues had been for a while stopped by the first shock of the dukes presence the guests seemed to feel no such constraint upon their teeth they fed one may almost say rabidly and gave their orders to the servants in an eager manner much more impressive than that usual at smaller parties mr apjohn who sat immediately opposite to frank had by some wellplanned manoeuvre contrived to get before him the jowl of a salmon but unfortunately he was not for a while equally successful in the article of sauce a very limited portionso at least thought mr apjohnhad been put on his plate and a servant with a huge sauce tureen absolutely passed behind his back inattentive to his audible requests poor mr apjohn in his despair turned round to arrest the man by his coattails but he was a moment too late and all but fell backwards on the floor as he righted himself he muttered an anathema and looked with a face of anguish at his plate  anything the matter apjohn said mr fothergill kindly seeing the utter despair written on the poor mans countenance can i get anything for you  the sauce said mr apjohn in a voice that would have melted a hermit and as he looked at mr fothergill he pointed at the now distant sinner who was dispensing his melted ambrosia at least ten heads upwards away from the unfortunate supplicant  mr fothergill however knew where to look for balm for such wounds and in a minute or two mr apjohn was employed quite to his hearts content  well said frank to his neighbour it may be very well once in a way but i think that on the whole dr thorne is right  my dear mr gresham see the world on all sides said mr athill who had also been somewhat intent on the gratification of his own appetite though with an energy less evident than that of the gentleman opposite see the world on all sides if you have an opportunity and believe me a good dinner now and then is a very good thing  yes but i dont like eating it with hogs  whishh softly softly mr gresham or youll disturb mr apjohns digestion upon my word hell want it all before he has done now i like this kind of thing once in a way  do you said frank in a tone that was almost savage  yes indeed i do one sees so much character and after all what harm does it do  my idea is that people should live with those whose society is pleasant to them  liveyes mr greshami agree with you there it wouldnt do for me to live with the duke of omnium i shouldnt understand or probably approve his ways nor should i perhaps much like the constant presence of mr apjohn but now and thenonce in a year or soi do own i like to see them both heres the cup now whatever you do mr gresham dont pass the cup without tasting it  and so the dinner passed on slowly enough as frank thought but all too quickly for mr apjohn it passed away and the wine came circulating freely the tongues again were loosed the teeth being released from their labours and under the influence of the claret the dukes presence was forgotten  but very speedily the coffee was brought this will soon be over now said frank to himself thankfully for though he be no means despised good claret he had lost his temper too completely to enjoy it at the present moment but he was much mistaken the farce as yet was only at its commencement the duke took his cup of coffee and so did the few friends who sat close to him but the beverage did not seem to be in great request with the majority of the guests when the duke had taken his modicum he rose up and silently retired saying no word and making no sign and then the farce commenced  now gentlemen said mr fothergill cheerily we are all right apjohn is there claret there mr bolus i know you stick to the madeira you are quite right for there isnt much of it left and my belief is therell never be more like it  and so the dukes hospitality went on and the dukes guests drank merrily for the next two hours  shant we see any more of him asked frank  any more of whom said mr athill  of the duke  oh no youll see no more of him he always goes when the coffee comes its brought in as an excuse weve had enough of the light of his countenance to last till next year the duke and i are excellent friends and have been so these fifteen years but i never see more of him than that  i shall go away said frank  nonsense mr de courcy and your other friend wont stir for this hour yet  i dont care i shall walk on and they may catch me i may be wrong but it seems to me that a man insults me when he asks me to dine with him and never speaks to me i dont care if he be ten times duke of omnium he cant be more than a gentleman and as such i am his equal and then having thus given vent to his feelings in somewhat highflown language he walked forth and trudged away along the road towards courcy  frank gresham had been born and bred a conservative whereas the duke of omnium was well known as a consistent whig there is no one so devoutly resolved to admit of no superior as your conservative born and bred no one so inclined to high domestic despotism as your thoroughgoing consistent old whig  when he had proceeded about six miles frank was picked up by his friends but even then his anger had hardly cooled  was the duke as civil as ever when you took your leave of him said he to his cousin george as he took his seat on the drag  the juke was jeuced jude winelem me tell you that old fella hiccupped out the honourable george as he touched up the leader under the flank     chapter xx  the proposal   and now the departures from courcy castle came rapidly one after another and there remained but one more evening before miss dunstables carriage was to be packed the countess in the early moments of franks courtship had controlled his ardour and checked the rapidity of his amorous professions but as days and at last weeks wore away she found that it was necessary to stir the fire which she had before endeavoured to slacken  there will be nobody here tonight but our own circle said she to him and i really think you should tell miss dunstable what your intentions are she will have fair ground to complain of you if you do not  frank began to feel that he was in a dilemma he had commenced making love to miss dunstable partly because he liked the amusement and partly from a satirical propensity to quiz his aunt by appearing to fall into her scheme but he had overshot the mark and did not know what answer to give when he was thus called upon to make a downright proposal and then although he did not care two rushes about miss dunstable in the way of love he nevertheless experienced a sort of jealousy when he found that she appeared to be indifferent to him and that she corresponded the meanwhile with his cousin george though all their flirtations had been carried on on both sides palpably by way of fun though frank had told himself ten times a day that his heart was true to mary thorne yet he had an undefined feeling that it behoved miss dunstable to be a little in love with him he was not quite at ease in that she was not a little melancholy now that his departure was so nigh and above all he was anxious to know what were the real facts about that letter he had in his own breast threatened miss dunstable with a heartache and now when the time for their separation came he found that his own heart was the more likely to ache of the two  i suppose i must say something to her or my aunt will never be satisfied said he to himself as he sauntered into the little drawingroom on that last evening but at the very time he was ashamed of himself for he knew he was going to ask badly  his sister and one of his cousins were in the room but his aunt who was quite on the alert soon got them out of it and frank and miss dunstable were alone  so all our fun and all our laughter is come to an end said she beginning the conversation i dont know how you feel but for myself i really am a little melancholy at the idea of parting and she looked up at him with her laughing black eyes as though she never had and never could have a care in the world  melancholy oh yes you look so said frank who really did feel somewhat lackadaisically sentimental  but how thoroughly glad the countess must be that we are both going continued she i declare we have treated her most infamously ever since weve been here weve had all the amusement to ourselves ive sometimes thought she would turn me out of the house  i wish with all my heart she had  oh you cruel barbarian why on earth should you wish that  that i might have joined you in your exile i hate courcy castle and should have rejoiced to leaveandand  and what  and i love miss dunstable and should have doubly trebly rejoiced to leave it with her  franks voice quivered a little as he made this gallant profession but still miss dunstable only laughed the louder upon my word of all my knights you are by far the best behaved said she and say much the prettiest things frank became rather red in the face and felt that he did so miss dunstable was treating him like a boy while she pretended to be so fond of him she was only laughing at him and corresponding the while with his cousin george now frank gresham already entertained a sort of contempt for his cousin which increased the bitterness of his feelings could it really be possible that george had succeeded while he had utterly failed that his stupid cousin had touched the heart of the heiress while she was playing with him as with a boy  of all your knights is that the way you talk to me when we are going to part when was it miss dunstable that george de courcy became one of them  miss dunstable for a while looked serious enough what makes you ask that said she what makes you inquire about mr de courcy  oh i have eyes you know and cant help seeing not that i see or have seen anything that i could possibly help  and what have you seen mr gresham  why i know you have been writing to him  did he tell you so  no he did not tell me but i know it  for a moment she sat silent and then her face again resumed its usual happy smile come mr gresham you are not going to quarrel with me i hope even if i did write a letter to your cousin why should i not write to him i correspond with all manner of people ill write to you some of these days if youll let me and will promise to answer my letters  frank threw himself back on the sofa on which he was sitting and in doing so brought himself somewhat nearer to his companion than he had been he then drew his hand slowly across his forehead pushing back his thick hair and as he did so he sighed somewhat plaintively  i do not care said he for the privilege of correspondence on such terms if my cousin george is to be a correspondent of yours also i will give up my claim  and then he sighed again so that it was piteous to hear him he was certainly an arrant puppy and an egregious ass into the bargain but then it must be remembered in his favour that he was only twentyone and that much had been done to spoil him miss dunstable did remember this and therefore abstained from laughing at him  why mr gresham what on earth do you mean in all human probability i shall never write another line to mr de courcy but if i did what possible harm could it do you  oh miss dunstable you do not in the least understand what my feelings are  dont i then i hope i never shall i thought i did i thought they were the feelings of a good truehearted friend feelings that i could sometimes look back upon with pleasure as being honest when so much that one meets is false i have become very fond of you mr gresham and i should be sorry to think that i did not understand your feelings  this was almost worse and worse young ladies like miss dunstablefor she was still to be numbered in the category of young ladiesdo not usually tell young gentlemen that they are very fond of them to boys and girls they may make such a declaration now frank gresham regarded himself as one who had already fought his battles and fought them not without glory he could not therefore endure to be thus openly told by miss dunstable that she was very fond of him  fond of me miss dunstable i wish you were  so i amvery  you little know how fond i am of you miss dunstable and he put out his hand to take hold of hers she then lifted up her own and slapped him lightly on the knuckles  and what can you have to say to miss dunstable that can make it necessary that you should pinch her hand i tell you fairly mr gresham if you make a fool of yourself i shall come to a conclusion that you are all fools and that it is hopeless to look out for any one worth caring for  such advice as this so kindly given so wisely meant so clearly intelligible he should have taken and understood young as he was but even yet he did not do so  a fool of myself yes i suppose i must be a fool if i have so much regard for miss dunstable as to make it painful for me to know that i am to see her no more a fool yes of course i am a foola man is always a fool when he loves  miss dunstable could not pretend to doubt his meaning any longer and was determined to stop him let it cost what it would she now put out her hand not over white and as frank soon perceived gifted with a very fair allowance of strength  now mr gresham said she before you go any further you shall listen to me will you listen to me for a moment without interrupting me  frank was of course obliged to promise that he would do so  you are goingor rather you were going for i shall stop youto make a profession of love  a profession said frank making a slight unsuccessful effort to get his hand free  yes a professiona false profession mr greshama false professiona false profession look into your heartinto your heart of hearts i know you at any rate have a heart look into it closely mr gresham you know you do not love me not as a man should love the woman whom he swears to love  frank was taken aback so appealed to he found that he could not any longer say that he did love her he could only look into her face with all his eyes and sit there listening to her  how is it possible that you should love me i am heaven knows how many years your senior i am neither young nor beautiful nor have i been brought up as she should be whom you in time will really love and make your wife i have nothing that should make you love me butbut i am rich  it is not that said frank stoutly feeling himself imperatively called upon to utter something in his own defence  ah mr gresham i fear it is that for what other reason can you have laid your plans to talk in this way to such a woman as i am  i have laid no plans said frank now getting his hand to himself at any rate you wrong me there miss dunstable  i like you so wellnay love you if a woman may talk of love in the way of friendshipthat if money money alone would make you happy you should have it heaped on you if you want it mr gresham you shall have it  i have never thought of your money said frank surlily  but it grieves me continued she it does grieve me to think that you you youso young so gay so brightthat you should have looked for it in this way from others i have taken it just as the wind that whistles and now two big slow tears escaped from her eyes and would have rolled down her rosy cheeks were it not that she brushed them off with the back of her hand  you have utterly mistaken me miss dunstable said frank  if i have i will humbly beg your pardon said she butbutbut  you have indeed you have  how can i have mistaken you were you not about to say that you loved me to talk absolute nonsense to make me an offer if you were not if i have mistaken you indeed i will beg your pardon  frank had nothing further to say in his own defence he had not wanted miss dunstables moneythat was true but he could not deny that he had been about to talk that absolute nonsense of which she spoke with so much scorn  you would almost make me think that there are none honest in this fashionable world of yours i well know why lady de courcy has had me here how could i help knowing it she has been so foolish in her plans that ten times a day she has told her own secret but i have said to myself twenty times that if she were crafty you were honest  and am i dishonest  i have laughed in my sleeve to see how she played her game and to hear others around playing theirs all of them thinking that they could get the money of the poor fool who had come at their beck and call but i was able to laugh at them as long as i thought that i had one true friend to laugh with me but one cannot laugh with all the world against one  i am not against you miss dunstable  sell yourself for money why if i were a man i would not sell one jot of liberty for mountains of gold what tie myself in the heyday of my youth to a person i could never love for a price perjure myself destroy myselfand not only myself but her also in order that i might live idly oh heavens mr gresham can it be that the words of such a woman as your aunt have sunk so deeply in your heart have blackened you so foully as to make you think of such vile folly as this have you forgotten your soul your spirit your mans energy the treasure of your heart and you so young for shame mr gresham for shamefor shame  frank found the task before him by no means an easy one he had to make miss dunstable understand that he had never had the slightest idea of marrying her and that he had made love to her merely with the object of keeping his hand in for the work as it were with that object and the other equally laudable one of interfering with his cousin george  and yet there was nothing for him but to get through this task as best he might he was goaded to it by the accusations which miss dunstable brought against him and he began to feel that though her invective against him might be bitter when he had told the truth they could not be so bitter as those she now kept hinting at under her mistaken impression as to his views he had never had any strong propensity for moneyhunting but now that offence appeared in his eyes abominable unmanly and disgusting any imputation would be better than that  miss dunstable i never for a moment thought of doing what you accuse me of on my honour i never did i have been very foolishvery wrongidiotic i believe but i have never intended that  then mr gresham what did you intend  this was rather a difficult question to answer and frank was not very quick in attempting it i know you will not forgive me he said at last and indeed i do not see how you can i dont know how it came about but this is certain miss dunstable i have never for a moment thought about your fortune that is thought about it in the way of coveting it  you never thought of making me your wife then  never said frank looking boldly into her face  you never intended really to propose to go with me to the altar and then make yourself rich by one great perjury  never for a moment said he  you have never gloated over me as the bird of prey gloats over the poor beast that is soon to become carrion beneath its claws you have not counted me out as equal to so much land and calculated on me as a balance at your bankers ah mr gresham she continued seeing that he stared as though struck almost with awe by her strong language you little guess what a woman situated as i am has to suffer  i have behaved badly to you miss dunstable and i beg your pardon but i have never thought of your money  then we will be friends again mr gresham wont we it is so nice to have a friend like you there i think i understand it now you need not tell me  it was half by way of making a fool of my aunt said frank in an apologetic tone  there is merit in that at any rate said miss dunstable i understand it all now you thought to make a fool of me in real earnest well i can forgive that at any rate it is not mean  it may be that miss dunstable did not feel much acute anger at finding that this young man had addressed her with words of love in the course of an ordinary flirtation although that flirtation had been unmeaning and silly this was not the offence against which her heart and breast had found peculiar cause to arm itself this was not the injury from which she had hitherto experienced suffering  at any rate she and frank again became friends and before the evening was over they perfectly understood each other twice during this long têteàtête lady de courcy came into the room to see how things were going on and twice she went out almost unnoticed it was quite clear to her that something uncommon had taken place was taking place or would take place and that should this be for weal or for woe no good could now come from her interference on each occasion therefore she smiled sweetly on the pair of turtledoves and glided out of the room as quietly as she had glided into it  but at last it became necessary to remove them for the world had gone to bed frank in the meantime had told to miss dunstable all his love for mary thorne and miss dunstable had enjoined him to be true to his vows to her eyes there was something of heavenly beauty in young true loveof beauty that was heavenly because it had been unknown to her  mind you let me hear mr gresham said she mind you do and mr gresham never never forget her for one moment not for one moment mr gresham  frank was about to swear that he never wouldagain when the countess for the third time sailed into the room  young people said she do you know what oclock it is  dear me lady de courcy i declare it is past twelve i really am ashamed of myself how glad you will be to get rid of me tomorrow  no no indeed we shant shall we frank and so miss dunstable passed out  then once again the aunt tapped her nephew with her fan it was the last time in her life that she did so he looked up in her face and his look was enough to tell her that the acres of greshamsbury were not to be reclaimed by the ointment of lebanon  nothing further on the subject was said on the following morning miss dunstable took her departure not much heeding the rather cold words of farewell which her hostess gave her and on the following day frank started for greshamsbury     chapter xxi  mr moffat falls into trouble   we will now with the readers kind permission skip over some months in our narrative frank returned from courcy castle to greshamsbury and having communicated to his mothermuch in the same manner as he had to the countessthe fact that his mission had been unsuccessful he went up after a day or two to cambridge during his short stay at greshamsbury he did not even catch a glimpse of mary he asked for her of course and was told that it was not likely that she would be at the house just at present he called at the doctors but she was denied to him there she was out janet saidprobably with miss oriel he went to the parsonage and found miss oriel at home but mary had not been seen that morning he then returned to the house and having come to the conclusion that she had not thus vanished into air otherwise than by preconcerted arrangement he boldly taxed beatrice on the subject  beatrice looked very demure declared that no one in the house had quarrelled with mary confessed that it had been thought prudent that she should for a while stay away from greshamsbury and of course ended by telling her brother everything including all the scenes that had passed between mary and herself  it is out of the question your thinking of marrying her frank said she you must know that nobody feels it more strongly than poor mary herself and beatrice looked the very personification of domestic prudence  i know nothing of the kind said he with the headlong imperative air that was usual with him in discussing matters with his sisters i know nothing of the kind of course i cannot say what marys feelings may be a pretty life she must have had of it among you but you may be sure of this beatrice and so may my mother that nothing on earth shall make me give her upnothing and frank as he made the protestation strengthened his own resolution by thinking of all the counsel that miss dunstable had given him  the brother and sister could hardly agree as beatrice was dead against the match not that she would not have liked mary thorne for a sisterinlaw but that she shared to a certain degree the feeling which was now common to all the greshamsthat frank must marry money it seemed at any rate to be imperative that he should either do that or not marry at all poor beatrice was not very mercenary in her views she had no wish to sacrifice her brother to any miss dunstable but yet she felt as they all feltmary thorne includedthat such a match as that of the young heir with the doctors niece was not to be thought ofnot to be spoken of as a thing that was in any way possible therefore beatrice though she was marys great friend though she was her brothers favourite sister could give frank no encouragement poor frank circumstances had made but one bride possible to him he must marry money  his mother said nothing to him on the subject when she learnt that the affair with miss dunstable was not to come off she merely remarked that it would perhaps be best for him to return to cambridge as soon as possible had she spoken her mind out she would probably have also advised him to remain there as long as possible the countess had not omitted to write to her when frank left courcy castle and the countesss letter certainly made the anxious mother think that her sons education had hardly yet been completed with this secondary object but with that of keeping him out of the way of mary thorne in the first place lady arabella was now quite satisfied that her son should enjoy such advantages as an education completed at the university might give him  with his father frank had a long conversation but alas the gist of his fathers conversation was this that it behoved him frank to marry money the father however did not put it to him in the cold callous way in which his ladyaunt had done and his ladymother he did not bid him go and sell himself to the first female he could find possessed of wealth it was with inward selfreproaches and true grief of spirit that the father told the son that it was not possible for him to do as those may do who are born really rich or really poor  if you marry a girl without a fortune frank how are you to live the father asked after having confessed how deep he himself had injured his own heir  i dont care about money sir said frank i shall be just as happy as if boxall hill had never been sold i dont care a straw about that sort of thing  ah my boy but you will care you will soon find that you do care  let me go into some profession let me go to the bar i am sure i could earn my own living earn it of course i could why not i as well as others i should like of all things to be a barrister  there was much more of the same kind in which frank said all that he could think of to lessen his fathers regrets in their conversation not a word was spoken about mary thorne frank was not aware whether or no his father had been told of the great family danger which was dreaded in that quarter that he had been told we may surmise as lady arabella was not wont to confine the family dangers to her own bosom moreover marys presence had of course been missed the truth was that the squire had been told with great bitterness of what had come to pass and all the evil had been laid at his door he it had been who had encouraged mary to be regarded almost as a daughter of the house of greshamsbury he it was who taught that odious doctorodious in all but his aptitude for good doctoringto think himself a fit match for the aristocracy of the county it had been his fault this great necessity that frank should marry money and now it was his fault that frank was absolutely talking of marrying a pauper  by no means in quiescence did the squire hear these charges brought against him the lady arabella in each attack got quite as much as she gave and at last was driven to retreat in a state of headache which she declared to be chronic and which so she assured her daughter augusta must prevent her from having any more lengthened conversations with her lordat any rate for the next three months but though the squire may be said to have come off on the whole as victor in these combats they did not perhaps have on that account the less effect upon him he knew it was true that he had done much towards ruining his son and he also could think of no other remedy than matrimony it was franks doom pronounced even by the voice of his father that he must marry money  and so frank went off again to cambridge feeling himself as he went to be a much lesser man in greshamsbury estimation than he had been some two months earlier when his birthday had been celebrated once during his short stay at greshamsbury he had seen the doctor but the meeting had been anything but pleasant he had been afraid to ask after mary and the doctor had been too diffident of himself to speak of her they had met casually on the road and though each in his heart loved the other the meeting had been anything but pleasant  and so frank went back to cambridge and as he did so he stoutly resolved that nothing should make him untrue to mary thorne beatrice said he on the morning he went away when she came into his room to superintend his packingbeatrice if she ever talks about me  oh frank my darling frank dont think of itit is madness she knows it is madness  never mind if she ever talks about me tell her that the last word i said was that i would never forget her she can do as she likes  beatrice made no promise never hinted that she would give the message but it may be taken for granted that she had not been long in company with mary thorne before she did give it  and then there were other troubles at greshamsbury it had been decided that augustas marriage was to take place in september but mr moffat had unfortunately been obliged to postpone the happy day he himself had told augustanot of course without protestations as to his regretand had written to this effect to mr gresham electioneering matters and other troubles had he said made this peculiarly painful postponement absolutely necessary  augusta seemed to bear her misfortune with more equanimity than is we believe usual with young ladies under such circumstances she spoke of it to her mother in a very matteroffact way and seemed almost contented at the idea of remaining at greshamsbury till february which was the time now named for the marriage but lady arabella was not equally well satisfied nor was the squire  i half believe that fellow is not honest he had once said out loud before frank and this set frank athinking of what dishonesty in the matter it was probable that mr moffat might be guilty and what would be the fitting punishment for such a crime nor did he think on the subject in vain especially after a conference on the matter which he had with his friend harry baker this conference took place during the christmas vacation  it should be mentioned that the time spent by frank at courcy castle had not done much to assist him in his views as to an early degree and that it had at last been settled that he should stay up at cambridge another year when he came home at christmas he found that the house was not peculiarly lively mary was absent on a visit with miss oriel both these young ladies were staying with miss oriels aunt in the neighbourhood of london and frank soon learnt that there was no chance that either of them would be home before his return no message had been left for him by marynone at least had been left with beatrice and he began in his heart to accuse her of coldness and perfidynot certainly with much justice seeing that she had never given him the slightest encouragement  the absence of patience oriel added to the dullness of the place it was certainly hard upon frank that all the attraction of the village should be removed to make way and prepare for his returnharder perhaps on them for to tell the truth miss oriels visit had been entirely planned to enable her to give mary a comfortable way of leaving greshamsbury during the time that frank should remain at home frank thought himself cruelly used but what did mr oriel think when doomed to eat his christmas pudding alone because the young squire would be unreasonable in his love what did the doctor think as he sat solitary by his deserted hearththe doctor who no longer permitted himself to enjoy the comforts of the greshamsbury diningtable frank hinted and grumbled talked to beatrice of the determined constancy of his love and occasionally consoled himself by a stray smile from some of the neighbouring belles the black horse was made perfect the old grey pony was by no means discarded and much that was satisfactory was done in the sporting line but still the house was dull and frank felt that he was the cause of its being so of the doctor he saw but little he never came to greshamsbury unless to see lady arabella as doctor or to be closeted with the squire there were no social evenings with him no animated confabulations at the doctors house no discourses between them as there had wont to be about the merits of the different covers and the capacities of the different hounds these were dull days on the whole for frank and sad enough we may say for our friend the doctor  in february frank again went back to college having settled with harry baker certain affairs which weighed on his mind he went back to cambridge promising to be home on the 20th of the month so as to be present at his sisters wedding a cold and chilling time had been named for these hymeneal joys but one not altogether unsuited to the feelings of the happy pair february is certainly not a warm month but with the rich it is generally a cosy comfortable time good fires winter cheer groaning tables and warm blankets make a fictitious summer which to some tastes is more delightful than the long days and the hot sun and some marriages are especially winter matches they depend for their charm on the same substantial attractions instead of heart beating to heart in sympathetic unison purse chinks to purse the rich new furniture of the new abode is looked to instead of the rapture of a pure embrace the new carriage is depended on rather than the new hearts companion and the first bright gloss prepared by the upholsterers hands stands in lieu of the rosy tints which young love lends to his true votaries  mr moffat had not spent his christmas at greshamsbury that eternal election petition those eternal lawyers the eternal care of his wellmanaged wealth forbade him the enjoyment of any such pleasures he could not come to greshamsbury for christmas nor yet for the festivities of the new year but now and then he wrote prettily worded notes sending occasionally a silvergilt pencilcase or a small brooch and informed lady arabella that he looked forward to the 20th of february with great satisfaction but in the meanwhile the squire became anxious and at last went up to london and frank who was at cambridge bought the heaviest cutting whip to be found in that town and wrote a confidential letter to harry baker  poor mr moffat it is well known that none but the brave deserve the fair but thou without much excuse for bravery had secured for thyself one who at any rate was fair enough for thee would it not have been well hadst thou looked into thyself to see what real bravery might be in thee before thou hadst prepared to desert this fair one thou hadst already won that last achievement one may say did require some special courage  poor mr moffat it is wonderful that as he sat in that gig going to gatherum castle planning how he would be off with miss gresham and afterwards on with miss dunstable it is wonderful that he should not then have cast his eye behind him and looked at that stalwart pair of shoulders which were so close to his own back as he afterwards pondered on his scheme while sipping the dukes claret it is odd that he should not have observed the fiery pride of purpose and power of wrath which was so plainly written on that young mans brow or when he matured and finished and carried out his purpose that he did not think of that keen grasp which had already squeezed his own hand with somewhat too warm a vigour even in the way of friendship  poor mr moffat it is probable that he forgot to think of frank at all as connected with his promised bride it is probable that he looked forward only to the squires violence and the enmity of the house of courcy and that he found from enquiry at his hearts pulses that he was man enough to meet these could he have guessed what a whip frank gresham would have bought at cambridgecould he have divined what a letter would have been written to harry bakerit is probable nay we think we may say certain that miss gresham would have become mrs moffat  miss gresham however never did become mrs moffat about two days after franks departure for cambridgeit is just possible that mr moffat was so prudent as to make himself aware of the factbut just two days after franks departure a very long elaborate and clearly explanatory letter was received at greshamsbury mr moffat was quite sure that miss gresham and her very excellent parents would do him the justice to believe that he was not actuated c c c the long and the short of this was that mr moffat signified his intention of breaking off the match without offering any intelligible reason  augusta again bore her disappointment well not indeed without sorrow and heartache and inward hidden tears but still well she neither raved nor fainted nor walked about by moonlight alone she wrote no poetry and never once thought of suicide when indeed she remembered the rosytinted lining the unfathomable softness of that longacre carriage her spirit did for one moment give way but on the whole she bore it as a strongminded woman and a de courcy should do  but both lady arabella and the squire were greatly vexed the former had made the match and the latter having consented to it had incurred deeper responsibilities to enable him to bring it about the money which was to have been given to mr moffat was still to the fore but alas how much how much that he could ill spare had been thrown away on bridal preparations it is moreover an unpleasant thing for a gentleman to have his daughter jilted perhaps peculiarly so to have her jilted by a tailors son  lady arabellas woe was really piteous it seemed to her as though cruel fate were heaping misery after misery upon the wretched house of greshamsbury a few weeks since things were going so well with her frank then was all but the accepted husband of almost untold wealthso at least she was informed by her sisterinlawwhereas augusta was the accepted wife of wealth not indeed untold but of dimensions quite sufficiently respectable to cause much joy in the telling where now were her golden hopes where now the splendid future of her poor duped children augusta was left to pine alone and frank in a still worse plight insisted on maintaining his love for a bastard and a pauper  for franks affair she had received some poor consolation by laying all the blame on the squires shoulders what she had then said was now repaid to her with interest for not only had she been the maker of augustas match but she had boasted of the deed with all a mothers pride  it was from beatrice that frank had obtained his tidings this last resolve on the part of mr moffat had not altogether been unsuspected by some of the greshams though altogether unsuspected by the lady arabella frank had spoken of it as a possibility to beatrice and was not quite unprepared when the information reached him he consequently bought his big cutting whip and wrote his confidential letter to harry baker  on the following day frank and harry might have been seen with their heads nearly close together leaning over one of the tables in the large breakfastroom at the tavistock hotel in covent garden the ominous whip to the handle of which frank had already made his hand well accustomed was lying on the table between them and ever and anon harry baker would take it up and feel its weight approvingly oh mr moffat poor mr moffat go not out into the fashionable world today above all go not to that club of thine in pall mall but oh especially go not there as is thy wont to do at three oclock in the afternoon  with much care did those two young generals lay their plans of attack let it not for a moment be thought that it was ever in the minds of either of them that two men should attack one but it was thought that mr moffat might be rather coy in coming out from his seclusion to meet the proffered hand of his once intended brotherinlaw when he should see that hand armed with a heavy whip baker therefore was content to act as a decoy duck and remarked that he might no doubt make himself useful in restraining the public mercy and probably in controlling the interference of policemen  it will be deuced hard if i cant get five or six shies at him said frank again clutching his weapon almost spasmodically oh mr moffat five or six shies with such a whip and such an arm for myself i would sooner join in a second balaclava gallop than encounter it  at ten minutes before four these two heroes might be seen walking up pall mall towards the  club young baker walked with an eager disengaged air mr moffat did not know his appearance he had therefore no anxiety to pass along unnoticed but frank had in some mysterious way drawn his hat very far over his forehead and had buttoned his shootingcoat up round his chin harry had recommended to him a greatcoat in order that he might the better conceal his face but frank had found that the greatcoat was an encumbrance to his arm he put it on and when thus clothed he had tried the whip he found that he cut the air with much less potency than in the lighter garment he contented himself therefore with looking down on the pavement as he walked along letting the long point of the whip stick up from his pocket and flattering himself that even mr moffat would not recognise him at the first glance poor mr moffat if he had but had the chance  and now having arrived at the front of the club the two friends for a moment separate frank remains standing on the pavement under the shade of the high stone arearailing while harry jauntily skips up three steps at a time and with a very civil word of inquiry of the hall porter sends in his card to mr moffat      mr harry baker   mr moffat never having heard of such a gentleman in his life unwittingly comes out into the hall and harry with the sweetest smile addresses him  now the plan of the campaign had been settled in this wise baker was to send into the club for mr moffat and invite that gentleman down into the street it was probable that the invitation might be declined and it had been calculated in such case that the two gentlemen would retire for parley into the strangers room which was known to be immediately opposite the hall door frank was to keep his eye on the portals and if he found that mr moffat did not appear as readily as might be desired he also was to ascend the steps and hurry into the strangers room then whether he met mr moffat there or elsewhere or wherever he might meet him he was to greet him with all the friendly vigour in his power while harry disposed of the club porters  but fortune who ever favours the brave specially favoured frank gresham on this occasion just as harry baker had put his card into the servants hand mr moffat with his hat on prepared for the street appeared in the hall mr baker addressed him with his sweetest smile and begged the pleasure of saying a word or two as they descended into the street had not mr moffat been going thither it would have been very improbable that he should have done so at harrys instance but as it was he merely looked rather solemn at his visitorit was his wont to look solemnand continued the descent of the steps  frank his heart leaping the while saw his prey and retreated two steps behind the arearailing the dread weapon already well poised in his hand oh mr moffat mr moffat if there be any goddess to interfere in thy favour let her come forward now without delay let her now bear thee off on a cloud if there be one to whom thou art sufficiently dear but there is no such goddess  harry smiled blandly till they were well on the pavement saying some nothing and keeping the victims face averted from the avenging angel and then when the raised hand was sufficiently nigh he withdrew two steps towards the nearest lamppost not for him was the honour of the interviewunless indeed succouring policemen might give occasion for some gleam of glory  but succouring policemen were no more to be come by than goddesses where were ye men when that savage whip fell about the ears of the poor exlegislator in scotland yard sitting dozing on your benches or talking soft nothings to the housemaids round the corner for ye were not walking on your beats nor standing at coign of vantage to watch the tumults of the day but had ye been there what could ye have done had sir richard himself been on the spot frank gresham would still we may say have had his five shies at that unfortunate one  when harry baker quickly seceded from the way mr moffat at once saw the fate before him his hair doubtless stood on end and his voice refused to give the loud screech with which he sought to invoke the club an ashy paleness suffused his cheeks and his tottering steps were unable to bear him away in flight once and twice the cutting whip came well down across his back had he been wise enough to stand still and take his thrashing in that attitude it would have been well for him but men so circumstanced have never such prudence after two blows he made a dash at the steps thinking to get back into the club but harry who had by no means reclined in idleness against the lamppost here stopped him you had better go back into the street said harry indeed you had giving him a shove from off the second step  then of course frank could not do other than hit him anywhere when a gentleman is dancing about with much energy it is hardly possible to strike him fairly on his back the blows therefore came now on his legs and now on his head and frank unfortunately got more than his five or six shies before he was interrupted  the interruption however came all too soon for franks idea of justice though there be no policeman to take part in a london row there are always others ready enough to do so amateur policemen who generally sympathise with the wrong side and in nine cases out of ten expend their generous energy in protecting thieves and pickpockets when it was seen with what tremendous ardour that dread weapon fell about the ears of the poor undefended gentleman interference there was at last in spite of harry bakers best endeavours and loudest protestations  do not interrupt them sir said he pray do not it is a family affair and they will neither of them like it  in the teeth however of these assurances rude people did interfere and after some nine or ten shies frank found himself encompassed by the arms and encumbered by the weight of a very stout gentleman who hung affectionately about his neck and shoulders whereas mr moffat was already receiving consolation from two motherly females sitting in a state of syncope on the goodnatured knees of a fishmongers apprentice  frank was thoroughly out of breath nothing came from his lips but halfmuttered expletives and unintelligible denunciations of the iniquity of his foe but still he struggled to be at him again we all know how dangerous is the taste of blood now cruelty will become a custom even with the most tenderhearted frank felt that he had hardly fleshed his virgin lash he thought almost with despair that he had not yet at all succeeded as became a man and a brother his memory told him of but one or two of the slightest touches that had gone well home to the offender he made a desperate effort to throw off that incubus round his neck and rush again to the combat  harryharry dont let him godont let him go he barely articulated  do you want to murder the man sir to murder him said the stout gentleman over his shoulder speaking solemnly into his very ear  i dont care said frank struggling manfully but uselessly let me out i say i dont caredont let him go harry whatever you do  he has got it prettily tidily said harry i think that will perhaps do for the present  by this time there was a considerable concourse the club steps were crowded with the members among whom there were many of mr moffats acquaintance policemen also now flocked up and the question arose as to what should be done with the originators of the affray frank and harry found that they were to consider themselves under a gentle arrest and mr moffat in a fainting state was carried into the interior of the club  frank in his innocence had intended to have celebrated this little affair when it was over by a light repast and a bottle of claret with his friend and then to have gone back to cambridge by the mail train he found however that his schemes in this respect were frustrated he had to get bail to attend at marlborough street policeoffice should he be wanted within the next two or three days and was given to understand that he would be under the eye of the police at any rate until mr moffat should be out of danger  out of danger said frank to his friend with a startled look why i hardly got at him nevertheless they did have their slight repast and also their bottle of claret  on the second morning after this occurrence frank was again sitting in that public room at the tavistock and harry was again sitting opposite to him the whip was not now so conspicuously produced between them having been carefully packed up and put away among franks other travelling properties they were so sitting rather glum when the door swung open and a heavy quick step was heard advancing towards them it was the squire whose arrival there had been momentarily expected  frank said hefrank what on earth is all this and as he spoke he stretched out both hands the right to his son and the left to his friend  he has given a blackguard a licking that is all said harry  frank felt that his hand was held with a peculiarly warm grasp and he could not but think that his fathers face raised though his eyebrows werethough there was on it an intended expression of amazement and perhaps regretnevertheless he could not but think that his fathers face looked kindly at him  god bless my soul my dear boy what have you done to the man  hes not a haporth the worse sir said frank still holding his fathers hand  oh isnt he said harry shrugging his shoulders he must be made of some very tough article then  but my dear boys i hope theres no danger i hope theres no danger  danger said frank who could not yet induce himself to believe that he had been allowed a fair chance with mr moffat  oh frank frank how could you be so rash in the middle of pall mall too well well well all the women down at greshamsbury will have it that you have killed him  i almost wish i had said frank  oh frank frank but now tell me  and then the father sat well pleased while he heard chiefly from harry baker the full story of his sons prowess and then they did not separate without another slight repast and another bottle of claret  mr moffat retired to the country for a while and then went abroad having doubtless learnt that the petition was not likely to give him a seat for the city of barchester and this was the end of the wooing with miss gresham     chapter xxii  sir roger is unseated   after this little occurred at greshamsbury or among greshamsbury people which it will be necessary for us to record some notice was of course taking of franks prolonged absence from his college and tidings perhaps exaggerated tidings of what had happened in pall mall were not slow to reach the high street of cambridge but that affair was gradually hushed up and frank went on with his studies  he went back to his studies it then being an understood arrangement between him and his father that he should not return to greshamsbury till the summer vacation on this occasion the squire and lady arabella had strange to say been of the same mind they both wished to keep their son away from miss thorne and both calculated that at his age and with his disposition it was not probable that any passion would last out a six months absence and when the summer comes it will be an excellent opportunity for us to go abroad said lady arabella poor augusta will require some change to renovate her spirits  to this last proposition the squire did not assent it was however allowed to pass over and this much was fixed that frank was not to return home till midsummer  it will be remembered that sir roger scatcherd had been elected as sitting member for the city of barchester but it will also be remembered that a petition against his return was threatened had that petition depended solely on mr moffat sir rogers seat no doubt would have been saved by frank greshams cutting whip but such was not the case mr moffat had been put forward by the de courcy interest and that noble family with its dependants was not to go to the wall because mr moffat had had a thrashing no the petition was to go on and mr nearthewinde declared that no petition in his hands had half so good a chance of success chance no but certainty said mr nearthewinde for mr nearthewinde had learnt something with reference to that honest publican and the payment of his little bill  the petition was presented and duly backed the recognisances were signed and all the proper formalities formally executed and sir roger found that his seat was in jeopardy his return had been a great triumph to him and unfortunately he had celebrated that triumph as he had been in the habit of celebrating most of the very triumphant occasions of his life though he was than hardly yet recovered from the effects of his last attack he indulged in another violent drinking bout and strange to say did so without any immediate visible bad effects  in february he took his seat amidst the warm congratulations of all men of his own class and early in the month of april his case came on for trial every kind of electioneering sin known to the electioneering world was brought to his charge he was accused of falseness dishonesty and bribery of every sort he had it was said in the paper of indictment bought votes obtained them by treating carried them off by violence conquered them by strong drink polled them twice over counted those of dead men stolen them forged them and created them by every possible fictitious contrivance there was no description of wickedness appertaining to the task of procuring votes of which sir roger had not been guilty either by himself or by his agents he was quite horrorstruck at the list of his own enormities but he was somewhat comforted when mr closerstil told him that the meaning of it all was that mr romer the barrister had paid a former bill due to mr reddypalm the publican  i fear he was indiscreet sir roger i really fear he was those young men always are being energetic they work like horses but whats the use of energy without discretion sir roger  but mr closerstil i knew nothing about it from first to last  the agency can be proved sir roger said mr closerstil shaking his head and then there was nothing further to be said on the matter  in these days of snowwhite purity all political delinquency is abominable in the eyes of british politicians but no delinquency is so abominable as that of venality at elections the sin of bribery is damnable it is the one sin for which in the house of commons there can be no forgiveness when discovered it should render the culprit liable to political death without hope of pardon it is treason against a higher throne than that on which the queen sits it is a heresy which requires an autodafé it is a pollution to the whole house which can only be cleansed by a great sacrifice anathema maranatha out with it from amongst us even though the half of our hearts blood be poured forth in the conflict out with it and for ever  such is the language of patriotic members with regard to bribery and doubtless if sincere they are in the right it is a bad thing certainly that a rich man should buy votes bad also that a poor man should sell them by all means let us repudiate such a system with heartfelt disgust  with heartfelt disgust if we can do so by all means but not with disgust pretended only and not felt in the heart at all the laws against bribery at elections are now so stringent that an unfortunate candidate may easily become guilty even though actuated by the purest intentions but not the less on that account does any gentleman ambitious of the honour of serving his country in parliament think it necessary as a preliminary measure to provide a round sum of money at his bankers a candidate must pay for no treating no refreshments no band of music he must give neither ribbons to the girls nor ale to the men if a huzza be uttered in his favour it is at his peril it may be necessary for him to prove before a committee that it was the spontaneous result of british feeling in his favour and not the purchased result of british beer he cannot safely ask any one to share his hotel dinner bribery hides itself now in the most impalpable shapes and may be effected by the offer of a glass of sherry but not the less on this account does a poor man find that he is quite unable to overcome the difficulties of a contested election  we strain at our gnats with a vengeance but we swallow our camels with ease for what purpose is it that we employ those peculiarly safe men of businessmessrs nearthewinde and closerstilwhen we wish to win our path through all obstacles into that sacred recess if all be so open all so easy all so much above board alas the money is still necessary is still prepared or at any rate expended the poor candidate of course knows nothing of the matter till the attorneys bill is laid before him when all danger of petitions has passed away he little dreamed till then not he that there had been banquetings and junketings secret doings and deep drinkings at his expense poor candidate poor member who was so ignorant as he tis true he has paid such bills before but tis equally true that he specially begged his managing friend mr nearthewinde to be very careful that all was done according to law he pays the bill however and on the next election will again employ mr nearthewinde  now and again at rare intervals some glimpse into the inner sanctuary does reach the eyes of ordinary mortal men without some slight accidental peep into those mysteries from whence all corruption has been so thoroughly expelled and then how delightfully refreshing is the sight when perhaps some exmember hurled from his paradise like a fallen peri reveals the secret of that pure heaven and in the agony of his despair tells us all that it cost him to sit for  through those few halcyon years  but mr nearthewinde is a safe man and easy to be employed with but little danger all these stringent bribery laws only enhance the value of such very safe men as mr nearthewinde to him stringent laws against bribery are the strongest assurance of valuable employment were these laws of a nature to be evaded with ease any indifferent attorney might manage a candidates affairs and enable him to take his seat with security  it would have been well for sir roger if he had trusted solely to mr closerstil well also for mr romer had he never fished in those troubled waters in due process of time the hearing of the petition came on and then who so happy sitting at his ease at his london inn blowing his cloud from a long pipe with measureless content as mr reddypalm mr reddypalm was the one great man of the contest all depended on mr reddypalm and well he did his duty  the result of the petition was declared by the committee to be as followsthat sir rogers election was null and voidthat the election altogether was null and voidthat sir roger had by his agent been guilty of bribery in obtaining a vote by the payment of a bill alleged to have been previously refused paymentthat sir roger himself knew nothing about itthis is always a matter of coursebut that sir rogers agent mr romer had been wittingly guilty of bribery with reference to the transaction above described poor sir roger poor mr romer  poor mr romer indeed his fate was perhaps as sad as well might be and as foul a blot to the purism of these very pure times in which we live not long after those days it so happening that some considerable amount of youthful energy and quidnunc ability were required to set litigation afloat at hongkong mr romer was sent thither as the fittest man for such work with rich assurance of future guerdon who so happy then as mr romer but even among the pure there is room for envy and detraction mr romer had not yet ceased to wonder at new worlds as he skimmed among the islands of that southern ocean before the edict had gone forth for his return there were men sitting in that huge court of parliament on whose breasts it lay as an intolerable burden that england should be represented among the antipodes by one who had tampered with the purity of the franchise for them there was no rest till this great disgrace should be wiped out and atoned for men they were of that calibre that the slightest reflection on them of such a stigma seemed to themselves to blacken their own character they could not break bread with satisfaction till mr romer was recalled he was recalled and of course ruinedand the minds of those just men were then at peace  to any honourable gentleman who really felt his brow suffused with a patriotic blush as he thought of his country dishonoured by mr romers presence at hongkongto any such gentleman if any such there were let all honour be given even though the intensity of his purity may create amazement to our less finely organised souls but if no such blush suffused the brow of any honourable gentleman if mr romer was recalled from quite other feelingswhat then in lieu of honour shall we allot to those honourable gentlemen who were most concerned  sir roger however lost his seat and after three months of the joys of legislation found himself reduced by a terrible blow to the low level of private life  and the blow to him was very heavy men but seldom tell the truth of what is in them even to their dearest friends they are ashamed of having feelings or rather of showing that they are troubled by any intensity of feeling it is the practice of the time to treat all pursuits as though they were only half important to us as though in what we desire we were only half in earnest to be visibly eager seems childish and is always bad policy and men therefore nowadays though they strive as hard as ever in the service of ambitionharder than ever in that of mammonusually do so with a pleasant smile on as though after all they were but amusing themselves with the little matter in hand  perhaps it had been so with sir roger in those electioneering days when he was looking for votes at any rate he had spoken of his seat in parliament as but a doubtful good he was willing indeed to stand having been asked but the thing would interfere wonderfully with his business and then what did he know about parliament nothing on earth it was the maddest scheme but nevertheless he was not going to hang back when called uponhe had always been rough and ready when wantedand there he was now ready as ever and rough enough too god knows  twas thus that he had spoken of his coming parliamentary honours and men had generally taken him at his word he had been returned and this success had been hailed as a great thing for the cause and class to which he belonged but men did not know that his inner heart was swelling with triumph and that his bosom could hardly contain his pride as he reflected that the poor barchester stonemason was now the representative in parliament of his native city and so when his seat was attacked he still laughed and joked they were welcome to it for him he said he could keep it or want it and of the two perhaps the want of it would come most convenient to him he did not exactly think that he had bribed any one but if the bigwigs chose to say so it was all one to him he was rough and ready now as ever c c  but when the struggle came it was to him a fearful one not the less fearful because there was no one no not one friend in all the world to whom he could open his mind and speak out honestly what was in his heart to dr thorne he might perhaps have done so had his intercourse with the doctor been sufficiently frequent but it was only now and again when he was ill or when the squire wanted to borrow money that he saw dr thorne he had plenty of friends heaps of friends in the parliamentary sense friends who talked about him and lauded him at public meetings who shook hands with him on platforms and drank his health at dinners but he had no friend who could sit with him over his own hearth in true friendship and listen to and sympathise with and moderate the sighings of the inner man for him there was no sympathy no tenderness of love no retreat save into himself from the loud brass band of the outer world  the blow hit him terribly hard it did not come altogether unexpectedly and yet when it did come it was all but unendurable he had made so much of the power of walking into that august chamber and sitting shoulder to shoulder in legislative equality with the sons of dukes and the curled darlings of the nation money had given him nothing nothing but the mere feeling of brute power with his three hundred thousand pounds he had felt himself to be no more palpably near to the goal of his ambition than when he had chipped stones for three shillings and sixpence a day but when he was led up and introduced at that table when he shook the old premiers hand on the floor of the house of commons when he heard the honourable member for barchester alluded to in grave debate as the greatest living authority on railway matters then indeed he felt that he had achieved something  and now this cup was ravished from his lips almost before it was tasted when he was first told as a certainty that the decision of the committee was against him he bore up against the misfortune like a man he laughed heartily and declared himself well rid of a very profitless profession cut some little joke about mr moffat and his thrashing and left on those around him an impression that he was a man so constituted so strong in his own resolves so steadily pursuant of his own work that no little contentions of this kind could affect him men admired his easy laughter as shuffling his halfcrowns with both his hands in his trouserpockets he declared that messrs romer and reddypalm were the best friends he had known for this many a day  but not the less did he walk out from the room in which he was standing a brokenhearted man hope could not buoy him up as she may do other exmembers in similarly disagreeable circumstances he could not afford to look forward to what further favours parliamentary future might have in store for him after a lapse of five or six years five or six years why his life was not worth four years purchase of that he was perfectly aware he could not now live without the stimulus of brandy and yet while he took it he knew he was killing himself death he did not fear but he would fain have wished after his life of labour to have lived while yet he could live in the blaze of that high world to which for a moment he had attained  he laughed loud and cheerily as he left his parliamentary friends and putting himself into the train went down to boxall hill he laughed loud and cheerily but he never laughed again it had not been his habit to laugh much at boxall hill it was there he kept his wife and mr winterbones and the brandy bottle behind his pillow he had not often there found it necessary to assume that loud and cheery laugh  on this occasion he was apparently well in health when he got home but both lady scatcherd and mr winterbones found him more than ordinarily cross he made an affectation at sitting very hard to business and even talked of going abroad to look at some of his foreign contracts but even winterbones found that his patron did not work as he had been wont to do and at last with some misgivings he told lady scatcherd that he feared that everything was not right  hes always at it my lady always said mr winterbones  is he said lady scatcherd well understanding what mr winterboness allusion meant  always my lady i never saw nothing like it now theres mei can always go my halfhour when ive had my drop but he why he dont go ten minutes not now  this was not cheerful to lady scatcherd but what was the poor woman to do when she spoke to him on any subject he only snarled at her and now that the heavy fit was on him she did not dare even to mention the subject of his drinking she had never known him so savage in his humour as he was now so bearish in his habits so little inclined to humanity so determined to rush headlong down with his head between his legs into the bottomless abyss  she thought of sending for dr thorne but she did not know under what guise to send for himwhether as doctor or as friend under neither would he now be welcome and she well knew that sir roger was not the man to accept in good part either a doctor or a friend who might be unwelcome she knew that this husband of hers this man who with all his faults was the best of her friends whom of all she loved bestshe knew that he was killing himself and yet she could do nothing sir roger was his own master and if kill himself he would kill himself he must  and kill himself he did not indeed by one sudden blow he did not take one huge dose of his consuming poison and then fall dead upon the floor it would perhaps have been better for himself and better for those around him had he done so no the doctors had time to congregate around his bed lady scatcherd was allowed a period of nursetending the sick man was able to say his last few words and bid adieu to his portion of the lower world with dying decency as these last words will have some lasting effect upon the surviving personages of our story the reader must be content to stand for a short while by the side of sir rogers sickbed and help us to bid him godspeed on the journey which lies before him     chapter xxiii  retrospective   it was declared in the early pages of this work that dr thorne was to be our hero but it would appear very much as though he had latterly been forgotten since that evening when he retired to rest without letting mary share the grievous weight which was on his mind we have neither seen nor heard aught of him  it was then full midsummer and it is now early spring and during the intervening months the doctor had not had a happy time of it on that night as we have before told he took his niece to his heart but he could not then bring himself to tell her that which it was so imperative that she should know like a coward he would put off the evil hour till the next morning and thus robbed himself of his nights sleep  but when the morning came the duty could not be postponed lady arabella had given him to understand that his niece would no longer be a guest at greshamsbury and it was quite out of the question that mary after this should be allowed to put her foot within the gate of the domain without having learnt what lady arabella had said so he told it her before breakfast walking round their little garden she with her hand in his  he was perfectly thunderstruck by the collectednay cool way in which she received his tidings she turned pale indeed he felt also that her hand somewhat trembled in his own and he perceived that for a moment her voice shook but no angry word escaped her lip nor did she even deign to repudiate the charge which was as it were conveyed in lady arabellas request the doctor knew or thought he knewnay he did knowthat mary was wholly blameless in the matter that she had at least given no encouragement to any love on the part of the young heir but nevertheless he had expected that she would avouch her own innocence this however she by no means did  lady arabella is quite right she said quite right if she has any fear of that kind she cannot be too careful  she is a selfish proud woman said the doctor quite indifferent to the feelings of others quite careless how deeply she may hurt her neighbours if in doing so she may possibly benefit herself  she will not hurt me uncle nor yet you i can live without going to greshamsbury  but it is not to be endured that she should dare to cast an imputation on my darling  on me uncle she casts no imputation on me frank has been foolish i have said nothing of it for it was not worth while to trouble you but as lady arabella chooses to interfere i have no right to blame her he has said what he should not have said he has been foolish uncle you know i could not prevent it  let her send him away then not you let her banish him  uncle he is her son a mother can hardly send her son away so easily could you send me away uncle  he merely answered her by twining his arm round her waist and pressing her to his side he was well sure that she was badly treated and yet now that she so unaccountably took lady arabellas part he hardly knew how to make this out plainly to be the case  besides uncle greshamsbury is in a manner his own how can he be banished from his fathers house no uncle there is an end of my visits there they shall find that i will not thrust myself in their way  and then mary with a calm brow and steady gait went in and made the tea  and what might be the feelings of her heart when she so sententiously told her uncle that frank had been foolish she was of the same age with him as impressionable though more powerful in hiding such impressionsas all women should be her heart was as warm her blood as full of life her innate desire for the companionship of some muchloved object as strong as his frank had been foolish in avowing his passion no such folly as that could be laid at her door but had she been proof against the other folly had she been able to walk heartwhole by his side while he chatted his commonplaces about love yes they are commonplaces when we read of them in novels common enough too to some of us when we write them but they are by no means commonplace when first heard by a young girl in the rich balmy fragrance of a july evening stroll  nor are they commonplaces when so uttered for the first or second time at least or perhaps the third tis a pity that so heavenly a pleasure should pall upon the senses  if it was so that franks folly had been listened to with a certain amount of pleasure mary did not even admit so much to herself but why should it have been otherwise why should she have been less prone to love than he was had he not everything which girls do love which girls should love which god created noble beautiful all but godlike in order that women all but goddesslike might love to love thoroughly truly heartily with her whole body soul heart and strength should not that be counted for a merit in a woman and yet we are wont to make a disgrace of it we do so most unnaturally most unreasonably for we expect our daughters to get themselves married off our hands when the period of that step comes then love is proper enough but up to thatbefore thatas regards all those preliminary passages which must we suppose be necessaryin all those it becomes a young lady to be icyhearted as a rivergod in winter      o whistle and ill come to you my lad    o whistle and ill come to you my lad    tho father and mither and a should go mad    o whistle and ill come to you my lad   this is the kind of love which a girl should feel before she puts her hand proudly in that of her lover and consents that they two shall be made one flesh  mary felt no such love as this she too had some inner perception of that dread destiny by which it behoved frank gresham to be forewarned she toothough she had never heard so much said in wordshad an almost instinctive knowledge that his fate required him to marry money thinking over this in her own way she was not slow to convince herself that it was out of the question that she should allow herself to love frank gresham however well her heart might be inclined to such a feeling it was her duty to repress it she resolved therefore to do so and she sometimes flattered herself that she had kept her resolution  these were bad times for the doctor and bad times for mary too she had declared that she could live without going to greshamsbury but she did not find it so easy she had been going to greshamsbury all her life and it was as customary with her to be there as at home such old customs are not broken without pain had she left the place it would have been far different but as it was she daily passed the gates daily saw and spoke to some of the servants who knew her as well as they did the young ladies of the familywas in hourly contact as it were with greshamsbury it was not only that she did not go there but that everyone knew that she had suddenly discontinued doing so yes she could live without going to greshamsbury but for some time she had but a poor life of it she felt nay almost heard that every man and woman boy and girl in the village was telling his and her neighbour that mary thorne no longer went to the house because of lady arabella and the young squire  but beatrice of course came to her what was she to say to beatrice the truth nay but it is not always so easy to say the truth even to ones dearest friends  but youll come up now he has gone said beatrice  no indeed said mary that would hardly be pleasant to lady arabella nor to me either no trichy dearest my visits to dear old greshamsbury are done done done perhaps in some twenty years time i may be walking down the lawn with your brother and discussing our childish daysthat is always if the then mrs gresham shall have invited me  how can frank have been so wrong so unkind so cruel said beatrice  this however was a light in which miss thorne did not take any pleasure in discussing the matter her ideas of franks fault and unkindness and cruelty were doubtless different from those of his sister such cruelty was not unnaturally excused in her eyes by many circumstances which beatrice did not fully understand mary was quite ready to go hand in hand with lady arabella and the rest of the greshamsbury fold in putting an end if possible to franks passion she would give no one a right to accuse her of assisting to ruin the young heir but she could hardly bring herself to admit that he was so very wrongno nor yet even so very cruel  and then the squire came to see her and this was a yet harder trial than the visit of beatrice it was so difficult for her to speak to him that she could not but wish him away and yet had he not come had he altogether neglected her she would have felt it to be unkind she had ever been his pet had always received kindness from him  i am sorry for all this mary very sorry said he standing up and holding both her hands in his  it cant be helped sir said she smiling  i dont know said he i dont knowit ought to be helped somehowi am quite sure you have not been to blame  no said she very quietly as though the position was one quite a matter of course i dont think i have been very much to blame there will be misfortunes sometimes when nobody is to blame  i do not quite understand it all said the squire but if frank  oh we will not talk about him said she still laughing gently  you can understand mary how dear he must be to me but if  mr gresham i would not for worlds be the cause of any unpleasantness between you and him  but i cannot bear to think that we have banished you mary  it cannot be helped things will all come right in time  but you will be so lonely here  oh i shall get over all that here you know mr gresham i am monarch of all i survey and there is a great deal in that  the squire did not quite catch her meaning but a glimmering of it did reach him it was competent to lady arabella to banish her from greshamsbury it was within the sphere of the squires duties to prohibit his son from an imprudent match it was for the greshams to guard their greshamsbury treasure as best they could within their own territories but let them beware that they did not attack her on hers in obedience to the first expression of their wishes she had submitted herself to this public mark of their disapproval because she had seen at once with her clear intellect that they were only doing that which her conscience must approve without a murmur therefore she consented to be pointed at as the young lady who had been turned out of greshamsbury because of the young squire she had no help for it but let them take care that they did not go beyond that outside those greshamsbury gates she and frank gresham she and lady arabella met on equal terms let them each fight their own battle  the squire kissed her forehead affectionately and took his leave feeling somehow that he had been excused and pitied and made much of whereas he had called on his young neighbour with the intention of excusing and pitying and making much of her he was not quite comfortable as he left the house but nevertheless he was sufficiently honesthearted to own to himself that mary thorne was a fine girl only that it was so absolutely necessary that frank should marry moneyand only also that poor mary was such a birthless foundling in the worlds esteemonly but for these things what a wife she would have made for that son of his  to one person only did she talk freely on the subject and that one was patience oriel and even with her the freedom was rather of the mind than of the heart she never said a word of her feeling with reference to frank but she said much of her position in the village and of the necessity she was under to keep out of the way  it is very hard said patience that the offence should be all with him and the punishment all with you  oh as for that said mary laughing i will not confess to any offence nor yet to any punishment certainly not to any punishment  it comes to the same thing in the end  no not so patience there is always some little sting of disgrace in punishment now i am not going to hold myself in the least disgraced  but mary you must meet the greshams sometimes  meet them i have not the slightest objection on earth to meet all or any of them they are not a whit dangerous to me my dear tis i that am the wild beast and tis they that must avoid me and then she added after a pauseslightly blushingi have not the slightest objection even to meet him if chance brings him in my way let them look to that my undertaking goes no further than this that i will not be seen within their gates  but the girls so far understood each other that patience undertook rather than promised to give mary what assistance she could and despite marys bravado she was in such a position that she much wanted the assistance of such a friend as miss oriel  after an absence of some six weeks frank as we have seen returned home nothing was said to him except by beatrice as to these new greshamsbury arrangements and he when he found mary was not at the place went boldly to the doctors house to seek her but it has been seen also that she discreetly kept out of his way this she had thought fit to do when the time came although she had been so ready with her boast that she had no objection on earth to meet him  after that there had been the christmas vacation and mary had again found discretion to be the better part of valour this was doubtless disagreeable enough she had no particular wish to spend her christmas with miss oriels aunt instead of at her uncles fireside indeed her christmas festivities had hitherto been kept at greshamsbury the doctor and herself having made a part of the family circle there assembled this was out of the question now and perhaps the absolute change to old miss oriels house was better for her than the lesser change to her uncles drawingroom besides how could she have demeaned herself when she met frank in their parish church all this had been fully understood by patience and therefore had this christmas visit been planned  and then this affair of frank and mary thorne ceased for a while to be talked of at greshamsbury for that other affair of mr moffat and augusta monopolised the rural attention augusta as we have said bore it well and sustained the public gaze without much flinching her period of martyrdom however did not last long for soon the news arrived of franks exploit in pall mall and then the greshamsburyites forgot to think much more of augusta being fully occupied in thinking of what frank had done  the tale as it was first told declared that frank had followed mr moffat up into his club had dragged him thence into the middle of pall mall and had then slaughtered him on the spot this was by degrees modified till a sobered fiction became generally prevalent that mr moffat was lying somewhere still alive but with all his bones in a general state of compound fracture this adventure again brought frank into the ascendant and restored to mary her former position as the greshamsbury heroine  one cannot wonder at his being very angry said beatrice discussing the matter with maryvery imprudently  wonderno the wonder would have been if he had not been angry one might have been quite sure that he would have been angry enough  i suppose it was not absolutely right for him to beat mr moffat said beatrice apologetically  not right trichy i think he was very right  not to beat him so very much mary  oh i suppose a man cant exactly stand measuring how much he does these things i like your brother for what he has done and i say so franklythough i suppose i ought to eat my tongue out before i should say such a thing eh trichy  i dont know that theres any harm in that said beatrice demurely if you both liked each other there would be no harm in thatif that were all  wouldnt there said mary in a low tone of bantering satire that is so kind trichy coming from youfrom one of the family you know  you are well aware mary that if i could have my wishes  yes i am well aware what a paragon of goodness you are if you could have your way i should be admitted into heaven again shouldnt i only with this proviso that if a stray angel should ever whisper to me with bated breath mistaking me perchance for one of his own class i should be bound to close my ears to his whispering and remind him humbly that i was only a poor mortal you would trust me so far wouldnt you trichy  i would trust you in any way mary but i think you are unkind in saying such things to me  into whatever heaven i am admitted i will go only on this understanding that i am to be as good an angel as any of those around me  but mary dear why do you say this to me  becausebecausebecauseah me why indeed but because i have no one else to say it to certainly not because you have deserved it  it seems as though you were finding fault with me  and so i am how can i do other than find fault how can i help being sore trichy you hardly realise my position you hardly see how i am treated how i am forced to allow myself to be treated without a sign of complaint you dont see it all if you did you would not wonder that i should be sore  beatrice did not quite see it all but she saw enough of it to know that mary was to be pitied so instead of scolding her friend for being cross she threw her arms round her and kissed her affectionately  but the doctor all this time suffered much more than his niece did he could not complain out loudly he could not aver that his pet lamb had been ill treated he could not even have the pleasure of openly quarrelling with lady arabella but not the less did he feel it to be most cruel that mary should have to live before the world as an outcast because it had pleased frank gresham to fall in love with her  but his bitterness was not chiefly against frank that frank had been very foolish he could not but acknowledge but it was a kind of folly for which the doctor was able to find excuse for lady arabellas cold propriety he could find no excuse  with the squire he had spoken no word on the subject up to this period of which we are now writing with her ladyship he had never spoken on it since that day when she had told him that mary was to come no more to greshamsbury he never now dined or spent his evenings at greshamsbury and seldom was to be seen at the house except when called in professionally the squire indeed he frequently met but he either did so in the village or out on horseback or at his own house  when the doctor first heard that sir roger had lost his seat and had returned to boxall hill he resolved to go over and see him but the visit was postponed from day to day as visits are postponed which may be made any day and he did not in fact go till he was summoned there somewhat peremptorily a message was brought to him one evening to say that sir roger had been struck by paralysis and that not a moment was to be lost  it always happens at night said mary who had more sympathy for the living uncle whom she did know than for the other dying uncle whom she did not know  what matterstherejust give me my scarf in all probability i may not be home tonightperhaps not till late tomorrow god bless you mary and away the doctor went on his cold bleak ride to boxall hill  who will be his heir as the doctor rode along he could not quite rid his mind of this question the poor man now about to die had wealth enough to make many heirs what if his heart should have softened towards his sisters child what if mary should be found in a few days to be possessed of such wealth that the greshams should be again be happy to welcome her at greshamsbury  the doctor was not a lover of moneyand he did his best to get rid of such pernicious thoughts but his longings perhaps were not so much that mary should be rich as that she should have the power of heaping coals of fire upon the heads of those people who had so injured her     chapter xxiv  louis scatcherd   when dr thorne reached boxall hill he found mr rerechild from barchester there before him poor lady scatcherd when her husband was stricken by the fit hardly knew in her dismay what adequate steps to take she had as a matter of course sent for dr thorne but she had thought that in so grave a peril the medical skill of no one man could suffice it was she knew quite out of the question for her to invoke the aid of dr fillgrave whom no earthly persuasion would have brought to boxall hill and as mr rerechild was supposed in the barchester world to be secondthough at a long intervalto that great man she had applied for his assistance  now mr rerechild was a follower and humble friend of dr fillgrave and was wont to regard anything that came from the barchester doctor as sure light from the lamp of Æsculapius he could not therefore be other than an enemy of dr thorne but he was a prudent discreet man with a long family averse to professional hostilities as knowing that he could make more by medical friends than medical foes and not at all inclined to take up any mans cudgel to his own detriment he had of course heard of that dreadful affront which had been put upon his friend as had all the medical worldall the medical world at least of barsetshire and he had often expressed his sympathy with dr fillgrave and his abhorrence of dr thornes antiprofessional practices but now that he found himself about to be brought in contact with dr thorne he reflected that the galen of greshamsbury was at any rate equal in reputation to him of barchester that the one was probably on the rise whereas the other was already considered by some as rather antiquated and he therefore wisely resolved that the present would be an excellent opportunity for him to make a friend of dr thorne  poor lady scatcherd had an inkling that dr fillgrave and mr rerechild were accustomed to row in the same boat and she was not altogether free from fear that there might be an outbreak she therefore took an opportunity before dr thornes arrival to deprecate any wrathful tendency  oh lady scatcherd i have the greatest respect for dr thorne said he the greatest possible respect a most skilful practitionersomething brusque certainly and perhaps a little obstinate but what then we all have our faults lady scatcherd  ohyes we all have mr rerechild thats certain  theres my friend fillgravelady scatcherd he cannot bear anything of that sort now i think hes wrong and so i tell him mr rerechild was in error here for he had never yet ventured to tell dr fillgrave that he was wrong in anything we must bear and forbear you know dr thorne is an excellent manin his way very excellent lady scatcherd  this little conversation took place after mr rerechilds first visit to his patient what steps were immediately taken for the relief of the sufferer we need not describe they were doubtless well intended and were perhaps as well adapted to stave off the coming evil day as any that dr fillgrave or even the great sir omicron pie might have used  and then dr thorne arrived  oh doctor doctor exclaimed lady scatcherd almost hanging round his neck in the hall what are we to do what are we to do hes very bad  has he spoken  no nothing like a word he has made one or two muttered sounds but poor soul you could make nothing of itoh doctor doctor he has never been like this before  it was easy to see where lady scatcherd placed any such faith as she might still have in the healing art mr rerechild is here and has seen him she continued i thought it best to send for two for fear of accidents he has done somethingi dont know what but doctor do tell the truth now i look to you to tell me the truth  dr thorne then went up and saw his patient and had he literally complied with lady scatcherds request he might have told her at once that there was no hope as however he had not the heart to do this he mystified the case as doctors so well know how to do and told her that there was cause to fear great cause for fear he was sorry to say very great cause for much fear  dr thorne promised to stay the night there and if possible the following night also and then lady scatcherd became troubled in her mind as to what she should do with mr rerechild he also declared with much medical humanity that let the inconvenience be what it might he too would stay the night the loss he said of such a man as sir roger scatcherd was of such paramount importance as to make other matters trivial he would certainly not allow the whole weight to fall on the shoulders of his friend dr thorne he also would stay at any rate that night by the sick mans bedside by the following morning some change might be expected  i say dr thorne said her ladyship calling the doctor into the housekeepingroom in which she and hannah spent any time that they were not required upstairs just come in doctor you couldnt tell him we dont want him any more could you  tell whom said the doctor  whymr rerechild mightnt he go away do you think  dr thorne explained that mr rerechild certainly might go away if he pleased but that it would by no means be proper for one doctor to tell another to leave the house and so mr rerechild was allowed to share the glories of the night  in the meantime the patient remained speechless but it soon became evident that nature was using all her efforts to make one final rally from time to time he moaned and muttered as though he was conscious and it seemed as though he strove to speak he gradually became awake at any rate to suffering and dr thorne began to think that the last scene would be postponed for yet a while longer  wonderful strong constitutioneh dr thorne wonderful said mr rerechild  yes he has been a strong man  strong as a horse dr thorne lord what that man would have been if he had given himself a chance you know his constitution of course  yes pretty well ive attended him for many years  always drinking i suppose always at iteh  he has not been a temperate man certainly  the brain you see clean goneand not a particle of coating left to the stomach and yet what a struggle he makesan interesting case isnt it  its very sad to see such an intellect so destroyed  very sad very sad indeed how fillgrave would have liked to have seen this case he is a clever man is fillgravein his way you know  im sure he is said dr thorne  not that hed make anything of a case like this nowhes not you know quitequiteperhaps not quite up to the new time of day if one may say so  he has had a very extensive provincial practice said dr thorne  oh veryvery and made a tidy lot of money too has fillgrave hes worth six thousand pounds i suppose now thats a good deal of money to put by in a little town like barchester  yes indeed  what i say to fillgrave is thiskeep your eyes open one should never be too old to learntheres always something new worth picking up but nohe wont believe that he cant believe that any new ideas can be worth anything you know a man must go to the wall in that wayeh doctor  and then again they were called to their patient hes doing finely finely said mr rerechild to lady scatcherd theres fair ground to hope hell rally fair ground is there not doctor  yes hell rally but how long that may last that we can hardly say  oh no certainly not certainly notthat is not with any certainty but still hes doing finely lady scatcherd considering everything  how long will you give him doctor said mr rerechild to his new friend when they were again alone ten days i dare say ten days or from that to a fortnight not more but i think hell struggle on ten days  perhaps so said the doctor i should not like to say exactly to a day  no certainly not we cannot say exactly to a day but i say ten days as for anything like a recovery that you know  is out of the question said dr thorne gravely  quite so quite so coating of the stomach clean gone you know brain destroyed did you observe the periporollida i never saw them so swelled before now when the periporollida are swollen like that  yes very much its always the case when paralysis has been brought about by intemperance  always always i have remarked that always the periporollida in such cases are always extended most interesting case isnt it i do wish fillgrave could have seen it but i believe you and fillgrave dont quiteeh  no not quite said dr thorne who as he thought of his last interview with dr fillgrave and of that gentlemans exceeding anger as he stood in the hall below could not keep himself from smiling sad as the occasion was  nothing would induce lady scatcherd to go to bed but the two doctors agreed to lie down each in a room on one side of the patient how was it possible that anything but good should come to him being so guarded he is going on finely lady scatcherd quite finely were the last words mr rerechild said as he left the room  and then dr thorne taking lady scatcherds hand and leading her out into another chamber told her the truth  lady scatcherd said he in his tenderest voiceand his voice could be very tender when occasion required itlady scatcherd do not hope you must not hope it would be cruel to bid you do so  oh doctor oh doctor  my dear friend there is no hope  oh dr thorne said the wife looking wildly up into her companions face though she hardly yet realised the meaning of what he said although her senses were half stunned by the blow  dear lady scatcherd is it not better that i should tell you the truth  oh i suppose so oh yes oh yes ah me ah me ah me and then she began rocking herself backwards and forwards on her chair with her apron up to her eyes what shall i do what shall i do  look to him lady scatcherd who only can make such grief endurable  yes yes yes i suppose so ah me ah me but dr thorne there must be some chanceisnt there any chance that man says hes going on so well  i fear there is no chanceas far as my knowledge goes there is no chance  then why does that chattering magpie tell such lies to a woman ah me ah me ah me oh doctor doctor what shall i do what shall i do and poor lady scatcherd fairly overcome by her sorrow burst out crying like a great schoolgirl  and yet what had her husband done for her that she should thus weep for him would not her life be much more blessed when this cause of all her troubles should be removed from her would she not then be a free woman instead of a slave might she not then expect to begin to taste the comforts of life what had that harsh tyrant of hers done that was good or serviceable for her why should she thus weep for him in paroxysms of truest grief  we hear a good deal of jolly widows and the slanderous raillery of the world tells much of conjugal disturbances as a cure for which women will look forward to a state of widowhood with not unwilling eyes the raillery of the world is very slanderous in our daily jests we attribute to each other vices of which neither we nor our neighbours nor our friends nor even our enemies are ever guilty it is our favourite parlance to talk of the family troubles of mrs green on our right and to tell how mrs young on our left is strongly suspected of having raised her hand to her lord and master what right have we to make these charges what have we seen in our own personal walks through life to make us believe that women are devils there may possibly have been a xantippe here and there but imogenes are to be found under every bush lady scatcherd in spite of the life she had led was one of them  you should send a message up to london for louis said the doctor  we did that doctor we did that todaywe sent up a telegraph oh me oh me poor boy what will he do i shall never know what to do with him never never and with such sorrowful wailings she sat rocking herself through the long night every now and then comforting herself by the performance of some menial service in the sick mans room  sir roger passed the night much as he had passed the day except that he appeared gradually to be growing nearer to a state of consciousness on the following morning they succeeded at last in making mr rerechild understand that they were not desirous of keeping him longer from his barchester practice and at about twelve oclock dr thorne also went promising that he would return in the evening and again pass the night at boxall hill  in the course of the afternoon sir roger once more awoke to his senses and when he did so his son was standing at his bedside louis philippe scatcherdor as it may be more convenient to call him louiswas a young man just of the age of frank gresham but there could hardly be two youths more different in their appearance louis though his father and mother were both robust persons was short and slight and now of a sickly frame frank was a picture of health and strength but though manly in disposition was by no means precocious either in appearance or manners louis scatcherd looked as though he was four years the others senior he had been sent to eton when he was fifteen his father being under the impression that this was the most ready and bestrecognised method of making him a gentleman here he did not altogether fail as regarded the coveted object of his becoming the companion of gentlemen he had more pocketmoney than any other lad in the school and was possessed also of a certain effrontery which carried him ahead among boys of his own age he gained therefore a degree of éclat even among those who knew and very frequently said to each other that young scatcherd was not fit to be their companion except on such open occasions as those of cricketmatches and boatraces boys in this respect are at least as exclusive as men and understand as well the difference between an inner and an outer circle scatcherd had many companions at school who were glad enough to go up to maidenhead with him in his boat but there was not one among them who would have talked to him of his sister  sir roger was vastly proud of his sons success and did his best to stimulate it by lavish expenditure at the christopher whenever he could manage to run down to eton but this practice though sufficiently unexceptionable to the boys was not held in equal delight by the masters to tell the truth neither sir roger nor his son were favourites with these stern custodians at last it was felt necessary to get rid of them both and louis was not long in giving them an opportunity by getting tipsy twice in one week on the second occasion he was sent away and he and sir roger though long talked of were seen no more at eton  but the universities were still open to louis philippe and before he was eighteen he was entered as a gentlemancommoner at trinity as he was moreover the eldest son of a baronet and had almost unlimited command of money here also he was enabled for a while to shine  to shine but very fitfully and one may say almost with a ghastly glare the very lads who had eaten his fathers dinners at eton and shared his fouroar at eton knew much better than to associate with him at cambridge now that they had put on the toga virilis they were still as prone as ever to fun frolic and devilryperhaps more so than ever seeing that more was in their power but they acquired an idea that it behoved them to be somewhat circumspect as to the men with whom their pranks were perpetrated so in those days louis scatcherd was coldly looked on by his whilom eton friends  but young scatcherd did not fail to find companions at cambridge also there are few places indeed in which a rich man cannot buy companionship but the set with whom he lived at cambridge were the worst of the place they were fast slang men who were fast and slang and nothing elsemen who imitated grooms in more than their dress and who looked on the customary heroes of racecourses as the highest lords of the ascendant upon earth among those at college young scatcherd did shine as long as such lustre was permitted him here indeed his father who had striven only to encourage him at eton did strive somewhat to control him but that was not now easy if he limited his sons allowance he only drove him to do his debauchery on credit there were plenty to lend money to the son of the great millionaire and so after eighteen months trial of a university education sir roger had no alternative but to withdraw his son from his alma mater  what was he then to do with him unluckily it was considered quite unnecessary to take any steps towards enabling him to earn his bread now nothing on earth can be more difficult than bringing up well a young man who has not to earn his own bread and who has no recognised station among other men similarly circumstanced juvenile dukes and sprouting earls find their duties and their places as easily as embryo clergymen and sucking barristers provision is made for their peculiar positions and though they may possibly go astray they have a fair chance given to them of running within the posts the same may be said of such youths as frank gresham there are enough of them in the community to have made it necessary that their wellbeing should be a matter of care and forethought but there are but few men turned out in the world in the position of louis scatcherd and of those few but very few enter the real battle of life under good auspices  poor sir roger though he had hardly time with all his multitudinous railways to look into this thoroughly had a glimmering of it when he saw his sons pale face and paid his wine bills and heard of his doings in horseflesh he did know that things were not going well he did understand that the heir to a baronetcy and a fortune of some ten thousand a year might be doing better but what was he to do he could not watch over his boy himself so he took a tutor for him and sent him abroad  louis and the tutor got as far as berlin with what mutual satisfaction to each other need not be specially described but from berlin sir roger received a letter in which the tutor declined to go any further in the task which he had undertaken he found that he had no influence over his pupil and he could not reconcile it to his conscience to be the spectator of such a life as that which mr scatcherd led he had no power in inducing mr scatcherd to leave berlin but he would remain there himself till he should hear from sir roger so sir roger had to leave the huge government works which he was then erecting on the southern coast and hurry off to berlin to see what could be done with young hopeful  the young hopeful was by no means a fool and in some matters was more than a match for his father sir roger in his anger threatened to cast him off without a shilling louis with mixed penitence and effrontery reminded him that he could not change the descent of the title promised amendment declared that he had done only as do other young men of fortune and hinted that the tutor was a straitlaced ass the father and the son returned together to boxall hill and three months afterwards mr scatcherd set up for himself in london  and now his life if not more virtuous was more crafty than it had been he had no tutor to watch his doings and complain of them and he had sufficient sense to keep himself from absolute pecuniary ruin he lived it is true where sharpers and blacklegs had too often opportunities of plucking him but young as he was he had been sufficiently long about the world to take care he was not openly robbed and as he was not openly robbed his father in a certain sense was proud of him  tidings however camecame at least in those last dayswhich cut sir roger to the quick tidings of vice in the son which the father could not but attribute to his own example twice the mother was called up to the sickbed of her only child while he lay raving in that horrid madness by which the outraged mind avenges itself on the body twice he was found raging in delirium tremens and twice the father was told that a continuance of such life must end in an early death  it may easily be conceived that sir roger was not a happy man lying there with that brandy bottle beneath his pillow reflecting in his moments of rest that that son of his had his brandy bottle beneath his pillow he could hardly have been happy but he was not a man to say much about his misery though he could restrain neither himself nor his heir he could endure in silence and in silence he did endure till opening his eyes to the consciousness of death he at last spoke a few words to the only friend he knew  louis scatcherd was not a fool nor was he naturally perhaps of a depraved disposition but he had to reap the fruits of the worst education which england was able to give him there were moments in his life when he felt that a better a higher nay a much happier career was open to him than that which he had prepared himself to lead now and then he would reflect what money and rank might have done for him he would look with wishful eyes to the proud doings of others of his age would dream of quiet joys of a sweet wife of a house to which might be asked friends who were neither jockeys nor drunkards he would dream of such things in his short intervals of constrained sobriety but the dream would only serve to make him moody  this was the best side of his character the worst probably was that which was brought into play by the fact that he was not a fool he would have a better chance of redemption in this worldperhaps also in anotherhad he been a fool as it was he was no fool he was not to be done not he he knew no one better the value of a shilling he knew also how to keep his shillings and how to spend them he consorted much with blacklegs and suchlike because blacklegs were to his taste but he boasted daily nay hourly to himself and frequently to those around him that the leeches who were stuck round him could draw but little blood from him he could spend his money freely but he would so spend it that he himself might reap the gratification of the expenditure he was acute crafty knowing and up to every damnable dodge practised by men of the class with whom he lived at oneandtwenty he was that most odious of all odious charactersa closefisted reprobate  he was a small man not illmade by nature but reduced to unnatural tenuity by dissipationa corporeal attribute of which he was apt to boast as it enabled him as he said to put himself up at 7 st 7 lb without any d nonsense of not eating and drinking the power however was one of which he did not often avail himself as his nerves were seldom in a fit state for riding his hair was dark red and he wore red moustaches and a great deal of red beard beneath his chin cut in a manner to make him look like an american his voice also had a yankee twang being a cross between that of an american trader and an english groom and his eyes were keen and fixed and cold and knowing  such was the son whom sir roger saw standing at his bedside when first he awoke to consciousness it must not be supposed that sir roger looked at him with our eyes to him he was an only child the heir of his wealth the future bearer of his title the most heartstirring remembrancer of those other days when he had been so much a poorer and so much a happier man let that boy be bad or good he was all sir roger had and the father was still able to hope when others thought that all ground for hope was gone  the mother also loved her son with a mothers natural love but louis had ever been ashamed of his mother and had as far as possible estranged himself from her her heart perhaps fixed itself with almost a warmer love on frank gresham her fosterson frank she saw but seldom but when she did see him he never refused her embrace there was too a joyous genial lustre about franks face which always endeared him to women and made his former nurse regard him as the pet creation of the age though she but seldom interfered with any monetary arrangement of her husbands yet once or twice she had ventured to hint that a legacy left to the young squire would make her a happy woman sir roger however on these occasions had not appeared very desirous of making his wife happy  ah louis is that you ejaculated sir roger in tones hardly more than halfformed afterwards in a day or two that is he fully recovered his voice but just then he could hardly open his jaws and spoke almost through his teeth he managed however to put out his hand and lay it on the counterpane so that his son could take it  why thats well governor said the son youll be as right as a trivet in a day or twoeh governor  the governor smiled with a ghastly smile he already pretty well knew that he would never again be right as his son called it on that side of the grave it did not moreover suit him to say much just at that moment so he contented himself with holding his sons hand he lay still in this position for a moment and then turning round painfully on his side endeavoured to put his hand to the place where his dire enemy usually was concealed sir roger however was too weak now to be his own master he was at length though too late a captive in the hands of nurses and doctors and the bottle had now been removed  then lady scatcherd came in and seeing that her husband was no longer unconscious she could not but believe that dr thorne had been wrong she could not but think that there must be some ground for hope she threw herself on her knees at the bedside bursting into tears as she did so and taking sir rogers hand in hers covered it with kisses  bother said sir roger  she did not however long occupy herself with the indulgence of her feelings but going speedily to work produced such sustenance as the doctors had ordered to be given when the patient might awake a breakfastcup was brought to him and a few drops were put into his mouth but he soon made it manifest that he would take nothing more of a description so perfectly innocent  a drop of brandyjust a little drop said he halfordering and halfentreating  ah roger said lady scatcherd  just a little drop louis said the sick man appealing to his son  a little will be good for him bring the bottle mother said the son  after some altercation the brandy bottle was brought and louis with what he thought a very sparing hand proceeded to pour about half a wineglassful into the cup as he did so sir roger weak as he was contrived to shake his sons arm so as greatly to increase the dose  ha ha ha laughed the sick man and then greedily swallowed the dose     chapter xxv  sir roger dies   that night the doctor stayed at boxall hill and the next night so that it became a customary thing for him to sleep there during the latter part of sir rogers illness he returned home daily to greshamsbury for he had his patients there to whom he was as necessary as to sir roger the foremost of whom was lady arabella he had therefore no slight work on his hands seeing that his nights were by no means wholly devoted to rest  mr rerechild had not been much wrong as to the remaining space of life which he had allotted to the dying man once or twice dr thorne had thought that the great original strength of his patient would have enabled him to fight against death for a somewhat longer period but sir roger would give himself no chance whenever he was strong enough to have a will of his own he insisted on having his very medicine mixed with brandy and in the hours of the doctors absence he was too often successful in his attempts  it does not much matter dr thorne had said to lady scatcherd do what you can to keep down the quantity but do not irritate him by refusing to obey it does not much signify now so lady scatcherd still administered the alcohol and he from day to day invented little schemes for increasing the amount over which he chuckled with ghastly laughter  two or three times during these days sir roger essayed to speak seriously to his son but louis always frustrated him he either got out of the room on some excuse or made his mother interfere on the score that so much talking would be bad for his father he already knew with tolerable accuracy what was the purport of his fathers will and by no means approved of it but as he could not now hope to induce his father to alter it so as to make it more favourable to himself he conceived that no conversation on matters of business could be of use to him  louis said sir roger one afternoon to his son louis i have not done by you as i ought to have donei know that now  nonsense governor never mind about that now i shall do well enough i dare say besides it isnt too late you can make it twentythree years instead of twentyfive if you like it  i do not mean as to money louis there are things besides money which a father ought to look to  now father dont fret yourselfim all right you may be sure of that  louis its that accursed brandyits that that im afraid of you see me here my boy how im lying here now  dont you be annoying yourself governor im all rightquite right and as for you why youll be up and about yourself in another month or so  i shall never be off this bed my boy till im carried into my coffin on those chairs there but im not thinking of myself louis but you think what you may have before you if you cant avoid that accursed bottle  im all right governor right as a trivet its very little i take except at an odd time or so  oh louis louis  come father cheer up this sort of thing isnt the thing for you at all i wonder where mother is she ought to be here with the broth just let me go and ill see for her  the father understood it all he saw that it was now much beyond his faded powers to touch the heart or conscience of such a youth as his son had become what now could he do for his boy except die what else what other benefit did his son require of him but to die to die so that his means of dissipation might be unbounded he let go the unresisting hand which he held and as the young man crept out of the room he turned his face to the wall he turned his face to the wall and held bitter commune with his own heart to what had he brought himself to what had he brought his son oh how happy would it have been for him could he have remained all his days a working stonemason in barchester how happy could he have died as such years ago such tears as those which wet that pillow are the bitterest which human eyes can shed  but while they were dropping the memoir of his life was in quick course of preparation it was indeed nearly completed with considerable detail he had lingered on four days longer than might have been expected and the author had thus had more than usual time for the work in these days a man is nobody unless his biography is kept so far posted up that it may be ready for the national breakfasttable on the morning after his demise when it chances that the dead hero is one who was taken in his prime of life of whose departure from among us the most farseeing biographical scribe can have no prophetic inkling this must be difficult of great men full of years who are ripe for the sickle who in the course of nature must soon fall it is of course comparatively easy for an active compiler to have his complete memoir ready in his desk but in order that the idea of omnipresent and omniscient information may be kept up the young must be chronicled as quickly as the old in some cases this task must one would say be difficult nevertheless it is done  the memoir of sir roger scatcherd was progressing favourably in this it was told how fortunate had been his life how in his case industry and genius combined had triumphed over the difficulties which humble birth and deficient education had thrown in his way how he had made a name among englands great men how the queen had delighted to honour him and nobles had been proud to have him for a guest at their mansions then followed a list of all the great works which he had achieved of the railroads canals docks harbours jails and hospitals which he had constructed his name was held up as an example to the labouring classes of his countrymen and he was pointed at as one who had lived and died happyever happy said the biographer because ever industrious and so a great moral question was inculcated a short paragraph was devoted to his appearance in parliament and unfortunate mr romer was again held up for disgrace for the thirtieth time as having been the means of depriving our legislative councils of the great assistance of sir rogers experience  sir roger said the biographer in his concluding passage was possessed of an iron frame but even iron will yield to the repeated blows of the hammer in the latter years of his life he was known to overtask himself and at length the body gave way though the mind remained firm to the last the subject of this memoir was only fiftynine when he was taken from us  and thus sir rogers life was written while the tears were yet falling on his pillow at boxall hill it was a pity that a proofsheet could not have been sent to him no man was vainer of his reputation and it would have greatly gratified him to know that posterity was about to speak of him in such termsto speak of him with a voice that would be audible for twentyfour hours  sir roger made no further attempt to give counsel to his son it was too evidently useless the old dying lion felt that the lions power had already passed from him and that he was helpless in the hands of the young cub who was so soon to inherit the wealth of the forest but dr thorne was more kind to him he had something yet to say as to his worldly hopes and worldly cares and his old friend did not turn a deaf ear to him  it was during the night that sir roger was most anxious to talk and most capable of talking he would lie through the day in a state halfcomatose but towards evening he would rouse himself and by midnight he would be full of fitful energy one night as he lay wakeful and full of thought he thus poured forth his whole heart to dr thorne  thorne said he i told you about my will you know  yes said the other and i have blamed myself greatly that i have not again urged you to alter it your illness came too suddenly scatcherd and then i was averse to speak of it  why should i alter it it is a good will as good as i can make not but that i have altered it since i spoke to you i did it that day after you left me  have you definitely named your heir in default of louis  nothat isyesi had done that before i have said marys eldest child i have not altered that  but scatcherd you must alter it  must well then i wont but ill tell you what i have done i have added a postscripta codicil they call itsaying that you and you only know who is her eldest child winterbones and jack martin have witnessed that  dr thorne was going to explain how very injudicious such an arrangement appeared to be but sir roger would not listen to him it was not about that that he wished to speak to him to him it was matter of but minor interest who might inherit his money if his son should die early his care was solely for his sons welfare at twentyfive the heir might make his own willmight bequeath all this wealth according to his own fancy sir roger would not bring himself to believe that his son could follow him to the grave in so short a time  never mind that doctor now but about louis you will be his guardian you know  not his guardian he is more than of age  ah but doctor you will be his guardian the property will not be his till he be twentyfive you will not desert him  i will not desert him but i doubt whether i can do much for himwhat can i do scatcherd  use the power that a strong man has over a weak one use the power that my will will give you do for him as you would for a son of your own if you saw him going in bad courses do as a friend should do for a friend that is dead and gone i would do so for you doctor if our places were changed  what i can do that i will do said thorne solemnly taking as he spoke the contractors hand in his own with a tight grasp  i know you will i know you will oh doctor may you never feel as i do now may you on your deathbed have no dread as i have as to the fate of those you will leave behind you  doctor thorne felt that he could not say much in answer to this the future fate of louis scatcherd was he could not but own to himself greatly to be dreaded what good what happiness could be presaged for such a one as he was what comfort could he offer to the father and then he was called on to compare as it were the prospects of this unfortunate with those of his own darling to contrast all that was murky foul and disheartening with all that was perfectfor to him she was all but perfect to liken louis scatcherd to the angel who brightened his own hearthstone how could he answer to such an appeal  he said nothing but merely tightened his grasp of the others hand to signify that he would do as best he could all that was asked of him sir roger looked up sadly into the doctors face as though expecting some word of consolation there was no comfort no consolation to come to him  for three or four years he must greatly depend upon you continued sir roger  i will do what i can said the doctor what i can do i will do but he is not a child scatcherd at his age he must stand or fall mainly by his own conduct the best thing for him will be to marry  exactly thats just it thorne i was coming to that if he would marry i think he would do well yet for all that has come and gone if he married of course you would let him have the command of his own income  i will be governed entirely by your wishes under any circumstances his income will as i understand be quite sufficient for him married or single  ahbut thorne i should like to think he should shine with the best of them for what have i made the money if not for that now if he marriesdecently that issome woman you know that can assist him in the world let him have what he wants it is not to save the money that i put it into your hands  no scatcherd not to save the money but to save him i think that while you are yet with him you should advise him to marry  he does not care a straw for what i advise not one straw why should he how can i tell him to be sober when i have been a beast all my life myself how can i advise him thats where it is it is that that now kills me advise why when i speak to him he treats me like a child  he fears that you are too weak you know he thinks that you should not be allowed to talk  nonsense he knows better you know better too weak what signifies would i not give all that i have of strength at one blow if i could open his eyes to see as i see but for one minute and the sick man raised himself up in his bed as though he were actually going to expend all that remained to him of vigour in the energy of a moment  gently scatcherd gently he will listen to you yet but do not be so unruly  thorne you see that bottle there give me half a glass of brandy  the doctor turned round in his chair but he hesitated in doing as he was desired  do as i ask you doctor it can do no harm now you know that well enough why torture me now  no i will not torture you but you will have water with it  water no the brandy by itself i tell you i cannot speak without it whats the use of canting now you know it can make no difference  sir roger was right it could make no difference and dr thorne gave him the half glass of brandy  ah well youve a stingy hand doctor confounded stingy you dont measure your medicines out in such light doses  you will be wanting more before morning you know  before morning indeed i shall a pint or so before that i remember the time doctor when i have drunk to my own cheek above two quarts between dinner and breakfast aye and worked all the day after it  you have been a wonderful man scatcherd very wonderful  aye wonderful well never mind its over now but what was i sayingabout louis doctor youll not desert him  certainly not  hes not strong i know that how should he be strong living as he has done not that it seemed to hurt me when i was his age  you had the advantage of hard work  thats it sometimes i wish that louis had not a shilling in the world that he had to trudge about with an apron round his waist as i did but its too late now to think of that if he would only marry doctor  dr thorne again expressed an opinion that no step would be so likely to reform the habits of the young heir as marriage and repeated his advice to the father to implore his son to take a wife  ill tell you what thorne said he and then after a pause he went on i have not half told you as yet what is on my mind and im nearly afraid to tell it though indeed i dont know why i should be  i never knew you afraid of anything yet said the doctor smiling gently  well then ill not end by turning coward now doctor tell the truth to me what do you expect me to do for that girl of yours that we were talking ofmarys child  there was a pause for a moment for thorne was slow to answer him  you would not let me see her you know though she is my niece as truly as she is yours  nothing at last said the doctor slowly i expect nothing i would not let you see her and therefore i expect nothing  she will have it all if poor louis should die said sir roger  if you intend it so you should put her name into the will said the other not that i ask you or wish you to do so mary thank god can do without wealth  thorne on one condition i will put her name into it i will alter it all on one condition let the two cousins be man and wifelet louis marry poor marys child  the proposition for a moment took away the doctors breath and he was unable to answer not for all the wealth of india would he have given up his lamb to that young wolf even though he had had the power to do so but that lamblamb though she washad as he well knew a will of her own on such a matter what alliance could be more impossible thought he to himself than one between mary thorne and louis scatcherd  i will alter it all if you will give me your hand upon it that you will do your best to bring about this marriage everything shall be his on the day he marries her and should he die unmarried it shall all then be hers by name say the word thorne and she shall come here at once i shall yet have time to see her  but dr thorne did not say the word just at the moment he said nothing but he slowly shook his head  why not thorne  my friend it is impossible  why impossible  her hand is not mine to dispose of nor is her heart  then let her come over herself  what scatcherd that the son might make love to her while the father is so dangerously ill bid her come to look for a rich husband that would not be seemly would it  no not for that let her come merely that i may see her that we may all know her i will leave the matter then in your hands if you will promise me to do your best  but my friend in this matter i cannot do my best i can do nothing and indeed i may say at once that it is altogether out of the question i know  what do you know said the baronet turning on him almost angrily what can you know to make you say that it is impossible is she a pearl of such price that a man may not win her  she is a pearl of great price  believe me doctor money goes far in winning such pearls  perhaps so i know little about it but this i do know that money will not win her let us talk of something else believe me it is useless for us to think of this  yes if you set your face against it obstinately you must think very poorly of louis if you suppose that no girl can fancy him  i have not said so scatcherd  to have the spending of ten thousand a year and be a baronets lady why doctor what is it you expect for this girl  not much indeed not much a quiet heart and a quiet home not much more  thorne if you will be ruled by me in this she shall be the most topping woman in this county  my friend my friend why thus grieve me why should you thus harass yourself i tell you it is impossible they have never seen each other they have nothing and can have nothing in common their tastes and wishes and pursuits are different besides scatcherd marriages never answer that are so made believe me it is impossible  the contractor threw himself back on his bed and lay for some ten minutes perfectly quiet so much so that the doctor began to think that he was sleeping so thinking and wearied by the watching dr thorne was beginning to creep quietly from the room when his companion again roused himself almost with vehemence  you wont do this thing for me then said he  do it it is not for you or me to do such things as that such things must be left to those concerned themselves  you will not even help me  not in this thing sir roger  then by  she shall not under any circumstances ever have a shilling of mine give me some of that stuff there and he again pointed to the brandy bottle which stood ever within his sight  the doctor poured out and handed to him another small modicum of spirit  nonsense man fill the glass ill stand no nonsense now ill be master in my own house to the last give it here i tell you ten thousand devils are tearing me within youyou could have comforted me but you would not fill the glass i tell you  i should be killing you were i to do it  killing me killing me you are always talking of killing me do you suppose that i am afraid to die do not i know how soon it is coming give me the brandy i say or i will be out across the room to fetch it  no scatcherd i cannot give it to you not while i am here do you remember how you were engaged this morninghe had that morning taken the sacrament from the parish clergymanyou would not wish to make me guilty of murder would you  nonsense you are talking nonsense habit is second nature i tell you i shall sink without it why you know i always get it directly your back is turned come i will not be bullied in my own house give me that bottle i sayand sir roger essayed vainly enough to raise himself from the bed  stop scatcherd i will give it youi will help you it may be that habit is second nature sir roger in his determined energy had swallowed without thinking of it the small quantity which the doctor had before poured out for him and still held the empty glass within his hand this the doctor now took and filled nearly to the brim  come thorne a bumper a bumper for this once whatever the drink it a bumper must be you stingy fellow i would not treat you so wellwell  its as full as you can hold it scatcherd  try me try me my hand is a rock at least at holding liquor and then he drained the contents of the glass which were sufficient in quantity to have taken away the breath from any ordinary man  ah im better now but thorne i do love a full glass ha ha ha  there was something frightful almost sickening in the peculiar hoarse guttural tone of his voice the sounds came from him as though steeped in brandy and told all too plainly the havoc which the alcohol had made there was a fire too about his eyes which contrasted with his sunken cheeks his hanging jaw unshorn beard and haggard face were terrible to look at his hands and arms were hot and clammy but so thin and wasted of his lower limbs the lost use had not returned to him so that in all his efforts at vehemence he was controlled by his own want of vitality when he supported himself halfsitting against the pillows he was in a continual tremor and yet as he boasted he could still lift his glass steadily to his mouth such now was the hero of whom that ready compiler of memoirs had just finished his correct and succinct account  after he had had his brandy he sat glaring a while at vacancy as though he was dead to all around him and was thinkingthinking thinking of things in the infinite distance of the past  shall i go now said the doctor and send lady scatcherd to you  wait a while doctor just one minute longer so you will do nothing for louis then  i will do everything for him that i can do  ah yes everything but the one thing that will save him well i will not ask you again but remember thorne i shall alter my will tomorrow  do so by all means you may well alter it for the better if i may advise you you will have down your own business attorney from london if you will let me send he will be here before tomorrow night  thank you for nothing thorne i can manage that matter myself now leave me but remember you have ruined that girls fortune  the doctor did leave him and went not altogether happy to his room he could not but confess to himself that he had despite himself as it were fed himself with hope that marys future might be made more secure aye and brighter too by some small unheeded fraction broken off from the huge mass of her uncles wealth such hope if it had amounted to hope was now all gone but this was not all nor was this the worst of it that he had done right in utterly repudiating all idea of a marriage between mary and her cousinof that he was certain enough that no earthly consideration would have induced mary to plight her troth to such a manthat with him was as certain as doom but how far had he done right in keeping her from the sight of her uncle how could he justify it to himself if he had thus robbed her of her inheritance seeing that he had done so from a selfish fear lest she who was now all his own should be known to the world as belonging to others rather than to him he had taken upon him on her behalf to reject wealth as valueless and yet he had no sooner done so than he began to consume his hours with reflecting how great to her would be the value of wealth and thus when sir roger told him as he left the room that he had ruined marys fortune he was hardly able to bear the taunt with equanimity  on the next morning after paying his professional visit to his patient and satisfying himself that the end was now drawing near with steps terribly quickened he went down to greshamsbury  how long is this to last uncle said his niece with sad voice as he again prepared to return to boxall hill  not long mary do not begrudge him a few more hours of life  no i do not uncle i will say nothing more about it is his son with him and then perversely enough she persisted in asking numerous questions about louis scatcherd  is he likely to marry uncle  i hope so my dear  will he be so very rich  yes ultimately he will be very rich  he will be a baronet will he not  yes my dear  what is he like uncle  likei never know what a young man is like he is like a man with red hair  uncle you are the worst hand in describing i ever knew if id seen him for five minutes id be bound to make a portrait of him and you if you were describing a dog youd only say what colour his hair was  well hes a little man  exactly just as i should say that mrs umbleby had a redhaired little dog i wish i had known these scatcherds uncle i do so admire people that can push themselves in the world i wish i had known sir roger  you will never know him now mary  i suppose not i am so sorry for him is lady scatcherd nice  she is an excellent woman  i hope i may know her some day you are so much there now uncle i wonder whether you ever mention me to them if you do tell her from me how much i grieve for her  that same night dr thorne again found himself alone with sir roger the sick man was much more tranquil and apparently more at ease than he had been on the preceding night he said nothing about his will and not a word about mary thorne but the doctor knew that winterbones and a notarys clerk from barchester had been in the bedroom a great part of the day and as he knew also that the great man of business was accustomed to do his most important work by the hands of such tools as these he did not doubt but that the will had been altered and remodelled indeed he thought it more than probable that when it was opened it would be found to be wholly different in its provisions from that which sir roger had already described  louis is clever enough he said sharp enough i mean he wont squander the property  he has good natural abilities said the doctor  excellent excellent said the father he may do well very well if he can only be kept from this and sir roger held up the empty wineglass which stood by his bedside what a life he may have before himand to throw it away for this and as he spoke he took the glass and tossed it across the room oh doctor would that it were all to begin again  we all wish that i dare say scatcherd  no you dont wish it you aint worth a shilling and yet you regret nothing i am worth half a million in one way or the other and i regret everythingeverythingeverything  you should not think in that way scatcherd you need not think so yesterday you told mr clarke that you were comfortable in your mind mr clarke was the clergyman who had visited him  of course i did what else could i say when he asked me it wouldnt have been civil to have told him that his time and words were all thrown away but thorne believe me when a mans heart is sadsadsad to the core a few words from a parson at the last moment will never make it all right  may he have mercy on you my friendif you will think of him and look to him he will have mercy on you  welli will try doctor but would that it were all to do again youll see to the old woman for my sake wont you  what lady scatcherd  lady devil if anything angers me now it is that ladyshipher to be my lady why when i came out of jail that time the poor creature had hardly a shoe to her foot but it wasnt her fault thorne it was none of her doing she never asked for such nonsense  she has been an excellent wife scatcherd and what is more she is an excellent woman she is and ever will be one of my dearest friends  thankee doctor thankee yes she has been a good wifebetter for a poor man than a rich one but then that was what she was born to you wont let her be knocked about by them will you thorne  dr thorne again assured him that as long as he lived lady scatcherd should never want one true friend in making this promise however he managed to drop all allusion to the obnoxious title  youll be with him as much as possible wont you again asked the baronet after lying quite silent for a quarter of an hour  with whom said the doctor who was then all but asleep  with my poor boy with louis  if he will let me i will said the doctor  and doctor when you see a glass at his mouth dash it down thrust it down though you thrust out the teeth with it when you see that thorne tell him of his fathertell him what his father might have been but for that tell him how his father died like a beast because he could not keep himself from drink  these reader were the last words spoken by sir roger scatcherd as he uttered them he rose up in bed with the same vehemence which he had shown on the former evening but in the very act of doing so he was again struck by paralysis and before nine on the following morning all was over  oh my manmy own own man exclaimed the widow remembering in the paroxysm of her grief nothing but the loves of their early days the best the brightest the cleverest of them all  some weeks after this sir roger was buried with much pomp and ceremony within the precincts of barchester cathedral and a monument was put up to him soon after in which he was portrayed as smoothing a block of granite with a mallet and chisel while his eagle eye disdaining such humble work was fixed upon some intricate mathematical instrument above him could sir roger have seen it himself he would probably have declared that no workman was ever worth his salt who looked one way while he rowed another  immediately after the funeral the will was opened and dr thorne discovered that the clauses of it were exactly identical with those which his friend had described to him some months back nothing had been altered nor had the document been unfolded since that strange codicil was added in which it was declared that dr thorne knewand only dr thornewho was the eldest child of the testators only sister at the same time however a joint executor with dr thorne had been namedone mr stock a man of railway fameand dr thorne himself was made a legatee to the humble extent of a thousand pounds a life income of a thousand pounds a year was left to lady scatcherd     chapter xxvi  war   we need not follow sir roger to his grave nor partake of the baked meats which were furnished for his funeral banquet such men as sir roger scatcherd are always well buried and we have already seen that his glories were duly told to posterity in the graphic diction of his sepulchral monument in a few days the doctor had returned to his quiet home and sir louis found himself reigning at boxall hill in his fathers steadwith however a much diminished sway and as he thought it but a poor exchequer we must soon return to him and say something of his career as a baronet but for the present we may go back to our more pleasant friends at greshamsbury  but our friends at greshamsbury had not been making themselves pleasantnot so pleasant to each other as circumstances would have admitted in those days which the doctor had felt himself bound to pass if not altogether at boxall hill yet altogether away from his own home so as to admit of his being as much as possible with his patient mary had been thrown more than ever with patience oriel and also almost more than ever with beatrice gresham as regarded mary she would doubtless have preferred the companionship of patience though she loved beatrice far the best but she had no choice when she went to the parsonage beatrice came there also and when patience came to the doctors house beatrice either accompanied or followed her mary could hardly have rejected their society even had she felt it wise to do so she would in such case have been all alone and her severance from the greshamsbury house and household from the big family in which she had for so many years been almost at home would have made such solitude almost unendurable  and then these two girls both knewnot her secret she had no secretbut the little history of her illtreatment they knew that though she had been blameless in this matter yet she had been the one to bear the punishment and as girls and bosom friends they could not but sympathise with her and endow her with heroic attributes make her in fact as we are doing their little heroine for the nonce this was perhaps not serviceable for mary but it was far from being disagreeable  the tendency to finding matter for heroworship in marys endurance was much stronger with beatrice than with miss oriel miss oriel was the elder and naturally less afflicted with the sentimentation of romance she had thrown herself into marys arms because she had seen that it was essentially necessary for marys comfort that she should do so she was anxious to make her friend smile and to smile with her beatrice was quite as true in her sympathy but she rather wished that she and mary might weep in unison shed mutual tears and break their hearts together  patience had spoken of franks love as a misfortune of his conduct as erroneous and to be excused only by his youth and had never appeared to surmise that mary also might be in love as well as he but to beatrice the affair was a tragic difficulty admitting of no solution a gordian knot not to be cut a misery now and for ever she would always talk about frank when she and mary were alone and to speak the truth mary did not stop her as she perhaps should have done as for a marriage between them that was impossible beatrice was well sure of that it was franks unfortunate destiny that he must marry moneymoney and as beatrice sometimes thoughtlessly added cutting mary to the quickmoney and family also under such circumstances a marriage between them was quite impossible but not the less did beatrice declare that she would have loved mary as her sisterinlaw had it been possible and how worthy frank was of a girls love had such love been permissible  it is so cruel beatrice would say so very very cruel you would have suited him in every way  nonsense trichy i should have suited him in no possible way at all nor he me  oh but you wouldexactly papa loves you so well  and mamma that would have been so nice  yes and mamma toothat is had you had a fortune said the daughter naïvely she always liked you personally always  did she  always and we all love you so  especially lady alexandrina  that would not have signified for frank cannot endure the de courcys himself  my dear it does not matter one straw whom your brother can endure or not endure just at present his character is to be formed and his tastes and his heart also  oh maryhis heart  yes his heart not the fact of his having a heart i think he has a heart but he himself does not yet understand it  oh mary you do not know him  such conversations were not without danger to poor marys comfort it came soon to be the case that she looked rather for this sort of sympathy from beatrice than for miss oriels pleasant but less piquant gaiety  so the days of the doctors absence were passed and so also the first week after his return during this week it was almost daily necessary that the squire should be with him the doctor was now the legal holder of sir rogers property and as such the holder also of all the mortgages on mr greshams property and it was natural that they should be much together the doctor would not however go up to greshamsbury on any other than medical business and it therefore became necessary that the squire should be a good deal at the doctors house  then the lady arabella became unhappy in her mind frank it was true was away at cambridge and had been successfully kept out of marys way since the suspicion of danger had fallen upon lady arabellas mind frank was away and mary was systematically banished with due acknowledgement from all the powers in greshamsbury but this was not enough for lady arabella as long as her daughter still habitually consorted with the female culprit and as long as her husband consorted with the male culprit it seemed to lady arabella at this moment as though in banishing mary from the house she had in effect banished herself from the most intimate of the greshamsbury social circles she magnified in her own mind the importance of the conferences between the girls and was not without some fear that the doctor might be talking the squire over into very dangerous compliance  she resolved therefore on another duel with the doctor in the first she had been preeminently and unexpectedly successful no young sucking dove could have been more mild than that terrible enemy whom she had for years regarded as being too puissant for attack in ten minutes she had vanquished him and succeeded in banishing both him and his niece from the house without losing the value of his services as is always the case with us she had begun to despise the enemy she had conquered and to think that the foe once beaten could never rally  her object was to break off all confidential intercourse between beatrice and mary and to interrupt as far as she could do it that between the doctor and the squire this it may be said could be more easily done by skilful management within her own household she had however tried that and failed she had said much to beatrice as to the imprudence of her friendship with mary and she had done this purposely before the squire injudiciously howeverfor the squire had immediately taken marys part and had declared that he had no wish to see a quarrel between his family and that of the doctor that mary thorne was in every way a good girl and an eligible friend for his own child and had ended by declaring that he would not have mary persecuted for franks fault this had not been the end nor nearly the end of what had been said on the matter at greshamsbury but the end when it came came in this wise that lady arabella determined to say a few words to the doctor as to the expediency of forbidding familiar intercourse between mary and any of the greshamsbury people  with this view lady arabella absolutely bearded the lion in his den the doctor in his shop she had heard that both mary and beatrice were to pass a certain afternoon at the parsonage and took that opportunity of calling at the doctors house a period of many years had passed since she had last so honoured that abode mary indeed had been so much one of her own family that the ceremony of calling on her had never been thought necessary and thus unless mary had been absolutely ill there would have been nothing to bring her ladyship to the house all this she knew would add to the importance of the occasion and she judged it prudent to make the occasion as important as it might well be  she was so far successful that she soon found herself têteàtête with the doctor in his own study she was no whit dismayed by the pair of human thighbones which lay close to his hand and which when he was talking in that den of his own he was in the constant habit of handling with much energy nor was she frightened out of her propriety even by the little childs skull which grinned at her from off the chimneypiece  doctor she said as soon as the first complimentary greetings were over speaking in her kindest and most wouldbeconfidential tone doctor i am still uneasy about that boy of mine and i have thought it best to come and see you at once and tell you freely what i think  the doctor bowed and said that he was very sorry that she should have any cause for uneasiness about his young friend frank  indeed i am very uneasy doctor and having as i do have such reliance on your prudence and such perfect confidence in your friendship i have thought it best to come and speak to you openly thereupon the lady arabella paused and the doctor bowed again  nobody knows so well as you do the dreadful state of the squires affairs  not so very dreadful not so very dreadful said the doctor mildly that is as far as i know  yes they are doctor very dreadful very dreadful indeed you know how much he owes to this young man i do not for the squire never tells anything to me but i know that it is a very large sum of money enough to swamp the estate and ruin frank now i call that very dreadful  no no not ruin him lady arabella not ruin him i hope  however i did not come to talk to you about that as i said before i know nothing of the squires affairs and as a matter of course i do not ask you to tell me but i am sure you will agree with me in this that as a mother i cannot but be interested about my only son and lady arabella put her cambric handkerchief to her eyes  of course you are of course you are said the doctor and lady arabella my opinion of frank is such that i feel sure that he will do well and in his energy dr thorne brandished one of the thighbones almost in the ladys face  i hope he will i am sure i hope he will but doctor he has such dangers to contend with he is so warm and impulsive that i fear his heart will bring him into trouble now you know unless frank marries money he is lost  the doctor made no answer to this last appeal but as he sat and listened a slight frown came across his brow  he must marry money doctor now we have you see with your assistance contrived to separate him from dear mary  with my assistance lady arabella i have given no assistance nor have i meddled in the matter nor will i  well doctor perhaps not meddled but you agreed with me you know that the two young people had been imprudent  i agreed to no such thing lady arabella never never i not only never agreed that mary had been imprudent but i will not agree to it now and will not allow any one to assert it in my presence without contradicting it and then the doctor worked away at the thighbones in a manner that did rather alarm her ladyship  at any rate you thought that the young people had better be kept apart  no neither did i think that my niece i felt sure was safe from danger i knew that she would do nothing that would bring either her or me to shame  not to shame said the lady apologetically as it were using the word perhaps not exactly in the doctors sense  i felt no alarm for her continued the doctor and desired no change frank is your son and it is for you to look to him you thought proper to do so by desiring mary to absent herself from greshamsbury  oh no no no said lady arabella  but you did lady arabella and as greshamsbury is your home neither i nor my niece had any ground of complaint we acquiesced not without much suffering but we did acquiesce and you i think can have no ground of complaint against us  lady arabella had hardly expected that the doctor would reply to her mild and conciliatory exordium with so much sternness he had yielded so easily to her on the former occasion she did not comprehend that when she uttered her sentence of exile against mary she had given an order which she had the power of enforcing but that obedience to that order had now placed mary altogether beyond her jurisdiction she was therefore a little surprised and for a few moments overawed by the doctors manner but she soon recovered herself remembering doubtless that fortune favours none but the brave  i make no complaint dr thorne she said after assuming a tone more befitting a de courcy than that hitherto used i make no complaint either as regards you or mary  you are very kind lady arabella  but i think that it is my duty to put a stop a peremptory stop to anything like a love affair between my son and your niece  i have not the least objection in life if there is such a love affair put a stop to itthat is if you have the power  here the doctor was doubtless imprudent but he had begun to think that he had yielded sufficiently to the lady and he had begun to resolve also that though it would not become him to encourage even the idea of such a marriage he would make lady arabella understand that he thought his niece quite good enough for her son and that the match if regarded as imprudent was to be regarded as equally imprudent on both sides he would not suffer that mary and her heart and feelings and interest should be altogether postponed to those of the young heir and perhaps he was unconsciously encouraged in this determination by the reflection that mary herself might perhaps become a young heiress  it is my duty said lady arabella repeating her words with even a stronger de courcy intonation and your duty also dr thorne  my duty said he rising from his chair and leaning on the table with the two thighbones lady arabella pray understand at once that i repudiate any such duty and will have nothing whatever to do with it  but you do not mean to say that you will encourage this unfortunate boy to marry your niece  the unfortunate boy lady arabellawhom by the by i regard as a very fortunate young manis your son not mine i shall take no steps about his marriage either one way or the other  you think it right then that your niece should throw herself in his way  throw herself in his way what would you say if i came up to greshamsbury and spoke to you of your daughters in such language what would my dear friend mr gresham say if some neighbours wife should come and so speak to him i will tell you what he would say he would quietly beg her to go back to her own home and meddle only with her own matters  this was dreadful to lady arabella even dr thorne had never before dared thus to lower her to the level of common humanity and liken her to any other wife in the countryside moreover she was not quite sure whether he the parish doctor was not desiring her the earls daughter to go home and mind her own business on this first point however there seemed to be no room for doubt of which she gave herself the benefit  it would not become me to argue with you dr thorne she said  not at least on this subject said he  i can only repeat that i mean nothing offensive to our dear mary for whom i think i may say i have always shown almost a mothers care  neither am i nor is mary ungrateful for the kindness she has received at greshamsbury  but i must do my duty my own children must be my first consideration  of course they must lady arabella thats of course  and therefore i have called on you to say that i think it is imprudent that beatrice and mary should be so much together  the doctor had been standing during the latter part of this conversation but now he began to walk about still holding the two bones like a pair of dumbbells  god bless my soul he said god bless my soul why lady arabella do you suspect your own daughter as well as your own son do you think that beatrice is assisting mary in preparing this wicked clandestine marriage i tell you fairly lady arabella the present tone of your mind is such that i cannot understand it  i suspect nobody dr thorne but young people will be young  and old people must be old i suppose the mores the pity lady arabella mary is the same to me as my own daughter and owes me the obedience of a child but as i do not disapprove of your daughter beatrice as an acquaintance for her but rather on the other hand regard with pleasure their friendship you cannot expect that i should take any steps to put an end to it  but suppose it should lead to renewed intercourse between frank and mary  i have no objection frank is a very nice young fellow gentlemanlike in his manners and neighbourly in his disposition  dr thorne  lady arabella  i cannot believe that you really intend to express a wish  you are quite right i have not intended to express any wish nor do i intend to do so mary is at liberty within certain boundswhich i am sure she will not passto choose her own friends i think she has not chosen badly as regards miss beatrice gresham and should she even add frank gresham to the number  friends why they were more than friends they were declared lovers  i doubt that lady arabella because i have not heard of it from mary but even if it were so i do not see why i should object  not object  as i said before frank is to my thinking an excellent young man why should i object  dr thorne said her ladyship now also rising from her chair in a state of too evident perturbation  why should i object it is for you lady arabella to look after your lambs for me to see that if possible no harm shall come to mine if you think that mary is an improper acquaintance for your children it is for you to guide them for you and their father say what you think fit to your own daughter but pray understand once for all that i will allow no one to interfere with my niece  interfere said lady arabella now absolutely confused by the severity of the doctors manner  i will allow no one to interfere with her no one lady arabella she has suffered very greatly from imputations which you have most unjustly thrown on her it was however your undoubted right to turn her out of your house if you thought fitthough as a woman who had known her for so many years you might i think have treated her with more forbearance that however was your right and you exercised it there your privilege stops yes and must stop lady arabella you shall not persecute her here on the only spot of ground she can call her own  persecute her dr thorne you do not mean to say that i have persecuted her  ah but i do mean to say so you do persecute her and would continue to do so did i not defend her it is not sufficient that she is forbidden to enter your domainand so forbidden with the knowledge of all the country roundbut you must come here also with the hope of interrupting all the innocent pleasures of her life fearing lest she should be allowed even to speak to your son to hear a word of him through his own sister you would put her in prison tie her up keep her from the light of day  dr thorne how can you  but the doctor was not to be interrupted  it never occurs to you to tie him up to put him in prison no he is the heir of greshamsbury he is your son an earls grandson it is only natural after all that he should throw a few foolish words at the doctors niece but she it is an offence not to be forgiven on her part that she should however unwillingly have been forced to listen to them now understand me lady arabella if any of your family come to my house i shall be delighted to welcome them if mary should meet any of them elsewhere i shall be delighted to hear of it should she tell me tomorrow that she was engaged to marry frank i should talk the matter over with her quite coolly solely with a view to her interest as would be my duty feeling at the same time that frank would be lucky in having such a wife now you know my mind lady arabella it is so i should do my dutyyou can do yours as you may think fit  lady arabella had by this time perceived that she was not destined on this occasion to gain any great victory she however was angry as well as the doctor it was not the mans vehemence that provoked her so much as his evident determination to break down the prestige of her rank and place her on a footing in no respect superior to his own he had never before been so audaciously arrogant and as she moved towards the door she determined in her wrath that she would never again have confidential intercourse with him in any relation of life whatsoever  dr thorne said she i think you have forgotten yourself you must excuse me if i say that after what has passed iii  certainly said he fully understanding what she meant and bowing low as he opened first the studydoor then the frontdoor then the gardengate  and then lady arabella stalked off not without full observation from mrs yates umbleby and her friend miss gushing who lived close by     chapter xxvii  miss thorne goes on a visit   and now began the unpleasant things at greshamsbury of which we have here told when lady arabella walked away from the doctors house she resolved that let it cost what it might there should be war to the knife between her and him she had been insulted by himso at least she said to herself and so she was prepared to say to others alsoand it was not to be borne that a de courcy should allow her parish doctor to insult her with impunity she would tell her husband with all the dignity that she could assume that it had now become absolutely necessary that he should protect his wife by breaking entirely with his unmannered neighbour and as regarded the young members of her family she would use the authority of a mother and absolutely forbid them to hold any intercourse with mary thorne so resolving she walked quickly back to her own house  the doctor when left alone was not quite satisfied with the part he had taken in the interview he had spoken from impulse rather than from judgement and as is generally the case with men who do so speak he had afterwards to acknowledge to himself that he had been imprudent he accused himself probably of more violence than he had really used and was therefore unhappy but nevertheless his indignation was not at rest he was angry with himself but not on that account the less angry with lady arabella she was cruel overbearing and unreasonable cruel in the most cruel of manners so he thought but not on that account was he justified in forgetting the forbearance due from a gentleman to a lady mary moreover had owed much to the kindness of this woman and therefore dr thorne felt that he should have forgiven much  thus the doctor walked about his room much disturbed now accusing himself for having been so angry with lady arabella and then feeding his own anger by thinking of her misconduct  the only immediate conclusion at which he resolved was this that it was unnecessary that he should say anything to mary on the subject of her ladyships visit there was no doubt sorrow enough in store for his darling why should he aggravate it lady arabella would doubtless not stop now in her course but why should he accelerate the evil which she would doubtless be able to effect  lady arabella when she returned to the house allowed no grass to grow under her feet as she entered the house she desired that miss beatrice should be sent to her directly she returned and she desired also that as soon as the squire should be in his room a message to that effect might be immediately brought to her  beatrice she said as soon as the young lady appeared before her and in speaking she assumed her firmest tone of authority beatrice i am sorry my dear to say anything that is unpleasant to you but i must make it a positive request that you will for the future drop all intercourse with dr thornes family  beatrice who had received lady arabellas message immediately on entering the house and had run upstairs imagining that some instant haste was required now stood before her mother rather out of breath holding her bonnet by the strings  oh mamma she exclaimed what on earth has happened  my dear said the mother i cannot really explain to you what has happened but i must ask you to give me your positive assurance that you will comply with my request  you dont mean that i am not to see mary any more  yes i do my dear at any rate for the present when i tell you that your brothers interest imperatively demands it i am sure that you will not refuse me  beatrice did not refuse but she did not appear too willing to comply she stood silent leaning against the end of a sofa and twisting her bonnetstrings in her hand  well beatrice  but mamma i dont understand  lady arabella had said that she could not exactly explain but she found it necessary to attempt to do so  dr thorne has openly declared to me that a marriage between poor frank and mary is all he could desire for his niece after such unparalleled audacity as that even your father will see the necessity of breaking with him  dr thorne oh mamma you must have misunderstood him  my dear i am not apt to misunderstand people especially when i am so much in earnest as i was in talking to dr thorne  but mamma i know so well what mary herself thinks about it  and i know what dr thorne thinks about it he at any rate has been candid in what he said there can be no doubt on earth that he has spoken his true thoughts there can be no reason to doubt him of course such a match would be all that he could wish  mamma i feel sure that there is some mistake  very well my dear i know that you are infatuated about these people and that you are always inclined to contradict what i say to you but remember i expect that you will obey me when i tell you not to go to dr thornes house any more  but mamma  i expect you to obey me beatrice though you are so prone to contradict you have never disobeyed me and i fully trust that you will not do so now  lady arabella had begun by exacting or trying to exact a promise but as she found that this was not forthcoming she thought it better to give up the point without a dispute it might be that beatrice would absolutely refuse to pay this respect to her mothers authority and then where would she have been  at this moment a servant came up to say that the squire was in his room and lady arabella was opportunely saved the necessity of discussing the matter further with her daughter i am now she said going to see your father on the same subject you may be quite sure beatrice that i should not willingly speak to him on any matter relating to dr thorne did i not find it absolutely necessary to do so  this beatrice knew was true and she did therefore feel convinced that something terrible must have happened  while lady arabella opened her budget the squire sat quite silent listening to her with apparent respect she found it necessary that her description to him should be much more elaborate than that which she had vouchsafed to her daughter and in telling her grievance she insisted most especially on the personal insult which had been offered to herself  after what has now happened said she not quite able to repress a tone of triumph as she spoke i do expect mr gresham that you willwill  will what my dear  will at least protect me from the repetition of such treatment  you are not afraid that dr thorne will come here to attack you as far as i can understand he never comes near the place unless when you send for him  no i do not think that he will come to greshamsbury any more i believe i have put a stop to that  then what is it my dear that you want me to do  lady arabella paused a minute before she replied the game which she now had to play was not very easy she knew or thought she knew that her husband in his heart of hearts much preferred his friend to the wife of his bosom and that he would if he could shuffle out of noticing the doctors iniquities it behoved her therefore to put them forward in such a way that they must be noticed  i suppose mr gresham you do not wish that frank should marry the girl  i do not think there is the slightest chance of such a thing and i am quite sure that dr thorne would not encourage it  but i tell you mr gresham that he says he will encourage it  oh you have misunderstood him  of course i always misunderstand everything i know that i misunderstood it when i told you how you would distress yourself if you took those nasty hounds  i have had other troubles more expensive than the hounds said the poor squire sighing  oh yes i know what you mean a wife and family are expensive of course it is a little too late now to complain of that  my dear it is always too late to complain of any troubles when they are no longer to be avoided we need not therefore talk any more about the hounds at present  i do not wish to speak of them mr gresham  nor i  but i hope you will not think me unreasonable if i am anxious to know what you intend to do about dr thorne  to do  yes i suppose you will do something you do not wish to see your son marry such a girl as mary thorne  as far as the girl herself is concerned said the squire turning rather red i am not sure that he could do much better i know nothing whatever against mary frank however cannot afford to make such a match it would be his ruin  of course it would utter ruin he never could hold up his head again therefore it is i ask what do you intend to do  the squire was bothered he had no intention whatever of doing anything and no belief in his wifes assertion as to dr thornes iniquity but he did not know how to get her out of the room she asked him the same question over and over again and on each occasion urged on him the heinousness of the insult to which she personally had been subjected so that at last he was driven to ask her what it was she wished him to do  well then mr gresham if you ask me i must say that i think you should abstain from any intercourse with dr thorne whatever  break off all intercourse with him  yes  what do you mean he has been turned out of this house and im not to go to see him at his own  i certainly think that you ought to discontinue your visits to dr thorne altogether  nonsense my dear absolute nonsense  nonsense mr gresham it is no nonsense as you speak in that way i must let you know plainly what i feel i am endeavouring to do my duty by my son as you justly observe such a marriage as this would be utter ruin to him when i found that the young people were actually talking of being in love with each other making vows and all that sort of thing i did think it time to interfere i did not however turn them out of greshamsbury as you accuse me of doing in the kindest possible manner  wellwellwell i know all that there they are gone and thats enough i dont complain surely that ought to be enough  enough mr gresham no it is not enough i find that in spite of what has occurred the closest intimacy exists between the two families that poor beatrice who is so very young and not so prudent as she should be is made to act as a gobetween and when i speak to the doctor hoping that he will assist me in preventing this he not only tells me that he means to encourage mary in her plans but positively insults me to my face laughs at me for being an earls daughter and tells meyes he absolutely told meto get out of his house  let it be told with some shame as to the squires conduct that his first feeling on hearing this was one of envyof envy and regret that he could not make the same uncivil request not that he wished to turn his wife absolutely out of his house but he would have been very glad to have had the power of dismissing her summarily from his own room this however was at present impossible so he was obliged to make some mild reply  you must have mistaken him my dear he could not have intended to say that  oh of course mr gresham it is all a mistake of course it will be a mistake only a mistake when you find your son married to mary thorne  well my dear i cannot undertake to quarrel with dr thorne this was true for the squire could hardly have quarrelled with dr thorne even had he wished it  then i think it right to tell you that i shall and mr gresham i did not expect much cooperation from you but i did think that you would have shown some little anger when you heard that i had been so illtreated i shall however know how to take care of myself and i shall continue to do the best i can to protect frank from these wicked intrigues  so saying her ladyship arose and left the room having succeeded in destroying the comfort of all our greshamsbury friends it was very well for the squire to declare that he would not quarrel with dr thorne and of course he did not do so but he himself had no wish whatever that his son should marry mary thorne and as a falling drop will hollow a stone so did the continual harping of his wife on the subject give rise to some amount of suspicion in his own mind then as to beatrice though she had made no promise that she would not again visit mary she was by no means prepared to set her mothers authority altogether at defiance and she also was sufficiently uncomfortable  dr thorne said nothing of the matter to his niece and she therefore would have been absolutely bewildered by beatrices absence had she not received some tidings of what had taken place at greshamsbury through patience oriel beatrice and patience discussed the matter fully and it was agreed between them that it would be better that mary should know what sterner orders respecting her had gone forth from the tyrant at greshamsbury and that she might understand that beatrices absence was compulsory patience was thus placed in this position that on one day she walked and talked with beatrice and on the next with mary and so matters went on for a while at greshamsburynot very pleasantly  very unpleasantly and very uncomfortably did the months of may and june pass away beatrice and mary occasionally met drinking tea together at the parsonage or in some other of the ordinary meetings of country society but there were no more confidentially distressing confidential discourses no more whispering of franks name no more sweet allusions to the inexpediency of a passion which according to beatrices views would have been so delightful had it been expedient  the squire and the doctor also met constantly there were unfortunately many subjects on which they were obliged to meet louis philippeor sir louis as we must call himthough he had no power over his own property was wide awake to all the coming privileges of ownership and he would constantly point out to his guardian the manner in which according to his ideas the most should be made of it the young baronets ideas of good taste were not of the most refined description and he did not hesitate to tell dr thorne that his the doctors friendship with mr gresham must be no bar to his the baronets interest sir louis also had his own lawyer who gave dr thorne to understand that according to his ideas the sum due on mr greshams property was too large to be left on its present footing the titledeeds he said should be surrendered or the mortgage foreclosed all this added to the sadness which now seemed to envelop the village of greshamsbury  early in july frank was to come home the manner in which the comings and goings of poor frank were allowed to disturb the arrangements of all the ladies and some of the gentlemen of greshamsbury was most abominable and yet it can hardly be said to have been his fault he would have been only too well pleased had things been allowed to go on after their old fashion things were not allowed so to go on at christmas miss oriel had submitted to be exiled in order that she might carry mary away from the presence of the young bashaw an arrangement by which all the winter festivities of the poor doctor had been thoroughly sacrificed and now it began to be said that some similar plan for the summer must be suggested  it must not be supposed that any direction to this effect was conveyed either to mary or to the doctor the suggestion came from them and was mentioned only to patience but patience as a matter of course told beatrice and beatrice told her mother somewhat triumphantly hoping thereby to convince the shedragon of marys innocence alas shedragons are not easily convinced of the innocence of any one lady arabella quite coincided in the propriety of marys being sent offwhither she never inquiredin order that the coast might be clear for poor frank but she did not a whit the more abstain from talking of the wicked intrigues of those thornes as it turned out marys absence caused her to talk all the more  the boxall hill property including the house and furniture had been left to the contractors son it being understood that the property would not be at present in his own hands but that he might inhabit the house if he chose to do so it would thus be necessary for lady scatcherd to find a home for herself unless she could remain at boxall hill by her sons permission in this position of affairs the doctor had been obliged to make a bargain between them sir louis did wish to have the comfort or perhaps the honour of a country house but he did not wish to have the expense of keeping it up he was also willing to let his mother live at the house but not without a consideration after a prolonged degree of haggling terms were agreed upon and a few weeks after her husbands death lady scatcherd found herself alone at boxall hillalone as regards society in the ordinary sense but not quite alone as concerned her ladyship for the faithful hannah was still with her  the doctor was of course often at boxall hill and never left it without an urgent request from lady scatcherd that he would bring his niece over to see her now lady scatcherd was no fit companion for mary thorne and though mary had often asked to be taken to boxall hill certain considerations had hitherto induced the doctor to refuse the request but there was that about lady scatcherda kind of homely honesty of purpose an absence of all conceit as to her own position and a strength of womanly confidence in the doctor as her friend which by degrees won upon his heart when therefore both he and mary felt that it would be better for her again to absent herself for a while from greshamsbury it was after much deliberation agreed that she should go on a visit to boxall hill  to boxall hill accordingly she went and was received almost as a princess mary had all her life been accustomed to women of rank and had never habituated herself to feel much trepidation in the presence of titled grandees but she had prepared herself to be more than ordinarily submissive to lady scatcherd her hostess was a widow was not a woman of high birth was a woman of whom her uncle spoke well and for all these reasons mary was determined to respect her and pay to her every consideration but when she settled down in the house she found it almost impossible to do so lady scatcherd treated her as a farmers wife might have treated some convalescent young lady who had been sent to her charge for a few weeks in order that she might benefit by the country air her ladyship could hardly bring herself to sit still and eat her dinner tranquilly in her guests presence and then nothing was good enough for mary lady scatcherd besought her almost with tears to say what she liked best to eat and drink and was in despair when mary declared she didnt care that she liked anything and that she was in nowise particular in such matters  a roast fowl miss thorne  very nice lady scatcherd  and bread sauce  bread sauceyes oh yesi like bread sauceand poor mary tried hard to show a little interest  and just a few sausages we make them all in the house miss thorne we know what they are and mashed potatoesdo you like them best mashed or baked  mary finding herself obliged to vote voted for mashed potatoes  very well but miss thorne if you like boiled fowl better with a little bit of ham you know i do hope youll say so and theres lamb in the house quite beautiful now do ee say something do ee miss thorne  so invoked mary felt herself obliged to say something and declared for the roast fowl and sausages but she found it very difficult to pay much outward respect to a person who would pay so much outward respect to her a day or two after her arrival it was decided that she should ride about the place on a donkey she was accustomed to riding the doctor having generally taken care that one of his own horses should when required consent to carry a lady but there was no steed at boxall hill that she could mount and when lady scatcherd had offered to get a pony for her she had willingly compromised matters by expressing the delight she would have in making a campaign on a donkey upon this lady scatcherd had herself set off in quest of the desired animal much to marys horror and did not return till the necessary purchase had been effected then she came back with the donkey close at her heels almost holding its collar and stood there at the halldoor till mary came to approve  i hope shell do i dont think shell kick said lady scatcherd patting the head of her purchase quite triumphantly  oh you are so kind lady scatcherd im sure shell do quite nicely she seems very quiet said mary  please my lady its a he said the boy who held the halter  oh a he is it said her ladyship but the hedonkeys are quite as quiet as the shes aint they  oh yes my lady a deal quieter all the world over and twice as useful  im so glad of that miss thorne said lady scatcherd her eyes bright with joy  and so mary was established with her donkey who did all that could be expected from an animal in his position  but dear lady scatcherd said mary as they sat together at the open drawingroom window the same evening you must not go on calling me miss thorne my name is mary you know wont you call me mary and she came and knelt at lady scatcherds feet and took hold of her looking up into her face  lady scatcherds cheeks became rather red as though she was somewhat ashamed of her position  you are so very kind to me continued mary and it seems so cold to hear you call me miss thorne  well miss thorne im sure id call you anything to please you only i didnt know whether youd like it from me else i do think mary is the prettiest name in all the language  i should like it very much  my dear roger always loved that name better than any other ten times better i used to wish sometimes that id been called mary  did he why  he once had a sister called mary such a beautiful creature i declare i sometimes think you are like her  oh dear then she must have been beautiful indeed said mary laughing  she was very beautiful i just remember heroh so beautiful she was quite a poor girl you know and so was i then isnt it odd that i should have to be called my lady now do you know miss thorne  mary mary said her guest  ah yes but somehow i hardly like to make so free but as i was saying i do so dislike being called my lady i always think the people are laughing at me and so they are  oh nonsense  yes they are though poor dear roger he used to call me my lady just to make fun of me i didnt mind it so much from him but miss thorne  mary mary mary  ah well i shall do it in time but missmary ha ha ha never mind let me alone but what i want to say is this do you think i could drop it hannah says that if i go the right way about it she is sure i can  oh but lady scatcherd you shouldnt think of such a thing  shouldnt i now  oh no for your husbands sake you should be proud of it he gained great honour you know  ah well said she sighing after a short pause if you think it will do him any good of course ill put up with it and then i know louis would be mad if i talked of such a thing but miss thorne dear a woman like me dont like to have to be made a fool of all the days of her life if she can help it  but lady scatcherd said mary when this question of the title had been duly settled and her ladyship made to understand that she must bear the burden for the rest of her life but lady scatcherd you were speaking of sir rogers sister what became of her  oh she did very well at last as sir roger did himself but in early life she was very unfortunatejust at the time of my marriage with dear roger and then just as she was about to commence so much as she knew of the history of mary scatcherd she remembered that the author of her sisterinlaws misery had been a thorne a brother of the doctor and therefore as she presumed a relative of her guest and suddenly she became mute  well said mary just as you were married lady scatcherd  poor lady scatcherd had very little worldly knowledge and did not in the least know how to turn the conversation or escape from the trouble into which she had fallen all manner of reflections began to crowd upon her in her early days she had known very little of the thornes nor had she thought much of them since except as regarded her friend the doctor but at this moment she began for the first time to remember that she had never heard of more than two brothers in the family who then could have been marys father she felt at once that it would be improper for to say anything as to henry thornes terrible faults and sudden fateimproper also to say more about mary scatcherd but she was quite unable to drop the matter otherwise than abruptly and with a start  she was very unfortunate you say lady scatcherd  yes miss thorne mary i meannever mind mei shall do it in time yes she was but now i think of it i had better say nothing more about it there are reasons and i ought not to have spoken of it you wont be provoked with me will you  mary assured her that she would not be provoked and of course asked no more questions about mary scatcherd nor did she think much more about it it was not so however with her ladyship who could not keep herself from reflecting that the old clergyman in the close at barchester certainly had but two sons one of whom was now the doctor at greshamsbury and the other of whom had perished so wretchedly at the gate of that farmyard who then was the father of mary thorne  the days passed very quietly at boxall hill every morning mary went out on her donkey who justified by his demeanour all that had been said in his praise then she would read or draw then walk with lady scatcherd then dine then walk again and so the days passed quietly away once or twice a week the doctor would come over and drink his tea there riding home in the cool of the evening mary also received one visit from her friend patience  so the days passed quietly away till the tranquillity of the house was suddenly broken by tidings from london lady scatcherd received a letter from her son contained in three lines in which he intimated that on the following day he meant to honour her with a visit he had intended he said to have gone to brighton with some friends but as he felt himself a little out of sorts he would postpone his marine trip and do his mother the grace of spending a few days with her  this news was not very pleasant to mary by whom it had been understood as it had also by her uncle that lady scatcherd would have had the house to herself but as there were no means of preventing the evil mary could only inform the doctor and prepare herself to meet sir louis scatcherd     chapter xxviii  the doctor hears something to his advantage   sir louis scatcherd had told his mother that he was rather out of sorts and when he reached boxall hill it certainly did not appear that he had given any exaggerated statement of his own maladies he certainly was a good deal out of sorts he had had more than one attack of delirium tremens since his fathers death and had almost been at deaths door  nothing had been said about this by dr thorne at boxall hill but he was by no means ignorant of his wards state twice he had gone up to london to visit him twice he had begged him to go down into the country and place himself under his mothers care on the last occasion the doctor had threatened him with all manner of pains and penalties with pains as to his speedy departure from this world and all its joys and with penalties in the shape of poverty if that departure should by any chance be retarded but these threats had at the moment been in vain and the doctor had compromised matters by inducing sir louis to promise that he would go to brighton the baronet however who was at length frightened by some renewed attack gave up his brighton scheme and without any notice to the doctor hurried down to boxall hill  mary did not see him on the first day of his coming but the doctor did he received such intimation of the visit as enabled him to be at the house soon after the young mans arrival and knowing that his assistance might be necessary he rode over to boxall hill it was a dreadful task to him this of making the same fruitless endeavour for the son that he had made for the father and in the same house but he was bound by every consideration to perform the task he had promised the father that he would do for the son all that was in his power and he had moreover the consciousness that should sir louis succeed in destroying himself the next heir to all the property was his own niece mary thorne  he found sir louis in a low wretched miserable state though he was a drunkard as his father was he was not at all such a drunkard as was his father the physical capacities of the men were very different the daily amount of alcohol which the father had consumed would have burnt up the son in a week whereas though the son was continually tipsy what he swallowed would hardly have had an injurious effect upon the father  you are all wrong quite wrong said sir louis petulantly it isnt that at all i have taken nothing this week pastliterally nothing i think its the liver  dr thorne wanted no one to tell him what was the matter with his ward it was his liver his liver and his head and his stomach and his heart every organ in his body had been destroyed or was in the course of destruction his father had killed himself with brandy the son more elevated in his tastes was doing the same thing with curaçoa maraschino and cherrybounce  sir louis said the doctorhe was obliged to be much more punctilious with him than he had been with the contractorthe matter is in your own hands entirely if you cannot keep your lips from that accursed poison you have nothing in this world to look forward to nothing nothing  mary proposed to return with her uncle to greshamsbury and he was at first well inclined that she should do so but this idea was overruled partly in compliance with lady scatcherds entreaties and partly because it would have seemed as though they had both thought the presence of its owner had made the house an unfit habitation for decent people the doctor therefore returned leaving mary there and lady scatcherd busied herself between her two guests  on the next day sir louis was able to come down to a late dinner and mary was introduced to him he had dressed himself in his best array and as he hadat any rate for the present momentbeen frightened out of his libations he was prepared to make himself as agreeable as possible his mother waited on him almost as a slave might have done but she seemed to do so with the fear of a slave rather than the love of a mother she was fidgety in her attentions and worried him by endeavouring to make her evening sittingroom agreeable  but sir louis though he was not very sweetly behaved under these manipulations from his mothers hands was quite complaisant to miss thorne nay after the expiration of a week he was almost more than complaisant he piqued himself on his gallantry and now found that in the otherwise dull seclusion of boxall hill he had a good opportunity of exercising it to do him justice it must be admitted that he would not have been incapable of a decent career had he stumbled upon some girl who could have loved him before he stumbled upon his maraschino bottle such might have been the case with many a lost rake the things that are bad are accepted because the things that are good do not come easily in his way how many a miserable father reviles with bitterness of spirit the low tastes of his son who has done nothing to provide his child with higher pleasures  sir louispartly in the hopes of marys smiles and partly frightened by the doctors threatsdid for a while keep himself within decent bounds he did not usually appear before marys eyes till three or four in the afternoon but when he did come forth he came forth sober and resolute to please his mother was delighted and was not slow to sing his praises and even the doctor who now visited boxall hill more frequently than ever began to have some hopes  one constant subject i must not say of conversation on the part of lady scatcherd but rather of declamation had hitherto been the beauty and manly attributes of frank gresham she had hardly ceased to talk to mary of the infinite good qualities of the young squire and especially of his prowess in the matter of mr moffat mary had listened to all this eloquence not perhaps with inattention but without much reply she had not been exactly sorry to hear frank talked about indeed had she been so minded she could herself have said something on the same subject but she did not wish to take lady scatcherd altogether into her confidence and she had been unable to say much about frank gresham without doing so lady scatcherd had therefore gradually conceived the idea that her darling was not a favourite with her guest  now therefore she changed the subject and as her own son was behaving with such unexampled propriety she dropped frank and confined her eulogies to louis he had been a little wild she admitted young men so often were so but she hoped that it was now over  he does still take a little drop of those french drinks in the morning said lady scatcherd in her confidence for she was too honest to be false even in her own cause he does do that i know but thats nothing my dear to swilling all day and everything cant be done at once can it miss thorne  on this subject mary found her tongue loosened she could not talk about frank gresham but she could speak with hope to the mother of her only son she could say that sir louis was still very young that there was reason to trust that he might now reform that his present conduct was apparently good and that he appeared capable of better things so much she did say and the mother took her sympathy for more than it was worth  on this matter and on this matter perhaps alone sir louis and lady scatcherd were in accord there was much to recommend mary to the baronet not only did he see her to be beautiful and perceive her to be attractive and ladylike but she was also the niece of the man who for the present held the pursestrings of his wealth mary it is true had no fortune but sir louis knew that she was acknowledged to be a lady and he was ambitious that his lady should be a lady there was also much to recommend mary to the mother to any mother and thus it came to pass that miss thorne had no obstacle between her and the dignity of being lady scatcherd the secondno obstacle whatever if only she could bring herself to wish it  it was some timetwo or three weeks perhapsbefore marys mind was first opened to this new brilliancy in her prospects sir louis at first was rather afraid of her and did not declare his admiration in any very determined terms he certainly paid her many compliments which from any one else she would have regarded as abominable but she did not expect great things from the baronets taste she concluded that he was only doing what he thought a gentleman should do and she was willing to forgive much for lady scatcherds sake  his first attempts were perhaps more ludicrous than passionate he was still too much an invalid to take walks and mary was therefore saved from his company in her rambles but he had a horse of his own at boxall hill and had been advised to ride by the doctor mary also rodeon a donkey only it is truebut sir louis found himself bound in gallantry to accompany her marys steed had answered every expectation and proved himself very quiet so quiet that without the admonition of a cudgel behind him he could hardly be persuaded into the demurest trot now as sir louiss horse was of a very different mettle he found it rather difficult not to step faster than his inamorata and let it him struggle as he would was generally so far ahead as to be debarred the delights of conversation  when for the second time he proposed to accompany her mary did what she could to hinder it she saw that he had been rather ashamed of the manner in which his companion was mounted and she herself would have enjoyed her ride much more without him he was an invalid however it was necessary to make much of him and mary did not absolutely refuse his offer  lady scatcherd said he as they were standing at the door previous to mountinghe always called his mother lady scatcherdwhy dont you have a horse for miss thorne this donkey isisreally is so veryverycant go at all you know  lady scatcherd began to declare that she would willingly have got a pony if mary would have let her do so  oh no lady scatcherd not on any account i do like the donkey so muchi do indeed  but he wont go said sir louis and for a person who rides like you miss thornesuch a horsewoman you knowwhy you know lady scatcherd its positively ridiculous d absurd you know  and then with an angry look at his mother he mounted his horse and was soon leading the way down the avenue  miss thorne said he pulling himself up at the gate if i had known that i was to be so extremely happy as to have found you here i would have brought you down the most beautiful creature an arab she belongs to my friend jenkins but i wouldnt have stood at any price in getting her for you by jove if you were on that mare id back you for style and appearance against anything in hyde park  the offer of this sporting wager which naturally would have been very gratifying to mary was lost upon her for sir louis had again unwittingly got on in advance but he stopped himself in time to hear mary again declare her passion was a donkey  if you could only see jenkinss little mare miss thorne only say one word and she shall be down here before the weeks end price shall be no obstaclenone whatever by jove what a pair you would be  this generous offer was repeated four or five times but on each occasion mary only half heard what was said and on each occasion the baronet was far too much in advance to hear marys reply at last he recollected that he wanted to call on one of the tenants and begged his companion to allow him to ride on  if you at all dislike being left alone you know  oh dear no not at all sir louis i am quite used to it  because i dont care about it you know only i cant make this horse walk the same pace as that brute  you mustnt abuse my pet sir louis  its a d shame on my mothers part said sir louis who even when in his best behaviour could not quite give up his ordinary mode of conversation when she was fortunate enough to get such a girl as you to come and stay with her she ought to have had something proper for her to ride upon but ill look to it as soon as i am a little stronger you see if i dont and so saying sir louis trotted off leaving mary in peace with her donkey  sir louis had now been living cleanly and forswearing sack for what was to him a very long period and his health felt the good effects of it no one rejoiced at this more cordially than did the doctor to rejoice at it was with him a point of conscience he could not help telling himself now and again that circumstanced as he was he was most specially bound to take joy in any sign of reformation which the baronet might show not to do so would be almost tantamount to wishing that he might die in order that mary might inherit his wealth and therefore the doctor did with all his energy devote himself to the difficult task of hoping and striving that sir louis might yet live to enjoy what was his own but the task was altogether a difficult one for as sir louis became stronger in health so also did he become more exorbitant in his demands on the doctors patience and more repugnant to the doctors tastes  in his worst fits of disreputable living he was ashamed to apply to his guardian for money and in his worst fits of illness he was through fear somewhat patient under his doctors hands but just at present he had nothing of which to be ashamed and was not at all patient  doctorsaid he one day at boxall hillhow about those greshamsbury titledeeds  oh that will all be properly settled between my lawyer and your own  ohahyes no doubt the lawyers will settle it settle it with a fine bill of costs of course but as finnie saysfinnie was sir louiss legal adviseri have got a tremendously large interest at stake in this matter eighty thousand pounds is no joke it aint everybody that can shell out eighty thousand pounds when theyre wanted and i should like to know how the things going on ive a right to ask you know eh doctor  the titledeeds of a large portion of the greshamsbury estate will be placed with the mortgagedeeds before the end of next month  oh thats all right i choose to know about these things for though my father did make such a confounded will thats no reason i shouldnt know how things are going  you shall know everything that i know sir louis  and now doctor what are we to do about money  about money  yes money rhino ready put money in your purse and cut a dash eh doctor not that i want to cut a dash no im going on the quiet line altogether now ive done with all that sort of thing  im heartily glad of it heartily said the doctor  yes im not going to make way for my faraway cousin yet not if i know it at least i shall soon be all right now doctor shant i  all right is a long word sir louis but i do hope you will be all right in time if you will live with decent prudence you shouldnt take that filth in the morning though  filth in the morning thats my mother i suppose thats her ladyship shes been talking has she dont you believe her doctor theres not a young man in barsetshire is going more regular all right within the posts than i am  the doctor was obliged to acknowledge that there did seem to be some improvement  and now doctor how about money eh  doctor thorne like other guardians similarly circumstanced began to explain that sir louis had already had a good deal of money and had begun also to promise that more should be forthcoming in the event of good behaviour when he was somewhat suddenly interrupted by sir louis  well now ill tell you what doctor ive got a bit of news for you something that i think will astonish you  the doctor opened his eyes and tried to look as though ready to be surprised  something that will really make you look about and something too that will be very much to the hearers advantageas the newspaper advertisements say  something to my advantage said the doctor  well i hope youll think so doctor what would you think now of my getting married  i should be delighted to hear of itmore delighted than i can express that is of course if you were to marry well it was your fathers most eager wish that you should marry early  thats partly my reason said the young hypocrite but then if i marry i must have an income fit to live on eh doctor  the doctor had some fear that his interesting protégée was desirous of a wife for the sake of the income instead of desiring the income for the sake of the wife but let the cause be what it would marriage would probably be good for him and he had no hesitation therefore in telling him that if he married well he should be put in possession of sufficient income to maintain the new lady scatcherd in a manner becoming her dignity  as to marrying well said sir louis you i take it will the be the last man doctor to quarrel with my choice  shall i said the doctor smiling  well you wont disapprove i guess as the yankee says what would you think of miss mary thorne  it must be said in sir louiss favour that he had probably no idea whatever of the estimation in which such young ladies as mary thorne are held by those who are nearest and dearest to them he had no sort of conception that she was regarded by her uncle as an inestimable treasure almost too precious to be rendered up to the arms of any man and infinitely beyond any price in silver and gold baronets incomes of eight or ten thousand a year and such coins usually current in the worlds markets he was a rich man and a baronet and mary was an unmarried girl without a portion in sir louiss estimation he was offering everything and asking for nothing he certainly had some idea that girls were apt to be coy and required a little wooing in the shape of presents civil speechesperhaps kisses also the civil speeches he had he thought done and imagined that they had been well received the other things were to follow an arab pony for instanceand the kisses probably with it and then all these difficulties would be smoothed  but he did not for a moment conceive that there would be any difficulty with the uncle how should there be was he not a baronet with ten thousand a year coming to him had he not everything which fathers want for portionless daughters and uncles for dependant nieces might he not well inform the doctor that he had something to tell him for his advantage  and yet to tell the truth the doctor did not seem to be overjoyed when the announcement was first made to him he was by no means overjoyed on the contrary even sir louis could perceive his guardians surprise was altogether unmixed with delight  what a question was this that was asked him what would he think of a marriage between mary thornehis mary and sir louis scatcherd between the alpha of the whole alphabet and him whom he could not but regard as the omega think of it why he would think of it as though a lamb and a wolf were to stand at the altar together had sir louis been a hottentot or an esquimaux the proposal could not have astonished him more the two persons were so totally of a different class that the idea of the one falling in love with the other had never occurred to him what would you think of miss mary thorne sir louis had asked and the doctor instead of answering him with ready and pleased alacrity stood silent thunderstruck with amazement  well wouldnt she be a good wife said sir louis rather in a tone of disgust at the evident disapproval shown at his choice i thought youd have been so delighted  mary thorne ejaculated the doctor at last have you spoken to my niece about this sir louis  well i have and yet i havent i havent and yet in a manner i have  i dont understand you said the doctor  why you see i havent exactly popped to her yet but i have been doing the civil and if shes up to snuff as i take her to be she knows very well what im after by this time  up to snuff mary thorne his mary thorne up to snuff to snuff too of such a very disagreeable description  i think sir louis that you are in mistake about this i think you will find that mary will not be disposed to avail herself of the great advantagesfor great they undoubtedly arewhich you are able to offer to your intended wife if you will take my advice you will give up thinking of mary she would not suit you  not suit me oh but i think she just would shes got no money you mean  no i did not mean that it will not signify to you whether your wife has money or not you need not look for money but you should think of some one more nearly of your own temperament i am quite sure that my niece would refuse you  these last words the doctor uttered with much emphasis his intention was to make the baronet understand that the matter was quite hopeless and to induce him if possible to drop it on the spot but he did not know sir louis he ranked him too low in the scale of human beings and gave him no credit for any strength of character sir louis in his way did love mary thorne and could not bring himself to believe that mary did not or at any rate would not soon return his passion he was moreover sufficiently obstinate firm we ought perhaps to sayfor his pursuit in this case was certainly not an evil oneand he at once made up his mind to succeed in spite of the uncle  if she consents however you will do so too asked he  it is impossible she should consent said the doctor  impossible i dont see anything at all impossible but if she does  but she wont  very wellthats to be seen but just tell me this if she does will you consent  the stars would fall first its all nonsense give it up my dear friend believe me you are only preparing unhappiness for yourself and the doctor put his hand kindly on the young mans arm she will not cannot accept such an offer  will not cannot said the baronet thinking over all the reasons which in his estimation could possibly be inducing the doctor to be so hostile to his views and shaking the hand off his arm will not cannot but come doctor answer my question fairly if shell have me for better or worse you wont say aught against it will you  but she wont have you why should you give her and yourself the pain of a refusal  oh as for that i must stand my chances like another and as for her why d doctor you wouldnt have me believe that any young lady thinks it so very dreadful to have a baronet with ten thousand pounds a year at her feet specially when that same baronet aint very old nor yet particularly ugly i aint so green as that doctor  i suppose she must go through it then said the doctor musing  but dr thorne i did look for a kinder answer from you considering all that you so often say about your great friendship with my father i did think youd at any rate answer me when i asked you a question  but the doctor did not want to answer that special question could it be possible that mary should wish to marry this odious man could such a state of things be imagined to be the case he would not refuse his consent infinitely as he would be disgusted by her choice but he would not give sir louis any excuse for telling mary that her uncle approved of so odious a match  i cannot say that in any case i should approve of such a marriage sir louis i cannot bring myself to say so for i know it would make you both miserable but on that matter my niece will choose wholly for herself  and about the money doctor  if you marry a decent woman you shall not want the means of supporting her decently and so saying the doctor walked away leaving sir louis to his meditations     chapter xxix  the donkey ride   sir louis when left to himself was slightly dismayed and somewhat discouraged but he was not induced to give up his object the first effort of his mind was made in conjecturing what private motive dr thorne could possibly have in wishing to debar his niece from marrying a rich young baronet that the objection was personal to himself sir louis did not for a moment imagine could it be that the doctor did not wish that his niece should be richer and grander and altogether bigger than himself or was it possible that his guardian was anxious to prevent him from marrying from some view of the reversion of the large fortune that there was some such reason sir louis was well sure but let it be what it might he would get the better of the doctor he knew so he said to himself what stuff girls were made of baronets did not grow like blackberries and so assuring himself with such philosophy he determined to make his offer  the time he selected for doing this was the hour before dinner but on the day on which his conversation with the doctor had taken place he was deterred by the presence of a strange visitor to account for this strange visit it will be necessary that we should return to greshamsbury for a few minutes  frank when he returned home for his summer vacation found that mary had again flown and the very fact of her absence added fuel to the fire of his love more perhaps than even her presence might have done for the flight of the quarry ever adds eagerness to the pursuit of the huntsman lady arabella moreover had a bitter enemy a foe utterly opposed to her side in the contest where she had once fondly looked for her staunchest ally frank was now in the habit of corresponding with miss dunstable and received from her most energetic admonitions to be true to the love which he had sworn true to it he resolved to be and therefore when he found that mary was flown he resolved to fly after her  he did not however do this till he had been in a measure provoked to it by it by the sharptongued cautions and blunted irony of his mother it was not enough for her that she had banished mary out of the parish and made dr thornes life miserable not enough that she harassed her husband with harangues on the constant subject of franks marrying money and dismayed beatrice with invectives against the iniquity of her friend the snake was so but scotched to kill it outright she must induce frank utterly to renounce miss thorne  this task she essayed but not exactly with success well mother said frank at last turning very red partly with shame and partly with indignation as he made the frank avowal since you press me about it i tell you fairly that my mind is made up to marry mary sooner or later if  oh frank good heavens you wicked boy you are saying this purposely to drive me distracted  if continued frank not attending to his mothers interjections if she will consent  consent said lady arabella oh heavens and falling into the corner of the sofa she buried her face in her handkerchief  yes mother if she will consent and now that i have told you so much it is only just that i should tell you this also that as far as i can see at present i have no reason to hope that she will do so  oh frank the girl is doing all she can to catch you said lady arabellanot prudently  no mother there you wrong her altogether wrong her most cruelly  you ungracious wicked boy you call me cruel  i dont call you cruel but you wrong her cruelly most cruelly when i have spoken to her about thisfor i have spoken to hershe has behaved exactly as you would have wanted her to do but not at all as i wished her she has given me no encouragement you have turned her out among youfrank was beginning to be very bitter nowbut she has done nothing to deserve it if there has been any fault it has been mine but it is well that we should all understand each other my intention is to marry mary if i can and so speaking certainly without due filial respect he turned towards the door  frank said his mother raising herself up with energy to make one last appeal frank do you wish to see me die of a broken heart  you know mother i would wish to make you happy if i could  if you wish to see me ever happy again if you do not wish to see me sink brokenhearted to my grave you must give up this mad idea frankand now all lady arabellas energy came out frank there is but one course left open to you you must marry money and then lady arabella stood up before her son as lady macbeth might have stood had lady macbeth lived to have a son of franks years  miss dunstable i suppose said frank scornfully no mother i made an ass and worse than an ass of myself once in that way and i wont do it again i hate money  oh frank  i hate money  but frank the estate  i hate the estateat least i shall hate it if i am expected to buy it at such a price as that the estate is my fathers  oh no frank it is not  it is in the sense i mean he may do with it as he pleases he will never have a word of complaint from me i am ready to go into a profession tomorrow ill be a lawyer or a doctor or an engineer i dont care what frank in his enthusiasm probably overlooked some of the preliminary difficulties or ill take a farm under him and earn my bread that way but mother dont talk to me any more about marrying money and so saying frank left the room  frank it will be remembered was twentyone when he was first introduced to the reader he is now twentytwo it may be said that there was a great difference between his character then and now a year at that period will make a great difference but the change has been not in his character but in his feelings  frank went out from his mother and immediately ordered his black horse to be got ready for him he would at once go over to boxall hill he went himself to the stables to give his orders and as he returned to get his gloves and whip he met beatrice in the corridor  beatrice said he step in here and she followed him into his room im not going to bear this any longer im going to boxall hill  oh frank how can you be so imprudent  you at any rate have some decent feeling for mary i believe you have some regard for her and therefore i tell you will you send her any message  oh yes my best best love that is if you will see her but frank you are very foolish very and she will be infinitely distressed  do not mention this that is not at present not that i mean to make any secret of it i shall tell my father everything im off now and then paying no attention to her remonstrance he turned down the stairs and was soon on horseback  he took the road to boxall hill but he did not ride very fast he did not go jauntily as a jolly thriving wooer but musingly and often with diffidence meditating every now and then whether it would not be better for him to turn back to turn backbut not from fear of his mother not from prudential motives not because that oftenrepeated lesson as to marrying money was beginning to take effect not from such causes as these but because he doubted how he might be received by mary  he did it is true think something about his worldly prospects he had talked rather grandiloquently to his mother as to his hating money and hating the estate his mothers neverceasing worldly cares on such subjects perhaps demanded that a little grandiloquence should be opposed to them but frank did not hate the estate nor did he at all hate the position of an english country gentleman miss dunstables eloquence however rang in his ears for miss dunstable had an eloquence of her own even in her letters never let them talk you out of your own true honest hearty feelings she had said greshamsbury is a very nice place i am sure and i hope i shall see it some day but all its green knolls are not half so nice should not be half so precious as the pulses of your own heart that is your own estate your own your very ownyour own and anothers whatever may go to the moneylenders dont send that there dont mortgage that mr gresham  no said frank pluckily as he put his horse into a faster trot i wont mortgage that they may do what they like with the estate but my hearts my own and so speaking to himself almost aloud he turned a corner of the road rapidly and came at once upon the doctor  hallo doctor is that you said frank rather disgusted  what frank i hardly expected to meet you here said dr thorne not much better pleased  they were now not above a mile from boxall hill and the doctor therefore could not but surmise whither frank was going they had repeatedly met since franks return from cambridge both in the village and in the doctors house but not a word had been said between them about mary beyond what the merest courtesy had required not that each did not love the other sufficiently to make a full confidence between them desirable to both but neither had had the courage to speak out  nor had either of them the courage to do so now yes said frank blushing i am going to lady scatcherds shall i find the ladies at home  yes lady scatcherd is there but sir louis is there alsoan invalid perhaps you would not wish to meet him  oh i dont mind said frank trying to laugh he wont bite i suppose  the doctor longed in his heart to pray to frank to return with him not to go and make further mischief not to do that which might cause a more bitter estrangement between himself and the squire but he had not the courage to do it he could not bring himself to accuse frank of being in love with his niece so after a few more senseless words on either side words which each knew to be senseless as he uttered them they both rode on their own ways  and then the doctor silently and almost unconsciously made such a comparison between louis scatcherd and frank gresham as hamlet made between the dead and live king it was hyperion to a satyr was it not as impossible that mary should not love the one as that she should love the other franks offer of his affections had at first probably been but a boyish ebullition of feeling but if it should now be that this had grown into a manly and disinterested love how could mary remain unmoved what could her heart want more better more beautiful more rich than such a love as his was he not personally all that a girl could like were not his disposition mind character acquirements all such as women most delight to love was it not impossible that mary should be indifferent to him  so meditated the doctor as he rode along with only too true a knowledge of human nature ah it was impossible it was quite impossible that mary should be indifferent she had never been indifferent since frank had uttered his first halfjoking word of love such things are more important to women than they are to men to girls than they are to boys when frank had first told her that he loved her aye months before that when he merely looked his love her heart had received the whisper had acknowledged the glance unconscious as she was herself and resolved as she was to rebuke his advances when in her hearing he had said soft nothings to patience oriel a hated irrepressible tear had gathered in her eye when he had pressed in his warm loving grasp the hand which she had offered him as a token of mere friendship her heart had forgiven him the treachery nay almost thanked him for it before her eyes or her words had been ready to rebuke him when the rumour of his liaison with miss dunstable reached her ears when she heard of miss dunstables fortune she had wept wept outright in her chamberwept as she said to herself to think that he should be so mercenary but she had wept as she should have said to herself at finding that he was so faithless then when she knew at last that this rumour was false when she found that she was banished from greshamsbury for his sake when she was forced to retreat with her friend patience how could she but love him in that he was not mercenary how could she not love him in that he was so faithful  it was impossible that she should not love him was he not the brightest and the best of men that she had ever seen or was like to seethat she could possibly ever see she would have said to herself could she have brought herself to own the truth and then when she heard how true he was how he persisted against father mother and sisters how could it be that that should not be a merit in her eyes which was so great a fault in theirs when beatrice with wouldbe solemn face but with eyes beaming with feminine affection would gravely talk of franks tender love as a terrible misfortune as a misfortune to them all to mary herself as well as others how could mary do other than love him beatrice is his sister she would say within her own mind otherwise she would never talk like this were she not his sister she could not but know the value of such love as this ah yes mary did love him love him with all the strength of her heart and the strength of her heart was very great and now by degrees in those lonely donkeyrides at boxall hill in those solitary walks she was beginning to own to herself the truth  and now that she did own it what should be her course what should she do how should she act if this loved one persevered in his love and ah what should she do how should she act if he did not persevere could it be that there should be happiness in store for her was it not too clear that let the matter go how it would there was no happiness in store for her much as she might love frank gresham she could never consent to be his wife unless the squire would smile on her as his daughterinlaw the squire had been all that was kind all that was affectionate and then too lady arabella as she thought of the lady arabella a sterner form of thought came across her brow why should lady arabella rob her of her hearts joy what was lady arabella that she mary thorne need quail before her had lady arabella stood only in her way lady arabella flanked by the de courcy legion mary felt that she could have demanded franks hand as her own before them all without a blush of shame or a moments hesitation thus when her heart was all but ready to collapse within her would she gain some little strength by thinking of the lady arabella  please my lady here be young squoire gresham said one of the untutored servants at boxall hill opening lady scatcherds little parlour door as her ladyship was amusing herself by pulling down and turning and refolding and putting up again a heap of household linen which was kept in a huge press for the express purpose of supplying her with occupation  lady scatcherd holding a vast counterpane in her arms looked back over her shoulders and perceived that frank was in the room down went the counterpane on the ground and frank soon found himself in the very position which that useful article had so lately filled  oh master frank oh master frank said her ladyship almost in an hysterical fit of joy and then she hugged and kissed him as she had never kissed and hugged her own son since that son had first left the parent nest  frank bore it patiently and with a merry laugh but lady scatcherd said he what will they all say you forget i am a man now and he stooped his head as she again pressed her lips upon his forehead  i dont care what none of em say said her ladyship quite going back to her old days i will kiss my own boy so i will eh but master frank this is good of you a sight of you is good for sore eyes and my eyes have been sore enough too since i saw you and she put her apron up to wipe away a tear  yes said frank gently trying to disengage himself but not successfully yes you have had a great loss lady scatcherd i was so sorry when i heard of your grief  you always had a soft kind heart master frank so you had gods blessing on you what a fine man you have grown deary me well it seems as though it were only just tother day like and she pushed him a little off from her so that she might look the better into his face  well is it all right i suppose you would hardly know me again now ive got a pair of whiskers  know you i should know you well if i saw but the heel of your foot why what a head of hair you have got and so dark too but it doesnt curl as it used once and she stroked his hair and looked into his eyes and put her hand to his cheeks youll think me an old fool master frank i know that but you may think what you like if i live for the next twenty years youll always be my own boy so you will  by degrees slow degrees frank managed to change the conversation and to induce lady scatcherd to speak on some other topic than his own infantine perfections he affected an indifference as he spoke of her guest which would have deceived no one but lady scatcherd but her it did deceive and then he asked where mary was  shes just gone out on her donkeysomewhere about the place she rides on a donkey mostly every day but youll stop and take a bit of dinner with us eh now do ee master frank  but master frank excused himself he did not choose to pledge himself to sit down to dinner with mary he did not know in what mood they might return with regard to each other at dinnertime he said therefore that he would walk out and if possible find miss thorne and that he would return to the house again before he went  lady scatcherd then began making apologies for sir louis he was an invalid the doctor had been with him all the morning and he was not yet out of his room  these apologies frank willingly accepted and then made his way as he could on to the lawn a gardener of whom he inquired offered to go with him in pursuit of miss thorne this assistance however he declined and set forth in quest of her having learnt what were her most usual haunts nor was he directed wrongly for after walking about twenty minutes he saw through the trees the legs of a donkey moving on the greensward at about two hundred yards from him on that donkey doubtless sat mary thorne  the donkey was coming towards him not exactly in a straight line but so much so as to make it impossible that mary should not see him if he stood still he did stand still and soon emerging from the trees mary saw him all but close to her  her heart gave a leap within her but she was so far mistress of herself as to repress any visible sign of outward emotion she did not fall from her donkey or scream or burst into tears she merely uttered the words mr gresham in a tone of not unnatural surprise  yes said he trying to laugh but less successful than she had been in suppressing a show of feeling mr gresham i have come over at last to pay my respects to you you must have thought me very uncourteous not to do so before  this she denied she had not she said thought him at all uncivil she had come to boxall hill to be out of the way and of course had not expected any such formalities as she uttered this she almost blushed at the abrupt truth of what she was saying but she was taken so much unawares that she did not know how to make the truth other than abrupt  to be out of the way said frank and why should you want to be out of the way  oh there were reasons said she laughing perhaps i have quarrelled dreadfully with my uncle  frank at the present moment had not about him a scrap of badinage he had not a single easy word at his command he could not answer her with anything in guise of a joke so he walked on not answering at all  i hope all my friends at greshamsbury are well said mary is beatrice quite well  quite well said he  and patience  what miss oriel yes i believe so i havent seen her this day or two how was it that mary felt a little flush of joy as frank spoke in this indifferent way about miss oriels health  i thought she was always a particular friend of yours said she  what who miss oriel so she is i like her amazingly so does beatrice and then he walked about six steps in silence plucking up courage for the great attempt he did pluck up his courage and then rushed at once to the attack  mary said he and as he spoke he put his hand on the donkeys neck and looked tenderly into her face he looked tenderly and as marys ear at once told her his voice sounded more soft than it had ever sounded before mary do you remember the last time that we were together  mary did remember it well it was on that occasion when he had treacherously held her hand on that day when according to law he had become a man when he had outraged all the propriety of the de courcy interest by offering his love to mary in augustas hearing mary did remember it well but how was she to speak of it it was your birthday i think said she  yes it was my birthday i wonder whether you remember what i said to you then  i remember that you were very foolish mr gresham  mary i have come to repeat my follythat is if it be folly i told you then that i loved you and i dare say that i did so awkwardly like a boy perhaps i may be just as awkward now but you ought at any rate to believe me when you find that a year has not altered me  mary did not think him at all awkward and she did believe him but how was she to answer him she had not yet taught herself what answer she ought to make if he persisted in his suit she had hitherto been content to run away from him but she had done so because she would not submit to be accused of the indelicacy of putting herself in his way she had rebuked him when he first spoke of his love but she had done so because she looked on what he said as a boys nonsense she had schooled herself in obedience to the greshamsbury doctrines was there any real reason any reason founded on truth and honesty why she should not be a fitting wife to frank greshamfrancis newbold gresham of greshamsbury though he was or was to be  he was well bornas well born as any gentleman in england she was basely bornas basely born as any lady could be was this sufficient bar against such a match mary felt in her heart that some twelvemonth since before she knew what little she did now know of her own story she would have said it was so and would she indulge her own love by inveigling him she loved into a base marriage but then reason spoke again what after all was this blood of which she had taught herself to think so much would she have been more honest more fit to grace an honest mans hearthstone had she been the legitimate descendant of a score of legitimate duchesses was it not her first duty to think of himof what would make him happy then of her unclewhat he would approve then of herselfwhat would best become her modesty her sense of honour could it be well that she should sacrifice the happiness of two persons to a theoretic love of pure blood  so she had argued within herself not now sitting on the donkey with franks hand before her on the tame brutes neck but on other former occasions as she had ridden along demurely among those trees so she had argued but she had never brought her arguments to a decision all manner of thoughts crowded on her to prevent her doing so she would think of the squire and resolve to reject frank and would then remember lady arabella and resolve to accept him her resolutions however were most irresolute and so when frank appeared in person before her carrying his heart in his hand she did not know what answer to make to him thus it was with her as with so many other maidens similarly circumstanced at last she left it all to chance  you ought at any rate to believe me said frank when you find that a year has not altered me  a year should have taught you to be wiser said she you should have learnt by this time mr gresham that your lot and mine are not cast in the same mould that our stations in life are different would your father or mother approve of your even coming here to see me  mary as she spoke these sensible words felt that they were flat stale and unprofitable she felt also that they were not true in sense that they did not come from her heart that they were not such as frank deserved at her hands and she was ashamed of herself  my father i hope will approve of it said he that my mother should disapprove of it is a misfortune which i cannot help but on this point i will take no answer from my father or mother the question is one too personal to myself mary if you say that you will not or cannot return my love i will go awaynot from here only but from greshamsbury my presence shall not banish you from all that you hold dear if you can honestly say that i am nothing to you can be nothing to you i will then tell my mother that she may be at ease and i will go away somewhere and get over it as i may the poor fellow got so far looking apparently at the donkeys ears with hardly a gasp of hope in his voice and he so far carried mary with him that she also had hardly a gasp of hope in her heart there he paused for a moment and then looking up into her face he spoke but one word more but said heand there he stopped it was clearly told in that but thus would he do if mary would declare that she did not care for him if however she could not bring herself so to declare then was he ready to throw his father and mother to the winds then would he stand his ground then would he look all other difficulties in the face sure that they might finally be overcome poor mary the whole onus of settling the matter was thus thrown upon her she had only to say that he was indifferent to herthat was all  if all the blood of the howards had depended upon it she could not have brought herself to utter such a falsehood indifferent to her as he walked there by her donkeys side talking thus earnestly of his love for her was he not to her like some god come from the heavens to make her blessed did not the sun shine upon him with a halo so that he was bright as an angel indifferent to her could the open unadulterated truth have been practicable for her she would have declared her indifference in terms that would truly have astonished him as it was she found it easier to say nothing she bit her lips to keep herself from sobbing she struggled hard but in vain to prevent her hands and feet from trembling she seemed to swing upon her donkey as though like to fall and would have given much to be upon her own feet upon the sward  si la jeunesse savait    there is so much in that wicked old french proverb had frank known more about a womans mindhad he that is been fortytwo instead of twentytwohe would at once have been sure of his game and have felt that marys silence told him all he wished to know but then had he been fortytwo instead of twentytwo he would not have been so ready to risk the acres of greshamsbury for the smiles of mary thorne  if you cant say one word to comfort me i will go said he disconsolately i made up my mind to tell you this and so i came over i told lady scatcherd i should not staynot even for dinner  i did not know you were so hurried said she almost in a whisper  on a sudden he stood still and pulling the donkeys rein caused him to stand still also the beast required very little persuasion to be so guided and obligingly remained meekly passive  mary mary said frank throwing his arms round her knees as she sat upon her steed and pressing his face against her body mary you were always honest be honest now i love you with all my heart will you be my wife  but still mary said not a word she no longer bit her lips she was beyond that and was now using all her efforts to prevent her tears from falling absolutely on her lovers face she said nothing she could no more rebuke him now and send him from her than she could encourage him she could only sit there shaking and crying and wishing she was on the ground frank on the whole rather liked the donkey it enabled him to approach somewhat nearer to an embrace than he might have found practicable had they both been on their feet the donkey himself was quite at his ease and looked as though he was approvingly conscious of what was going on behind his ears  i have a right to a word mary say go and i will leave you at once  but mary did not say go perhaps she would have done so had she been able but just at present she could say nothing this came from her having failed to make up her mind in due time as to what course it would best become her to follow  one word mary one little word there if you will not speak here is my hand if you will have it let it lie in yoursif not push it away so saying he managed to get the end of his fingers on to her palm and there it remained unrepulsed la jeunesse was beginning to get a lesson experience when duly sought after sometimes comes early in life  in truth mary had not strength to push the fingers away my love my own my own said frank presuming on this very negative sign of acquiescence my life my own one my own mary and then the hand was caught hold of and was at his lips before an effort could be made to save it from such treatment  mary look at me say one word to me  there was a deep sigh and then came the one wordoh frank  mr gresham i hope i have the honour of seeing you quite well said a voice close to his ear i beg to say that you are welcome to boxall hill frank turned round and instantly found himself shaking hands with sir louis scatcherd  how mary got over her confusion frank never saw for he had enough to do to get over his own he involuntarily deserted mary and began talking very fast to sir louis sir louis did not once look at miss thorne but walked back towards the house with mr gresham sulky enough in temper but still making some effort to do the fine gentleman mary glad to be left alone merely occupied herself with sitting on the donkey and the donkey when he found that the two gentlemen went towards the house for companys sake and for his stables sake followed after them  frank stayed but three minutes in the house gave another kiss to lady scatcherd getting three in return and thereby infinitely disgusting sir louis shook hands anything but warmly with the young baronet and just felt the warmth of marys hand within his own he felt also the warmth of her eyes last glance and rode home a happy man     chapter xxx  post prandial   frank rode home a happy man cheering himself as successful lovers do cheer themselves with the brilliancy of his late exploit nor was it till he had turned the corner into the greshamsbury stables that he began to reflect what he would do next it was all very well to have induced mary to allow his three fingers to lie half a minute in her soft hand the having done so might certainly be sufficient evidence that he had overcome one of the lions in his path but it could hardly be said that all his difficulties were now smoothed how was he to make further progress  to mary also the same ideas no doubt occurredwith many others but then it was not for mary to make any progress in the matter to her at least belonged this passive comfort that at present no act hostile to the de courcy interest would be expected from her all that she could do would be to tell her uncle so much as it was fitting that he should know the doing this would doubtless be in some degree difficult but it was not probable that there would be much difference much of anything but loving anxiety for each other between her and dr thorne one other thing indeed she must do frank must be made to understand what her birth had been this she said to herself will give him an opportunity of retracting what he has done should he choose to avail himself of it it is well he should have such opportunity  but frank had more than this to do he had told beatrice that he would make no secret of his love and he fully resolved to be as good as his word to his father he owed an unreserved confidence and he was fully minded to give it it was he knew altogether out of the question that he should at once marry a portionless girl without his fathers consent probably out of the question that he should do so even with it but he would at any rate tell his father and then decide as to what should be done next so resolving he put his black horse into the stable and went in to dinner after dinner he and his father would be alone  yes after dinner he and his father would be alone he dressed himself hurriedly for the dinnerbell was almost on the stroke as he entered the house he said this to himself once and again but when the meats and the puddings and then the cheese were borne away as the decanters were placed before his father and lady arabella sipped her one glass of claret and his sisters ate their portion of strawberries his pressing anxiety for the coming interview began to wax somewhat dull  his mother and sisters however rendered him no assistance by prolonging their stay with unwonted assiduity he pressed a second glass of claret on his mother but lady arabella was not only temperate in her habits but also at the present moment very angry with her son she thought that he had been to boxall hill and was only waiting a proper moment to crossquestion him sternly on the subject now she departed taking her train of daughters with her  give me one big gooseberry said nina as she squeezed herself in under her brothers arm prior to making her retreat frank would willingly have given her a dozen of the biggest had she wanted them but having got the one she squeezed herself out again and scampered off  the squire was very cheery this evening from what cause cannot now be said perhaps he had succeeded in negotiating a further loan thus temporarily sprinkling a drop of water over the everrising dust of his difficulties  well frank what have you been after today peter told me you had the black horse out said he pushing the decanter to his son take my advice my boy and dont give him too much summer roadwork legs wont stand it let them be ever so good  why sir i was obliged to go out today and therefore it had to be either the old mare or the young horse  why didnt you take ramble now ramble was the squires own saddle hack used for farm surveying and occasionally for going to cover  i shouldnt think of doing that sir  my dear boy he is quite at your service for goodness sake do let me have a little wine frankquite at your service any riding i have now is after the haymakers and thats all on the grass  thankee sir well perhaps i will take a turn out of ramble should i want it  do and pray pray take care of that black horses legs hes turning out more of a horse than i took him to be and i should be sorry to see him injured where have you been today  well father i have something to tell you  something to tell me and then the squires happy and gay look which had been only rendered more happy and more gay by his assumed anxiety about the black horse gave place to that heaviness of visage which acrimony and misfortune had made so habitual to him something to tell me any grave words like these always presaged some money difficulty to the squires ears he loved frank with the tenderest love he would have done so under almost any circumstances but doubtless that love had been made more palpable to himself by the fact that frank had been a good son as regards moneynot exigeant as was lady arabella or selfishly reckless as was his nephew lord porlock but now frank must be in difficulty about money this was his first idea what is it frank you have seldom had anything to say that has not been pleasant for me to hear and then the heaviness of visage again gave way for a moment as his eye fell upon his son  i have been to boxall hill sir  the tenor of his fathers thoughts was changed in an instant and the dread of immediate temporary annoyance gave place to true anxiety for his son he the squire had been no party to marys exile from his own domain and he had seen with pain that she had now a second time been driven from her home but he had never hitherto questioned the expediency of separating his son from mary thorne alas it became too necessarytoo necessary through his own defaultthat frank should marry money  at boxall hill frank has that been prudent or indeed has it been generous to miss thorne who has been driven there as it were by your imprudence  father it is well that we should understand each other about this  fill your glass frank frank mechanically did as he was told and passed the bottle  i should never forgive myself were i to deceive you or keep anything from you  i believe it is not in your nature to deceive me frank  the fact is sir that i have made up my mind that mary thorne shall be my wifesooner or later that is unless of course she should utterly refuse hitherto she has utterly refused me i believe i may now say that she has accepted me  the squire sipped his claret but at the moment said nothing there was a quiet manly but yet modest determination about his son that he had hardly noticed before frank had become legally of age legally a man when he was twentyone nature it seems had postponed the ceremony till he was twentytwo nature often does postpone the ceremony even to a much later agesometimes altogether forgets to accomplish it  the squire continued to sip his claret he had to think over the matter a while before he could answer a statement so deliberately made by his son  i think i may say so continued frank with perhaps unnecessary modesty she is so honest that had she not intended it she would have said so honestly am i right father in thinking that as regards mary personally you would not reject her as a daughterinlaw  personally said the squire glad to have the subject presented to him in a view that enabled him to speak out oh no personally i should not object to her for i love her dearly she is a good girl i do believe she is a good girl in every respect i have always liked her liked to see her about the house but  i know what you would say father this was rather more than the squire knew himself such a marriage is imprudent  it is more than that frank i fear it is impossible  impossible no father it is not impossible  it is impossible frank in the usual sense what are you to live upon what would you do with your children you would not wish to see your wife distressed and comfortless  no i should not like to see that  you would not wish to begin life as an embarrassed man and end it as a ruined man if you were now to marry miss thorne such would i fear doubtless be your lot  frank caught at the word now i dont expect to marry immediately i know that would be imprudent but i am pledged father and i certainly cannot go back and now that i have told you all this what is your advice to me  the father again sat silent still sipping his wine there was nothing in his son that he could be ashamed of nothing that he could meet with anger nothing that he could not love but how should he answer him the fact was that the son had more in him than the father this his mind and spirit were of a calibre not to be opposed successfully by the mind and spirit of the squire  do you know marys history said mr gresham at last the history of her birth  not a word of it said frank i did not know she had a history  nor does she know it at least i presume not but you should know it now and frank i will tell it you not to turn you from hernot with that object though i think that to a certain extent it should have that effect marys birth was not such as would become your wife and be beneficial to your children  if so father i should have known that sooner why was she brought in here among us  true frank the fault is mine mine and your mothers circumstances brought it about years ago when it never occurred to us that all this would arise but i will tell you her history and frank remember this though i tell it you as a secret a secret to be kept from all the world but one you are quite at liberty to let the doctor know that i have told you indeed i shall be careful to let him know myself should it ever be necessary that he and i should speak together as to this engagement the squire then told his son the whole story of marys birth as it is known to the reader  frank sat silent looking very blank he also had as had every gresham a great love for his pure blood he had said to his mother that he hated money that he hated the estate but he would have been very slow to say even in his warmest opposition to her that he hated the roll of the family pedigree he loved it dearly though he seldom spoke of itas men of good family seldom do speak of it it is one of those possessions which to have is sufficient a man having it need not boast of what he has or show it off before the world but on that account he values it more he had regarded mary as a cutting duly taken from the ullathorne tree not indeed as a grafting branch full of flower just separated from the parent stalk but as being not a whit the less truly endowed with the pure sap of that venerable trunk when therefore he heard her true history he sat awhile dismayed  it is a sad story said the father  yes sad enough said frank rising from his chair and standing with it before him leaning on the back of it poor mary poor mary she will have to learn it some day  i fear so frank and then there was again a few moments silence  to me father it is told too late it can now have no effect on me indeed said he sighing as he spoke but still relieving himself by the very sigh it could have had no effect had i learned it ever so soon  i should have told you before said the father certainly i ought to have done so  it would have been no good said frank ah sir tell me this who were miss dunstables parents what was that fellow moffats family  this was perhaps cruel of frank the squire however made no answer to the question i have thought it right to tell you said he i leave all commentary to yourself i need not tell you what your mother will think  what did she think of miss dunstables birth said he again more bitterly than before no sir he continued after a further pause all that can make no change none at any rate now it cant make my love less even if it could have prevented it nor even could it do sowhich it cant least not in the leastbut could it do so it could not break my engagement i am now engaged to mary thorne  and then he again repeated his question asking for his fathers advice under the present circumstances the conversation was a very long one as long as to disarrange all lady arabellas plans she had determined to take her son most stringently to task that very evening and with this object had ensconced herself in the small drawingroom which had formerly been used for a similar purpose by the august countess herself here she now sat having desired augusta and beatrice as well as the twins to beg frank to go to her as soon as he should come out of the diningroom poor lady there she waited till ten oclocktealess there was not much of the bluebeard about the squire but he had succeeded in making it understood through the household that he was not to be interrupted by messages from his wife during the postprandial hour which though no toper he loved so well  as a period of twelve months will now have to be passed over the upshot of this long conversation must be told in as few words as possible the father found it impracticable to talk his son out of his intended marriage indeed he hardly attempted to do so by any direct persuasion he explained to him that it was impossible that he should marry at once and suggested that he frank was very young  you married sir before you were oneandtwenty said frank yes and repented before i was twoandtwenty so did not say the squire  he suggested that mary should have time to ascertain what would be her uncles wishes and ended by inducing frank to promise that after taking his degree in october he would go abroad for some months and that he would not indeed return to greshamsbury till he was threeandtwenty  he may perhaps forget her said the father to himself as this agreement was made between them  he thinks that i shall forget her said frank to himself at the same time but he does not know me  when lady arabella at last got hold of her son she found that the time for her preaching was utterly gone by he told her almost with sangfroid what his plans were and when she came to understand them and to understand also what had taken place at boxall hill she could not blame the squire for what he had done she also said to herself more confidently than the squire had done that frank would quite forget mary before the year was out lord buckish said she to herself rejoicingly is now with the ambassador at parislord buckish was her nephewand with him frank will meet women that are really beautifulwomen of fashion when with lord buckish he will soon forget mary thorne  but not on this account did she change her resolve to follow up to the furthest point her hostility to the thornes she was fully enabled now to do so for dr fillgrave was already reinstalled at greshamsbury as her medical adviser  one other short visit did frank pay to boxall hill and one interview had he with dr thorne mary told him all she knew of her own sad history and was answered only by a kissa kiss absolutely not in any way by her to be avoided the first the only one that had ever yet reached her lips from his and then he went away  the doctor told him all the story yes said frank i knew it all before dear mary dearest mary dont you doctor teach yourself to believe that i shall forget her and then also he went his way from himwent his way also from greshamsbury and was absent for the full period of his allotted banishmenttwelve months namely and a day     chapter xxxi  the small end of the wedge   frank gresham was absent from greshamsbury twelve months and a day a day is always added to the period of such absences as shown in the history of lord bateman and other noble heroes we need not detail all the circumstances of his banishment all the details of the compact that was made one detail of course was this that there should be no corresponding a point to which the squire found some difficulty in bringing his son to assent  it must not be supposed that mary thorne or the doctor were in any way parties to or privy to these agreements by no means the agreements were drawn out and made and signed and sealed at greshamsbury and were known of nowhere else the reader must not imagine that lady arabella was prepared to give up her son if only his love could remain constant for one year neither did lady arabella consent to any such arrangement nor did the squire it was settled rather in this wise that frank should be subjected to no torturing process pestered to give no promises should in no way be bullied about marythat is not at presentif he would go away for a year then at the end of the year the matter should again be discussed agreeing to this frank took his departure and was absent as per agreement  what were marys fortunes immediately after his departure must be shortly told and then we will again join some of our greshamsbury friends at a period about a month before franks return  when sir louis saw frank gresham standing by marys donkey with his arms round marys knees he began to fear that there must be something in it he had intended that very day to throw himself at marys feet and now it appeared to his inexperienced eyes as though somebody else had been at the same work before him this not unnaturally made him cross so after having sullenly wished the visitor goodbye he betook himself to his room and there drank curaçoa alone instead of coming down to dinner  this he did for two or three days and then taking heart of grace he remembered that after all he had very many advantages over young gresham in the first place he was a baronet and could make his wife a lady in the next place franks father was alive and like to live whereas his own was dead he possessed boxall hill in his own right but his rival had neither house nor land of his own after all might it not be possible for him also to put his arm round marys kneesher knees or her waist or perhaps even her neck faint heart never won fair lady at any rate he would try  and he did try with what result as regards mary need hardly be told he certainly did not get nearly so far as putting his hand even upon her knee before he was made to understand that it was no go as he graphically described it to his mother he tried once and again on the first time mary was very civil though very determined on the second she was more determined though less civil and then she told him that if he pressed her further he would drive her from his mothers house there was something then about marys eye a fixed composure round her mouth and an authority in her face which went far to quell him and he did not press her again  he immediately left boxall hill and returning to london had more violent recourse to the curaçoa it was not long before the doctor heard of him and was obliged to follow him and then again occurred those frightful scenes in which the poor wretch had to expiate either in terrible delirium or more terrible prostration of spirits the vile sin which his father had so early taught him  then mary returned to her uncles home frank was gone and she therefore could resume her place at greshamsbury yes she came back to greshamsbury but greshamsbury was by no means the same place that it was formerly almost all intercourse was now over between the doctor and the greshamsbury people he rarely ever saw the squire and then only on business not that the squire had purposely quarrelled with him but dr thorne himself had chosen that it should be so since frank had openly proposed for his niece frank was now gone and lady arabella was in arms against him it should not be said that he kept up any intimacy for the sake of aiding the lovers in their love no one should rightfully accuse him of inveigling the heir to marry his niece  mary therefore found herself utterly separated from beatrice she was not even able to learn what beatrice would think or did think of the engagement as it now stood she could not even explain to her friend that love had been too strong for her and endeavour to get some comfort from that friends absolution from her sin this estrangement was now carried so far that she and beatrice did not even meet on neutral ground lady arabella made it known to miss oriel that her daughter could not meet mary thorne even as strangers meet and it was made known to others also mrs yates umbleby and her dear friend miss gushing to whose charming teaparties none of the greshamsbury ladies went above once in a twelvemonth talked through the parish of this distressing difficulty they would have been so happy to have asked dear mary thorne only the greshamsbury ladies did not approve  mary was thus tabooed from all society in the place in which a twelvemonth since she had been of all its denizens perhaps the most courted in those days no bevy of greshamsbury young ladies had fairly represented the greshamsbury young ladyhood if mary thorne was not there now she was excluded from all such bevies patience did not quarrel with her certainlycame to see her frequentlyinvited her to walkinvited her frequently to the parsonage but mary was shy of acceding to such invitations and at last frankly told her friend patience that she would not again break bread in greshamsbury in any house in which she was not thought fit to meet the other guests who habitually resorted there  in truth both the doctor and his niece were very sore but they were of that temperament that keeps all its soreness to itself mary walked out by herself boldly looking at least as though she were indifferent to all the world she was indeed hardly treated young ladies engagements are generally matters of profoundest secrecy and are hardly known of by their near friends till marriage is a thing settled but all the world knew of marys engagement within a month of that day on which she had neglected to expel franks finger from her hand it had been told openly through the countryside that she had confessed her love for the young squire now it is disagreeable for a young lady to walk about under such circumstances especially so when she has no female friend to keep her in countenance more especially so when the gentleman is such importance in the neighbourhood as frank was in that locality it was a matter of moment to every farmer and every farmers wife which bride frank should marry of those bespoken for him mary namely or money every yokel about the place had been made to understand that by some feminine sleight of hand the doctors niece had managed to trap master frank and that master frank had been sent out of the way so that he might if yet possible break through the trapping all this made life rather unpleasant for her  one day walking solitary in the lanes she met that sturdy farmer to whose daughter she had in former days been so serviceable god bless ee miss mary said hehe always did bid god bless her when he saw her and miss mary to say my mind out freely thee be quite gude enough for un quite gude enough so thee best thof he were ten squoires there may perhaps have been something pleasant in the heartiness of this but it was not pleasant to have this heart affair of hers thus publicly scanned and talked over to have it known to every one that she had set her heart on marrying frank gresham and that all the greshams had set their hearts on preventing it and yet she could in nowise help it no girl could have been more staid and demure less demonstrative and boastful about her love she had never yet spoken freely out of her full heart to one human being oh frank all her spoken sin had been contained in that  but lady arabella had been very active it suited her better that it should be known far and wide that a nameless pauperlady arabella only surmised that her foe was nameless but she did not scruple to declare itwas intriguing to catch the heir of greshamsbury none of the greshams must meet mary thorne that was the edict sent about the country and the edict was well understood those therefore were bad days for miss thorne  she had never yet spoken on the matter freely out of her full heart to one human being not to one not to him not to her uncle no not even to him fully and freely she had told him that that had passed between frank and her which amounted at any rate on his part to a proposal  well dearest and what was your answer said her uncle drawing her close to him and speaking in his kindest voice  i hardly made any answer uncle  you did not reject him mary  no uncle and then she pausedhe had never known her tremble as she now trembled but if you say that i ought i will she added drawing every word from herself with difficulty  i say you ought mary nay but this question you must answer yourself  must i said she plaintively and then she sat for the next half hour with her head against his shoulder but nothing more was said about it they both acquiesced in the sentence that had been pronounced against them and went on together more lovingly than before  the doctor was quite as weak as his niece nay weaker she hesitated fearfully as to what she ought to do whether she should obey her heart or the dictates of greshamsbury but he had other doubts than hers which nearly set him wild when he strove to bring his mind to a decision he himself was now in possessionof course as a trustee onlyof the titledeeds of the estate more of the estate much more belonged to the heirs under sir roger scatcherds will than to the squire it was now more than probable that that heir must be mary thorne his conviction became stronger and stronger that no human efforts would keep sir louis in the land of the living till he was twentyfive could he therefore wisely or honestly in true friendship to the squire to frank or to his niece take any steps to separate two persons who loved each other and whose marriage would in all human probability be so suitable  and yet he could not bring himself to encourage it then the idea of looking after dead mens shoes was abhorrent to his mind especially when the man whose death he contemplated had been so trusted to him as had been sir louis scatcherd he could not speak of the event even to the squire as being possible so he kept his peace from day to day and gave no counsel to mary in the matter  and then he had his own individual annoyances and very aggravating annoyances they were the carriageor rather postchaiseof dr fillgrave was now frequent in greshamsbury passing him constantly in the street among the lanes and on the high roads it seemed as though dr fillgrave could never get to his patients at the big house without showing himself to his beaten rival either on his way thither or on his return this alone would perhaps not have hurt the doctor much but it did hurt him to know that dr fillgrave was attending the squire for a little incipient gout and that dear nina was in measles under those unloving hands  and then also the oldfashioned phaeton of oldfashioned old dr century was seen to rumble up to the big house and it became known that lady arabella was not very well not very well when pronounced in a low grave voice about lady arabella always meant something serious and in this case something serious was meant lady arabella was not only ill but frightened it appeared even to her that dr fillgrave himself hardly knew what he was about that he was not so sure in his opinion so confident in himself as dr thorne used to be how should he be seeing that dr thorne had medically had lady arabella in his hands for the last ten years  if sitting with dignity in his hired carriage and stepping with authority up the big front steps would have done anything dr fillgrave might have done much lady arabella was greatly taken with his looks when he first came to her and it was only when she by degrees perceived that the symptoms which she knew so well did not yield to him that she began to doubt those looks  after a while dr fillgrave himself suggested dr century not that i fear anything lady arabella said helying hugely for he did fear fear both for himself and for her but dr century has great experience and in such a matter when the interests are so important one cannot be too safe  so dr century came and toddled slowly into her ladyships room he did not say much he left the talking to his learned brother who certainly was able to do that part of the business but dr century though he said very little looked very grave and by no means quieted lady arabellas mind she as she saw the two putting their heads together already had misgivings that she had done wrong she knew that she could not be safe without dr thorne at her bedside and she already felt that she had exercised a most injudicious courage in driving him away  well doctor said she as soon as dr century had toddled downstairs to see the squire  oh we shall be all right lady arabella all right very soon but we must be careful very careful i am glad ive had century here very but theres nothing to alter little or nothing  there were but few words spoken between dr century and the squire but few as they were they frightened mr gresham when dr fillgrave came down the grand stairs a servant waited at the bottom to ask him also to go to the squire now there never had been much cordiality between the squire and dr fillgrave though mr gresham had consented to take a preventative pill from his hands and the little man therefore swelled himself out somewhat more than ordinarily as he followed the servant  dr fillgrave said the squire at once beginning the conversation lady arabella is i fear in danger  well no i hope not in danger mr gresham i certainly believe i may be justified in expressing a hope that she is not in danger her state is no doubt rather seriousrather seriousas dr century has probably told you and dr fillgrave made a bow to the old man who sat quiet in one of the diningroom armchairs  well doctor said the squire i have not any grounds on which to doubt your judgement  dr fillgrave bowed but with the stiffest slightest inclination which a head could possibly make he rather thought that mr gresham had no ground for doubting his judgement  nor do i  the doctor bowed and a little a very little less stiffly  but doctor i think that something ought to be done  the doctor this time did his bowing merely with his eyes and mouth the former he closed for a moment the latter he pressed and then decorously rubbed his hands one over the other  i am afraid dr fillgrave that you and my friend thorne are not the best friends in the world  no mr gresham no i may go so far as to say we are not  well i am sorry for it  perhaps mr gresham we need hardly discuss it but there have been circumstances  i am not going to discuss anything dr fillgrave i say i am sorry for it because i believe that prudence will imperatively require lady arabella to have doctor thorne back again now if you would not object to meet him  mr gresham i beg pardon i beg pardon indeed but you must really excuse me doctor thorne has in my estimation  but doctor fillgrave  mr gresham you really must excuse me you really must indeed anything else that i could do for lady arabella i should be most happy to do but after what has passed i cannot meet doctor thorne i really cannot you must not ask me to do so mr gresham and mr gresham continued the doctor i did understand from lady arabella that histhat is dr thornesconduct to her ladyship had been suchso very outrageous i may say thatthatthatof course mr gresham you know best but i did think that lady arabella herself was quite unwilling to see doctor thorne again and dr fillgrave looked very big and very dignified and very exclusive  the squire did not ask again he had no warrant for supposing that lady arabella would receive dr thorne if he did come and he saw that it was useless to attempt to overcome the rancour of a man so pigheaded as the little galen now before him other propositions were then broached and it was at last decided that assistance should be sought for from london in the person of the great sir omicron pie  sir omicron came and drs fillgrave and century were there to meet him when they all assembled in lady arabellas room the poor womans heart almost sank within heras well it might at such a sight if she could only reconcile it with her honour her consistency with her high de courcy principles to send once more for dr thorne oh frank frank to what misery your disobedience brought your mother  sir omicron and the lesser provincial lights had their consultation and the lesser lights went their way to barchester and silverbridge leaving sir omicron to enjoy the hospitality of greshamsbury  you should have thorne back here mr gresham said sir omicron almost in a whisper when they were quite alone doctor fillgrave is a very good man and so is dr century very good i am sure but thorne has known her ladyship so long and then on the following morning sir omicron also went his way  and then there was a scene between the squire and her ladyship lady arabella had given herself credit for great good generalship when she found that the squire had been induced to take that pill we have all heard of the little end of the wedge and we have most of us an idea that the little end is the difficulty that pill had been the little end of lady arabellas wedge up to that period she had been struggling in vain to make a severance between her husband and her enemy that pill should do the business she well knew how to make the most of it to have it published in greshamsbury that the squire had put his gouty toe into dr fillgraves hands how to let it be knownespecially at that humble house in the corner of the streetthat fillgraves prescriptions now ran current through the whole establishment dr thorne did hear of it and did suffer he had been a true friend to the squire and he thought the squire should have stood to him more staunchly  after all said he himself perhaps its as wellperhaps it will be best that i should leave this place altogether and then he thought of sir roger and his will and of mary and her lover and then of marys birth and of his own theoretical doctrines as to pure blood and so his troubles multiplied and he saw no present daylight through them  such had been the way in which lady arabella had got in the little end of the wedge and she would have triumphed joyfully had not her increased doubts and fears as to herself then come in to check her triumph and destroy her joy she had not yet confessed to any one her secret regret for the friend she had driven away she hardly yet acknowledged to herself that she did regret him but she was uneasy frightened and in low spirits  my dear said the squire sitting down by her bedside i want to tell you what sir omicron said as he went away  well said her ladyship sitting up and looking frightened  i dont know how you may take it bell but i think it very good news the squire never called his wife bell except when he wanted her to be on particularly good terms with him  well said she again she was not overanxious to be gracious and did not reciprocate his familiarity  sir omicron says that you should have thorne back again and upon my honour i cannot but agree with him now thorne is a clever man a very clever man nobody denies that and then you know  why did not sir omicron say that to me said her ladyship sharply all her disposition in dr thornes favour becoming wonderfully damped by her husbands advocacy  i suppose he thought it better to say it to me said the squire rather curtly  he should have spoken to myself said lady arabella who though she did not absolutely doubt her husbands word gave him credit for having induced and led on sir omicron to the uttering of this opinion doctor thorne has behaved to me in so gross so indecent a manner and then as i understand he is absolutely encouraging that girl  now bell you are quite wrong  of course i am i always am quite wrong  quite wrong in mixing up two things doctor thorne as an acquaintance and dr thorne as a doctor  it is dreadful to have him here even standing in the room with me how can one talk to ones doctor openly and confidentially when one looks upon him as ones worst enemy and lady arabella softening almost melted into tears  my dear you cannot wonder that i should be anxious for you  lady arabella gave a little snuffle which might be taken as a not very eloquent expression of thanks for the squires solicitude or as an ironical jeer at his want of sincerity  and therefore i have not lost a moment in telling you what sir omicron said you should have thorne back here those were his very words you can think it over my dear and remember this bell if he is to do any good no time should be lost  and then the squire left the room and lady arabella remained alone perplexed by many doubts     chapter xxxii  mr oriel   i must now shortlyas shortly as it is in my power to do itintroduce a new character to my reader mention has been made of the rectory of greshamsbury but hitherto no opportunity has offered itself for the rev caleb oriel to come upon the boards  mr oriel was a man of family and fortune who having gone to oxford with the usual views of such men had become inoculated there with very highchurch principles and had gone into orders influenced by a feeling of enthusiastic love for the priesthood he was by no means an asceticsuch men indeed seldom arenor was he a devotee he was a man well able and certainly willing to do the work of a parish clergyman and when he became one he was efficacious in his profession but it may perhaps be said of him without speaking slanderously that his original calling as a young man was rather to the outward and visible signs of religion than to its inward and spiritual graces  he delighted in lecterns and credencetables in services at dark hours of winter mornings when no one would attend in high waistcoats and narrow white neckties in chanted services and intoned prayers and in all the paraphernalia of anglican formalities which have given such offence to those of our brethren who live in daily fear of the scarlet lady many of his friends declared that mr oriel would sooner or later deliver himself over body and soul to that lady but there was no need to fear for him for though sufficiently enthusiastic to get out of bed at five am on winter morningshe did so at least all through his first winter at greshamsburyhe was not made of that stuff which is necessary for a staunch burning selfdenying convert it was not in him to change his very sleek black coat for a capuchins filthy cassock nor his pleasant parsonage for some dirty hole in rome and it was better so both for him and others there are but few very few to whom it is given to be a huss a wickliffe or a luther and a man gains but little by being a false huss or a false lutherand his neighbours gain less  but certain lengths in selfprivation mr oriel did go at any rate for some time he eschewed matrimony imagining that it became him as a priest to do so he fasted rigorously on fridays and the neighbours declared that he scourged himself  mr oriel was as it has been said a man of fortune that is to say when he came of age he was master of thirty thousand pounds when he took it into his head to go into the church his friends bought for him the next presentation to the living at greshamsbury and a year after his ordination the living falling in mr oriel brought himself and his sister to the rectory  mr oriel soon became popular he was a darkhaired goodlooking man of polished manners agreeable in society not given to monkish austeritiesexcept in the matter of fridaysnor yet to the lowchurch severity of demeanour he was thoroughly a gentleman goodhumoured inoffensive and sociable but he had one fault he was not a marrying man  on this ground there was a feeling against him so strong as almost at one time to throw him into serious danger it was not only that he should be sworn against matrimony in his individual selfhe whom fate had made so able to sustain the weight of a wife and family but what an example he was setting if other clergymen all around should declare against wives and families what was to become of the country what was to be done in the rural districts the religious observances as regards women of a brigham young were hardly so bad as this  there were around greshamsbury very many unmarried ladiesi believe there generally are so round most such villages from the great house he did not receive much annoyance beatrice was then only just on the verge of being brought out and was not perhaps inclined to think very much of a young clergyman and augusta certainly intended to fly at higher game but there were the miss athelings the daughters of a neighbouring clergyman who were ready to go all lengths with him in highchurch matters except as that one tremendously papal step of celibacy and the two miss hesterwells of hesterwell park the younger of whom boldly declared her purpose of civilising the savage and mrs opie green a very pretty widow with a very pretty jointure who lived in a very pretty house about a mile from greshamsbury and who declared her opinion that mr oriel was quite right in his view of a clergymans position how could a woman situated as she was have the comfort of a clergymans attention if he were to be regarded just as any other man she could now know in what light to regard mr oriel and would be able without scruple to avail herself of his zeal so she did avail herself of his zealand that without any scruple  and then there was miss gushinga young thing miss gushing had a great advantage over the other competitors for the civilisation of mr oriel namely in thisthat she was able to attend his morning services if mr oriel was to be reached in any way it was probable that he might be reached in this way if anything could civilise him this would do it therefore the young thing through all one long tedious winter tore herself from her warm bed and was to be seenno not seen but heardentering mr oriels church at six oclock with indefatigable assiduity the responses were made uttered from under a close bonnet and out of a dark corner in an enthusiastically feminine voice through the whole winter  nor did miss gushing altogether fail in her object when a clergymans daily audience consists of but one person and that person is a young lady it is hardly possible that he should not become personally intimate with her hardly possible that he should not be in some measure grateful miss gushings responses came from her with such fervour and she begged for ghostly advice with such eager longing to have her scruples satisfied that mr oriel had nothing for it but to give way to a certain amount of civilisation  by degrees it came to pass that miss gushing could never get her final prayer said her shawl and boa adjusted and stow away her nice new prayerbook with the red letters inside and the cross on the back till mr oriel had been into his vestry and got rid of his surplice and then they met at the churchporch and naturally walked together till mr oriels cruel gateway separated them the young thing did sometimes think that as the parsons civilisation progressed he might have taken the trouble to walk with her as far as mr yates umblebys hall door but she had hope to sustain her and a firm resolve to merit success even though she might not attain it  is it not ten thousand pities she once said to him that none here should avail themselves of the inestimable privilege which your coming has conferred upon us oh mr oriel i do so wonder at it to me it is so delightful the morning service in the dark church is so beautiful so touching  i suppose they think it is a bore getting up so early said mr oriel  ah a bore said miss gushing in an enthusiastic tone of depreciation how insensate they must be to me it gives a new charm to life it quiets one for the day makes one so much fitter for ones daily trials and daily troubles does it not mr oriel  i look upon morning prayer as an imperative duty certainly  oh certainly a most imperative duty but so delicious at the same time i spoke to mrs umbleby about it but she said she could not leave the children  no i dare say not said mr oriel  and mr umbleby said his business kept him up so late at night  very probably i hardly expect the attendance of men of business  but the servants might come mightnt they mr oriel  i fear that servants seldom can have time for daily prayers in church  oh ah no perhaps not and then miss gushing began to bethink herself of whom should be composed the congregation which it must be presumed that mr oriel wished to see around him but on this matter he did not enlighten her  then miss gushing took to fasting on fridays and made some futile attempts to induce her priest to give her the comfort of confessional absolution but unfortunately the zeal of the master waxed cool as that of the pupil waxed hot and at last when the young thing returned to greshamsbury from an autumn excursion which she had made with mrs umbleby to westonsupermare she found that the delicious morning services had died a natural death miss gushing did not on that account give up the game but she was bound to fight with no particular advantage in her favour  miss oriel though a good churchwoman was by no means a convert to her brothers extremist views and perhaps gave but scanty credit to the gushings athelings and opie greens for the sincerity of their religion but nevertheless she and her brother were staunch friends and she still hoped to see the day when he might be induced to think that an english parson might get through his parish work with the assistance of a wife better than he could do without such feminine encumbrance the girl whom she selected for his bride was not the young thing but beatrice gresham  and at last it seemed probable to mr oriels nearest friends that he was in a fair way to be overcome not that he had begun to make love to beatrice or committed himself by the utterance of any opinion as to the propriety of clerical marriages but he daily became looser about his peculiar tenets raved less immoderately than heretofore as to the atrocity of the greshamsbury church pews and was observed to take some opportunities of conversing alone with beatrice beatrice had always denied the imputationthis had usually been made by mary in their happy dayswith vehement asseverations of anger and miss gushing had tittered and expressed herself as supposing that great peoples daughters might be as barefaced as they pleased  all this had happened previous to the great greshamsbury feud mr oriel gradually got himself into a way of sauntering up to the great house sauntering into the drawingroom for the purpose as i am sure he thought of talking to lady arabella and then of sauntering home again having usually found an opportunity for saying a few words to beatrice during the visit this went on all through the feud up to the period of lady arabellas illness and then one morning about a month before the date fixed for franks return mr oriel found himself engaged to miss beatrice gresham  from the day that miss gushing heard of itwhich was not however for some considerable time after thisshe became an independent methodist she could no longer she said at first have any faith in any religion and for an hour or so she was almost tempted to swear that she could no longer have any faith in any man she had nearly completed a worked cover for a credencetable when the news reached her as to which in the young enthusiasm of her heart she had not been able to remain silent it had already been promised to mr oriel that promise she swore should not be kept he was an apostate she said from his principles an utter pervert a false designing man with whom she would never have trusted herself alone on dark mornings had she known that he had such grovelling worldly inclinations so miss gushing became an independent methodist the credencetable covering was cut up into slippers for the preachers feet and the young thing herself more happy in this direction than she had been in the other became the arbiter of that preachers domestic happiness  but this little history of miss gushings future life is premature mr oriel became engaged demurely nay almost silently to beatrice and no one out of their own immediate families was at the time informed of the matter it was arranged very differently from those two other matchesembryo or not embryo those namely of augusta with mr moffat and frank with mary thorne all barsetshire had heard of them but that of beatrice and mr oriel was managed in a much more private manner  i do think you are a happy girl said patience to her one morning  indeed i am  he is so good you dont know how good he is as yet he never thinks of himself and thinks so much of those he loves  beatrice took her friends hand in her own and kissed it she was full of joy when a girl is about to be married when she may lawfully talk of her love there is no music in her ears so sweet as the praises of her lover  i made up my mind from the first that he should marry you  nonsense patience  i did indeed i made up my mind that he should marry and there were only two to choose from  me and miss gushing said beatrice laughing  no not exactly miss gushing i had not many fears for caleb there  i declare shes very pretty said beatrice who could afford to be goodnatured now miss gushing certainly was pretty and would have been very pretty had her nose not turned up so much and could she have parted her hair in the centre  well i am very glad you chose meif it was you who chose said beatrice modestly having however in her own mind a strong opinion that mr oriel had chosen for himself and had never had any doubt in the matter and who was the other  cant you guess  i wont guess any more perhaps mrs green  oh no certainly not a widow i dont like widows marrying but of course you could guess if you would of course it was mary thorne but i soon saw mary would not do for two reasons caleb would never have liked her well enough nor would she ever have liked him  not like him oh i hope she will i do so love mary thorne  so do i dearly and so does caleb but he could never have loved her as he loves you  but patience have you told mary  no i have told no one and shall not without your leave  ah you must tell her tell it her with my best and kindest warmest love tell her how happy i am and how i long to talk to her tell that i will have her for my bridesmaid oh i do hope that before that all this horrid quarrel will be settled  patience undertook the commission and did tell mary did give her also the message which beatrice had sent and mary was rejoiced to hear it for though as patience had said of her she had never herself felt any inclination to fall in love with mr oriel she believed him to be one in whose hands her friends happiness would be secure then by degrees the conversation changed from the loves of mr oriel and beatrice to the troubles of frank gresham and herself  she says that let what will happen you shall be one of her bridesmaids  ah yes dear trichy that was settled between us in auld lang syne but those settlements are all unsettled now must all be broken no i cannot be her bridesmaid but i shall yet hope to see her once before her marriage  and why not be her bridesmaid lady arabella will hardly object to that  lady arabella said mary curling her lip with deep scorn i do not care that for lady arabella and she let her silver thimble fall from her fingers on to the table if beatrice invited me to her wedding she might manage as to that i should ask no question as to lady arabella  then why not come to it  she remained silent for a while and then boldly answered though i do not care for lady arabella i do care for mr greshamand i do care for his son  but the squire always loved you  yes and therefore i will not be there to vex his sight i will tell you the truth patience i can never be in that house again till frank gresham is a married man or till i am about to be a married woman i do not think they have treated me well but i will not treat them ill  i am sure you will not do that said miss oriel  i will endeavour not to do so and therefore will go to none of their fêtes no patience and then she turned her head to the arm of the sofa and silently without audible sobs hiding her face she endeavoured to get rid of her tears unseen for one moment she had all but resolved to pour out the whole truth of her love into her friends ears but suddenly she changed her mind why should she talk of her own unhappiness why should she speak of her own love when she was fully determined not to speak of franks promises  mary dear mary  anything but pity patience anything but that said she convulsively swallowing down her sobs and rubbing away her tears i cannot bear that tell beatrice from me that i wish her every happiness and with such a husband i am sure she will be happy i wish her every joy give her my kindest love but tell her i cannot be at her marriage oh i should so like to see her not there you know but here in my own room where i still have liberty to speak  but why should you decide now she is not to be married yet you know  now or this day twelvemonth can make no difference i will not go into that house again unlessbut never mind i will not go into it all never never again if i could forgive her for myself i could not forgive her for my uncle but tell me patience might not beatrice now come here it is so dreadful to see her every sunday in church and never to speak to her never to kiss her she seems to look away from me as though she too had chosen to quarrel with me  miss oriel promised to do her best she could not imagine she said that such a visit could be objected to on such an occasion she would not advise beatrice to come without telling her mother but she could not think that lady arabella would be so cruel as to make any objection knowing as she could not but know that her daughter when married would be at liberty to choose her own friends  goodbye mary said patience i wish i knew how to say more to comfort you  oh comfort i dont want comfort i want to be let alone  thats just it you are so ferocious in your scorn so unbending so determined to take all the punishment that comes in your way  what i do take ill take without complaint said mary and then they kissed each other and parted     chapter xxxiii  a morning visit   it must be remembered that mary among her miseries had to suffer this that since franks departure now nearly twelve months ago she had not heard a word about him or rather she had only heard that he was very much in love with some lady in london this news reached her in a manner so circuitous and from such a doubtful source it seemed to her to savour so strongly of lady arabellas precautions that she attributed it at once to malice and blew it to the winds it might not improbably be the case that frank was untrue to her but she would not take it for granted because she was now told so it was more than probable that he should amuse himself with some one flirting was his prevailing sin and if he did flirt the most would of course be made of it  but she found it to be very desolate to be thus left alone without a word of comfort or a word of love without being able to speak to any one of what filled her heart doubting nay more than doubting being all but sure that her passion must terminate in misery why had she not obeyed her conscience and her better instinct in that moment when the necessity for deciding had come upon her why had she allowed him to understand that he was master of her heart did she not know that there was everything against such a marriage as that which he proposed had she not done wrong very wrong even to think of it had she not sinned deeply against mr gresham who had ever been so kind to her could she hope was it possible that a boy like frank should be true to his first love and if he were true if he were ready to go to the altar with her tomorrow ought she to allow him to degrade himself by such a marriage  there was alas some truth about the london lady frank had taken his degree as arranged and had then gone abroad for the winter doing the fashionable things going up the nile crossing over to mount sinai thence over the long desert to jerusalem and home by damascus beyrout and constantinople bringing back a long beard a red cap and a chibook just as our fathers used to go through italy and switzerland and our grandfathers to spend a season in paris he had then remained for a couple of months in london going through all the society which the de courcys were able to open to him and it was true that a certain belle of the season of that season and some others had been captivatedfor the tenth timeby the silken sheen of his long beard frank had probably been more demonstrative perhaps even more susceptible than he should have been and hence the rumour which had all too willingly been forwarded to greshamsbury  but young gresham had also met another lady in london namely miss dunstable mary would indeed have been grateful to miss dunstable could she have known all that lady did for her franks love was never allowed to flag when he spoke of the difficulties in his way she twitted him by being overcome by straws and told him that no one was worth having who was afraid of every lion that he met in his path when he spoke of money she bade him earn it and always ended by offering to smooth for him any real difficulty which want of means might put in his way  no frank used to say to himself when these offers were made i never intended to take her and her money together and therefore i certainly will never take the money alone  a day or two after miss oriels visit mary received the following note from beatrice      dearest dearest mary     i shall be so happy to see you and will come tomorrow at    twelve i have asked mamma and she says that for once    she has no objection you know it is not my fault that    i have never been with you dont you frank comes home    on the 12th mr oriel wants the wedding to be on the 1st    of september but that seems to be so very very soon    doesnt it however mamma and papa are all on his side    i wont write about this though for we shall have such a    delicious talk oh mary i have been so unhappy without    you     ever your own affectionate     trichy     monday   though mary was delighted at the idea of once more having her friend in her arms there was nevertheless something in this letter which oppressed her she could not put up with the idea that beatrice should have permission given to come to herjust for once she hardly wished to be seen by permission nevertheless she did not refuse the proffered visit and the first sight of beatrices face the first touch of the first embrace dissipated for the moment all her anger  and then beatrice fully enjoyed the delicious talk which she had promised herself mary let her have her way and for two hours all the delights and all the duties all the comforts and all the responsibilities of a parsons wife were discussed with almost equal ardour on both sides the duties and responsibilities were not exactly those which too often fall to the lot of the mistress of an english vicarage beatrice was not doomed to make her husband comfortable to educate her children dress herself like a lady and exercise openhanded charity on an income of two hundred pounds a year her duties and responsibilities would have to spread themselves over seven or eight times that amount of worldly burden living also close to greshamsbury and not far from courcy castle she would have the full advantages and all the privileges of county society in fact it was all couleur de rose and so she chatted deliciously with her friend  but it was impossible that they should separate without something having been said as to marys own lot it would perhaps have been better that they should do so but this was hardly within the compass of human nature  and mary you know i shall be able to see you as often as i likeyou and dr thorne too when i have a house of my own  mary said nothing but essayed to smile it was but a ghastly attempt  you know how happy that will make me continued beatrice of course mamma wont expect me to be led by her then if he likes it there can be no objection and he will like it you may be sure of that  you are very kind trichy said mary but she spoke in a tone very different from that she would have used eighteen months ago  why what is the matter mary shant you be glad to come to see us  i do not know dearest that must depend on circumstances to see you you yourself your own dear sweet loving face must always be pleasant to me  and shant you be glad to see him  yes certainly if he loves you  of course he loves me  all that alone would be pleasant enough trichy but what if there should be circumstances which should still make us enemies should make your friends and my friendsfriend i should say for i have only oneshould make them opposed to each other  circumstances what circumstances  you are going to be married trichy to the man you love are you not  indeed i am  and it is not pleasant is it not a happy feeling  pleasant happy yes very pleasant very happy but mary i am not at all in such a hurry as he is said beatrice naturally thinking of her own little affairs  and suppose i should wish to be married to the man that i love mary said this slowly and gravely and as she spoke she looked her friend full in the face  beatrice was somewhat astonished and for the moment hardly understood i am sure i hope you will some day  no trichy no you hope the other way i love your brother i love frank gresham i love him quite as well quite as warmly as you love caleb oriel  do you said beatrice staring with all her eyes and giving one long sigh as this new subject for sorrow was so distinctly put before her  it that so odd said mary you love mr oriel though you have been intimate with him hardly more than two years is it so odd that i should love your brother whom i have known almost all my life  but mary i thought it was always understood between us thatthati mean that you were not to care about him not in the way of loving him you knowi thought you always said soi have always told mamma so as if it came from yourself  beatrice do not tell anything to lady arabella as though it came from me i do not want anything to be told to her either of me or from me say what you like to me yourself whatever you say will not anger me indeed i know what you would sayand yet i love you oh i love you trichytrichy i do love you so much dont turn away from me  there was such a mixture in marys manner of tenderness and almost ferocity that poor beatrice could hardly follow her turn away from you mary no never but this does make me unhappy  it is better that you should know it all and then you will not be led into fighting my battles again you cannot fight them so that i should win i do love your brother love him truly fondly tenderly i would wish to have him for my husband as you wish to have mr oriel  but mary you cannot marry him  why not said she in a loud voice why can i not marry him if the priest says a blessing over us shall we not be married as well as you and your husband  but you know he cannot marry unless his wife shall have money  moneymoney and he is to sell himself for money oh trichy do not you talk about money it is horrible but trichy i will grant iti cannot marry him but still i love him he has a name a place in the world and fortune family high blood position everything he has all this and i have nothing of course i cannot marry him but yet i do love him  are you engaged to him mary  he is not engaged to me but i am to him  oh mary that is impossible  it is not impossible it is the casei am pledged to him but he is not pledged to me  but mary dont look at me in that way i do not quite understand you what is the good of your being engaged if you cannot marry him  good there is no good but can i help it if i love him can i make myself not love him by just wishing it oh i would do it if i could but now you will understand why i shake my head when you talk of my coming to your house your ways and my ways must be different  beatrice was startled and for a time silenced what mary said of the difference of their ways was quite true beatrice had dearly loved her friend and had thought of her with affection through all this long period in which they had been separated but she had given her love and her thoughts on the understanding as it were that they were in unison as to the impropriety of franks conduct  she had always spoken with a grave face of frank and his love as of a great misfortune even to mary herself and her pity for mary had been founded on the conviction of her innocence now all those ideas had to be altered mary owned her fault confessed herself to be guilty of all that lady arabella so frequently laid to her charge and confessed herself anxious to commit every crime as to which beatrice had been ever so ready to defend her  had beatrice up to this dreamed that mary was in love with frank she would doubtless have sympathised with her more or less sooner or later as it was is was beyond all doubt that she would soon sympathise with her but at the moment the suddenness of the declaration seemed to harden her heart and she forgot as it were to speak tenderly to her friend  she was silent therefore and dismayed and looked as though she thought that her ways and marys ways must be different  mary saw all that was passing in the others mind no not all all the hostility the disappointment the disapproval the unhappiness she did see but not the undercurrent of love which was strong enough to well up and drown all these if only time could be allowed for it to do so  i am glad i have told you said mary curbing herself for deceit and hypocrisy are detestable  it was a misunderstanding not deceit said beatrice  well now we understand each other now you know that i have a heart within me which like those of some others has not always been under my own control lady arabella believes that i am intriguing to be the mistress of greshamsbury you at any rate will not think that of me if it could be discovered tomorrow that frank were not the heir i might have some chance of happiness  but mary  well  you say you love him  yes i do say so  but if he does not love you will you cease to do so  if i have a fever i will get rid of it if i can in such case i must do so or die  i fear continued beatrice you hardly know perhaps do not think what is franks real character he is not made to settle down early in life even now i believe he is attached to some lady in london whom of course he cannot marry  beatrice said this in perfect trueness of heart she had heard of franks new loveaffair and believing what she had heard thought it best to tell the truth but the information was not of a kind to quiet marys spirit  very well said she let it be so i have nothing to say against it  but are you not preparing wretchedness and unhappiness for yourself  very likely  oh mary do not be so cold with me you know how delighted i should be to have you for a sisterinlaw if only it were possible  yes trichy but it is impossible is it not impossible that francis gresham of greshamsbury should disgrace himself by marrying such a poor creature as i am of course i know it of course i am prepared for unhappiness and misery he can amuse himself as he likes with me or otherswith anybody it is his privilege it is quite enough to say that he is not made for settling down i know my own positionand yet i love him  but mary has he asked you to be his wife if so  you ask homequestions beatrice let me ask you one has he ever told you that he has done so  at this moment beatrice was not disposed to repeat all that frank had said a year ago before he went away he had told his sister a score of times that he meant to marry mary thorne if she would have him but beatrice now looked on all that as idle boyish vapouring the pity was that mary should have looked on it differently  we will each keep our secret said mary only remember this should frank marry tomorrow i shall have no ground for blaming him he is free as far i as am concerned he can take the london lady if he likes you may tell him so from me but trichy what else i have told you i have told you only  oh yes said beatrice sadly i shall say nothing of it to anybody it is very sad very very i was so happy when i came here and now i am so wretched this was the end of that delicious talk to which she had looked forward with so much eagerness  dont be wretched about me dearest i shall get through it i sometimes think i was born to be unhappy and that unhappiness agrees with me best kiss me now trichy and dont be wretched any more you owe it to mr oriel to be as happy as the day is long  and then they parted  beatrice as she went out saw dr thorne in his little shop on the righthand side of the passage deeply engaged in some derogatory branch of an apothecarys mechanical trade mixing a dose perhaps for a little child she would have passed him without speaking if she could have been sure of doing so without notice for her heart was full and her eyes were red with tears but it was so long since she had been in his house that she was more than ordinarily anxious not to appear uncourteous or unkind to him  good morning doctor she said changing her countenance as best she might and attempting a smile  ah my fairy said he leaving his villainous compounds and coming out to her and you too are about to become a steady old lady  indeed i am not doctor i dont mean to be either steady or old for the next ten years but who has told you i suppose mary has been a traitor  well i will confess mary was the traitor but hadnt i a right to be told seeing how often i have brought you sugarplums in my pocket but i wish you joy with all my heartwith all my heart oriel is an excellent good fellow  is he not doctor  an excellent good fellow i never heard but of one fault that he had  what was that one fault doctor thorne  he thought that clergymen should not marry but you have cured that and now hes perfect  thank you doctor i declare that you say the prettiest things of all my friends  and none of your friends wish prettier things for you i do congratulate you beatrice and hope you may be happy with the man you have chosen and taking both her hands in his he pressed them warmly and bade god bless her  oh doctor i do so hope the time will come when we shall all be friends again  i hope it as well my dear but let it come or let it not come my regard for you will be the same and then she parted from him also and went her way  nothing was spoken of that evening between dr thorne and his niece excepting beatrices future happiness nothing at least having reference to what had passed that morning but on the following morning circumstances led to frank greshams name being mentioned  at the usual breakfasthour the doctor entered the parlour with a harassed face he had an open letter in his hand and it was at once clear to mary that he was going to speak on some subject that vexed him  that unfortunate fellow is again in trouble here is a letter from greyson greyson was a london apothecary who had been appointed as medical attendant to sir louis scatcherd and whose real business consisted in keeping a watch on the baronet and reporting to dr thorne when anything was very much amiss here is a letter from greyson he has been drunk for the last three days and is now laid up in a terribly nervous state  you wont go up to town again will you uncle  i hardly know what to do no i think not he talks of coming down here to greshamsbury  who sir louis  yes sir louis greyson says that he will be down as soon as he can get out of his room  what to this house  what other house can he come to  oh uncle i hope not pray pray do not let him come here  i cannot prevent it my dear i cannot shut my door on him  they sat down to breakfast and mary gave him his tea in silence i am going over to boxall hill before dinner said he have you any message to send to lady scatcherd  message no i have no message not especially give her my love of course she said listlessly and then as though a thought had suddenly struck her she spoke with more energy but couldnt i go to boxall hill again i should be so delighted  what to run away from sir louis no dearest we will have no more running away he will probably also go to boxall hill and he could annoy you much more there than he can here  but uncle mr gresham will be home on the 12th she said blushing  what frank  yes beatrice said he was to be here on the 12th  and would you run away from him too mary  i do not know i do not know what to do  no we will have no more running away i am sorry that you ever did so it was my fault altogether my fault but it was foolish  uncle i am not happy here as she said this she put down the cup which she had held and leaning her elbows on the table rested her forehead on her hands  and would you be happier at boxall hill it is not the place makes the happiness  no i know that it is not the place i do not look to be happy in any place but i should be quieter more tranquil elsewhere than here  i also sometimes think that it will be better for us to take up our staves and walk away out of greshamsburyleave it altogether and settle elsewhere miles miles miles away from here should you like that dearest  miles miles miles away from greshamsbury there was something in the sound that fell very cold on marys ears unhappy as she was greshamsbury had been so dear to her in spite of all that had passed was still so dear to her was she prepared to take up her staff as her uncle said and walk forth from the place with the full understanding that she was to return to it no more with a mind resolved that there should be an inseparable gulf between her and its inhabitants such she knew was the proposed nature of the walking away of which her uncle spoke so she sat there resting on her arms and gave no answer to the question that had been asked her  no we will stay a while yet said her uncle it may come to that but this is not the time for one season longer let us facei will not say our enemies i cannot call anybody my enemy who bears the name of gresham and then he went on for a moment with his breakfast so frank will be here on the 12th  yes uncle  well dearest i have no questions to ask you no directions to give i know how good you are and how prudent i am anxious only for your happiness not at all  happiness uncle is out of the question  i hope not it is never out of the question never can be out of the question but as i was saying i am quite satisfied your conduct will be good and therefore i have no questions to ask we will remain here and whether good or evil come we will not be ashamed to show our faces  she sat for a while again silent collecting her courage on the subject that was nearest her heart she would have given the world that he should ask her questions but she could not bid him to do so and she found it impossible to talk openly to him about frank unless he did so will he come here at last she said in a lowtoned voice  who he louis yes i think that in all probability he will  no but frank she said in a still lower voice  ah my darling that i cannot tell but will it be well that he should come here  i do not know she said no i suppose not but uncle i dont think he will come  she was now sitting on a sofa away from the table and he got up sat down beside her and took her hands in his mary said he you must be strong now strong to endure not to attack i think you have that strength but if not perhaps it will be better that we should go away  i will be strong said she rising up and going towards the door never mind me uncle dont follow me i will be strong it will be base cowardly mean to run away very base in me to make you do so  no dearest not so it will be the same to me  no said she i will not run away from lady arabella and as for himif he loves this other one he shall hear no reproach from me uncle i will be strong and running back to him she threw her arms round him and kissed him and still restraining her tears she got safely to her bedroom in what way she may there have shown her strength it would not be well for us to inquire     chapter xxxiv  a barouche and four arrives at greshamsbury   during the last twelve months sir louis scatcherd had been very efficacious in bringing trouble turmoil and vexation upon greshamsbury now that it was too late to take steps to save himself dr thorne found that the will left by sir roger was so made as to entail upon him duties that he would find it almost impossible to perform sir louis though his father had wished to make him still a child in the eye of the law was no child he knew his own rights and was determined to exact them and before sir roger had been dead three months the doctor found himself in continual litigation with a low barchester attorney who was acting on behalf of his the doctors own ward  and if the doctor suffered so did the squire and so did those who had hitherto had the management of the squires affairs dr thorne soon perceived that he was to be driven into litigation not only with mr finnie the barchester attorney but with the squire himself while finnie harassed him he was compelled to harass mr gresham he was no lawyer himself and though he had been able to manage very well between the squire and sir roger and had perhaps given himself some credit for his lawyerlike ability in so doing he was utterly unable to manage between sir louis and mr gresham  he had therefore to employ a lawyer on his own account and it seemed probable that the whole amount of sir rogers legacy to himself would by degrees be expended in this manner and then the squires lawyers had to take up the matter and they did so greatly to the detriment of poor mr yates umbleby who was found to have made a mess of the affairs entrusted to him mr umblebys accounts were incorrect his mind was anything but clear and he confessed when put to it by the very sharp gentleman that came down from london that he was bothered and so after a while he was suspended from his duties and mr gazebee the sharp gentleman from london reigned over the diminished rentroll of the greshamsbury estate  thus everything was going wrong at greshamsburywith the one exception of mr oriel and his lovesuit miss gushing attributed the deposition of mr umbleby to the narrowness of the victory which beatrice had won in carrying off mr oriel for miss gushing was a relation of the umblebys and had been for many years one of their family if she had only chosen to exert herself as miss gresham had done she could have had mr oriel easily oh too easily but she had despised such work so she said but though she had despised it the greshams had not been less irritated and therefore mr umbleby had been driven out of his house we can hardly believe this as victory generally makes men generous miss gushing however stated it as a fact so often that it is probable she was induced to believe it herself  thus everything was going wrong at greshamsbury and the squire himself was especially a sufferer umbleby had at any rate been his own man and he could do what he liked with him he could see him when he liked and where he liked and how he liked could scold him if in an illhumour and laugh at him when in a good humour all this mr umbleby knew and bore but mr gazebee was a very different sort of gentleman he was the junior partner in the firm of gumption gazebee  gazebee of mount street a house that never defiled itself with any other business than the agency business and that in the very highest line they drew out leases and managed property both for the duke of omnium and lord de courcy and ever since her marriage it had been one of the objects dearest to lady arabellas heart that the greshamsbury acres should be superintended by the polite skill and polished legal ability of that all but elegant firm in mount street  the squire had long stood firm and had delighted in having everything done under his own eye by poor mr yates umbleby but now alas he could stand it no longer he had put off the evil day as long as he could he had deferred the odious work of investigation till things had seemed resolved on investigating themselves and then when it was absolutely necessary that mr umbleby should go there was nothing for him left but to fall into the ready hands of messrs gumption gazebee and gazebee  it must not be supposed that messrs gumption gazebee  gazebee were in the least like the ordinary run of attorneys they wrote no letters for sixandeightpence each they collected no debts filed no bills made no charge per folio for whereases and as aforesaids they did no dirty work and probably were as ignorant of the interior of a court of law as any young lady living in their mayfair vicinity no their business was to manage the property of great people draw up leases make legal assignments get the family marriage settlements made and look after wills occasionally also they had to raise money but it was generally understood that this was done by proxy  the firm had been going on for a hundred and fifty years and the designation had often been altered but it always consisted of gumptions and gazebees differently arranged and no less hallowed names had ever been permitted to appear it had been gazebee gazebee  gumption then gazebee  gumption then gazebee gumption  gumption then gumption gumption  gazebee and now it was gumption gazebee  gazebee  mr gazebee the junior member of this firm was a very elegant young man while looking at him riding in rotten row you would hardly have taken him for an attorney and had he heard that you had so taken him he would have been very much surprised indeed he was rather bald not being as people say quite so young as he was once his exact age was thirtyeight but he had a really remarkable pair of jetblack whiskers which fully made up for any deficiency as to his head he had also dark eyes and a beaked nose what may be called a distinguished mouth and was always dressed in fashionable attire the fact was that mr mortimer gazebee junior partner in the firm gumption gazebee  gazebee by no means considered himself to be made of that very disagreeable material which mortals call small beer  when this great firm was applied to to get mr gresham through his difficulties and when the state of his affairs was made known to them they at first expressed rather a disinclination for the work but at last moved doubtless by their respect for the de courcy interest they assented and mr gazebee junior went down to greshamsbury the poor squire passed many a sad day after that before he again felt himself to be master even of his own domain  nevertheless when mr mortimer gazebee visited greshamsbury which he did on more than one or two occasions he was always received en grand seigneur to lady arabella he was by no means an unwelcome guest for she found herself able for the first time in her life to speak confidentially on her husbands pecuniary affairs with the man who had the management of her husbands property mr gazebee also was a pet with lady de courcy and being known to be a fashionable man in london and quite a different sort of person from poor mr umbleby he was always received with smiles he had a hundred little ways of making himself agreeable and augusta declared to her cousin the lady amelia after having been acquainted with him for a few months that he would be a perfect gentleman only that his family had never been anything but attorneys the lady amelia smiled in her own peculiarly aristocratic way shrugged her shoulders slightly and said that mr mortimer gazebee was a very good sort of a person very poor augusta felt herself snubbed thinking perhaps of the tailors son but as there was never any appeal against the lady amelia she said nothing more at that moment in favour of mr mortimer gazebee  all these evilsmr mortimer gazebee being the worst of themhad sir louis scatcherd brought down on the poor squires head there may be those who will say that the squire had brought them on himself by running into debt and so doubtless he had but it was not the less true that the baronets interference was unnecessary vexatious and one might almost say malicious his interest would have been quite safe in the doctors hands and he had in fact no legal right to meddle but neither the doctor nor the squire could prevent him mr finnie knew very well what he was about if sir louis did not and so the three went on each with his own lawyer and each of them distrustful unhappy and ill at ease this was hard upon the doctor for he was not in debt and had borrowed no money  there was not much reason to suppose that the visit of sir louis to greshamsbury would much improve matters it must be presumed that he was not coming with any amicable views but with the object rather of looking after his own a phrase which was now constantly in his mouth he might probably find it necessary while looking after his own at greshamsbury to say some very disagreeable things to the squire and the doctor therefore hardly expected that the visit would go off pleasantly  when last we saw sir louis now nearly twelve months since he was intent on making a proposal of marriage to miss thorne this intention he carried out about two days after frank gresham had done the same thing he had delayed doing so till he had succeeded in purchasing his friend jenkinss arab pony imagining that such a present could not but go far in weaning marys heart from her other lover poor mary was put to the trouble of refusing both the baronet and the pony and a very bad time she had of it while doing so sir louis was a man easily angered and not very easily pacified and mary had to endure a good deal of annoyance from any other person indeed she would have called it impertinence sir louis however had to bear his rejection as best he could and after a perseverance of three days returned to london in disgust and mary had not seen him since  mr greysons first letter was followed by a second and the second was followed by the baronet in person he also required to be received en grand seigneur perhaps more imperatively than mr mortimer gazebee himself he came with four posters from the barchester station and had himself rattled up to the doctors door in a way that took the breath away from all greshamsbury why the squire himself for a many long year had been contented to come home with a pair of horses and four were never seen in the place except when the de courcys came to greshamsbury or lady arabella with all her daughters returned from her hardfought metropolitan campaigns  sir louis however came with four and very arrogant he looked leaning back in the barouche belonging to the george and dragon and wrapped up in fur although it was now midsummer and up in the dicky behind was a servant more arrogant if possible than his masterthe baronets own man who was the object of dr thornes special detestation and disgust he was a little fellow chosen originally on account of his light weight on horseback but if that may be considered a merit it was the only one he had his outdoor show dress was a little tight frockcoat round which a polished strap was always buckled tightly a stiff white choker leather breeches topboots and a hat with a cockade stuck on one side of his head his name was jonah which his master and his masters friends shortened into joe none however but those who were very intimate with his master were allowed to do so with impunity  this joe was dr thornes special aversion in his anxiety to take every possible step to keep sir louis from poisoning himself he had at first attempted to enlist the baronets own man in the cause joe had promised fairly but had betrayed the doctor at once and had become the worst instrument of his masters dissipation when therefore his hat and the cockade were seen as the carriage dashed up to the door the doctors contentment was by no means increased  sir louis was now twentythree years old and was a great deal too knowing to allow himself to be kept under the doctors thumb it had indeed become his plan to rebel against his guardian in almost everything he had at first been decently submissive with the view of obtaining increased supplies of ready money but he had been sharp enough to perceive that let his conduct be what it would the doctor would keep him out of debt but that the doing so took so large a sum that he could not hope for any further advances in this respect sir louis was perhaps more keenwitted than dr thorne  mary when she saw the carriage at once ran up to her own bedroom the doctor who had been with her in the drawingroom went down to meet his ward but as soon as he saw the cockade he darted almost involuntarily into his shop and shut the door this protection however lasted only for a moment he felt that decency required him to meet his guest and so he went forth and faced the enemy  i say said joe speaking to janet who stood curtsying at the gate with bridget the other maid behind her i say are there any chaps about the place to take these thingseh come look sharp here  it so happened that the doctors groom was not on the spot and other chaps the doctor had none  take those things bridget he said coming forward and offering his hand to the baronet sir louis when he saw his host roused himself slowly from the back of his carriage how do doctor said he what terrible bad roads you have here and upon my word its as cold as winter and so saying he slowly proceeded to descend  sir louis was a year older than when we last saw him and in his generation a year wiser he had then been somewhat humble before the doctor but now he was determined to let his guardian see that he knew how to act the baronet that he had acquired the manners of a great man and that he was not to be put upon he had learnt some lessons from jenkins in london and other friends of the same sort and he was about to profit by them  the doctor showed him to his room and then proceeded to ask after his health oh im right enough said sir louis you mustnt believe all that fellow greyson tells you he wants me to take salts and senna opodeldoc and all that sort of stuff looks after his bill you knoweh like all the rest of you but i wont have itnot at any price and then he writes to you  im glad to see you able to travel said dr thorne who could not force himself to tell his guest that he was glad to see him at greshamsbury  oh travel yes i can travel well enough but i wish you had some better sort of trap down in these country parts im shaken to bits and doctor would you tell your people to send that fellow of mine up here with hot water  so dismissed the doctor went his way and met joe swaggering in one of the passages while janet and her colleague dragged along between them a heavy article of baggage  janet said he go downstairs and get sir louis some hot water and joe do you take hold of your masters portmanteau  joe sulkily did as he was bid seems to me said he turning to the girl and speaking before the doctor was out of hearing seems to me my dear you be rather shorthanded here lots of work and nothing to get thats about the ticket aint it bridget was too demurely modest to make any answer upon so short an acquaintance so putting her end of the burden down at the strange gentlemans door she retreated into the kitchen  sir louis in answer to the doctors inquiries had declared himself to be all right but his appearance was anything but all right twelve months since a life of dissipation or rather perhaps a life of drinking had not had upon him so strong an effect but that some of the salt of youth was still left some of the freshness of young years might still be seen in his face but this was now all gone his eyes were sunken and watery his cheeks were hollow and wan his mouth was drawn and his lips dry his back was even bent and his legs were unsteady under him so that he had been forced to step down from his carriage as an old man would do alas alas he had no further chance now of ever being all right again  mary had secluded herself in her bedroom as soon as the carriage had driven up to the door and there she remained till dinnertime but she could not shut herself up altogether it would be necessary that she should appear at dinner and therefore a few minutes before the hour she crept out into the drawingroom as she opened the door she looked in timidly expecting sir louis to be there but when she saw that her uncle was the only occupant of the room her brow cleared and she entered with a quick step  hell come down to dinner wont he uncle  oh i suppose so  whats he doing now  dressing i suppose hes been at it this hour  but uncle  well  will he come up after dinner do you think  mary spoke of him as though he were some wild beast whom her uncle insisted on having in his house  goodness knows what he will do come up yes he will not stay in the diningroom all night  but dear uncle do be serious  serious  yes serious dont you think that i might go to bed instead of waiting  the doctor was saved the trouble of answering by the entrance of the baronet he was dressed in what he considered the most fashionable style of the day he had on a new dresscoat lined with satin new dresstrousers a silk waistcoat covered with chains a white cravat polished pumps and silk stockings and he carried a scented handkerchief in his hand he had rings on his fingers and carbuncle studs in his shirt and he smelt as sweet as patchouli could make him but he could hardly do more than shuffle into the room and seemed almost to drag one of his legs behind him  mary in spite of her aversion was shocked and distressed when she saw him he however seemed to think himself perfect and was no whit abashed by the unfavourable reception which twelve months since had been paid to his suit mary came up and shook hands with him and he received her with a compliment which no doubt he thought must be acceptable upon my word miss thorne every place seems to agree with you one better than another you were looking charming at boxall hill but upon my word charming isnt half strong enough now  mary sat down quietly and the doctor assumed a face of unutterable disgust this was the creature for whom all his sympathies had been demanded all his best energies put in requisition on whose behalf he was to quarrel with his oldest friends lose his peace and quietness of life and exercise all the functions of a loving friend this was his selfinvited guest whom he was bound to foster and whom he could not turn from his door  then dinner came and mary had to put her hand upon his arm she certainly did not lean upon him and once or twice felt inclined to give him some support they reached the diningroom however the doctor following them and then sat down janet waiting in the room as was usual  i say doctor said the baronet hadnt my man better come in and help hes got nothing to do you know we should be more cosy shouldnt we  janet will manage pretty well said the doctor  oh youd better have joe theres nothing like a good servant at table i say janet just send that fellow in will you  we shall do very well without him said the doctor becoming rather red about the cheekbones and with a slight gleam of determination about the eye janet who saw how matters stood made no attempt to obey the baronets order  oh nonsense doctor you think hes an uppish sort of fellow i know and you dont like to trouble him but when im near him hes all right just send him in will you  sir louis said the doctor im accustomed to none but my own old woman here in my own house and if you will allow me ill keep my old ways i shall be sorry if you are not comfortable the baronet said nothing more and the dinner passed off slowly and wearily enough  when mary had eaten her fruit and escaped the doctor got into one armchair and the baronet into another and the latter began the only work of existence of which he knew anything  thats good port said he very fair port  the doctor loved his port wine and thawed a little in his manner he loved it not as a toper but as a collector loves his pet pictures he liked to talk about it and think about it to praise it and hear it praised to look at it turned towards the light and to count over the years it had lain in his cellar  yes said he its pretty fair wine it was at least when i got it twenty years ago and i dont suppose time has hurt it and he held the glass up to the window and looked at the evening light through the ruby tint of the liquid ah dear theres not much of it left mores the pity  a good thing wont last for ever ill tell you what now i wish id brought down a dozen or two of claret ive some prime stuff in london got it from muzzle  drug at ninetysix shillings it was a great favour though ill tell you what now ill send up for a couple of dozen tomorrow i mustnt drink you out of house high and dry must i doctor  the doctor froze immediately  i dont think i need trouble you said he i never drink claret at least not here and theres enough of the old bin left to last some little time longer yet  sir louis drank two or three glasses of wine very quickly after each other and they immediately began to tell upon his weak stomach but before he was tipsy he became more impudent and more disagreeable  doctor said he when are we to see any of this greshamsbury money thats what i want to know  your money is quite safe sir louis and the interest is paid to the day  interest yes but how do i know how long it will be paid i should like to see the principal a hundred thousand pounds or something like it is a precious large stake to have in one mans hands and he preciously hard up himself ill tell you what doctori shall look the squire up myself  look him up  yes look him up ferret him out tell him a bit of my mind ill thank you to pass the bottle d me doctor i mean to know how things are going on  your money is quite safe repeated the doctor and to my mind could not be better invested  thats all very well d well i dare say for you and squire gresham  what do you mean sir louis  mean why i mean that ill sell the squire up thats what i meanhallobeg pardon im blessed if i havent broken the waterjug that comes of having water on the table oh d me its all over me and then getting up to avoid the flood he himself had caused he nearly fell into the doctors arms  youre tired with your journey sir louis perhaps youd better go to bed  well i am a bit seedy or so those cursed roads of yours shake a fellow so  the doctor rang the bell and on this occasion did request that joe might be sent for joe came in and though he was much steadier than his master looked as though he also had found some bin of which he had approved  sir louis wishes to go to bed said the doctor you had better give him your arm  oh yes in course i will said joe standing immoveable about halfway between the door and the table  ill just take one more glass of the old porteh doctor said sir louis putting out his hand and clutching the decanter  it is very hard for any man to deny his guest in his own house and the doctor at the moment did not know how to do it so sir louis got his wine after pouring half of it over the table  come in sir and give sir louis your arm said the doctor angrily  so i will in course if my master tells me but if you please dr thorneand joe put his hand up to his hair in a manner that had a great deal more of impudence than reverence in iti just want to ax one question where be i to sleep  now this was a question which the doctor was not prepared to answer on the spur of the moment however well janet or mary might have been able to do so  sleep said he i dont know where you are to sleep and dont care ask janet  thats all very well master  hold your tongue sirrah said sir louis what the devil do you want of sleepcome here and then with his servants help he made his way up to his bedroom and was no more heard of that night  did he get tipsy asked mary almost in a whisper when her uncle joined her in the drawingroom  dont talk of it said he poor wretch poor wretch lets have some tea now molly and pray dont talk any more about him tonight then mary did make the tea and did not talk any more about sir louis that night  what on earth were they to do with him he had come there selfinvited but his connexion with the doctor was such that it was impossible he should be told to go away either he himself or that servant of his there was no reason to disbelieve him when he declared that he had come down to ferret out the squire such was doubtless his intention he would ferret out the squire perhaps he might ferret out lady arabella also frank would be home in a few days and he too might be ferreted out  but the matter took a very singular turn and one quite unexpected on the doctors part on the morning following the little dinner of which we have spoken one of the greshamsbury grooms rode up to the doctors door with two notes one was addressed to the doctor in the squires wellknown large handwriting and the other was for sir louis each contained an invitation do dinner for the following day and that to the doctor was in this wise      dear doctor     do come and dine here tomorrow and bring sir louis    scatcherd with you if youre the man i take you to be    you wont refuse me lady arabella sends a note for    sir louis there will be nobody here but oriel and mr    gazebee who is staying in the house     yours ever     f n gresham     greshamsbury july 185     psi make a positive request that youll come and i    think you will hardly refuse me   the doctor read it twice before he could believe it and then ordered janet to take the other note up to sir louis as these invitations were rather in opposition to the then existing greshamsbury tactics the cause of lady arabellas special civility must be explained  mr mortimer gazebee was now at the house and therefore it must be presumed that things were not allowed to go on after their old fashion mr gazebee was an acute as well as a fashionable man one who knew what he was about and who moreover had determined to give his very best efforts on behalf of the greshamsbury property his energy in this respect will explain itself hereafter it was not probable that the arrival in the village of such a person as sir louis scatcherd should escape attention he had heard of it before dinner and before the evening was over had discussed it with lady arabella  her ladyship was not at first inclined to make much of sir louis and expressed herself as but little inclined to agree with mr gazebee when that gentleman suggested that he should be treated with civility at greshamsbury but she was at last talked over she found it pleasant enough to have more to do with the secret management of the estate than mr gresham himself and when mr gazebee proved to her by sundry nods and winks and subtle allusions to her own infinite good sense that it was necessary to catch this obscene bird which had come to prey upon the estate by throwing a little salt upon his tail she also nodded and winked and directed augusta to prepare the salt according to order  but wont it be odd mr gazebee asking him out of dr thornes house  oh we must have the doctor too lady arabella by all means ask the doctor also  lady arabellas brow grew dark mr gazebee she said you can hardly believe how that man has behaved to me  he is altogether beneath your anger said mr gazebee with a bow  i dont know in one way he may be but not in another i really do not think i can sit down to table with doctor thorne  but nevertheless mr gazebee gained his point it was now about a week since sir omicron pie had been at greshamsbury and the squire had almost daily spoken to his wife as to that learned mans advice lady arabella always answered in the same tone you can hardly know mr gresham how that man has insulted me but nevertheless the physicians advice had not been disbelieved it tallied too well with her own inward convictions she was anxious enough to have doctor thorne back at her bedside if she could only get him there without damage to her pride her husband she thought might probably send the doctor there without absolute permission from herself in which case she would have been able to scold and show that she was offended and at the same time profit by what had been done but mr gresham never thought of taking so violent a step as this and therefore dr fillgrave still came and her ladyships finesse was wasted in vain  but mr gazebees proposition opened a door by which her point might be gained well said she at last with infinite selfdenial if you think it is for mr greshams advantage and if he chooses to ask dr thorne i will not refuse to receive him  mr gazebees next task was to discuss the matter with the squire nor was this easy for mr gazebee was no favourite with mr gresham but the task was at last performed successfully mr gresham was so glad at heart to find himself able once more to ask his old friend to his own house and though it would have pleased him better that this sign of relenting on his wifes part should have reached him by other means he did not refuse to take advantage of it and so he wrote the above letter to dr thorne  the doctor as we have said read it twice and he at once resolved stoutly that he would not go  oh do do go said mary she well knew how wretched this feud had made her uncle pray pray go  indeed i will not said he there are some things a man should bear and some he should not  you must go said mary who had taken the note from her uncles hand and read it you cannot refuse him when he asks you like that  it will greatly grieve me but i must refuse him  i also am angry uncle very angry with lady arabella but for him for the squire i would go to him on my knees if he asked me in that way  yes and had he asked you i also would have gone  oh now i shall be so wretched it is his invitation not hers mr gresham could not ask me as for her do not think of her but do do go when he asks you like that you will make me so miserable if you do not and then sir louis cannot go without youand mary pointed upstairsand you may be sure that he will go  yes and make a beast of himself  this colloquy was cut short by a message praying the doctor to go up to sir louiss room the young man was sitting in his dressinggown drinking a cup of coffee at his toilettable while joe was preparing his razor and hot water the doctors nose immediately told him that there was more in the coffeecup than had come out of his own kitchen and he would not let the offence pass unnoticed  are you taking brandy this morning sir louis  just a little chassecafé said he not exactly understanding the word he used its all the go now and a capital thing for the stomach  its not a capital thing for your stomachabout the least capital thing you can take that is if you wish to live  never mind about that now doctor but look here this is what we call the civil thingeh and he showed the greshamsbury note not but what they have an object of course i understand all that lots of girls thereeh  the doctor took the note and read it it is civil said he very civil  well i shall go of course i dont bear malice because he cant pay me the money he owes me ill eat his dinner and look at the girls have you an invite too doctor  yes i have  and youll go  i think not but that need not deter you but sir louis  well eh what is it  step downstairs a moment said the doctor turning to the servant and wait till you are called for i wish to speak to your master joe for a moment looked up at the baronets face as though he wanted but the slightest encouragement to disobey the doctors orders but not seeing it he slowly retired and placed himself of course at the keyhole  and then the doctor began a long and very useless lecture the first object of it was to induce his ward not to get drunk at greshamsbury but having got so far he went on and did succeed in frightening his unhappy guest sir louis did not possess the iron nerves of his fathernerves which even brandy had not been able to subdue the doctor spoke strongly very strongly spoke of quick almost immediate death in case of further excesses spoke to him of the certainty there would be that he could not live to dispose of his own property if he could not refrain and thus he did frighten sir louis the father he had never been able to frighten but there are men who though they fear death hugely fear present suffering more who indeed will not bear a moment of pain if there by any mode of escape sir louis was such he had no strength of nerve no courage no ability to make a resolution and keep it he promised the doctor that he would refrain and as he did so he swallowed down his cup of coffee and brandy in which the two articles bore about equal proportions  the doctor did at last make up his mind to go whichever way he determined he found that he was not contented with himself he did not like to trust sir louis by himself and he did not like to show that he was angry still less did he like the idea of breaking bread in lady arabellas house till some amends had been made to mary but his heart would not allow him to refuse the petition contained in the squires postscript and the matter ended in his accepting the invitation  this visit of his wards was in every way pernicious to the doctor he could not go about his business fearing to leave such a man alone with mary on the afternoon of the second day she escaped to the parsonage for an hour or so and then walked away among the lanes calling on some of her old friends among the farmers wives but even then the doctor was afraid to leave sir louis what could such a man do left alone in a village like greshamsbury so he stayed at home and the two together went over their accounts the baronet was particular about his accounts and said a good deal as to having finnie over to greshamsbury to this however dr thorne positively refused his consent  the evening passed off better than the preceding one at least the early part of it sir louis did not get tipsy he came up to tea and mary who did not feel so keenly on the subject as her uncle almost wished that he had done so at ten oclock he went to bed  but after that new troubles came on the doctor had gone downstairs into his study to make up some of the time which he had lost and had just seated himself at his desk when janet without announcing herself burst into the room and bridget dissolved in hysterical tears with her apron to her eyes appeared behind the senior domestic  please sir said janet driven by excitement much beyond her usual pace of speaking and becoming unintentionally a little less respectful than usual please sir that ere young man must go out of this here house or else no respectable young ooman cant stop here no indeed sir and we be sorry to trouble you dr thorne so we be  what young man sir louis asked the doctor  oh no he abides mostly in bed and dont do nothing amiss least way not to us tant him sir but his man  man sobbed bridget from behind he ant no man nor nothing like a man if tummas had been here he wouldnt have dared so he wouldnt thomas was the groom and if all greshamsbury reports were true it was probable that on some happy future day thomas and bridget would become one flesh and one bone  please sir continued janet therell be bad work here if that ere young man doesnt quit this here house this very night and im sorry to trouble you doctor and so i am but tom he be given to fight amost for nothin hes hout now but if that there young man bes here when tom comes home tom will be punching his head i know he will  he wouldnt stand by and see a poor girl put upon no more he wouldnt said bridget through her tears  after many futile inquiries the doctor ascertained that mr jonah had expressed some admiration for bridgets youthful charms and had in the absence of janet thrown himself at the ladys feet in a manner which had not been altogether pleasing to her she had defended herself stoutly and loudly and in the middle of the row janet had come down  and where is he now said the doctor  why sir said janet the poor girl was so put about that she did give him one touch across the face with the rollingpin and he be all bloody now in the back kitchen at hearing this achievement of hers thus spoken of bridget sobbed more hysterically than ever but the doctor looking at her arm as she held her apron to her face thought in his heart that joe must have had so much the worst of it that there could be no possible need for the interference of thomas the groom  and such turned out to be the case the bridge of joes nose was broken and the doctor had to set it for him in a little bedroom at the village publichouse bridget having positively refused to go to bed in the same house with so dreadful a character  quiet now or ill be serving thee the same way thee see ive found the trick of it the doctor could not but hear so much as he made his way into his own house by the back door after finishing his surgical operation bridget was recounting to her champion the fracas that had occurred and he as was so natural was expressing his admiration at her valour     chapter xxxv  sir louis goes out to dinner   the next day joe did not make his appearance and sir louis with many execrations was driven to the terrible necessity of dressing himself then came an unexpected difficulty how were they to get up to the house walking out to dinner though it was merely through the village and up the avenue seemed to sir louis to be a thing impossible indeed he was not well able to walk at all and positively declared that he should never be able to make his way over the gravel in pumps his mother would not have thought half as much of walking from boxall hill to greshamsbury and back again at last the one village fly was sent for and the matter was arranged  when they reached the house it was easy to see that there was some unwonted bustle in the drawingroom there was no one but mr mortimer gazebee who introduced himself to them both sir louis who knew that he was only an attorney did not take much notice of him but the doctor entered into conversation  have you heard that mr gresham has come home said mr gazebee  mr gresham i did not know that he had been away  mr gresham junior i mean no indeed the doctor had not heard frank had returned unexpectedly just before dinner and he was now undergoing his fathers smiles his mothers embraces and his sisters questions  quite unexpectedly said mr gazebee i dont know what has brought him back before his time i suppose he found london too hot  deuced hot said the baronet i found it so at least i dont know what keeps men in london when its so hot except those fellows who have business to do theyre paid for it  mr mortimer gazebee looked at him he was managing an estate which owed sir louis an enormous sum of money and therefore he could not afford to despise the baronet but he thought to himself what a very abject fellow the man would be if he were not a baronet and had not a large fortune  and then the squire came in his broad honest face was covered with a smile when he saw the doctor  thorne he said almost in a whisper youre the best fellow breathing i have hardly deserved this the doctor as he took his old friends hand could not but be glad that he had followed marys counsel  so frank has come home  oh yes quite unexpectedly he was to have stayed a week longer in london you would hardly know him if you met him sir louis i beg your pardon and the squire went up to his other guest who had remained somewhat sullenly standing in one corner of the room he was the man of highest rank present or to be present and he expected to be treated as such  i am happy to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance mr gresham said the baronet intending to be very courteous though we have not met before i very often see your name in my accountsha ha ha and sir louis laughed as though he had said something very good  the meeting between lady arabella and the doctor was rather distressing to the former but she managed to get over it she shook hands with him graciously and said that it was a fine day the doctor said that it was fine only perhaps a little rainy and then they went into different parts of the room  when frank came in the doctor hardly did know him his hair was darker than it had been and so was his complexion but his chief disguise was in a long silken beard which hung down over his cravat the doctor had hitherto not been much in favour of long beards but he could not deny that frank looked very well with the appendage  oh doctor i am so delighted to find you here said he coming up to him so very very glad and taking the doctors arm he led him away into a window where they were alone and how is mary said he almost in a whisper oh i wish she were here but doctor it shall all come in time but tell me doctor there is no news about her is there  newswhat news  oh well no news is good news you will give her my love wont you  the doctor said that he would what else could he say it appeared quite clear to him that some of marys fears were groundless  frank was again very much altered it has been said that though he was a boy at twentyone he was a man at twentytwo but now at twentythree he appeared to be almost a man of the world his manners were easy his voice under his control and words were at his command he was no longer either shy or noisy but perhaps was open to the charge of seeming at least to be too conscious of his own merits he was indeed very handsome tall manly and powerfully built his form was such as womens eyes have ever loved to look upon ah if he would but marry money said lady arabella to herself taken up by a mothers natural admiration for her son his sisters clung round him before dinner all talking to him at once how proud a family of girls are of one big tall burly brother  you dont mean to tell me frank that you are going to eat soup with that beard said the squire when they were seated round the table he had not ceased to rally his son as to this patriarchal adornment but nevertheless any one could have seen with half an eye that he was as proud of it as were the others  dont i sir all i require is a relay of napkins for every course and he went to work covering it with every spoonful as men with beards always do  well if you like it said the squire shrugging his shoulders  but i do like it said frank  oh papa you wouldnt have him cut it off said one of the twins it is so handsome  i should like to work it into a chairback instead of flosssilk said the other twin  thankee sophy ill remember you for that  doesnt it look nice and grand and patriarchal said beatrice turning to her neighbour  patriarchal certainly said mr oriel i should grow one myself if i had not the fear of the archbishop before my eyes  what was next said to him was in a whisper audible only to himself  doctor did you know wildman of the 9th he was left as surgeon at scutari for two years why my beard to his is only a little down  a little way down you mean said mr gazebee  yes said frank resolutely set against laughing at mr gazebees pun why his beard descends to his ankles and he is obliged to tie it in a bag at night because his feet get entangled in it when he is asleep  oh frank said one of the girls  this was all very well for the squire and lady arabella and the girls they were all delighted to praise frank and talk about him neither did it come amiss to mr oriel and the doctor who had both a personal interest in the young hero but sir louis did not like it at all he was the only baronet in the room and yet nobody took any notice of him he was seated in the post of honour next to lady arabella but even lady arabella seemed to think more of her own son than of him seeing how he was illused he meditated revenge but not the less did it behove him to make some effort to attract attention  was your ladyship long in london this season said he  lady arabella had not been in london at all this year and it was a sore subject with her no said she very graciously circumstances have kept us at home  sir louis only understood one description of circumstances circumstances in his idea meant the want of money and he immediately took lady arabellas speech as a confession of poverty  ah indeed i am very sorry for that that must be very distressing to a person like your ladyship but things are mending perhaps  lady arabella did not in the least understand him mending she said in her peculiar tone of aristocratic indifference and then turned to mr gazebee who was on the other side of her  sir louis was not going to stand this he was the first man in the room and he knew his own importance it was not to be borne that lady arabella should turn to talk to a dirty attorney and leave him a baronet to eat his dinner without notice if nothing else would move her he would let her know who was the real owner of the greshamsbury titledeeds  i think i saw your ladyship out today taking a ride lady arabella had driven through the village in her ponychair  i never ride said she turning her head for one moment from mr gazebee  in the onehorse carriage i mean my lady i was delighted with the way you whipped him up round the corner  whipped him up round the corner lady arabella could make no answer to this so she went on talking to mr gazebee sir louis repulsed but not vanquishedresolved not to be vanquished by any lady arabellaturned his attention to his plate for a minute or two and then recommenced  the honour of a glass of wine with you lady arabella said he  i never take wine at dinner said lady arabella the man was becoming intolerable to her and she was beginning to fear that it would be necessary for her to fly the room to get rid of him  the baronet was again silent for a moment but he was determined not to be put down  this is a nicelooking country about here said he  yes very nice said mr gazebee endeavouring to relieve the lady of the mansion  i hardly know which i like best this or my own place at boxall hill you have the advantage here in trees and those sort of things but as to the house why my box there is very comfortable very youd hardly know the place now lady arabella if you havent seen it since my governor bought it how much do you think he spent about the house and grounds pineries included you know and those sort of things  lady arabella shook her head  now guess my lady said he but it was not to be supposed that lady arabella should guess on such a subject  i never guess said she with a look of ineffable disgust  what do you say mr gazebee  perhaps a hundred thousand pounds  what for a house you cant know much about money nor yet about building i think mr gazebee  not much said mr gazebee as to such magnificent places as boxall hill  well my lady if you wont guess ill tell you it cost twentytwo thousand four hundred and nineteen pounds four shillings and eightpence ive all the accounts exact now thats a tidy lot of money for a house for a man to live in  sir louis spoke this in a loud tone which at least commanded the attention of the table lady arabella vanquished bowed her head and said that it was a large sum mr gazebee went on sedulously eating his dinner the squire was struck momentarily dumb in the middle of a long chat with the doctor even mr oriel ceased to whisper and the girls opened their eyes with astonishment before the end of his speech sir louiss voice had become very loud  yes indeed said frank a very tidy lot of money id have generously dropped the four and eightpence if id been the architect  it wasnt all one bill but thats the tot i can show the bills and sir louis well pleased with his triumph swallowed a glass of wine  almost immediately after the cloth was removed lady arabella escaped and the gentlemen clustered together sir louis found himself next to mr oriel and began to make himself agreeable  a very nice girl miss beatrice very nice  now mr oriel was a modest man and when thus addressed as to his future wife found it difficult to make any reply  you parsons always have your own luck said sir louis you get all the beauty and generally all the money too not much of the latter in this case thougheh  mr oriel was dumbfounded he had never said a word to any creature as to beatrices dowry and when mr gresham had told him with sorrow that his daughters portion must be small he had at once passed away from the subject as one that was hardly fit for conversation even between him and his future fatherinlaw and now he was abruptly questioned on the subject by a man he had never before seen in his life of course he could make no answer  the squire has muddled his matters most uncommonly continued sir louis filling his glass for the second time before he passed the bottle what do you suppose now he owes me alone just at one lump you know  mr oriel had nothing for it but to run he could make no answer nor would he sit there to hear tidings as to mr greshams embarrassments so he fairly retreated without having said one word to his neighbour finding such discretion to be the only kind of valour left to him  what oriel off already said the squire anything the matter  oh no nothing particular im not just quitei think ill go out for a few minutes  see what it is to be in love said the squire halfwhispering to dr thorne youre not in the same way i hope  sir louis then shifted his seat again and found himself next to frank mr gazebee was opposite to him and the doctor opposite to frank  parson seems peekish i think said the baronet  peekish said the squire inquisitively  rather down on his luck hes decently well off himself isnt he  there was another pause and nobody seemed inclined to answer the question  i mean hes got something more than his bare living  oh yes said frank laughing hes got what will buy him bread and cheese when the rads shut up the churchunless indeed they shut up the funds too  ah theres nothing like land said sir louis nothing like the dirty acres is there squire  land is a very good investment certainly said mr gresham  the best going said the other who was now as people say when they mean to be goodnatured slightly under the influence of liquor the best goingeh gazebee  mr gazebee gathered himself up and turned away his head looking out of the window  you lawyers never like to give an opinion without money ha ha ha do they mr gresham you and i have had to pay for plenty of them and will have to pay for plenty more before they let us alone  here mr gazebee got up and followed mr oriel out of the room he was not of course on such intimate terms in the house as was mr oriel but he hoped to be forgiven by the ladies in consequence of the severity of the miseries to which he was subjected he and mr oriel were soon to be seen through the diningroom window walking about the grounds with the two eldest miss greshams and patience oriel who had also been of the party was also to be seen with the twins frank looked at his father with almost a malicious smile and began to think that he too might be better employed out among the walks did he think then of a former summer evening when he had half broken marys heart by walking there too lovingly with patience oriel  sir louis if he continued his brilliant career of success would soon be left the cock of the walk the squire to be sure could not bolt nor could the doctor very well but they might be equally vanquished remaining there in their chairs dr thorne during all this time was sitting with tingling ears indeed it may be said that his whole body tingled he was in a manner responsible for this horrid scene but what could he do to stop it he could not take sir louis up bodily and carry him away one idea did occur to him the fly had been ordered for ten oclock he could rush out and send for it instantly  youre not going to leave me said the squire in a voice of horror as he saw the doctor rising from his chair  oh no no no said the doctor and then he whispered the purpose of his mission i will be back in two minutes the doctor would have given twenty pounds to have closed the scene at once but he was not the man to desert his friend in such a strait as that  hes a wellmeaning fellow the doctor said sir louis when his guardian was out of the room very but hes not up to trapnot at all  up to trapwell i should say he was that is if i know what trap means said frank  ah but thats just the ticket do you know now i say dr thornes not a man of the world  hes about the best man i know or ever heard of said the squire and if any man ever had a good friend you have got one in him and so have i and the squire silently drank the doctors health  all very true i dare say but yet hes not up to trap now look here squire  if you dont mind sir said frank ive got something very particularperhaps however  stay till thorne returns frank  frank did stay till thorne returned and then escaped  excuse me doctor said he but ive something very particular to say ill explain tomorrow and then the three were left alone  sir louis was now becoming almost drunk and was knocking his words together the squire had already attempted to stop the bottle but the baronet had contrived to get hold of a modicum of madeira and there was no preventing him from helping himself at least none at that moment  as we were saying about lawyers continued sir louis lets see what were we saying why squire its just here those fellows will fleece us both if we dont mind what we are after  never mind about lawyers now said dr thorne angrily  ah but i do mind most particularly thats all very well for you doctor youve nothing to lose youve no great stake in the matter why now what sum of money of mine do you think those d doctors are handling  d doctors said the squire in a tone of dismay  lawyers i mean of course why now gresham were all totted now you see youre down in my books i take it for pretty near a hundred thousand pounds  hold your tongue sir said the doctor getting up  hold my tongue said sir louis  sir louis scatcherd said the squire slowly rising from his chair we will not if you please talk about business at the present moment perhaps we had better go to the ladies  this latter proposition had certainly not come from the squires heart going to the ladies was the very last thing for which sir louis was now fit but the squire had said it as being the only recognised formal way he could think of for breaking up the symposium  oh very well hiccupped the baronet im always ready for the ladies and he stretched out his hand to the decanter to get a last glass of madeira  no said the doctor rising stoutly and speaking with a determined voice no you will have no more wine and he took the decanter from him  whats all this about said sir louis with a drunken laugh  of course he cannot go into the drawingroom mr gresham if you will leave him here with me i will stay with him till the fly comes pray tell lady arabella from me how sorry i am that this has occurred  the squire would not leave his friend and they sat together till the fly came it was not long for the doctor had dispatched his messenger with much haste  i am so heartily ashamed of myself said the doctor almost with tears  the squire took him by the hand affectionately ive seen a tipsy man before tonight said he  yes said the doctor and so have i but he did not express the rest of his thoughts     chapter xxxvi  will he come again   long before the doctor returned home after the little dinnerparty above described mary had learnt that frank was already at greshamsbury she had heard nothing of him or from him not a word nothing in the shape of a message for twelve months and at her age twelve months is a long period would he come and see her in spite of his mother would he send her any tidings of his return or notice her in any way if he did not what would she do and if he did what then would she do it was so hard to resolve so hard to be deserted and so hard to dare to wish that she might not be deserted she continued to say to herself that it would be better that they should be strangers and she could hardly keep herself from tears in the fear that they might be so what chance could there be that he should care for her after an absence spent in travelling over the world no she would forget that affair of his hand and then immediately after having so determined she would confess to herself that it was a thing not to be forgotten and impossible of oblivion  on her uncles return she would hear some word about him and so she sat alone with a book before her of which she could not read a line she expected them about eleven and was therefore rather surprised when the fly stopped at the door before nine  she immediately heard her uncles voice loud and angry calling for thomas both thomas and bridget were unfortunately out being at this moment forgetful of all sublunary cares and seated in happiness under a beechtree in the park janet flew to the little gate and there found sir louis insisting that he would be taken at once to his own mansion at boxall hill and positively swearing that he would no longer submit to the insult of the doctors surveillance  in the absence of thomas the doctor was forced to apply for assistance to the driver of the fly between them the baronet was dragged out of the vehicle the windows suffered much and the doctors hat also in this way he was taken upstairs and was at last put to bed janet assisting nor did the doctor leave the room till his guest was asleep then he went into the drawingroom to mary it may easily be conceived that he was hardly in a humour to talk much about frank gresham  what am i to do with him said he almost in tears what am i to do with him  can you not send him to boxall hill asked mary  yes to kill himself there but it is no matter he will kill himself somewhere oh what that family have done for me and then suddenly remembering a portion of their doings he took mary in his arms and kissed and blessed her and declared that in spite of all this he was a happy man  there was no word about frank that night the next morning the doctor found sir louis very weak and begging for stimulants he was worse than weak he was in such a state of wretched misery and mental prostration so low in heart in such collapse of energy and spirit that dr thorne thought it prudent to remove his razors from his reach  for gods sake do let me have a little chassecafé im always used to it ask joe if im not you dont want to kill me do you and the baronet cried piteously like a child and when the doctor left him for the breakfasttable abjectly implored janet to get him some curaçoa which he knew was in one of his portmanteaus janet however was true to her master  the doctor did give him some wine and then having left strict orders as to his treatmentbridget and thomas being now both in the housewent forth to some of his too much neglected patients  then mary was again alone and her mind flew away to her lover how should she be able to compose herself when she should first see him see him she must people cannot live in the same village without meeting if she passed him at the churchdoor as she often passed lady arabella what should she do lady arabella always smiled a peculiar little bitter smile and this with half a nod of recognition carried off the meeting should she try the bitter smile the halfnod with frank alas she knew it was not in her to be so much mistress of her own hearts blood  as she thus thought she stood at the drawingroom window looking out into her garden and as she leant against the sill her head was surrounded by the sweet creepers at any rate he wont come here she said and so with a deep sigh she turned from the window into the room  there he was frank gresham himself standing there in her immediate presence beautiful as apollo her next thought was how she might escape from out of his arms how it happened that she had fallen into them she never knew  mary my own own love my own one sweetest dearest best mary dear mary have you not a word to say to me  no she had not a word though her life had depended on it the exertion necessary for not crying was quite enough for her this then was the bitter smile and the halfnod that was to pass between them this was the manner in which estrangement was to grow into indifference this was the mode of meeting by which she was to prove that she was mistress of her conduct if not her heart there he held her close bound to his breast and she could only protect her face and that all ineffectually with her hands he loves another beatrice had said at any rate he will not love me her own heart had said also here was now the answer  you know you cannot marry him beatrice had said also ah if that really were so was not this embrace deplorable for them both and yet how could she not be happy she endeavoured to repel him but with what a weak endeavour her pride had been wounded to the core not by lady arabellas scorn but by the conviction which had grown on her that though she had given her own heart absolutely away had parted with it wholly and for ever she had received nothing in return the world her world would know that she had loved and loved in vain but here now was the loved one at her feet the first moment that his enforced banishment was over had brought him there how could she not be happy  they all said that she could not marry him well perhaps it might be so nay when she thought of it must not that edict too probably be true but if so it would not be his fault he was true to her and that satisfied her pride he had taken from her by surprise a confession of her love she had often regretted her weakness in allowing him to do so but she could not regret it now she could endure to suffer nay it would not be suffering while he suffered with her  not one word mary then after all my dreams after all my patience you do not love me at last  oh frank notwithstanding what has been said in thy praise what a fool thou art was any word necessary for thee had not her heart beat against thine had she not borne thy caresses had there been one touch of anger when she warded off thy threatened kisses bridget in the kitchen when jonah became amorous smashed his nose with the rollingpin but when thomas sinned perhaps as deeply she only talked of doing so miss thorne in the drawingroom had she needed selfprotection could doubtless have found the means though the process would probably have been less violent  at last mary succeeded in her efforts at enfranchisement and she and frank stood at some little distance from each other she could not but marvel at him that long soft beard which just now had been so close to her face was all new his whole look was altered his mien and gait and very voice were not the same was this indeed the very frank who had chattered of his boyish love two years since in the gardens at greshamsbury  not one word of welcome mary  indeed mr gresham you are welcome home  mr gresham tell me marytell me at oncehas anything happened i could not ask up there  frank she said and then stopped not being able at the moment to get any further  speak to me honestly mary honestly and bravely i offered you my hand once before there it is again will you take it  she looked wistfully up in his eyes she would fain have taken it but though a girl may be honest in such a case it is so hard for her to be brave  he still held out his hand mary said he if you can value it it shall be yours through good fortune or ill fortune there may be difficulties but if you can love me we will get over them i am a free man free to do as i please with myself except so far as i am bound to you there is my hand will you have it and then he too looked into her eyes and waited composedly as though determined to have an answer  she slowly raised her hand and as she did so her eyes fell to the ground it then drooped again and was again raised and at last her light tapering fingers rested on his broad open palm  they were soon clutched and the whole hand brought absolutely within his grasp there now you are my own he said and none of them shall part us my own mary my own wife  oh frank is not this imprudent is it not wrong  imprudent i am sick of prudence i hate prudence and as for wrongno i say it is not wrong certainly not wrong if we love each other and you do love me maryeh you do dont you  he would not excuse her or allow her to escape from saying it in so many words and when the words did come at last they came freely yes frank i do love you if that were all you would have no cause for fear  and i will have no cause for fear  ah but your father frank and my uncle i can never bring myself to do anything that shall bring either of them to sorrow  frank of course ran through all his arguments he would go into a profession or take a farm and live in it he would wait that is for a few months a few months frank said mary well perhaps six oh frank but frank would not be stopped he would do anything that his father might ask him anything but the one thing he would not give up the wife he had chosen it would not be reasonable or proper or righteous that he should be asked to do so and here he mounted a somewhat high horse  mary had no arguments which she could bring from her heart to offer in opposition to all this she could only leave her hand in his and feel that she was happier than she had been at any time since the day of that donkeyride at boxall hill  but mary continued he becoming very grave and serious we must be true to each other and firm in this nothing that any of them can say shall drive me from my purpose will you say as much  her hand was still in his and so she stood thinking for a moment before she answered him but she could not do less for him than he was willing to do for her yes said shesaid in a very low voice and with a manner perfectly quieti will be firm nothing that they can say shall shake me but frank it cannot be soon  nothing further occurred in this interview which needs recording frank had been three times told by mary that he had better go before he did go and at last she was obliged to take the matter into her own hands and lead him to the door  you are in a great hurry to get rid of me said he  you have been here two hours and you must go now what will they all think  who cares what they think let them think the truth that after a years absence i have much to say to you however at last he did go and mary was left alone  frank although he had been so slow to move had a thousand other things to do and went about them at once he was very much in love no doubt but that did not interfere with his interest in other pursuits in the first place he had to see harry baker and harry bakers stud harry had been specially charged to look after the black horse during franks absence and the holiday doings of that valuable animal had to be inquired into then the kennel of the hounds had to be visited andas a matter of secondrate importancethe master this could not be done on the same day but a plan for doing so must be concocted with harryand then there were two young pointer pups  frank when he left his betrothed went about these things quite as vehemently as though he were not in love at all quite as vehemently as though he had said nothing as to going into some profession which must necessarily separate him from horses and dogs but mary sat there at her window thinking of her love and thinking of nothing else it was all in all to her now she had pledged herself not to be shaken from her troth by anything by any person and it would behove her to be true to this pledge true to it though all the greshams but one should oppose her with all their power true to it even though her own uncle should oppose her  and how could she have done any other than so pledge herself invoked to it as she had been how could she do less for him than he was so anxious to do for her they would talk to her of maiden delicacy and tell her that she had put a stain on that snowwhite coat of proof in confessing her love for one whose friends were unwilling to receive her let them so talk honour honesty and truth outspoken truth selfdenying truth and fealty from man to man are worth more than maiden delicacy more at any rate than the talk of it it was not for herself that this pledge had been made she knew her position and the difficulties of it she knew also the value of it he had much to offer much to give she had nothing but herself he had name and old repute family honour and what eventually would at least be wealth to her she was nameless fameless portionless he had come there with all his ardour with the impulse of his character and asked for her love it was already his own he had then demanded her troth and she acknowledged that he had a right to demand it she would be his if ever it should be in his power to take her  but there let the bargain end she would always remember that though it was in her power to keep her pledge it might too probably not be in his power to keep his that doctrine laid down so imperatively by the great authorities of greshamsbury that edict which demanded that frank should marry money had come home also to her with a certain force it would be sad that the fame of greshamsbury should perish and that the glory should depart from the old house it might be that frank also should perceive that he must marry money it would be a pity that he had not seen it sooner but she at any rate would not complain  and so she stood leaning on the open window with her book unnoticed lying beside her the sun had been in the midsky when frank had left her but its rays were beginning to stream into the room from the west before she moved from her position her first thought in the morning had been this would he come to see her her last now was more soothing to her less full of absolute fear would it be right that he should come again  the first sounds she heard were the footsteps of her uncle as he came up to the drawingroom three steps at a time his step was always heavy but when he was disturbed in spirit it was slow when merely fatigued in body by ordinary work it was quick  what a broiling day he said and he threw himself into a chair for mercys sake give me something to drink now the doctor was a great man for summerdrinks in his house lemonade currantjuice orangemixtures and raspberryvinegar were used by the quart he frequently disapproved of these things for his patients as being apt to disarrange the digestion but he consumed enough himself to throw a large family into such difficulties  haa he ejaculated after a draught im better now well whats the news  youve been out uncle you ought to have the news hows mrs green  really as bad as ennui and solitude can make her  and mrs oaklerath  shes getting better because she has ten children to look after and twins to suckle what has he been doing and the doctor pointed towards the room occupied by sir louis  marys conscience struck her that she had not even asked she had hardly remembered during the whole day that the baronet was in the house i do not think he has been doing much she said janet has been with him all day  has he been drinking  upon my word i dont know uncle i think not for janet has been with him but uncle  well dearbut just give me a little more of that tipple  mary prepared the tumbler and as she handed it to him she said frank gresham has been here today  the doctor swallowed his draught and put down the glass before he made any reply and even then he said but little  oh frank gresham  yes uncle  you thought him looking pretty well  yes uncle he was very well i believe  dr thorne had nothing more to say so he got up and went to his patient in the next room  if he disapproves of it why does he not say so said mary to herself why does he not advise me  but it was not so easy to give advice while sir louis scatcherd was lying there in that state     chapter xxxvii  sir louis leaves greshamsbury   janet had been sedulous in her attentions to sir louis and had not troubled her mistress but she had not had an easy time of it her orders had been that either she or thomas should remain in the room the whole day and those orders had been obeyed  immediately after breakfast the baronet had inquired after his own servant his confounded nose must be right by this time i suppose  it was very bad sir louis said the old woman who imagined that it might be difficult to induce jonah to come into the house again  a man in such a place as his has no business to be laid up said the master with a whine ill see and get a man who wont break his nose  thomas was sent to the inn three or four times but in vain the man was sitting up well enough in the taproom but the middle of his face was covered with streaks of plaster and he could not bring himself to expose his wounds before his conqueror  sir louis began by ordering the woman to bring him chassecafé she offered him coffee as much as he would but no chasse a glass of port wine she said at twelve oclock and another at three had been ordered for him  i dont care a  for the orders said sir louis send me my own man the man was again sent for but would not come theres a bottle of that stuff that i take in that portmanteau in the lefthand cornerjust hand it to me  but janet was not to be done she would give him no stuff except what the doctor had ordered till the doctor came back the doctor would then no doubt give him anything that was proper  sir louis swore a good deal and stormed as much as he could he drank however his two glasses of wine and he got no more once or twice he essayed to get out of bed and dress but at every effort he found that he could not do it without joe and there he was still under the clothes when the doctor returned  ill tell you what it is said he as soon as his guardian entered the room im not going to be made a prisoner of here  a prisoner no surely not  it seems very much like it at present your servant herethat old womantakes it upon her to say shell do nothing without your orders  well shes right there  right i dont know what you call right but i wont stand it you are not going to make a child of me dr thorne so you need not think it  and then there was a long quarrel between them and but an indifferent reconciliation the baronet said that he would go to boxall hill and was vehement in his intention to do so because the doctor opposed it he had not however as yet ferreted out the squire or given a bit of his mind to mr gazebee and it behoved him to do this before he took himself off to his own country mansion he ended therefore by deciding to go on the next day but one  let it be so if you are well enough said the doctor  well enough said the other with a sneer theres nothing to make me ill that i know of it certainly wont be drinking too much here  on the next day sir louis was in a different mood and in one more distressing for the doctor to bear his compelled abstinence from intemperate drinking had no doubt been good for him but his mind had so much sunk under the pain of the privation that his state was piteous to behold he had cried for his servant as a child cries for its nurse till at last the doctor moved to pity had himself gone out and brought the man in from the publichouse but when he did come joe was of but little service to his master as he was altogether prevented from bringing him either wine or spirits and when he searched for the liqueurcase he found that even that had been carried away  i believe you want me to die he said as the doctor sitting by his bedside was trying for the hundredth time to make him understand that he had but one chance of living  the doctor was not the least irritated it would have been as wise to be irritated by the want of reason in a dog  i am doing what i can to save your life he said calmly but as you said just now i have no power over you as long as you are able to move and remain in my house you certainly shall not have the means of destroying yourself you will be very wise to stay here for a week or ten days a week or ten days of healthy living might perhaps bring you round  sir louis again declared that the doctor wished him to die and spoke of sending for his attorney finnie to come to greshamsbury to look after him  send for him if you choose said the doctor his coming will cost you three or four pounds but can do no other harm  and i will send for fillgrave threatened the baronet im not going to die here like a dog  it was certainly hard upon dr thorne that he should be obliged to entertain such a guest in the houseto entertain him and foster him and care for him almost as though he were a son but he had no alternative he had accepted the charge from sir roger and he must go through with it his conscience moreover allowed him no rest in this matter it harassed him day and night driving him on sometimes to great wretchedness he could not love this incubus that was on his shoulders he could not do other than be very far from loving him of what use or value was he to any one what could the world make of him that would be good or he of the world was not an early death his certain fate the earlier it might be would it not be the better  were he to linger on yet for two years longerand such a space of life was possible for himhow great would be the mischief that he might do nay certainly would do farewell then to all hopes for greshamsbury as far as mary was concerned farewell then to that dear scheme which lay deep in the doctors heart that hope that he might in his nieces name give back to the son the lost property of the father and might not one yearsix months be as fatal frank they all said must marry money and even hehe the doctor himself much as he despised the idea for moneys sakeeven he could not but confess that frank as the heir to an old but grievously embarrassed property had no right to marry at his early age a girl without a shilling mary his niece his own child would probably be the heiress of this immense wealth but he could not tell this to frank no nor to franks father while sir louis was yet alive what if by so doing he should achieve this marriage for his niece and that then sir louis should live to dispose of his own how then would he face the anger of lady arabella  i will never hanker after a dead mans shoes neither for myself nor for another he had said to himself a hundred times and as often did he accuse himself of doing so one path however was plainly open before him he would keep his peace as to the will and would use such efforts as he might use for a son of his own loins to preserve the life that was so valueless his wishes his hopes his thoughts he could not control but his conduct was at his own disposal  i say doctor you dont really think that im going to die sir louis said when dr thorne again visited him  i dont think at all i am sure you will kill yourself if you continue to live as you have lately done  but suppose i go all right for a while and livelive just as you tell me you know  all of us are in gods hands sir louis by so doing you will at any rate give yourself the best chance  best chance why dn doctor there are fellows have done ten times worse than i and they are not going to kick come now i know you are trying to frighten me aint you now  i am trying to do the best i can for you  its very hard on a fellow like me i have nobody to say a kind word to me no not one and sir louis in his wretchedness began to weep come doctor if youll put me once more on my legs ill let you draw on the estate for five hundred pounds by g i will  the doctor went away to his dinner and the baronet also had his in bed he could not eat much but he was allowed two glasses of wine and also a little brandy in his coffee this somewhat invigorated him and when dr thorne again went to him in the evening he did not find him so utterly prostrated in spirit he had indeed made up his mind to a great resolve and thus unfolded his final scheme for his own reformation  doctor he began again i believe you are an honest fellow i do indeed  dr thorne could not but thank him for his good opinion  you aint annoyed at what i said this morning are you  the doctor had forgotten the particular annoyance to which sir louis alluded and informed him that his mind might be at rest on any such matter  i do believe youd be glad to see me well wouldnt you now  the doctor assured him that such was in very truth the case  well now ill tell you what ive been thinking about it a great deal today indeed i have and i want to do whats right mightnt i have a little drop more of that stuff just in a cup of coffee  the doctor poured him out a cup of coffee and put about a teaspoonful of brandy in it sir louis took it with a disconsolate face not having been accustomed to such measures in the use of his favourite beverage  i do wish to do whats righti do indeed only you see im so lonely as to those fellows up in london i dont think that one of them cares a straw about me  dr thorne was of the same way of thinking and he said so he could not but feel some sympathy with the unfortunate man as he thus spoke of his own lot it was true that he had been thrown on the world without any one to take care of him  my dear friend i will do the best i can in every way i will indeed i do believe that your companions in town have been too ready to lead you astray drop them and you may yet do well  may i though doctor well i will drop them theres jenkins hes the best of them but even he is always wanting to make money of me not but what im up to the best of them in that way  you had better leave london sir louis and change your old mode of life go to boxall hill for a while for two or three years or so live with your mother there and take to farming  what farming  yes thats what all country gentlemen do take the land there into your own hand and occupy your mind upon it  well doctor i willupon one condition  dr thorne sat still and listened he had no idea what the condition might be but he was not prepared to promise acquiescence till he heard it  you know what i told you once before said the baronet  i dont remember at this moment  about my getting married you know  the doctors brow grew black and promised no help to the poor wretch bad in every way wretched selfish sensual unfeeling purseproud ignorant as sir louis scatcherd was still there was left to him the power of feeling something like sincere love it may be presumed that he did love mary thorne and that he was at the time earnest in declaring that if she could be given to him he would endeavour to live according to her uncles counsel it was only a trifle he asked but alas that trifle could not be vouchsafed  i should much approve of your getting married but i do not know how i can help you  of course i mean to miss mary i do love her i really do dr thorne  it is quite impossible sir louis quite you do my niece much honour but i am able to answer for her positively that such a proposition is quite out of the question  look here now dr thorne anything in the way of settlements  i will not hear a word on the subject you are very welcome to the use of my house as long as it may suit you to remain here but i must insist that my niece shall not be troubled on this matter  do you mean to say shes in love with that young gresham  this was too much for the doctors patience sir louis said he i can forgive you much for your fathers sake i can also forgive something on the score of your own ill health but you ought to know you ought by this time to have learnt that there are some things which a man cannot forgive i will not talk to you about my niece and remember this also i will not have her troubled by you and so saying the doctor left him  on the next day the baronet was sufficiently recovered to be able to resume his braggadocio airs he swore at janet insisted on being served by his own man demanded in a loud voice but in vain that his liqueurcase should be restored to him and desired that posthorses might be ready for him on the morrow on that day he got up and ate his dinner in his bedroom on the next morning he countermanded the horses informing the doctor that he did so because he had a little bit of business to transact with squire gresham before he left the place with some difficulty the doctor made him understand that the squire would not see him on business and it was at last decided that mr gazebee should be invited to call on him at the doctors house and this mr gazebee agreed to do in order to prevent the annoyance of having the baronet up at greshamsbury  on this day the evening before mr gazebees visit sir louis condescended to come down to dinner he dined however têteàtête with the doctor mary was not there nor was anything said as to her absence sir louis scatcherd never set eyes upon her again  he bore himself very arrogantly on that evening having resumed the airs and wouldbe dignity which he thought belonged to him as a man of rank and property in his periods of low spirits he was abject and humble enough abject and fearful of the lamentable destiny which at these moments he believed to be in store for him but it was one of the peculiar symptoms of his state that as he partially recovered his bodily health the tone of his mind recovered itself also and his fears for the time were relieved  there was very little said between him and the doctor that evening the doctor sat guarding the wine and thinking when he should have his house to himself again sir louis sat moody every now and then uttering some impertinence as to the greshams and the greshamsbury property and at an early hour allowed joe to put him to bed  the horses were ordered on the next day for three and at two mr gazebee came to the house he had never been there before nor had he ever met dr thorne except at the squires dinner on this occasion he asked only for the baronet  ah ah im glad youre come mr gazebee very glad said sir louis acting the part of the rich great man with all the power he had i want to ask you a few questions so as to make it all clear sailing between us  as you have asked to see me i have come sir louis said the other putting on much dignity as he spoke but would it not be better that any business there may be should be done among the lawyers  the lawyers are very well i dare say but when a man has so large a stake at interest as i have in this greshamsbury property why you see mr gazebee he feels a little inclined to look after it himself now do you know mr gazebee how much it is that mr gresham owes me  mr gazebee of course did know very well but he was not going to discuss the subject with sir louis if he could help it  whatever claim your fathers estate may have on that of mr gresham is as far as i understand vested in dr thornes hands as trustee i am inclined to believe that you have not yourself at present any claim on greshamsbury the interest as it becomes due is paid to dr thorne and if i may be allowed to make a suggestion i would say that it will not be expedient to make any change in that arrangement till the property shall come into your own hands  i differ from you entirely mr gazebee in toto as we used to say at eton what you mean to say isi cant go to law with mr gresham im not so sure of that but perhaps not but i can compel dr thorne to look after my interests i can force him to foreclose and to tell you the truth gazebee unless some arrangement is proposed to me which i shall think advantageous i shall do so at once there is near a hundred thousand pounds owing to me yes to me thorne is only a name in the matter the money is my money and by  i mean to look after it  have you any doubt sir louis as to the money being secure  yes i have it isnt so easy to have a hundred thousand pounds secured the squire is a poor man and i dont choose to allow a poor man to owe me such a sum as that besides i mean to invest it in land i tell you fairly therefore i shall foreclose  mr gazebee using all the perspicuity which his professional education had left to him tried to make sir louis understand that he had no power to do anything of the kind  no power mr gresham shall see whether i have no power when a man has a hundred thousand pounds owing to him he ought to have some power and as i take it he has but we will see perhaps you know finnie do you  mr gazebee with a good deal of scorn in his face said that he had not that pleasure mr finnie was not in his line  well you will know him then and youll find hes sharp enough that is unless i have some offer made to me that i may choose to accept mr gazebee declared that he was not instructed to make any offer and so he took his leave  on that afternoon sir louis went off to boxall hill transferring the miserable task of superintending his selfdestruction from the shoulders of the doctor to those of his mother of lady scatcherd the baronet took no account in his proposed sojourn in the country nor did he take much of the doctor in leaving greshamsbury he again wrapped himself in his furs and with tottering steps climbed up into the barouche which was to carry him away  is my man up behind he said to janet while the doctor was standing at the little front gardengate making his adieux  no sir hes not up yet said janet respectfully  then send him out will you i cant lose my time waiting here all day  i shall come over to boxall hill and see you said the doctor whose heart softened towards the man in spite of his brutality as the hour of his departure came  i shall be happy to see you if you like to come of course that is in the way of visiting and that sort of thing as for doctoring if i want any i shall send for fillgrave such were his last words as the carriage with a rush went off from the door  the doctor as he reentered the house could not avoid smiling for he thought of dr fillgraves last patient at boxall hill its a question to me said he to himself whether dr fillgrave will ever be induced to make another visit to that house even with the object of rescuing a baronet out of my hands  hes gone isnt he uncle said mary coming out of her room  yes my dear hes gone poor fellow  he may be a poor fellow uncle but hes a very disagreeable inmate in a house i have not had any dinner these two days  and i havent had what can be called a cup of tea since hes been in the house but ill make up for that tonight     chapter xxxviii  de courcy precepts and de courcy practice   there is a mode of novelwriting which used to be much in vogue but which has now gone out of fashion it is nevertheless one which is very expressive when in good hands and which enables the author to tell his story or some portion of his story with more natural trust than any other i mean that of familiar letters i trust i shall be excused if i attempt it as regards this one chapter though it may be that i shall break down and fall into the commonplace narrative even before the one chapter be completed the correspondents are the lady amelia de courcy and miss gresham i of course give precedence to the higher rank but the first epistle originated with the latternamed young lady let me hope that they will explain themselves      miss gresham to lady amelia de courcy     greshamsbury house june 185     my dearest amelia     i wish to consult you on a subject which as you will    perceive is of a most momentous nature you know how much    reliance i place in your judgement and knowledge of what    is proper and therefore i write to you before speaking    to any other living person on the subject not even to    mamma for although her judgement is good too she has so    many cares and troubles that it is natural that it should    be a little warped when the interests of her children are    concerned now that it is all over i feel that it may    possibly have been so in the case of mr moffat     you are aware that mr mortimer gazebee is now staying    here and that he has been here for nearly two months he    is engaged in managing poor papas affairs and mamma who    likes him very much says that he is a most excellent man    of business of course you know that he is the junior    partner in the very old firm of gumption gazebee     gazebee who i understand do not undertake any business    at all except what comes to them from peers or commoners    of the very highest class     i soon perceived dearest amelia that mr gazebee paid me    more than ordinary attention and i immediately became    very guarded in my manner i certainly liked mr gazebee    from the first his manners are quite excellent his    conduct to mamma is charming and as regards myself i    must say that there has been nothing in his behaviour of    which even you could complain he has never attempted    the slightest familiarity and i will do him the justice    to say that though he has been very attentive he has    also been very respectful     i must confess that for the last three weeks i have    thought that he meant something i might perhaps have    done more to repel him or i might have consulted you    earlier as to the propriety of keeping altogether out of    his way but you know amelia how often these things lead    to nothing and though i thought all along that mr gazebee    was in earnest i hardly liked to say anything about it    even to you till i was quite certain if you had advised    me you know to accept his offer and if after that he    had never made it i should have felt so foolish     but now he has made it he came to me yesterday just    before dinner in the little drawingroom and told me in    the most delicate manner in words that even you could not    have but approved that his highest ambition was to be    thought worthy of my regard and that he felt for me the    warmest love and the most profound admiration and the    deepest respect you may say amelia that he is only an    attorney and i believe that he is an attorney but i am    sure you would have esteemed him had you heard the very    delicate way in which he expressed his sentiments     something had given me a presentiment of what he was going    to do when i saw him come into the room so that i was    on my guard i tried very hard to show no emotion but i    suppose i was a little flurried as i once detected myself    calling him mr mortimer his name you know is mortimer    gazebee i ought not to have done so certainly but it    was not so bad as if i had called him mortimer without    the mr was it i dont think there could possibly be a    prettier christian name than mortimer well amelia i    allowed him to express himself without interruption he    once attempted to take my hand but even this was done    without any assumption of familiarity and when he saw    that i would not permit it he drew back and fixed his    eyes on the ground as though he were ashamed even of that     of course i had to give him an answer and though i had    expected that something of this sort would take place    i had not made up my mind on the subject i would not    certainly under any circumstances accept him without    consulting you if i really disliked him of course there    would be no doubt but i cant say dearest amelia that    i do absolutely dislike him and i really think that we    would make each other very happy if the marriage were    suitable as regarded both our positions     i collected myself as well as i could and i really do    think that you would have said that i did not behave    badly though the position was rather trying i told him    that of course i was flattered by his sentiments though    much surprised at hearing them that since i knew him i    had esteemed and valued him as an acquaintance but that    looking on him as a man of business i had never expected    anything more i then endeavoured to explain to him that    i was not perhaps privileged as some other girls might    be to indulge my own feelings altogether perhaps that    was saying too much and might make him think that i was    in love with him but from the way i said it i dont    think he would for i was very much guarded in my manner    and very collected and then i told him that in any    proposal of marriage that might be made to me it would    be my duty to consult my family as much if not more than    myself     he said of course and asked whether he might speak to    papa i tried to make him understand that in talking of    my family i did not exactly mean papa or even mamma    of course i was thinking of what was due to the name of    gresham i know very well what papa would say he would    give his consent in half a minute he is so brokenhearted    by these debts and to tell you the truth amelia i    think mamma would too he did not seem quite to comprehend    what i meant but he did say that he knew it was a high    ambition to marry into the family of the greshams i    am sure you would confess that he has the most proper    feelings and as for expressing them no man could do it    better     he owned that it was ambition to ally himself with a    family above his own rank in life and that he looked to    doing so as a means of advancing himself now this was at    any rate honest that was one of his motives he said    though of course not his first and then he declared    how truly attached he was to me in answer to this i    remarked that he had known me only a very short time    this perhaps was giving him too much encouragement but    at that moment i hardly knew what to say for i did not    wish to hurt his feelings he then spoke of his income    he has fifteen hundred a year from the business and that    will be greatly increased when his father leaves it and    his father is much older than mr gumption though he is    only the second partner mortimer gazebee will be the    senior partner himself before very long and perhaps that    does alter his position a little     he has a very nice place down somewhere in surrey i have    heard mamma say it is quite a gentlemans place it is let    now but he will live there when he is married and he    has property of his own besides which he can settle so    you see he is quite as well off as mr oriel better    indeed and if a man is in a profession i believe it is    considered that it does not much matter what of course a    clergyman can be a bishop but then i think i have heard    that one attorney did once become lord chancellor i    should have my carriage you know i remember his saying    that especially though i cannot recollect how he brought    it in     i told him at last that i was so much taken by surprise    that i could not give him an answer then he was going    up to london he said on the next day and might he    be permitted to address me on the same subject when he    returned i could not refuse him you know and so now i    have taken the opportunity of his absence to write to you    for your advice you understand the world so very well    and know so exactly what one ought to do in such a strange    position     i hope i have made it intelligible at least as to what    i have written about i have said nothing as to my own    feelings because i wish you to think on the matter    without consulting them if it would be derogatory to    accept mr gazebee i certainly would not do so because i    happen to like him if we were to act in that way what    would the world come to amelia perhaps my ideas may be    overstrained if so you will tell me     when mr oriel proposed for beatrice nobody seemed to make    any objection it all seemed to go as a matter of course    she says that his family is excellent but as far as i can    learn his grandfather was a general in india and came    home very rich mr gazebees grandfather was a member of    the firm and so i believe was his greatgrandfather    dont you think this ought to count for something    besides they have no business except with the most    aristocratic persons such as uncle de courcy and the    marquis of kensington gore and that sort i mention the    marquis because mr mortimer gazebee is there now and i    know that one of the gumptions was once in parliament and    i dont think that any of the oriels ever were the name    of attorney is certainly very bad is it not amelia but    they certainly do not seem to be all the same and i do    think that this ought to make a difference to hear mr    mortimer gazebee talk of some attorney at barchester you    would say that there is quite as much difference between    them as between a bishop and a curate and so i think    there is     i dont wish at all to speak of my own feelings but if he    were not an attorney he is i think the sort of man i    should like he is very nice in every way and if you were    not told i dont think youd know he was an attorney    but dear amelia i will be guided by you altogether he    is certainly much nicer than mr moffat and has a great    deal more to say for himself of course mr moffat having    been in parliament and having been taken up by uncle    de courcy was in a different sphere but i really felt    almost relieved when he behaved in that way with mortimer    gazebee i think it would be different     i shall wait so impatiently for your answer so do pray    write at once i hear some people say that these sort of    things are not so much thought of now as they were once    and that all manner of marriages are considered to be    comme il faut i do not want you know to make myself    foolish by being too particular perhaps all these changes    are bad and i rather think they are but if the world    changes one must change too one cant go against the    world     so do write and tell me what you think do not suppose    that i dislike the man for i really cannot say that i do    but i would not for anything make an alliance for which    any one bearing the name of de courcy would have to blush     always dearest amelia     your most affectionate cousin     augusta gresham     psi fear frank is going to be very foolish with mary    thorne you know it is absolutely important that frank    should marry money     it strikes me as quite possible that mortimer gazebee may    be in parliament some of these days he is just the man    for it   poor augusta prayed very hard for her husband but she prayed to a bosom that on this subject was as hard as a flint and she prayed in vain augusta gresham was twentytwo lady amelia de courcy was thirtyfour was it likely that lady amelia would permit augusta to marry the issue having thus been left in her hands why should augusta derogate from her position by marrying beneath herself seeing that lady amelia had spent so many more years in the world without having found it necessary to do so augustas letter was written on two sheets of notepaper crossed all over and lady amelias answer was almost equally formidable      lady amelia de courcy to miss augusta gresham     courcy castle june 185     my dear augusta     i received your letter yesterday morning but i have put    off answering it till this evening as i have wished to    give it very mature consideration the question is one    which concerns not only your character but happiness    for life and nothing less than very mature consideration    would justify me in giving a decided opinion on the    subject     in the first place i may tell you that i have not a word    to say against mr mortimer gazebee when augusta had read    as far as this her heart sank within her the rest was    all leather and prunella she saw at once that the fiat    had gone against her and that her wish to become mrs    mortimer gazebee was not to be indulged i have known    him for a long time and i believe him to be a very    respectable person and i have no doubt a good man of    business the firm of messrs gumption  gazebee stands    probably quite among the first attorneys in london and i    know that papa has a very high opinion of them     all of these would be excellent arguments to use in favour    of mr gazebee as a suitor had his proposals been made to    any one in his own rank of life but you in considering    the matter should i think look on it in a very    different light the very fact that you pronounce him to    be so much superior to other attorneys shows in how very    low esteem you hold the profession in general it shows    also dear augusta how well aware you are that they are a    class of people among whom you should not seek a partner    for life     my opinion is that you should make mr gazebee    understandvery courteously of coursethat you cannot    accept his hand you observe that he himself confesses    that in marrying you he would seek a wife in a rank above    his own is it not therefore clear that in marrying    him you would descend to a rank below your own     i shall be very sorry if this grieves you but still    it will be better that you should bear the grief of    overcoming a temporary fancy than take a step which may    so probably make you unhappy and which some of your    friends would certainly regard as disgraceful     it is not permitted to us my dear augusta to think of    ourselves in such matters as you truly say if we were    to act in that way what would the world come to it has    been gods pleasure that we should be born with high blood    in our veins this is a great boon which we both value    but the boon has its responsibilities as well as its    privileges it is established by law that the royal    family shall not intermarry with subjects in our case    there is no law but the necessity is not the less felt    we should not intermarry with those who are probably    of a lower rank mr mortimer gazebee is after all    only an attorney and although you speak of his    greatgrandfather he is a man of no blood whatsoever you    must acknowledge that such an admixture should be looked    on by a de courcy or even by a gresham as a pollution    here augusta got very red and she felt almost inclined    to be angry with her cousin beatrices marriage with mr    oriel is different though remember i am by no means    defending that it may be good or bad and i have had no    opportunity of inquiring respecting mr oriels family    beatrice moreover has never appeared to me to feel    what was due to herself in such matters but as i    said her marriage with mr oriel is very different    clergymenparticularly the rectors and vicars of country    parishesdo become privileged above other professional    men i could explain why but it would be too long in a    letter     your feelings on the subject altogether do you great    credit i have no doubt that mr gresham if asked would    accede to the match but that is just the reason why he    should not be asked it would not be right that i should    say anything against your father to you but it is    impossible for any of us not to see that all through life    he has thrown away every advantage and sacrificed his    family why is he now in debt as you say why is he not    holding the family seat in parliament even though you are    his daughter you cannot but feel that you would not do    right to consult him on such a subject     as to dear aunt i feel sure that were she in good    health and left to exercise her own judgement she would    not wish to see you married to the agent for the family    estate for dear augusta that is the real truth mr    gazebee often comes here in the way of business and    though papa always receives him as a gentlemanthat is    he dines at table and all thathe is not on the same    footing in the house as the ordinary guests and friends of    the family how would you like to be received at courcy    castle in the same way     you will say perhaps that you would still be papas    niece so you would but you know how strict in such    matters papa is and you must remember that the wife    always follows the rank of the husband papa is accustomed    to the strict etiquette of a court and i am sure that no    consideration would induce him to receive the estateagent    in the light of a nephew indeed were you to marry mr    gazebee the house to which he belongs would i imagine    have to give up the management of this property     even were mr gazebee in parliamentand i do not see how    it is probable that he should get thereit would not make    any difference you must remember dearest that i never    was an advocate for the moffat match i acquiesced in it    because mamma did so if i could have had my own way    i would adhere to all our old prescriptive principles    neither money nor position can atone to me for low birth    but the world alas is retrograding and according to    the newfangled doctrines of the day a lady of blood is    not disgraced by allying herself to a man of wealth and    what may be called quasiaristocratic position i wish it    were otherwise but so it is and therefore the match    with mr moffat was not disgraceful though it could not be    regarded as altogether satisfactory     but with mr gazebee the matter would be altogether    different he is a man earning his bread honestly i    dare say but in a humble position you say he is very    respectable i do not doubt it and so is mr scraggs    the butcher at courcy you see augusta to what such    arguments reduce you     i dare say he may be nicer than mr moffat in one way    that is he may have more smalltalk at his command and    be more clever in all those little pursuits and amusements    which are valued by ordinary young ladies but my    opinion is that neither i nor you would be justified in    sacrificing ourselves for such amusements we have high    duties before us it may be that the performance of those    duties will prohibit us from taking a part in the ordinary    arena of the feminine world it is natural that girls    should wish to marry and therefore those who are weak    take the first that come those who have more judgement    make some sort of selection but the strongestminded are    perhaps those who are able to forgo themselves and their    own fancies and to refrain from any alliance that does    not tend to the maintenance of high principles of course    i speak of those who have blood in their veins you and i    need not dilate as to the conduct of others     i hope what i have said will convince you indeed i know    that it only requires that you and i should have a little    cousinly talk on this matter to be quite in accord you    must now remain at greshamsbury till mr gazebee shall    return immediately that he does so seek an interview    with him do not wait till he asks for it then tell him    that when he addressed you the matter had taken you so    much by surprise that you were not at the moment able to    answer him with that decision that the subject demanded    tell him that you are flatteredin saying this however    you must keep a collected countenance and be very cold    in your mannerbut that family reasons would forbid you    to avail yourself of his offer even did no other cause    prevent it     and then dear augusta come to us here i know you    will be a little downhearted after going through this    struggle but i will endeavour to inspirit you when we    are both together you will feel more sensibly the value    of that high position which you will preserve by rejecting    mr gazebee and will regret less acutely whatever you may    lose     your very affectionate cousin     amelia de courcy     psi am greatly grieved about frank but i have long    feared that he would do some very silly thing i have    heard lately that miss mary thorne is not even the    legitimate niece of your dr thorne but is the daughter    of some poor creature who was seduced by the doctor in    barchester i do not know how true this may be but i    think your brother should be put on his guard it might do    good   poor augusta she was in truth to be pitied for her efforts were made with the intention of doing right according to her lights for mr moffat she had never cared a straw and when therefore she lost the piece of gilding for which she had been instructed by her mother to sell herself it was impossible to pity her but mr gazebee she would have loved with that sort of love which it was in her power to bestow with him she would have been happy respectable and contented  she had written her letter with great care when the offer was made to her she could not bring herself to throw lady amelia to the winds and marry the man as it were out of her own head lady amelia had been the tyrant of her life and so she strove hard to obtain her tyrants permission she used all her little cunning in showing that after all mr gazebee was not so very plebeian all her little cunning was utterly worthless lady amelias mind was too strong to be caught with such chaff augusta could not serve god and mammon she must either be true to the god of her cousins idolatry and remain single or serve the mammon of her own inclinations and marry mr gazebee  when refolding her cousins letter after the first perusal she did for a moment think of rebellion could she not be happy at the nice place in surrey having as she would have a carriage even though all the de courcys should drop her it had been put to her that she would not like to be received at courcy castle with the scant civility which would be considered due to a mrs mortimer gazebee but what if she could put up without being received at courcy castle at all such ideas did float through her mind dimly  but her courage failed her it is so hard to throw off a tyrant so much easier to yield when we have been in the habit of yielding this third letter therefore was written and it is the end of the correspondence      miss augusta gresham to lady amelia de courcy     greshamsbury house july 185     my dearest amelia     i did not answer your letter before because i thought it    better to delay doing so till mr gazebee had been here    he came the day before yesterday and yesterday i did    as nearly as possible what you advised perhaps on    the whole it will be better as you say rank has its    responsibilities as well as its privileges     i dont quite understand what you mean about clergymen    but we can talk that over when we meet indeed it seems    to me that if one is to be particular about familyand    i am sure i think we oughtone ought to be so without    exception if mr oriel be a parvenu beatrices    children wont be well born merely because their father    was a clergyman even though he is a rector since    my former letter i have heard that mr gazebees    greatgreatgreatgrandfather established the firm and    there are many people who were nobodies then who are    thought to have good blood in their veins now     but i do not say this because i differ from you i agree    with you so fully that i at once made up my mind to    reject the man and consequently i have done so     when i told him i could not accept him from family    considerations he asked me whether i had spoken to papa    i told him no and that it would be no good as i had    made up my own mind i dont think he quite understood me    but it did not perhaps much matter you told me to be very    cold and i think that perhaps he thought me less gracious    than before indeed i fear that when he first spoke    i may seem to have given him too much encouragement    however it is all over now quite over as augusta wrote    this she barely managed to save the paper beneath her    hand from being moistened with the tear which escaped from    her eye     i do not mind confessing now she continued at any rate    to you that i did like mr gazebee a little i think his    temper and disposition would have suited me but i am    quite satisfied that i have done right he tried very hard    to make me change my mind that is he said a great many    things as to whether i would not put off my decision but    i was quite firm i must say that he behaved very well    and that i really do think he liked me honestly and truly    but of course i could not sacrifice family    considerations on that account     yes rank has its responsibilities as well as its    privileges i will remember that it is necessary to do    so as otherwise one would be without consolation for what    one has to suffer for i find that one has to suffer    amelia i know papa would have advised me to marry this    man and so i dare say mamma would and frank and    beatrice if they knew that i liked him it would not be    so bad if we all thought alike about it but it is hard to    have the responsibilities all on ones own shoulder is it    not     but i will go over to you and you will comfort me i    always feel stronger on this subject at courcy than at    greshamsbury we will have a long talk about it and then    i shall be happy again i purpose going on next friday if    that will suit you and dear aunt i have told mamma that    you all wanted me and she made no objection do write at    once dearest amelia for to hear from you now will be my    only comfort     yours ever most affectionately and obliged     augusta gresham     psi told mamma what you said about mary thorne and    she said yes i suppose all the world knows it now and    if all the world did know it it makes no difference to    frank she seemed very angry so you see it was true   though by so doing we shall somewhat anticipate the end of our story it may be desirable that the full tale of mr gazebees loves should be told here when mary is breaking her heart on her deathbed in the last chapter or otherwise accomplishing her destiny we shall hardly find a fit opportunity of saying much about mr gazebee and his aristocratic bride  for he did succeed at last in obtaining a bride in whose veins ran the noble ichor of de courcy blood in spite of the high doctrine preached so eloquently by the lady amelia as augusta had truly said he had failed to understand her he was led to think by her manner of receiving his first proposaland justly so enoughthat she liked him and would accept him and he was therefore rather perplexed by his second interview he tried again and again and begged permission to mention the matter to mr gresham but augusta was very firm and he at last retired in disgust augusta went to courcy castle and received from her cousin that consolation and restrengthening which she so much required  four years afterwardslong after the fate of mary thorne had fallen like a thunderbolt on the inhabitants of greshamsbury when beatrice was preparing for her second baby and each of the twins had her accepted lovermr mortimer gazebee went down to courcy castle of course on matters of business no doubt he dined at the table and all that we have the word of lady amelia that the earl with his usual goodnature allowed him such privileges let us hope that he never encroached on them  but on this occasion mr gazebee stayed a long time at the castle and singular rumours as to the cause of his prolonged visit became current in the little town no female scion of the present family of courcy had as yet found a mate we may imagine that eagles find it difficult to pair when they become scarce in their localities and we all know how hard it has sometimes been to get comme il faut husbands when there has been any number of protestant princesses on hand  some such difficulty had doubtless brought it about that the countess was still surrounded by her full bevy of maidens rank has its responsibilities as well as its privileges and these young ladies responsibilities seemed to have consisted in rejecting any suitor who may have hitherto kneeled to them but now it was told through courcy that one suitor had kneeled and not in vain from courcy the rumour flew to barchester and thence came down to greshamsbury startling the inhabitants and making one poor heart throb with a violence that would have been piteous had it been known the suitor so named was mr mortimer gazebee  yes mr mortimer gazebee had now awarded to him many other privileges than those of dining at the table and all that he rode with the young ladies in the park and they all talked to him very familiarly before company all except the lady amelia the countess even called him mortimer and treated him quite as one of the family  at last came a letter from the countess to her dear sister arabella it should be given at length but that i fear to introduce another epistle it is such an easy mode of writing and facility is always dangerous in this letter it was announced with much preliminary ambiguity that mortimer gazebeewho had been found to be a treasure in every way quite a paragon of menwas about to be taken into the de courcy bosom as a child of that house on that day fortnight he was destined to lead to the altarthe lady amelia  the countess then went on to say that dear amelia did not write herself being so much engaged by her coming dutiesthe responsibilities of which she doubtless fully realised as well as the privileges but she had begged her mother to request that the twins should come and act as bridesmaids on the occasion dear augusta she knew was too much occupied in the coming event in mr oriels family to be able to attend  mr mortimer gazebee was taken into the de courcy family and did lead the lady amelia to the altar and the gresham twins did go there and act as bridesmaids and which is much more to say for human nature augusta did forgive her cousin and after a certain interval went on a visit to that nice place in surrey which she had once hoped would be her own home it would have been a very nice place augusta thought had not lady amelia gazebee been so very economical  we must presume that there was some explanation between them if so augusta yielded to it and confessed it to be satisfactory she had always yielded to her cousin and loved her with that sort of love which is begotten between fear and respect anything was better than quarrelling with her cousin amelia  and mr mortimer gazebee did not altogether make a bad bargain he never received a shilling of dowry but that he had not expected nor did he want it his troubles arose from the overstrained economy of his noble wife she would have it that as she had married a poor manmr gazebee however was not a poor manit behoved her to manage her house with great care such a match as that she had madethis she told in confidence to augustahad its responsibilities as well as its privileges  but on the whole mr gazebee did not repent his bargain when he asked his friends to dine he could tell them that lady amelia would be very glad to see them his marriage gave him some éclat at his club and some additional weight in the firm to which he belonged he gets his share of the courcy shooting and is asked about to greshamsbury and other barsetshire houses not only to dine at table and all that but to take his part in whatever delights country society there has to offer he lives with the great hope that his noble fatherinlaw may some day be able to bring him into parliament     chapter xxxix  what the world says about blood   beatrice said frank rushing suddenly into his sisters room i want you to do me one especial favour this was three or four days after frank had seen mary thorne since that time he had spoken to none of his family on the subject but he was only postponing from day to day the task of telling his father he had now completed his round of visits to the kennel master huntsman and stables of the county hunt and was at liberty to attend to his own affairs so he had decided on speaking to the squire that very day but he first made his request to his sister  i want you to do me one especial favour the day for beatrices marriage had now been fixed and it was not to be very distant mr oriel had urged that their honeymoon trip would lose half its delights if they did not take advantage of the fine weather and beatrice had nothing to allege in answer the day had just been fixed and when frank ran into her room with his special request she was not in a humour to refuse him anything  if you wish me to be at your wedding you must do it said he  wish you to be there you must be there of course oh frank what do you mean ill do anything you ask if it is not to go to the moon or anything of that sort  frank was too much in earnest to joke you must have mary for one of your bridesmaids he said now mind there may be some difficulty but you must insist on it i know what has been going on but it is not to be borne that she should be excluded on such a day as that you that have been like sisters all your lives till a year ago  but frank  now beatrice dont have any buts say that you will do it and it will be done i am sure oriel will approve and so will my father  but frank you wont hear me  not if you make objections i have set my heart on your doing it  but i had set my heart on the same thing  well  and i went to mary on purpose and told her just as you tell me now that she must come i meant to make mamma understand that i could not be happy unless it were so but mary positively refused  refused what did she say  i could not tell you what she said indeed it would not be right if i could but she positively declined she seemed to feel that after all that had happened she never could come to greshamsbury again  fiddlestick  but frank those are her feelings and to tell the truth i could not combat them i know she is not happy but time will cure that and to tell you the truth frank  it was before i came back that you asked her was it not  yes just the day before you came i think  well its all altered now i have seen her since that  have you frank  what do you take me for of course i have the very first day i went to her and now beatrice you may believe me or not as you like but if i ever marry i shall marry mary thorne and if ever she marries i think i may say she will marry me at any rate i have her promise and now you cannot be surprised that i should wish her to be at your wedding or that i should declare that if she is absent i will be absent i dont want any secrets and you may tell my mother if you like itand all the de courcys too for anything i care  frank had ever been used to command his sisters and they especially beatrice had ever been used to obey on this occasion she was well inclined to do so if she only knew how she again remembered how mary had once sworn to be at her wedding to be near her and to touch hereven though all the blood of the de courcys should be crowded before the altar railings  i should be so happy that she should be there but what am i to do frank if she refuses i have asked her and she has refused  go to her again you need not have any scruples with her do not i tell you she will be your sister not come here again to greshamsbury why i tell you that she will be living here while you are living there at the parsonage for years and years to come  beatrice promised that she would go to mary again and that she would endeavour to talk her mother over if mary would consent to come but she could not yet make herself believe that mary thorne would ever be mistress of greshamsbury it was so indispensably necessary that frank should marry money besides what were those horrid rumours which were now becoming rife as to marys birth rumours more horrid than any which had yet been heard  augusta had said hardly more than the truth when she spoke of her father being brokenhearted by his debts his troubles were becoming almost too many for him and mr gazebee though no doubt he was an excellent man of business did not seem to lessen them mr gazebee indeed was continually pointing out how much he owed and in what a quagmire of difficulties he had entangled himself now to do mr yates umbleby justice he had never made himself disagreeable in this manner  mr gazebee had been doubtless right when he declared that sir louis scatcherd had not himself the power to take any steps hostile to the squire but sir louis had also been right when he boasted that in spite of his fathers will he could cause others to move in the matter others did move and were moving and it began to be understood that a moiety at least of the remaining greshamsbury property must be sold even this however would by no means leave the squire in undisturbed possession of the other moiety and thus mr gresham was nearly brokenhearted  frank had now been at home a week and his father had not as yet spoken to him about the family troubles nor had a word as yet been said between them as to mary thorne it had been agreed that frank should go away for twelve months in order that he might forget her he had been away the twelvemonth and had now returned not having forgotten her  it generally happens that in every household one subject of importance occupies it at a time the subject of importance now mostly thought of in the greshamsbury household was the marriage of beatrice lady arabella had to supply the trousseau for her daughter the squire had to supply the money for the trousseau mr gazebee had the task of obtaining the money for the squire while this was going on mr gresham was not anxious to talk to his son either about his own debts or his sons love there would be time for these things when the marriagefeast should be over  so thought the father but the matter was precipitated by frank he also had put off the declaration which he had to make partly from a wish to spare the squire but partly also with a view to spare himself we have all some of that cowardice which induces us to postpone an inevitably evil day at this time the discussions as to beatrices wedding were frequent in the house and at one of them frank had heard his mother repeat the names of the proposed bridesmaids marys name was not among them and hence had arisen his attack on his sister  lady arabella had had her reason for naming the list before her son but she overshot her mark she wished to show him how totally mary was forgotten at greshamsbury but she only inspired him with a resolve that she should not be forgotten he accordingly went to his sister and then the subject being full on his mind he resolved at once to discuss it with his father  sir are you at leisure for five minutes he said entering the room in which the squire was accustomed to sit majestically to receive his tenants scold his dependants and in which in former happy days he had always arranged the meets of the barsetshire hunt  mr gresham was quite at leisure when was he not so but had he been immersed in the deepest business of which he was capable he would gladly have put it aside at his sons instance  i dont like to have any secret from you sir said frank nor for the matter of that from anybody elsethe anybody else was intended to have reference to his motherand therefore i would rather tell you at once what i have made up my mind to do  franks address was very abrupt and he felt it was so he was rather red in the face and his manner was fluttered he had quite made up his mind to break the whole affair to his father but he had hardly made up his mind as to the best mode of doing so  good heavens frank what do you mean you are not going to do anything rash what is it you mean frank  i dont think it is rash said frank  sit down my boy sit down what is it that you say you are going to do  nothing immediately sir said he rather abashed but as i have made up my mind about mary thornequite made up my mind i think it right to tell you  oh about mary said the squire almost relieved  and then frank in voluble language which he hardly however had quite under his command told his father all that had passed between him and mary you see sir said he that it is fixed now and cannot be altered nor must it be altered you asked me to go away for twelve months and i have done so it has made no difference you see as to our means of living i am quite willing to do anything that may be best and most prudent i was thinking sir of taking a farm somewhere near here and living on that  the squire sat quite silent for some moments after this communication had been made to him franks conduct as a son had been such that he could not find fault with it and in this special matter of his love how was it possible for him to find fault he himself was almost as fond of mary as of a daughter and though he too would have been desirous that his son should relieve the estate from its embarrassments by a rich marriage he did not at all share lady arabellas feelings on the subject no countess de courcy had ever engraved it on the tablets of his mind that the world would come to ruin if frank did not marry money ruin there was and would be but it had been brought about by no sin of franks  do you remember about her birth frank he said at last  yes sir everything she told me all she knew and dr thorne finished the story  and what do you think of it  it is a pity and a misfortune it might perhaps have been a reason why you or my mother should not have had mary in the house many years ago but it cannot make any difference now  frank had not meant to lean so heavily on his father but he did do so the story had never been told to lady arabella was not even known to her now positively and on good authority but mr gresham had always known it if marys birth was so great a stain upon her why had he brought her into his house among his children  it is a misfortune frank a very great misfortune it will not do for you and me to ignore birth too much of the value of ones position depends upon it  but what was mr moffats birth said frank almost with scorn or what miss dunstables he would have added had it not been that his father had not been concerned in that sin of wedding him to the oil of lebanon  true frank but yet what you would mean to say is not true we must take the world as we find it were you to marry a rich heiress were her birth even as low as that of poor mary  dont call her poor mary father she is not poor my wife will have a right to take rank in the world however she was born  wellpoor in that way but were she an heiress the world would forgive her birth on account of her wealth  the world is very complaisant sir  you must take it as you find it frank i only say that such is the fact if porlock were to marry the daughter of a shoeblack without a farthing he would make a mésalliance but if the daughter of the shoeblack had half a million of money nobody would dream of saying so i am stating no opinion of my own i am only giving you the worlds opinion  i dont give a straw for the world  that is a mistake my boy you do care for it and would be very foolish if you did not what you mean is that on this particular point you value your love more than the worlds opinion  well yes that is what i mean  but the squire though he had been very lucid in his definition had not got no nearer to his object had not even yet ascertained what his own object was this marriage would be ruinous to greshamsbury and yet what was he to say against it seeing that the ruin had been his fault and not his sons  you could let me have a farm could you not sir i was thinking of about six or seven hundred acres i suppose it could be managed somehow  a farm said the father abstractedly  yes sir i must do something for my living i should make less of a mess of that than of anything else besides it would take such a time to be an attorney or a doctor or anything of that sort  do something for his living and was the heir of greshamsbury come to thisthe heir and only son whereas he the squire had succeeded at an earlier age than franks to an unembarrassed income of fourteen thousand pounds a year the reflection was very hard to bear  yes i dare say you could have a farm and then he threw himself back in his chair closing his eyes then after a while rose again and walked hurriedly about the room frank he said at last standing opposite to his son i wonder what you think of me  think of you sir ejaculated frank  yes what do you think of me for having thus ruined you i wonder whether you hate me  frank jumping up from his chair threw his arms round his fathers neck hate you sir how can you speak so cruelly you know well that i love you and father do not trouble yourself about the estate for my sake i do not care for it i can be just as happy without it let the girls have what is left and i will make my own way in the world somehow i will go to australia yes sir that will be best i and mary will both go nobody will care about her birth there but father never say never think that i do not love you  the squire was too much moved to speak at once so he sat down again and covered his face with his hands frank went on pacing the room till gradually his first idea recovered possession of his mind and the remembrance of his fathers grief faded away may i tell mary he said at last that you consent to our marriage it will make her so happy  but the squire was not prepared to say this he was pledged to his wife to do all that he could to oppose it and he himself thought that if anything could consummate the family ruin it would be this marriage  i cannot say that frank i cannot say that what would you both live on it would be madness  we would go to australia answered he bitterly i have just said so  oh no my boy you cannot do that you must not throw the old place up altogether there is no other one but you frank and we have lived here now for so many many years  but if we cannot live here any longer father  but for this scheme of yours we might do so i will give up everything to you the management of the estate the park all the land we have in hand if you will give up this fatal scheme for frank it is fatal you are only twentythree why should you be in such a hurry to marry  you married at twentyone sir  frank was again severe on his father but unwittingly yes i did said mr gresham and see what has come of it had i waited ten years longer how different would everything have been no frank i cannot consent to such a marriage nor will your mother  it is your consent i ask sir and i am asking for nothing but your consent  it would be sheer madness madness for you both my own frank my dear dear boy do not drive me to distraction give it up for four years  four years  yes for four years i ask it as a personal favour as an obligation to myself in order that we may be saved from ruin you your mother and sisters your family name and the old house i do not talk about myself but were such a marriage to take place i should be driven to despair  frank found it very hard to resist his father who now had hold of his hand and arm and was thus half retaining him and half embracing him frank say that you will forget this for four yearssay for three years  but frank would not say so to postpone his marriage for four years or for three seemed to him to be tantamount to giving up mary altogether and he would not acknowledge that any one had the right to demand of him to do that  my word is pledged sir he said  pledged pledged to whom  to miss thorne  but i will see her frankand her uncle she was always reasonable i am sure she will not wish to bring ruin on her old friends at greshamsbury  her old friends at greshamsbury have done but little lately to deserve her consideration she has been treated shamefully i know it has not been by you sir but i must say so she has already been treated shamefully but i will not treat her falsely  well frank i can say no more to you i have destroyed the estate which should have been yours and i have no right to expect you should regard what i say  frank was greatly distressed he had not any feeling of animosity against his father with reference to the property and would have done anything to make the squire understand this short of giving up his engagement to mary his feeling rather was that as each had a case against the other they should cry quits that he should forgive his father for his bad management on condition that he himself was to be forgiven with regard to his determined marriage not that he put it exactly in that shape even to himself but could he have unravelled his own thoughts he would have found that such was the web on which they were based  father i do regard what you say but you would not have me be false had you doubled the property instead of lessening it i could not regard what you say any more  i should be able to speak in a very different tone i feel that frank  do not feel it any more sir say what you wish as you would have said it under any other circumstances and pray believe this the idea never occurs to me that i have ground of complaint as regards the property never whatever troubles we may have do not let that trouble you  soon after this frank left him what more was there that could be said between them they could not be of one accord but even yet it might not be necessary that they should quarrel he went out and roamed by himself through the grounds rather more in meditation than was his wont  if he did marry how was he to live he talked of a profession but had he meant to do as others do who make their way in professions he should have thought of that a year or two agoor rather have done more than think of it he spoke also of a farm but even that could not be had in a moment nor if it could would it produce a living where was his capital where his skill and he might have asked also where the industry so necessary for such a trade he might set his father at defiance and if mary were equally headstrong with himself he might marry her but what then  as he walked slowly about cutting off the daisies with his stick he met mr oriel going up to the house as was now his custom to dine there and spend the evening close to beatrice  how i envy you oriel he said what would i not give to have such a position in the world as yours  thou shalt not covet a mans house nor his wife said mr oriel perhaps it ought to have been added nor his position  it wouldnt have made much difference when a man is tempted the commandments i believe do not go for much  do they not frank thats a dangerous doctrine and one which if you had my position you would hardly admit but what makes you so much out of sorts your own position is generally considered about the best which the world has to give  is it then let me tell you that the world has very little to give what can i do where can i turn oriel if there be an empty lying humbug in the world it is the theory of high birth and pure blood which some of us endeavour to maintain blood indeed if my father had been a baker i should know by this time where to look for my livelihood as it is i am told of nothing but my blood will my blood ever get me half a crown  and then the young democrat walked on again in solitude leaving mr oriel in doubt as to the exact line of argument which he had meant to inculcate     chapter xl  the two doctors change patients   dr fillgrave still continued his visits to greshamsbury for lady arabella had not yet mustered the courage necessary for swallowing her pride and sending once more for dr thorne nothing pleased dr fillgrave more than those visits  he habitually attended grander families and richer people but then he had attended them habitually greshamsbury was a prize taken from the enemy it was his rock of gibraltar of which he thought much more than of any ordinary hampshire or wiltshire which had always been within his own kingdom  he was just starting one morning with his posthorses for greshamsbury when an impudentlooking groom with a crooked nose trotted up to his door for joe still had a crooked nose all the doctors care having been inefficacious to remedy the evil effects of bridgets little tap with the rollingpin joe had no written credentials for his master was hardly equal to writing and lady scatcherd had declined to put herself into further personal communication with dr fillgrave but he had effrontery enough to deliver any message  be you dr fillgrave said joe with one finger just raised to his cocked hat  yes said dr fillgrave with one foot on the step of the carriage but pausing at the sight of so wellturnedout a servant yes i am dr fillgrave  then you be to go to boxall hill immediately before anywhere else  boxall hill said the doctor with a very angry frown  yes boxall hill my masters placemy master is sir louis scatcherd baronet youve heard of him i suppose  dr fillgrave had not his mind quite ready for such an occasion so he withdrew his foot from the carriage step and rubbing his hands one over another looked at his own hall door for inspiration a single glance at his face was sufficient to show that no ordinary thoughts were being turned over within his breast  well said joe thinking that his masters name had not altogether produced the magic effect which he had expected remembering also how submissive greyson had always been who being a london doctor must be supposed to be a bigger man than this provincial fellow do you know as how my master is dying very like while you stand there  what is your masters disease said the doctor facing joe slowly and still rubbing his hands what ails him what is the matter with him  oh the matter with him well to say it out at once then he do take a drop too much at times and then he has the horrorswhat is it they call it delicious beamends or something of that sort  oh ah yes i know and tell me my man who is attending him  attending him why i do and his mother that is her ladyship  yes but what medical attendant what doctor  why there was greyson in london and  greyson and the doctor looked as though a name so medicinally humble had never before struck the tympanum of his ear  yes greyson and then down at whats the name of the place there was thorne  greshamsbury  yes greshamsbury but he and thorne didnt hit it off and so since that he has had no one but myself  i will be at boxall hill in the course of the morning said dr fillgrave or rather you may say that i will be there at once i will take it in my way and having thus resolved he gave his orders that the posthorses should make such a detour as would enable him to visit boxall hill on his road it is impossible said he to himself that i should be twice treated in such a manner in the same house  he was not however altogether in a comfortable frame of mind as he was driven up to the hall door he could not but remember the smile of triumph with which his enemy had regarded him in that hall he could not but think how he had returned feeless to barchester and how little he had gained in the medical world by rejecting lady scatcherds banknote however he also had had his triumphs since that he had smiled scornfully at dr thorne when he had seen him in the greshamsbury street and had been able to tell at twenty houses through the county how lady arabella had at last been obliged to place herself in his hands and he triumphed again when he found himself really standing by sir louis scatcherds bedside as for lady scatcherd she did not even show herself she kept in her own little room sending out hannah to ask him up the stairs and she only just got a peep at him through the door as she heard the medical creak of his shoes as he again descended  we need say but little of his visit to sir louis it mattered nothing now whether it was thorne or greyson or fillgrave and dr fillgrave knew that it mattered nothing he had skill at least for thatand heart enough also to feel that he would fain have been relieved from this task would fain have left this patient in the hands even of dr thorne  the name which joe had given to his masters illness was certainly not a false one he did find sir louis in the horrors if any father have a son whose besetting sin is a passion for alcohol let him take his child to the room of a drunkard when possessed by the horrors nothing will cure him if not that  i will not disgust my reader by attempting to describe the poor wretch in his misery the sunken but yet glaring eyes the emaciated cheeks the fallen mouth the parched sore lips the face now dry and hot and then suddenly clammy with drops of perspiration the shaking hand and all but palsied limbs and worse than this the fearful mental efforts and the struggles for drink struggles to which it is often necessary to give way  dr fillgrave soon knew what was to be the mans fate but he did what he might to relieve it there in one big best bedroom looking out to the north lay sir louis scatcherd dying wretchedly there in the other big best bedroom looking out to the south had died the other baronet about a twelvemonth since and each a victim to the same sin to this had come the prosperity of the house of scatcherd  and then dr fillgrave went on to greshamsbury it was a long days work both for himself and the horses but then the triumph of being dragged up that avenue compensated for both the expense and the labour he always put on his sweetest smile as he came near the hall door and rubbed his hands in the most complaisant manner of which he knew it was seldom that he saw any of the family but lady arabella but then he desired to see none other and when he left her in a good humour was quite content to take his glass of sherry and eat his lunch by himself  on this occasion however the servant at once asked him to go into the diningroom and there he found himself in the presence of frank gresham the fact was that lady arabella having at last decided had sent for dr thorne and it had become necessary that some one should be entrusted with the duty of informing dr fillgrave that some one must be the squire or frank lady arabella would doubtless have preferred a messenger more absolutely friendly to her own side of the house but such messenger there was none she could not send mr gazebee to see her doctor and so of the two evils she chose the least  dr fillgrave said frank shaking hands with him very cordially as he came up my mother is so much obliged to you for all your care and anxiety on her behalf and so indeed are we all  the doctor shook hands with him very warmly this little expression of a family feeling on his behalf was the more gratifying as he had always thought that the males of the greshamsbury family were still wedded to that pseudodoctor that halfapothecary who lived in the village  it has been awfully troublesome to you coming over all this way i am sure indeed money could not pay for it my mother feels that it must cut up your time so much  not at all mr gresham not at all said the barchester doctor rising up on his toes proudly as he spoke a person of your mothers importance you know i should be happy to go any distance to see her  ah but dr fillgrave we cannot allow that  mr gresham dont mention it  oh yes but i must said frank who thought that he had done enough for civility and was now anxious to come to the point the fact is doctor that we are very much obliged for what you have done but for the future my mother thinks she can trust to such assistance as she can get here in the village  frank had been particularly instructed to be very careful how he mentioned dr thornes name and therefore cleverly avoided it  get what assistance she wanted in the village what words were those that he heard mr gresham ehhemperhaps i do not completely yes alas he had completely understood what frank had meant that he should understand frank desired to be civil but he had no idea of beating unnecessarily about the bush on such an occasion as this  its by sir omicrons advice dr fillgrave you see this man hereand he nodded his head towards the doctors house being still anxious not to pronounce the hideous namehas known my mothers constitution for so many years  oh mr gresham of course if it is wished  yes dr fillgrave it is wished lunch is coming directly and frank rang the bell  nothing i thank you mr gresham  do take a glass of sherry  nothing at all i am very much obliged to you  wont you let the horses get some oats  i will return at once if you please mr gresham and the doctor did return taking with him on this occasion the fee that was offered to him his experience had at any rate taught him so much  but though frank could do this for lady arabella he could not receive dr thorne on her behalf the bitterness of that interview had to be borne by herself a messenger had been sent for him and he was upstairs with her ladyship while his rival was receiving his congé downstairs she had two objects to accomplish if it might be possible she had found that high words with the doctor were of no avail but it might be possible that frank could be saved by humiliation on her part if she humbled herself before this man would he consent to acknowledge that his niece was not the fit bride for the heir of greshamsbury  the doctor entered the room where she was lying on her sofa and walking up to her with a gentle but yet not constrained step took the seat beside her little table just as he had always been accustomed to do and as though there had been no break in their intercourse  well doctor you see that i have come back to you she said with a faint smile  or rather i have come back to you and believe me lady arabella i am very happy to do so there need be no excuses you were doubtless right to try what other skill could do and i hope it has not been tried in vain  she had meant to have been so condescending but now all that was put quite beyond her power it was not easy to be condescending to the doctor she had been trying all her life and had never succeeded  i have had sir omicron pie she said  so i was glad to hear sir omicron is a clever man and has a good name i always recommend sir omicron myself  and sir omicron returns the compliment said she smiling gracefully for he recommends you he told mr gresham that i was very foolish to quarrel with my best friend so now we are friends again are we not you see how selfish i am and she put out her hand to him  the doctor took her hand cordially and assured her that he bore her no illwill that he fully understood her conductand that he had never accused her of selfishness this was all very well and very gracious but nevertheless lady arabella felt that the doctor kept the upper hand in those sweet forgivenesses whereas she had intended to keep the upper hand at least for a while so that her humiliation might be more effective when it did come  and then the doctor used his surgical lore as he well knew how to use it there was an assured confidence about him an air which seemed to declare that he really knew what he was doing these were very comfortable to his patients but they were wanting in dr fillgrave when he had completed his examinations and questions and she had completed her little details and made her answer she certainly was more at ease than she had been since the doctor had last left her  dont go yet for a moment she said i have one word to say to you  he declared that he was not the least in a hurry he desired nothing better he said than to sit there and talk to her and i owe you a most sincere apology lady arabella  a sincere apology said she becoming a little red was he going to say anything about mary was he going to own that he and mary and frank had all been wrong  yes indeed i ought not to have brought sir louis scatcherd here i ought to have known that he would have disgraced himself  oh it does not signify said her ladyship in a tone almost of disappointment i had forgotten it mr gresham and you had more inconvenience than we had  he is an unfortunate wretched manmost unfortunate with an immense fortune which he can never live to possess  and who will the money go to doctor  this was a question for which dr thorne was hardly prepared go to he repeated oh some member of the family i believe there are plenty of nephews and nieces  yes but will it be divided or all go to one  probably to one i think sir roger had a strong idea of leaving it all in one hand if it should happen to be a girl thought lady arabella what an excellent opportunity would that be for frank to marry money  and now doctor i want to say one word to you considering the very long time that we have known each other it is better that i should be open with you this estrangement between us and dear mary has given us all so much pain cannot we do anything to put an end to it  well what can i say lady arabella that depends so wholly on yourself  if it depends on me it shall be done at once  the doctor bowed and though he could hardly be said to do so stiffly he did it coldly his bow seemed to say certainly if you choose to make a proper amende it can be done but i think it is very unlikely that you will do so  beatrice is just going to be married you know that doctor the doctor said that he did know it and it will be so pleasant that mary should make one of us poor beatrice you dont know what she has suffered  yes said the doctor there has been suffering i am sure suffering on both sides  you cannot wonder that we should be so anxious about frank dr thorne an only son and the heir to an estate that has been so very long in the family and lady arabella put her handkerchief to her eyes as though these facts were in themselves melancholy and not to be thought of by a mother without some soft tears now i wish you could tell me what your views are in a friendly manner between ourselves you wont find me unreasonable  my views lady arabella  yes doctor about your niece you know you must have views of some sort thats of course it occurs to me that perhaps we are all in the dark together if so a little candid speaking between you and me may set it all right  lady arabellas career had not hitherto been conspicuous for candour as far as dr thorne had been able to judge of it but that was no reason why he should not respond to so very becoming an invitation on her part he had no objection to a little candid speaking at least so he declared as to his views with regard to mary they were merely these that he would make her as happy and comfortable as he could while she remained with him and that he would give her his blessingfor he had nothing else to give herwhen she left himif ever she should do so  now it will be said that the doctor was not very candid in this not more so perhaps than was lady arabella herself but when one is specially invited to be candid one is naturally set upon ones guard those who by disposition are most open are apt to become crafty when so admonished when a man says to you let us be candid with each other you feel instinctively that he desires to squeeze you without giving a drop of water himself  yes but about frank said lady arabella  about frank said the doctor with an innocent look which her ladyship could hardly interpret  what i mean is this can you give me your word that these young people do not intend to do anything rash one word like that from you will set my mind quite at rest and then we could be so happy together again  ah who is to answer for what rash things a young man will do said the doctor smiling  lady arabella got up from the sofa and pushed away the little table the man was false hypocritical and cunning nothing could be made of him they were all in a conspiracy together to rob her of her son to make him marry without money what should she do where should she turn for advice or counsel she had nothing more to say to the doctor and he perceiving that this was the case took his leave this little attempt to achieve candour had not succeeded  dr thorne had answered lady arabella as had seemed best to him on the spur of the moment but he was by no means satisfied with himself as he walked away through the gardens he bethought himself whether it would be better for all parties if he could bring himself to be really candid would it not be better for him at once to tell the squire what were the future prospects of his niece and let the father agree to the marriage or not agree to it as he might think fit but then if so if he did do this would he not in fact say there is my niece there is this girl of whom you have been talking for the last twelvemonth indifferent to what agony of mind you may have occasioned to her there she is a probable heiress it may be worth your sons while to wait a little time and not cast her off till he shall know whether she be an heiress or no if it shall turn out that she is rich let him take her if not why he can desert her then as well as now he could not bring himself to put his niece into such a position as this he was anxious enough that she should be frank greshams wife for he loved frank gresham he was anxious enough also that she should give to her husband the means of saving the property of his family but frank though he might find her rich was bound to take her while she was poor  then also he doubted whether he would be justified in speaking of this will at all he almost hated the will for the trouble and vexation it had given him and the constant stress it had laid on his conscience he had spoken of it as yet to no one and he thought that he was resolved not to do so while sir louis should yet be in the land of the living  on reaching home he found a note from lady scatcherd informing him that dr fillgrave had once more been at boxall hill and that on this occasion he had left the house without anger  i dont know what he has said about louis she added for to tell the truth doctor i was afraid to see him but he comes again tomorrow and then i shall be braver but i fear that my poor boy is in a bad way     chapter xli  doctor thorne wont interfere   at this period there was as it were a truce to the ordinary little skirmishes which had been so customary between lady arabella and the squire things had so fallen out that they neither of them had much spirit for a contest and moreover on that point which at the present moment was most thought of by both of them they were strangely in unison for each of them was anxious to prevent the threatened marriage of their only son  it must moreover be remembered that lady arabella had carried a great point in ousting mr yates umbleby and putting the management of the estate into the hands of her own partisan but then the squire had not done less in getting rid of fillgrave and reinstating dr thorne in possession of the family invalids the losses therefore had been equal the victories equal and there was a mutual object  and it must be confessed also that lady arabellas taste for grandeur was on the decline misfortune was coming too near to her to leave her much anxiety for the gaieties of a london season things were not faring well with her when her eldest daughter was going to marry a man of fortune and a member of parliament she had thought nothing of demanding a thousand pounds or so for the extraordinary expenses incident to such an occasion but now beatrice was to become the wife of a parish parson and even that was thought to be a fortunate event she had therefore no heart for splendour  the quieter we can do it the better she wrote to her countesssister her father wanted to give him at least a thousand pounds but mr gazebee has told me confidentially that it literally cannot be done at the present moment ah my dear rosina how things have been managed if one or two of the girls will come over we shall all take it as a favour beatrice would think it very kind of them but i dont think of asking you or amelia amelia was always the grandest of the de courcy family being almost on an equality withnay in some respect superior tothe countess herself but this of course was before the days of the nice place in surrey  such and so humble being the present temper of the lady of greshamsbury it will not be thought surprising that she and mr gresham should at last come together in their efforts to reclaim their son  at first lady arabella urged upon the squire the duty of being very peremptory and very angry do as other fathers do in such cases make him understand that he will have no allowance to live on he understands that well enough said mr gresham  threaten to cut him off with a shilling said her ladyship with spirit i havent a shilling to cut him off with answered the squire bitterly  but lady arabella herself soon perceived that this line would not do as mr gresham himself confessed his own sins against his son had been too great to allow of his taking a high hand with him besides mr gresham was not a man who could ever be severe with a son whose individual conduct had been so good as franks this marriage was in his view a misfortune to be averted if possibleto be averted by any possible means but as far as frank was concerned it was to be regarded rather as a monomania than a crime  i did feel so certain that he would have succeeded with miss dunstable said the mother almost crying  i thought it impossible but that at his age a twelvemonths knocking about the world would cure him said the father  i never heard of a boy being so obstinate about a girl said the mother im sure he didnt get it from the de courcys and then again they talked it over in all its bearings  but what are they to live upon said lady arabella appealing as it were to some impersonation of reason thats what i want him to tell me what are they to live upon  i wonder whether de courcy could get him into some embassy said the father he does talk of a profession  what with the girl and all asked lady arabella with horror alarmed at the idea of such an appeal being made to her noble brother  no but before he marries he might be broken of it that way  nothing will break him said the wretched mother nothingnothing for my part i think that he is possessed why was she brought here oh dear oh dear why was she ever brought into this house  this last question mr gresham did not think it necessary to answer that evil had been done and it would be useless to dispute it ill tell you what ill do said he ill speak to the doctor himself  its not the slightest use said lady arabella he will not assist us indeed i firmly believe its all his own doing  oh nonsense that really is nonsense my love  very well mr gresham what i say is always nonsense i know you have always told me so but yet see how things have turned out i knew how it would be when she was first brought into the house this assertion was rather a stretch on the part of lady arabella  well it is nonsense to say that frank is in love with the girl at the doctors bidding  i think you know mr gresham that i dont mean that what i say is this that dr thorne finding what an easy fool frank is  i dont think hes at all easy my love and certainly is not a fool  very well have it your own way ill not say a word more im struggling to do my best and im browbeaten on every side god knows i am not in a state of health to bear it and lady arabella bowed her head into her pockethandkerchief  i think my dear if you were to see mary herself it might do some good said the squire when the violence of his wifes grief had somewhat subsided  what go and call upon this girl  yes you can send beatrice to give her notice you know she never was unreasonable and i do not think that you would find her so you should tell her you know  oh i should know very well what to tell her mr gresham  yes my love im sure you would nobody better but what i mean is that if you are to do any good you should be kind in your manner mary thorne has a spirit that you cannot break you may perhaps lead but nobody can drive her  as this scheme originated with her husband lady arabella could not of course confess that there was much in it but nevertheless she determined to attempt it thinking that if anything could be efficacious for good in their present misfortunes it would be her own diplomatic powers it was therefore at last settled between them that he should endeavour to talk over the doctor and that she would do the same with mary  and then i will speak to frank said lady arabella as yet he has never had the audacity to open his mouth to me about mary thorne though i believe he declares his love openly to every one else in the house  and i will get oriel to speak to him said the squire  i think patience might do more good i did once think he was getting fond of patience and i was quite unhappy about it then ah dear i should be almost pleased at that now  and thus it was arranged that all the artillery of greshamsbury was to be brought to bear at once on franks love so as to crush it as it were by the very weight of metal  it may be imagined that the squire would have less scruple in addressing the doctor on this matter than his wife would feel and that his part of their present joint undertaking was less difficult than hers for he and the doctor had ever been friends at heart but nevertheless he did feel much scruple as with his stick in hand he walked down to the little gate which opened out near the doctors house  this feeling was so strong that he walked on beyond this door to the entrance thinking of what he was going to do and then back again it seemed to be his fate to be depending always on the clemency or consideration of dr thorne at this moment the doctor was imposing the only obstacle which was offered to the sale of a great part of his estate sir louis through his lawyer was pressing the doctor to sell and the lawyer was loudly accusing the doctor of delaying to do so he has the management of your property said mr finnie but he manages it in the interest of his own friend it is quite clear and we will expose it by all means said sir louis it is a dd shame and it shall be exposed of all this the squire was aware  when he reached the doctors house he was shown into the drawingroom and found mary there alone it had always been his habit to kiss her forehead when he chanced to meet her about the house at greshamsbury she had been younger and more childish then but even now she was but a child to him so he kissed her as he had been wont to do she blushed slightly as she looked up into his face and said oh mr gresham i am so glad to see you here again  as he looked at her he could not but acknowledge that it was natural that frank should love her he had never before seen that she was attractivehad never had an opinion about it she had grown up as a child under his eye and as she had not had the name of being especially a pretty child he had never thought on the subject now he saw before him a woman whose every feature was full of spirit and animation whose eye sparkled with more than mere brilliancy whose face was full of intelligence whose very smile was eloquent was it to be wondered at that frank should have learned to love her  miss thorne wanted but one attribute which many consider essential to feminine beauty she had no brilliancy of complexion no pearly whiteness no vivid carnation nor indeed did she possess the dark brilliance of a brunette but there was a speaking earnestness in her face an expression of mental faculty which the squire now for the first time perceived to be charming  and then he knew how good she was he knew well what was her nature how generous how open how affectionate and yet how proud her pride was her fault but even that was not a fault in his eyes out of his own family there was no one whom he had loved and could love as he loved her he felt and acknowledged that no man could have a better wife and yet he was there with the express object of rescuing his son from such a marriage  you are looking very well mary he said almost involuntarily am i she answered smiling its very nice at any rate to be complimented uncle never pays me any compliments of that sort  in truth she was looking well she would say to herself over and over again from morning to night that franks love for her would be must be unfortunate could not lead to happiness but nevertheless it did make her happy she had before his return made up her mind to be forgotten and it was so sweet to find that he had been so far from forgetting her a girl may scold a man in words for rashness in his love but her heart never scolds him for such an offence as that she had not been slighted and her heart therefore still rose buoyant within her breast  the doctor entered the room as the squires visit had been expected by him he had of course not been out of the house and now i suppose i must go said mary for i know you are going to talk about business but uncle mr gresham says im looking very well why have you not been able to find that out  shes a dear good girl said the squire as the door shut behind her a dear good girl and the doctor could not fail to see that his eyes were filled with tears  i think she is said he quietly and then they both sat silent as though each was waiting to hear whether the other had anything more to say on that subject the doctor at any rate had nothing more to say  i have come here specially to speak to you about her said the squire  about mary  yes doctor about her and frank something must be done some arrangement made if not for our sakes at least for theirs  what arrangement squire  ah that is the question i take it for granted that either frank or mary has told you that they have engaged themselves to each other  frank told me so twelve months since  and has not mary told you  not exactly that but never mind she has i believe no secret from me though i have said but little to her i think i know it all  well what then  the doctor shook his head and put up his hands he had nothing to say no proposition to make no arrangement to suggest the thing was so and he seemed to say that as far as he was concerned there was an end of it  the squire sat looking at him hardly knowing how to proceed it seemed to him that the fact of a young man and a young lady being in love with each other was not a thing to be left to arrange itself particularly seeing the rank of life in which they were placed but the doctor seemed to be of a different opinion  but dr thorne there is no man on gods earth who knows my affairs as well as you do and in knowing mine you know franks do you think it possible that they should marry each other  possible yes it is possible you mean will it be prudent  well take it in that way would it not be most imprudent  at present it certainly would be i have never spoken to either of them on the subject but i presume they do not think of such a thing for the present  but doctor the squire was certainly taken aback by the coolness of the doctors manner after all he the squire was mr gresham of greshamsbury generally acknowledged to be the first commoner in barsetshire after all frank was his heir and in process of time he would be mr gresham of greshamsbury crippled as the estate was there would be something left and the rank at any rate remained but as to mary she was not even the doctors daughter she was not only penniless but nameless fatherless worse than motherless it was incredible that dr thorne with his generally exalted ideas as to family should speak in this cold way as to a projected marriage between the heir of greshamsbury and his brothers bastard child  but doctor repeated the squire  the doctor put one leg over the other and began to rub his calf squire said he i think i know all that you would say all that you mean and you dont like to say it because you would not wish to pain me by alluding to marys birth  but independently of that what would they live on said the squire energetically birth is a great thing a very great thing you and i think exactly alike about that so we need have no dispute you are quite as proud of ullathorne as i am of greshamsbury  i might be if it belonged to me  but you are it is no use arguing but putting that aside altogether what would they live on if they were to marry what would they do where would they go you know what lady arabella thinks of such things would it be possible that they should live up at the house with her besides what a life would that be for both of them could they live here would that be well for them  the squire looked at the doctor for an answer but he still went on rubbing his calf mr gresham therefore was constrained to continue his expostulation  when i am dead there will still i hope be somethingsomething left for the poor fellow lady arabella and the girls would be better off perhaps than now and i sometimes wish for franks sake that the time had come  the doctor could not now go on rubbing his leg he was moved to speak and declared that of all events that was the one which would be furthest from franks heart i know no son said he who loves his father more dearly than he does  i do believe it said the squire i do believe it but yet i cannot but feel that i am in his way  no squire no you are in no ones way you will find yourself happy with your son yet and proud of him and proud of his wife too i hope so and i think so i do indeed or i should not say so squire we will have many a happy day yet together when we shall talk of all these things over the diningroom fire at greshamsbury  the squire felt it kind in the doctor that he should thus endeavour to comfort him but he could not understand and did not inquire on what basis these golden hopes was founded it was necessary however to return to the subject which he had come to discuss would the doctor assist him in preventing this marriage that was now the one thing necessary to be kept in view  but doctor about the young people of course they cannot marry you are aware of that  i dont know that exactly  well doctor i must say i thought you would feel it  feel what squire  that situated as they are they ought not to marry  that is quite another question i have said nothing about that either to you or to anybody else the truth is squire i have never interfered in this matter one way or the other and i have no wish to do so now  but should you not interfere is not mary the same to you as your own child  dr thorne hardly knew how to answer this he was aware that his argument about not interfering was in fact absurd mary could not marry without his interference and had it been the case that she was in danger of making an improper marriage of course he would interfere his meaning was that he would not at the present moment express any opinion he would not declare against a match which might turn out to be in every way desirable nor if he spoke in favour of it could he give his reasons for doing so under these circumstances he would have wished to say nothing could that only have been possible  but as it was not possible and as he must say something he answered the squires last question by asking another what is your objection squire  objection why what on earth would they live on  then i understand that if that difficulty were over you would not refuse your consent merely because of marys birth  this was a manner in which the squire had by no means expected to have the affair presented to him it seemed so impossible that any soundminded man should take any but his view of the case that he had not prepared himself for argument there was every objection to his son marrying miss thorne but the fact of their having no income between them did certainly justify him in alleging that first  but that difficulty cant be got over doctor you know however that it would be cause of grief to us all to see frank marry much beneath his station that is i mean in family you should not press me to say this for you know that i love mary dearly  but my dear friend it is necessary wounds sometimes must be opened in order that they may be healed what i mean is thisand squire im sure i need not say to you that i hope for an honest answerwere mary thorne an heiress had she for instance such wealth as that miss dunstable that we hear of in that case would you object to the match  when the doctor declared that he expected an honest answer the squire listened with all his ears but the question when finished seemed to have no bearing on the present case  come squire speak your mind faithfully there was some talk once of franks marrying miss dunstable did you mean to object to that match  miss dunstable was legitimate at least i presume so  oh mr gresham has it come to that miss dunstable then would have satisfied your ideas of high birth  mr gresham was rather posed and regretted at the moment his allusion to miss dunstables presumed legitimacy but he soon recovered himself no said he it would not and i am willing to admit as i have admitted before that the undoubted advantages arising from wealth are taken by the world as atoning for what otherwise would be a mésalliance but  you admit that do you you acknowledge that as your conviction on the subject  yes but the squire was going on to explain the propriety of this opinion but the doctor uncivilly would not hear him  then squire i will not interfere in this matter one way or the other  how on earth can such an opinion  pray excuse me mr gresham but my mind is now quite made up it was very nearly so before i will do nothing to encourage frank nor will i say anything to discourage mary  that is the most singular resolution that a man of sense like you ever came to  i cant help it squire it is my resolution  but what has miss dunstables fortune to do with it  i cannot say that it has anything but in this matter i will not interfere  the squire went on for some time but it was all to no purpose and at last he left the house considerably in dudgeon the only conclusion to which he could come was that dr thorne had thought the chance on his nieces behalf too good to be thrown away and had therefore resolved to act in this very singular way  i would not have believed it of him though all barsetshire had told me he said to himself as he entered the great gates and he went on repeating the same words till he found himself in his own room no not if all barsetshire had told me  he did not however communicate the ill result of his visit to the lady arabella     chapter xlii  what can you give in return   in spite of the family troubles these were happy days for beatrice it so seldom happens that young ladies on the eve of their marriage have their future husbands living near them this happiness was hers and mr oriel made the most of it she was constantly being coaxed down to the parsonage by patience in order that she might give her opinion in private as to some domestic arrangement some piece of furniture or some new carpet but this privacy was always invaded what mr oriels parishioners did in these halcyon days i will not ask his morning services however had been altogether given up and he had provided himself with a very excellent curate  but one grief did weigh heavily on beatrice she continually heard her mother say things which made her feel that it would be more than ever impossible that mary should be at her wedding and yet she had promised her brother to ask her frank had also repeated his threat that if mary were not present he would absent himself  beatrice did what most girls do in such a case what all would do who are worth anything she asked her lovers advice  oh but frank cant be in earnest said the lover of course hell be at our wedding  you dont know him caleb he is so changed that no one hardly would know him you cant conceive how much in earnest he is how determined and resolute and then i should like to have mary so much if mamma would let her come  ask lady arabella said caleb  well i suppose i must do that but i know what shell say and frank will never believe that i have done my best mr oriel comforted her with such little whispered consolations as he was able to afford and then she went away on her errand to her mother  she was indeed surprised at the manner in which her prayer was received she could hardly falter forth her petition but when she had done so lady arabella answered in this wise  well my dear i have no objection none the least that is of course if mary is disposed to behave herself properly  oh mamma of course she will said beatrice she always did and always does  i hope she will my love but beatrice when i say that i shall be glad to see her of course i mean under certain conditions i never disliked mary thorne and if she would only let frank understand that she will not listen to his mad proposals i should be delighted to see her at greshamsbury just as she used to be  beatrice could say nothing in answer to this but she felt very sure that mary let her intention be what it might would not undertake to make frank understand anything at anybodys bidding  i will tell you what i will do my dear continued lady arabella i will call on mary myself  what at dr thornes house  yes why not i have been at dr thornes house before now and lady arabella could not but think of her last visit thither and the strong feeling she had as she came out that she would never again enter those doors she was however prepared to do anything on behalf of her rebellious son  oh yes i know that mamma  i will call upon her and if i can possibly manage it i will ask her myself to make one of your party if so you can go to her afterwards and make your own arrangements just write her a note my dear and say that i will call tomorrow at twelve it might fluster her if i were to go in without notice  beatrice did as she was bid but with a presentiment that no good would come of it the note was certainly unnecessary for the purpose assigned by lady arabella as mary was not given to be flustered by such occurrences but perhaps it was as well that it was written as it enabled her to make up her mind steadily as to what information should be given and what should not be given to her coming visitor  on the next morning at the appointed hour lady arabella walked down to the doctors house she never walked about the village without making some little disturbance among the inhabitants with the squire himself they were quite familiar and he could appear and reappear without creating any sensation but her ladyship had not made herself equally common in mens sight therefore when she went in at the doctors little gate the fact was known through all greshamsbury in ten minutes and before she had left the house mrs umbleby and miss gushing had quite settled between them what was the exact cause of the very singular event  the doctor when he had heard what was going to happen carefully kept out of the way mary therefore had the pleasure of receiving lady arabella alone nothing could exceed her ladyships affability mary thought that it perhaps might have savoured less of condescension but then on this subject mary was probably prejudiced lady arabella smiled and simpered and asked after the doctor and the cat and janet and said everything that could have been desired by any one less unreasonable than mary thorne  and now mary ill tell you why i have called mary bowed her head slightly as much to say that she would be glad to receive any information that lady arabella could give her on that subject of course you know that beatrice is going to be married very shortly  mary acknowledged that she had heard so much  yes we think it will be in septemberearly in septemberand that is coming very soon now the poor girl is anxious that you should be at her wedding mary turned slightly red but she merely said and that somewhat too coldly that she was much indebted to beatrice for her kindness  i can assure you mary that she is very fond of you as much so as ever and so indeed am i and all of us are so you know that mr gresham was always your friend  yes he always was and i am grateful to mr gresham answered mary it was well for lady arabella that she had her temper under command for had she spoken her mind out there would have been very little chance left for reconciliation between her and mary  yes indeed he was and i think we all did what little we could to make you welcome at greshamsbury mary till those unpleasant occurrences took place  what occurrences lady arabella  and beatrice is so very anxious on this point said her ladyship ignoring for the moment marys question you two have been so much together that she feels she cannot be quite happy if you are not near her when she is being married  dear beatrice said mary warmed for the moment to an expression of genuine feeling  she came to me yesterday begging that i would waive any objection i might have to your being there i have made her no answer yet what answer do you think i ought to make her  mary was astounded at this question and hesitated in her reply what answer ought you to make her she said  yes mary what answer do you think i ought to give i wish to ask you the question as you are the person the most concerned  mary considered for a while and then did give her opinion on the matter in a firm voice i think you should tell beatrice that as you cannot at present receive me cordially in your house it will be better that you should not be called on to receive me at all  this was certainly not the sort of answer that lady arabella expected and she was now somewhat astounded in her turn but mary she said i should be delighted to receive you cordially if i could do so  but it seems you cannot lady arabella and so there must be an end of it  oh but i do not know that and she smiled her sweetest smile i do not know that i want to put an end to all this illfeeling if i can it all depends upon one thing you know  does it lady arabella  yes upon one thing you wont be angry if i ask you another questioneh mary  no at least i dont think i will  is there any truth in what we hear about your being engaged to frank  mary made no immediate answer to this but sat quite silent looking lady arabella in the face not but that she had made up her mind as to what answer she would give but the exact words failed her at the moment  of course you must have heard of such a rumour continued lady arabella  oh yes i have heard of it  yes and you have noticed it and i must say very properly when you went to boxall hill and before that with miss oriels to her aunts i thought you behaved extremely well mary felt herself glow with indignation and began to prepare words that should be sharp and decisive but nevertheless people talk and frank who is still quite a boy marys indignation was not softened by this allusion to franks folly seems to have got some nonsense in his head i grieve to say it but i feel myself in justice bound to do so that in this matter he has not acted as well as you have done now therefore i merely ask you whether there is any truth in the report if you tell me that there is none i shall be quite contented  but it is altogether true lady arabella i am engaged to frank gresham  engaged to be married to him  yes engaged to be married to him  what was to say or do now nothing could be more plain more decided or less embarrassed with doubt than marys declaration and as she made it she looked her visitor full in the face blushing indeed for her cheeks were now suffused as well as her forehead but boldly and as it were with defiance  and you tell me so to my face miss thorne  and why not did you not ask me the question and would you have me answer you with a falsehood i am engaged to him as you would put the question to me what other answer could i make the truth is that i am engaged to him  the decisive abruptness with which mary declared her own iniquity almost took away her ladyships breath she had certainly believed that they were engaged and had hardly hoped that mary would deny it but she had not expected that the crime would be acknowledged or at any rate if acknowledged that the confession would be made without some show of shame on this lady arabella could have worked but there was no such expression nor was there the slightest hesitation i am engaged to frank gresham and having so said mary looked her visitor full in the face  then it is indeed impossible that you should be received at greshamsbury  at present quite so no doubt in saying so lady arabella you only repeat the answer i made to your first question i can now go to greshamsbury only in one light that of mr greshams accepted daughterinlaw  and that is perfectly out of the question altogether out of the question now and for ever  i will not dispute with you about that but as i said before my being at beatrices wedding is not to be thought of  lady arabella sat for a while silent that she might meditate if possible calmly as to what line of argument she had now better take it would be foolish in her she thought to return home having merely expressed her anger she had now an opportunity of talking to mary which might not again occur the difficulty was in deciding in what special way she should use the opportunity should she threaten or should she entreat to do her justice it should be stated that she did actually believe that the marriage was all but impossible she did not think that it could take place but the engagement might be the ruin of her sons prospects seeing how he had before him one imperative one immediate dutythat of marrying money  having considered all this as well as her hurry would allow her she determined first to reason then to entreat and lastly if necessary to threaten  i am astonished you cannot be surprised at that miss thorne i am astonished at hearing so singular a confession made  do you think my confession singular or is it the fact of my being engaged to your son  we will pass over that for the present but do let me ask you do you think it possible i say possible that you and frank should be married  oh certainly quite possible  of course you know that he has not a shilling in the world  nor have i lady arabella  nor will he have were he to do anything so utterly hostile to his fathers wishes the property you are aware is altogether at mr greshams disposal  i am aware of nothing about the property and can say nothing about it except this that it has not been and will not be inquired after by me in this matter if i marry frank gresham it will not be for the property i am sorry to make such an apparent boast but you force me to do it  on what then are you to live you are too old for love in a cottage i suppose  not at all too old frank you know is still quite a boy  impudent hussy forward illconditioned saucy minx such were the epithets which rose to lady arabellas mind but she politely suppressed them  miss thorne this subject is of course to me very serious very illadapted for jesting i look upon such a marriage as absolutely impossible  i do not know what you mean by impossible lady arabella  i mean in the first place that you two could not get yourselves married  oh yes mr oriel would manage that for us we are his parishioners and he would be bound to do it  i beg your pardon i believe that under all the circumstances it would be illegal  mary smiled but she said nothing you may laugh miss thorne but i think you will find that i am right there are still laws to prevent such fearful distress as would be brought about by such a marriage  i hope that nothing i shall do will bring distress on the family  ah but it would dont you know that it would think of it miss thorne think of franks state and of his fathers state you know enough of that i am sure to be well aware that frank is not in a condition to marry without money think of the position which mr greshams only son should hold in the county think of the old name and the pride we have in it you have lived among us enough to understand all this think of these things and then say whether it is possible such a marriage should take place without family distress of the deepest kind think of mr gresham if you truly love my son you could not wish to bring on him all this misery and ruin  mary now was touched for there was truth in what lady arabella said but she had no power of going back her troth was plighted and nothing that any human being could say should shake her from it if he indeed chose to repent that would be another thing  lady arabella she said i have nothing to say in favour of this engagement except that he wishes it  and is that a reason mary  to me it is not only a reason but a law i have given him my promise  and you will keep your promise even to his own ruin  i hope not our engagement unless he shall choose to break it off must necessarily be a long one but the time will come  what when mr gresham is dead  before that i hope  there is no probability of it and because he is headstrong you who have always had credit for so much sense will hold him to this mad engagement  no lady arabella i will not hold him to anything to which he does not wish to be held nothing that you can say shall move me nothing that anybody can say shall induce me to break my promise to him but a word from himself will do it one look will be sufficient let him give me to understand in any way that his love for me is injurious to himthat he has learnt to think soand then i will renounce my part in this engagement as quickly as you could wish it  there was much in this promise but still not so much as lady arabella wished to get mary she knew was obstinate but yet reasonable frank she thought was both obstinate and unreasonable it might be possible to work on marys reason but quite impossible to touch franks irrationality so she perseveredfoolishly  miss thornethat is mary for i still wish to be thought your friend  i will tell you the truth lady arabella for some considerable time past i have not thought you so  then you have wronged me but i will go on with what i was saying you quite acknowledge that this is a foolish affair  i acknowledge no such thing  something very much like it you have not a word in its defence  not to you i do not choose to be put on my defence by you  i dont know who has more right however you promise that if frank wishes it you will release him from his engagement  release him it is for him to release me that is if he wishes it  very well at any rate you give him permission to do so but will it not be more honourable for you to begin  no i think not  ah but it would if he in his position should be the first to speak the first to suggest that this affair between you is a foolish one what would people say  they would say the truth  and what would you yourself say  nothing  what would he think of himself  ah that i do not know it is according as that may be that he will or will not act at your bidding  exactly and because you know him to be highminded because you think that he having so much to give will not break his word to youto you who have nothing to give in returnit is therefore that you say that the first step must be taken by him is that noble  then mary rose from her seat for it was no longer possible for her to speak what it was in her to say sitting there leisurely on her sofa lady arabellas worship of money had not hitherto been so brought forward in the conversation as to give her unpardonable offence but now she felt that she could no longer restrain her indignation to you who have nothing to give in return had she not given all that she possessed had she not emptied his store into his lap that heart of hers beating with such genuine life capable of such perfect love throbbing with so grand a pride had she not given that and was it not that between him and her more than twenty greshamsburys nobler than any pedigree to you who have nothing to give indeed this to her who was so ready to give everything  lady arabella she said i think that you do not understand me and that it is not likely that you should if so our further talking will be worse than useless i have taken no account of what will be given between your son and me in your sense of the word giving but he has professed toto love meas she spoke she still looked on the ladys face but her eyelashes for a moment screened her eyes and her colour was a little heightenedand i have acknowledged that i also love him and so we are engaged to me my promise is sacred i will not be threatened into breaking it if however he shall wish to change his mind he can do so i will not upbraid him will not if i can help it think harshly of him so much you may tell him if it suits you but i will not listen to your calculations as to how much or how little each of us may have to give to the other  she was still standing when she finished speaking and so she continued to stand her eyes were fixed on lady arabella and her position seemed to say that sufficient words had been spoken and that it was time that her ladyship should go and so lady arabella felt it gradually she also rose slowly but tacitly she acknowledged that she was in the presence of a spirit superior to her own and so she took her leave  very well she said in a tone that was intended to be grandiloquent but which failed grievously i will tell him that he has your permission to think a second time on this matter i do not doubt but that he will do so mary would not condescend to answer but curtsied low as her visitor left the room and so the interview was over  the interview was over and mary was alone she remained standing as long as she heard the footsteps of franks mother on the stairs not immediately thinking of what had passed but still buoying herself up with her hot indignation as though her work with lady arabella was not yet finished but when the footfall was no longer heard and the sound of the closing door told her that she was in truth alone she sank back in her seat and covering her face with her hands burst into bitter tears  all that doctrine about money was horrible to her that insolent pretence that she had caught at frank because of his worldly position made her all but ferocious but lady arabella had not the less spoken much that was true she did think of the position which the heir of greshamsbury should hold in the county and of the fact that a marriage would mar that position so vitally she did think of the old name and the old gresham pride she did think of the squire and his deep distress it was true that she had lived among them long enough to understand these things and to know that it was not possible that this marriage should take place without deep family sorrow  and then she asked herself whether in consenting to accept franks hand she had adequately considered this and she was forced to acknowledge that she had not considered it she had ridiculed lady arabella for saying that frank was still a boy but was it not true that his offer had been made with a boys energy rather than a mans forethought if so if she had been wrong to accede to that offer when made would she not be doubly wrong to hold him to it now that she saw their error  it was doubtless true that frank himself could not be the first to draw back what would people say of him she could now calmly ask herself the question that had so angered her when asked by lady arabella if he could not do it and if nevertheless it behoved them to break off this match by whom was it to be done if not by her was not lady arabella right throughout right in her conclusions though so foully wrong in her manner of drawing them  and then she did think for one moment of herself you who have nothing to give in return such had been lady arabellas main accusation against her was it in fact true that she had nothing to give her maiden love her feminine pride her very life and spirit and beingwere these things nothing were they to be weighed against pounds sterling per annum and when so weighed were they ever to kick the beam like feathers all these things had been nothing to her when without reflection governed wholly by the impulse of the moment she had first allowed his daring hand to lie for an instant in her own she had thought nothing of these things when that other suitor came richer far than frank to love whom it was as impossible to her as it was not to love him  her love had been pure from all such thoughts she was conscious that it ever would be pure from them lady arabella was unable to comprehend this and therefore was lady arabella so utterly distasteful to her  frank had once held her close to his warm breast and her very soul had thrilled with joy to feel that he so loved herwith a joy which she had hardly dared to acknowledge at that moment her maidenly efforts had been made to push him off but her heart had grown to his she had acknowledged him to be master of her spirit her bosoms lord the man whom she had been born to worship the human being to whom it was for her to link her destiny franks acres had been of no account nor had his want of acres god had brought them two together that they should love each other that conviction had satisfied her and she had made it a duty to herself that she would love him with her very soul and now she was called upon to wrench herself asunder from him because she had nothing to give in return  well she would wrench herself asunder as far as such wrenching might be done compatibly with her solemn promise it might be right that frank should have an opportunity offered him so that he might escape from his position without disgrace she would endeavour to give him this opportunity so with one deep sigh she arose took herself pen ink and paper and sat herself down again so that the wrenching might begin  and then for a moment she thought of her uncle why had he not spoken to her of all this why had he not warned her he who had ever been so good to her why had he now failed her so grievously she had told him everything had had no secret from him but he had never answered her a word he also must have known she said to herself piteously he also must have known that i could give nothing in return such accusation however availed her not at all so she sat down and slowly wrote her letter  dearest frank she began she had at first written dear mr gresham but her heart revolted against such useless coldness she was not going to pretend she did not love him      dearest frank     your mother has been here talking to me about our    engagement i do not generally agree with her about such    matters but she has said some things today which i    cannot but acknowledge to be true she says that our    marriage would be distressing to your father injurious to    all your family and ruinous to yourself if this be so    how can i who love you wish for such a marriage     i remember my promise and have kept it i would not    yield to your mother when she desired me to disclaim our    engagement but i do think it will be more prudent if    you will consent to forget all that has passed between    usnot perhaps to forget it that may not be possible    for usbut to let it pass by as though it had never    been if so if you think so dear frank do not have any    scruples on my account what will be best for you must be    best for me think what a reflection it would ever be to    me to have been the ruin of one that i love so well     let me have but one word to say that i am released from my    promise and i will tell my uncle that the matter between    us is over it will be painful for us at first those    occasional meetings which must take place will distress    us but that will wear off we shall always think well    of each other and why should we not be friends this    doubtless cannot be done without inward wounds but such    wounds are in gods hands and he can cure them     i know what your first feelings will be on reading this    letter but do not answer it in obedience to first    feelings think over it think of your father and all you    owe him of your old name your old family and of what    the world expects from you mary was forced to put her    hand to her eyes to save her paper from her falling    tears as she found herself thus repeating nearly word    for word the arguments that had been used by lady    arabella think of these things coolly if you can but    at any rate without passion and then let me have one    word in answer one word will suffice     i have but to add this do not allow yourself to think    that my heart will ever reproach you it cannot reproach    you for doing that which i myself suggest marys logic    in this was very false but she was not herself aware of    it i will never reproach you either in word or thought    and as for all others it seems to me that the world    agrees that we have hitherto been wrong the world i    hope will be satisfied when we have obeyed it     god bless you dearest frank i shall never call you    so again but it would be a pretence were i to write    otherwise in this letter think of this and then let me    have one line     your affectionate friend     mary thorne     psof course i cannot be at dear beatrices marriage    but when they come back to the parsonage i shall see her    i am sure they will both be happy because they are so    good i need hardly say that i shall think of them on    their wedding day   when she had finished her letter she addressed it plainly in her own somewhat bold handwriting to francis n gresham jun esq and then took it herself to the little village postoffice there should be nothing underhand about her correspondence all the greshamsbury world should know of itthat world of which she had spoken in her letterif that world so pleased having put her penny label on it she handed it with an open brow and an unembarrassed face to the bakers wife who was her majestys postmistress at greshamsbury and having so finished her work she returned to see the table prepared for her uncles dinner i will say nothing to him said she to herself till i get the answer he will not talk to me about it so why should i trouble him     chapter xliii  the race of scatcherd becomes extinct   it will not be imagined at any rate by feminine readers that marys letter was written off at once without alterations and changes or the necessity for a fair copy letters from one young lady to another are doubtless written in this manner and even with them it might sometimes be better if more patience had been taken but with marys first letter to her loverher first loveletter if loveletter it can be calledmuch more care was used it was copied and recopied and when she returned from posting it it was read and reread  it is very cold she said to herself he will think i have no heart that i have never loved him and then she all but resolved to run down to the bakers wife and get back her letter that she might alter it but it will be better so she said again if i touched his feelings now he would never bring himself to leave me it is right that i should be cold to him i should be false to myself if i tried to move his lovei who have nothing to give him in return for it and so she made no further visit to the postoffice and the letter went on its way  we will now follow its fortunes for a short while and explain how it was that mary received no answer for a week a week it may well be imagined of terrible suspense to her when she took it to the postoffice she doubtless thought that the bakers wife had nothing to do but to send it up to the house at greshamsbury and that frank would receive it that evening or at latest early on the following morning but this was by no means so the epistle was posted on a friday afternoon and it behoved the bakers wife to send it into silverbridgesilverbridge being the posttownso that all due formalities as ordered by the queens government might there be perfected now unfortunately the postboy had taken his departure before mary reached the shop and it was not therefore dispatched till saturday sunday was always a dies non with the greshamsbury mercury and consequently franks letter was not delivered at the house till monday morning at which time mary had for two long days been waiting with weary heart for the expected answer  now frank had on that morning gone up to london by the early train with his future brotherinlaw mr oriel in order to accomplish this they had left greshamsbury for barchester exactly as the postboy was leaving silverbridge for greshamsbury  i should like to wait for my letters mr oriel had said when the journey was being discussed  nonsense frank had answered who ever got a letter that was worth waiting for and so mary was doomed to a week of misery  when the postbag arrived at the house on monday morning it was opened as usual by the squire himself at the breakfasttable here is a letter for frank said he posted in the village you had better send it to him and he threw the letter across the table to beatrice  its from mary said beatrice out loud taking the letter up and examining the address and having said so she repented what she had done as she looked first at her father and then at her mother  a cloud came over the squires brow as for a minute he went on turning over the letters and newspapers oh from mary thorne is it he said well you had better send it to him  frank said that if any letters came they were to be kept said his sister sophy he told me so particularly i dont think he likes having letters sent after him  you had better send that one said the squire  mr oriel is to have all his letters addressed to longs hotel bond street and this one can very well be sent with them said beatrice who knew all about it and intended herself to make a free use of the address  yes you had better send it said the squire and then nothing further was said at the table but lady arabella though she said nothing had not failed to mark what had passed had she asked for the letter before the squire he would probably have taken possession of it himself but as soon as she was alone with beatrice she did demand it i shall be writing to frank myself she said and will send it to him and so beatrice with a heavy heart gave it up  the letter lay before lady arabellas eyes all that day and many a wistful glance was cast at it she turned it over and over and much she desired to know its contents but she did not dare to break the seal of her sons letter all that day it lay upon her desk and all the next for she could hardly bring herself to part with it but on the wednesday it was sentsent with these lines from herself  dearest dearest frank i send you a letter which has come by the post from mary thorne i do not know what it may contain but before you correspond with her pray pray think of what i said to you for my sake for your fathers for your own pray think of it  that was all but it was enough to make her word to beatrice true she did send it to frank enclosed in a letter from herself we must reserve to the next chapter what had taken place between frank and his mother but for the present we will return to the doctors house  mary said not a word to him about the letter but keeping silent on the subject she felt wretchedly estranged from him is anything the matter mary he said to her on the sunday afternoon  no uncle she answered turning away her head to hide her tears  ah but there is something what is it dearest  nothingthat is nothing that one can talk about  what mary be unhappy and not to talk about it to me thats something new is it not  one has presentiments sometimes and is unhappy without knowing why besides you know  i know what do i know do i know anything that will make my pet happier and he took her in his arms as they sat together on the sofa her tears were now falling fast and she no longer made an effort to hide them speak to me mary this is more than a presentiment what is it  oh uncle  come love speak to me tell me why you are grieving  oh uncle why have you not spoken to me why have you not told me what to do why have you not advised me why are you always so silent  silent about what  you know uncle you know silent about him silent about frank  why indeed what was he to say to this it was true that he had never counselled her never shown her what course she should take had never even spoken to her about her lover and it was equally true that he was not now prepared to do so even in answer to such an appeal as this he had a hope a strong hope more than a hope that marys love would yet be happy but he could not express or explain his hope nor could he even acknowledge to himself a wish that would seem to be based on the death of him whose life he was bound if possible to preserve  my love he said it is a matter in which you must judge for yourself did i doubt your conduct i should interfere but i do not  conduct is conduct everything one may conduct oneself excellently and yet break ones heart  this was too much for the doctor his sternness and firmness instantly deserted him mary he said i will do anything that you would have me if you wish it i will make arrangements for leaving this place at once  oh no she said plaintively  when you tell me of a broken heart you almost break my own come to me darling do not leave me so i will say all that i can say i have thought do still think that circumstances will admit of your marriage with frank if you both love each other and can both be patient  you think so said she unconsciously sliding her hand into his as though to thank him by its pressure for the comfort he was giving her  i do think so now more than ever but i only think so i have been unable to assure you there darling i must not say more only that i cannot bear to see you grieving i would not have said this and then he left her and nothing more was spoken on the subject  if you can be patient why a patience of ten years would be as nothing to her could she but live with the knowledge that she was first in his estimation dearest in his heart could it be also granted to her to feel that she was regarded as his equal she could be patient for ever what more did she want than to know and feel this patient indeed  but what could these circumstances be to which her uncle had alluded i do think that circumstances will admit of your marriage such was his opinion and she had never known him to be wrong circumstances what circumstances did he perhaps mean that mr greshams affairs were not so bad as they had been thought to be if so that alone would hardly alter the matter for what could she give in return i would give him the world for one word of love she said to herself and never think that he was my debtor ah how beggarly the heart must be that speculates on such gifts as those  but there was her uncles opinion he still thought that they might be married oh why had she sent her letter and why had she made it so cold with such a letter as that before him frank could not do other than consent to her proposal and then why did he not at least answer it  on the sunday afternoon there arrived at greshamsbury a man and a horse from boxall hill bearing a letter from lady scatcherd to dr thorne earnestly requesting the doctors immediate attendance i fear everything is over with poor louis wrote the unhappy mother it has been very dreadful do come to me i have no other friend and i am nearly worn through with it the man from the cityshe meant dr fillgravecomes every day and i dare say he is all very well but he has never done much good he has not had spirit enough to keep the bottle from him and it was that and that only that most behoved to be done i doubt you wont find him in this world when you arrive here  dr thorne started immediately even though he might have to meet dr fillgrave he could not hesitate for he went not as a doctor to the dying man but as the trustee under sir rogers will moreover as lady scatcherd had said he was her only friend and he could not desert her at such a moment for an army of fillgraves he told mary he should not return that night and taking with him a small saddlebag he started at once for boxall hill  as he rode up to the hall door dr fillgrave was getting into his carriage they had never met so as to speak to each other since that memorable day when they had their famous passage of arms in the hall of that very house before which they both now stood but at the present moment neither of them was disposed to renew the fight  what news of your patient dr fillgrave said our doctor still seated on his sweating horse and putting his hand lightly to his hat  dr fillgrave could not refrain from one moment of supercilious disdain he gave one little chuck to his head one little twist to his neck one little squeeze to his lips and then the man within him overcame the doctor sir louis is no more he said  gods will be done said dr thorne  his death is a release for his last days have been very frightful your coming dr thorne will be a comfort to lady scatcherd and then dr fillgrave thinking that even the present circumstances required no further condescension ensconced himself in the carriage  his last days have been very dreadful ah me poor fellow dr fillgrave before you go allow me to say this i am quite aware that when he fell into your hands no medical skill in the world could save him  dr fillgrave bowed low from the carriage and after this unwonted exchange of courtesies the two doctors parted not to meet againat any rate in the pages of this novel of dr fillgrave let it now be said that he grows in dignity as he grows in years and that he is universally regarded as one of the celebrities of the city of barchester  lady scatcherd was found sitting alone in her little room on the groundfloor even hannah was not with her for hannah was now occupied upstairs when the doctor entered the room which he did unannounced he found her seated on a chair with her back against one of the presses her hands clasped together over her knees gazing into vacancy she did not ever hear him or see him as he approached and his hand had slightly touched her shoulder before she knew that she was not alone then she looked up at him with a face so full of sorrow so worn with suffering that his own heart was racked to see her  it is all over my friend said he it is better so much better so  she seemed at first hardly to understand him but still regarding him with that wan face shook her head slowly and sadly one might have thought that she was twenty years older than when dr thorne last saw her  he drew a chair to her side and sitting by her took her hand in his it is better so lady scatcherd better so he repeated the poor lads doom had been spoken and it is well for him and for you that it should be over  they are both gone now said she speaking very low both gone now oh doctor to be left alone here all alone  he said some few words trying to comfort her but who can comfort a widow bereaved of her child who can console a heart that has lost all that it possessed sir roger had not been to her a tender husband but still he had been the husband of her love sir louis had not been to her an affectionate son but still he had been her child her only child now they were both gone who can wonder that the world should be a blank to her  still the doctor spoke soothing words and still he held her hand he knew that his words could not console her but the sounds of his kindness at such desolate moments are to such minds as hers some alleviation of grief she hardly answered him but sat there staring out before her leaving her hand passively to him and swaying her head backwards and forwards as though her grief were too heavy to be borne  at last her eye rested on an article which stood upon the table and she started up impetuously from her chair she did this so suddenly that the doctors hand fell beside him before he knew that she had risen the table was covered with all those implements which become so frequent about a house when severe illness is an inhabitant there there were little boxes and apothecaries bottles cups and saucers standing separate and bowls in which messes have been prepared with the hope of suiting a sick mans failing appetite there was a small saucepan standing on a plate a curiously shaped glass utensil left by the doctor and sundry pieces of flannel which had been used in rubbing the sufferers limbs but in the middle of the débris stood one black bottle with head erect unsuited to the companionship in which it was found  there she said rising up and seizing this in a manner that would have been ridiculous had it not been so truly tragic there that has robbed me of everythingof all that i ever possessed of husband and child of the father and son that has swallowed them bothmurdered them both oh doctor that such a thing as that should cause such bitter sorrow i have hated it always but nowoh woe is me weary me and then she let the bottle drop from her hand as though it were too heavy for her  this comes of their barroniting she continued if they had let him alone he would have been here now and so would the other one why did they do it why did they do it ah doctor people such as us should never meddle with them above us see what has come of it see what has come of it  the doctor could not remain with her long as it was necessary that he should take upon himself the direction of the household and give orders for the funeral first of all he had to undergo the sad duty of seeing the corpse of the deceased baronet this at any rate may be spared to my readers it was found to be necessary that the interment should be made very quickly as the body was already nearly destroyed by alcohol having done all this and sent back his horse to greshamsbury with directions that clothes for a journey might be sent to him and a notice that he should not be home for some days he again returned to lady scatcherd  of course he could not but think much of the immense property which was now for a short time altogether in his own hands his resolution was soon made to go at once to london and consult the best lawyer he could findor the best dozen lawyers should such be necessaryas to the validity of marys claims this must be done before he said a word to her or to any of the gresham family but it must be done instantly so that all suspense might be at an end as soon as possible he must of course remain with lady scatcherd till the funeral should be over but when that office should be complete he would start instantly for london  in resolving to tell no one as to marys fortune till after he had fortified himself with legal warranty he made one exception he thought it rational that he should explain to lady scatcherd who was now the heir under her husbands will and he was the more inclined to do so from feeling that the news would probably be gratifying to her with this view he had once or twice endeavoured to induce her to talk about the property but she had been unwilling to do so she seemed to dislike all allusions to it and it was not till she had incidentally mentioned the fact that she would have to look for a home that he was able to fix her to the subject this was on the evening before the funeral on the afternoon of which day he intended to proceed to london  it may probably be arranged that you may continue to live here said the doctor  i dont wish it at all said she rather sharply i dont wish to have any arrangements made i would not be indebted to any of them for anything oh dear if money could make it all right i should have enough of that  indebted to whom lady scatcherd who do you think will be the owner of boxall hill  indeed then dr thorne i dont much care unless it be yourself it wont be any friend of mine or any one i shall care to make a friend of it isnt so easy for an old woman like me to make new friends  well it certainly wont belong to me  i wish it did with all my heart but even then i would not live here i have had too many troubles here to wish to see more  that shall be just as you like lady scatcherd but you will be surprised to hear that the place willat least i think it willbelong to a friend of yours to one to whom you have been very kind  and who is he doctor wont it go to some of those americans i am sure i never did anything kind to them though indeed i did love poor mary scatcherd but thats years upon years ago and she is dead and gone now well i begrudge nothing to marys children as i have none of my own it is right they should have the money it has not made me happy i hope it may do so to them  the property will i think go to mary scatcherds eldest child it is she whom you have known as mary thorne  doctor and then lady scatcherd as she made the exclamation put both her hands down to hold her chair as though she feared the weight of her surprise would topple her off her seat  yes mary thornemy maryto whom you have been so good who loves you so well she i believe will be sir rogers heiress and it was so that sir roger intended on his deathbed in the event of poor louiss life being cut short if this be so will you be ashamed to stay here as the guest of mary thorne she has not been ashamed to be your guest  but lady scatcherd was now too much interested in the general tenor of the news which she had heard to care much about the house which she was to inhabit in future mary thorne the heiress of boxall hill mary thorne the still living child of that poor creature who had so nearly died when they were all afflicted with their early grief well there was consolation there was comfort in this there were but three people left in the world that she could love her fosterchild frank greshammary thorne and the doctor if the money went to mary it would of course go to frank for she now knew that they loved each other and if it went to them would not the doctor have his share also such share as he might want could she have governed the matter she would have given it all to frank and now it would be as well bestowed  yes there was consolation in this they both sat up more than half the night talking over it and giving and receiving explanations if only the council of lawyers would not be adverse that was now the point of suspense  the doctor before he left her bade her hold her peace and say nothing of marys fortune to any one till her rights had been absolutely acknowledged it will be nothing not to have it said the doctor but it would be very bad to hear it was hers and then to lose it  on the next morning dr thorne deposited the remains of sir louis in the vault prepared for the family in the parish church he laid the son where a few months ago he had laid the fatherand so the title of scatcherd became extinct their race of honour had not been long  after the funeral the doctor hurried up to london and there we will leave him     chapter xliv  saturday evening and sunday morning   we must now go back a little and describe how frank had been sent off on special business to london the household at greshamsbury was at this time in but a doleful state it seemed to be pervaded from the squire down to the scullerymaid with a feeling that things were not going well and men and women in spite of beatrices coming marriage were grimvisaged and dolorous mr mortimer gazebee rejected though he had been still went and came talking much to the squire much also to her ladyship as to the illdoings which were in the course of projection by sir louis and frank went about the house with clouded brow as though finally resolved to neglect his one great duty  poor beatrice was robbed of half her joy over and over again her brother asked her whether she had yet seen mary and she was obliged as often to answer that she had not indeed she did not dare to visit her friend for it was hardly possible that they should sympathise with each other mary was to say the least stubborn in her pride and beatrice though she could forgive her friend for loving her brother could not forgive the obstinacy with which mary persisted in a course which as beatrice thought she herself knew to be wrong  and then mr gazebee came down from town with an intimation that it behoved the squire himself to go up that he might see certain learned pundits and be badgered in his own person at various dingy dismal chambers in lincolns inn fields the temple and grays inn lane it was an invitation exactly of that sort which a good many years ago was given to a certain duck  will you will youwill you will youcome and be killed although mr gazebee urged the matter with such eloquence the squire remained steady to his objection and swam obstinately about his greshamsbury pond in any direction save that which seemed to lead towards london  this occurred on the very evening of that friday which had witnessed the lady arabellas last visit to dr thornes house the question of the squires necessary journey to the great fountains of justice was of course discussed between lady arabella and mr gazebee and it occurred to the former full as she was of franks iniquity and of marys obstinacy that if frank were sent up in lieu of his father it would separate them at least for a while if she could only get frank away without seeing his love she might yet so work upon him by means of the message which mary had sent as to postpone if not break off this hateful match it was inconceivable that a youth of twentythree and such a youth as frank should be obstinately constant to a girl possessed of no great beautyso argued lady arabella to herselfand who had neither wealth birth nor fashion to recommend her  and thus it was at last settledthe squire being a willing party to the agreementthat frank should go up and be badgered in lieu of his father at his age it was possible to make it appear a thing desirable if not necessaryon account of the importance conveyedto sit day after day in the chambers of messrs slow  bideawhile and hear musty law talk and finger dusty law parchments the squire had made many visits to messrs slow  bideawhile and he knew better frank had not hitherto been there on his own bottom and thus he fell easily into the trap  mr oriel was also going to london and this was another reason for sending frank mr oriel had business of great importance which it was quite necessary that he should execute before his marriage how much of this business consisted in going to his tailor buying a weddingring and purchasing some other more costly present for beatrice we need not here inquire but mr oriel was quite on lady arabellas side with reference to this mad engagement and as frank and he were now fast friends some good might be done in that way if we all caution him against it he can hardly withstand us all said lady arabella to herself  the matter was broached to frank on the saturday evening and settled between them all the same night nothing of course was at that moment said about mary but lady arabella was too full of the subject to let him go to london without telling him that mary was ready to recede if only he would allow her to do so about eleven oclock frank was sitting in his own room conning over the difficulties of the situationthinking of his fathers troubles and his own positionwhen he was roused from his reverie by a slight tap at the door  come in said he somewhat loudly he thought it was one of his sisters who were apt to visit him at all hours and for all manner of reasons and he though he was usually gentle to them was not at present exactly in a humour to be disturbed  the door gently opened and he saw his mother standing hesitating in the passage  can i come in frank said she  oh yes mother by all means and then with some surprise marked in his countenance he prepared a seat for her such a visit as this from lady arabella was very unusual so much so that he had probably not seen her in his own room since the day when he first left school he had nothing however to be ashamed of nothing to conceal unless it were an open letter from miss dunstable which he had in his hand when she entered and which he somewhat hurriedly thrust into his pocket  i wanted to say a few words to you frank before you start for london about this business frank signified by a gesture that he was quite ready to listen to her  i am so glad to see your father putting the matter into your hands you are younger than he is and theni dont know why but somehow your father has never been a good man of businesseverything has gone wrong with him  oh mother do not say anything against him  no frank i will not i do not wish it things have been unfortunate certainly ah me i little thought when i marriedbut i dont mean to complaini have excellent children and i ought to be thankful for that  frank began to fear that no good could be coming when his mother spoke in that strain i will do the best i can said he up in town i cant help thinking myself that mr gazebee might have done as well but  oh dear no by no means in such cases the principal must show himself besides it is right you should know how matters stand who is so much interested in it as you are poor frank i so often feel for you when i think how the property has dwindled  pray do not mind me mother why should you talk of it as my matter while my father is not yet fortyfive his life so to speak is as good as mine i can do very well without it all i want is to be allowed to settle to something  you mean a profession  yes something of that sort  they are so slow dear frank you who speak french so welli should think my brother might get you in as attaché to some embassy  that wouldnt suit me at all said frank  well well talk about that some other time but i came about something else and i do hope you will hear me  franks brow again grew black for he knew that his mother was about to say something which it would be disagreeable for him to hear  i was with mary yesterday  well mother  dont be angry with me frank you cant but know that the fate of an only son must be a subject of anxiety to a mother ah how singularly altered was lady arabellas tone since first she had taken upon herself to discuss the marriage prospects of her son then how autocratic had she been as she sent him away bidding him with full command to throw himself into the golden embraces of miss dunstable but now how humble as she came suppliantly to his room craving that she might have leave to whisper into his ears a mothers anxious fears frank had laughed at her stern behests though he had half obeyed them but he was touched to the heart by her humility  he drew his chair nearer to her and took her by the hand but she disengaging hers parted the hair from off his forehead and kissed his brow oh frank she said i have been so proud of you am still so proud of you it will send me to my grave if i see you sink below your proper position not that it will be your fault i am sure it will not be your fault only circumstanced as you are you should be doubly trebly careful if your father had not  do not speak against my father  no frank i will notno i will not not another word and now frank  before we go on we must say one word further as to lady arabellas character it will probably be said that she was a consummate hypocrite but at the present moment she was not hypocritical she did love her son was anxiousvery very anxious for him was proud of him and almost admired the very obstinacy which so vexed her to her inmost soul no grief would be to her so great as that of seeing him sink below what she conceived to be his position she was as genuinely motherly in wishing that he should marry money as another woman might be in wishing to see her son a bishop or as the spartan matron who preferred that her offspring should return on his shield to hearing that he had come back whole in limb but tainted in honour when frank spoke of a profession she instantly thought of what lord de courcy might do for him if he would not marry money he might at any rate be an attaché at an embassy a professionhard work as a doctor or as an engineerwould according to her ideas degrade him cause him to sink below his proper position but to dangle at a foreign court to make small talk at the evening parties of a lady ambassadress and occasionally perhaps to write demiofficial notes containing demiofficial tittletattle this would be in proper accordance with the high honour of a gresham of greshamsbury  we may not admire the direction taken by lady arabellas energy on behalf of her son but that energy was not hypocritical  and now frank she looked wistfully into his face as she addressed him as though half afraid to go on and begging that he would receive with complaisance whatever she found herself forced to say  well mother  i was with mary yesterday  yes yes what then i know what your feelings are with regard to her  no frank you wrong me i have no feelings against hernone indeed none but this that she is not fit to be your wife  i think her fit  ah yes but how fit think of your position frank and what means you have of keeping her think what you are your fathers only son the heir to greshamsbury if greshamsbury be ever again more than a name it is you that must redeem it of all men living you are the least able to marry a girl like mary thorne  mother i will not sell myself for what you call my position  who asks you i do not ask you nobody asks you i do not want you to marry any one i did think oncebut let that pass you are now twentythree in ten years time you will still be a young man i only ask you to wait if you marry now that is marry such a girl as mary thorne  such a girl where shall i find such another  i mean as regards money frank you know i mean that how are you to live where are you to go and then her birth oh frank frank  birth i hate such pretence what wasbut i wont talk about it mother i tell you my word is pledged and on no account will i be induced to break it  ah thats just it thats just the point now frank listen to me pray listen to me patiently for one minute i do not ask much of you  frank promised that he would listen patiently but he looked anything but patient as he said so  i have seen mary as it was certainly my duty to do you cannot be angry with me for that  who said that i was angry mother  well i have seen her and i must own that though she was not disposed to be courteous to me personally she said much that marked her excellent good sense but the gist of it was this that as she had made you a promise nothing should turn her from that promise but your permission  and do you think  wait a moment frank and listen to me she confessed that this marriage was one which would necessarily bring distress on all your family that it was one which would probably be ruinous to yourself that it was a match which could not be approved of she did indeed she confessed all that i have nothing she saidthose were her own wordsi have nothing to say in favour of this engagement except that he wishes it that is what she thinks of it herself his wishes are not a reason but a law she said  and mother would you have me desert such a girl as that  it is not deserting frank it would not be deserting you would be doing that which she herself approves of she feels the impropriety of going on but she cannot draw back because of her promise to you she thinks that she cannot do it even though she wishes it  wishes it oh mother  i do believe she does because she has sense to feel the truth of all that your friends say oh frank i will go on my knees to you if you will listen to me  oh mother mother mother  you should think twice frank before you refuse the only request your mother ever made you and why do i ask you why do i come to you thus is it for my own sake oh my boy my darling boy will you lose everything in life because you love the child with whom you have played as a child  whose fault is it that we were together as children she is now more than a child i look on her already as my wife  but she is not your wife frank and she knows that she ought not to be it is only because you hold her to it that she consents to be so  do you mean to say that she does not love me  lady arabella would probably have said this also had she dared but she felt that in doing so she would be going too far it was useless for her to say anything that would be utterly contradicted by an appeal to mary herself  no frank i do not mean to say that you do not love her what i do mean is this that it is not becoming in you to give up everythingnot only yourself but all your familyfor such a love as this and that she mary herself acknowledges this every one is of the same opinion ask your father i need not say that he would agree with you about everything if he could i will not say the de courcys  oh the de courcys  yes they are my relations i know that lady arabella could not quite drop the tone of bitterness which was natural to her in saying this but ask your sisters ask mr oriel whom you esteem so much ask your friend harry baker  frank sat silent for a moment or two while his mother with a look almost of agony gazed into his face i will ask no one at last he said  oh my boy my boy  no one but myself can know my own heart  and you will sacrifice all to such a love as that all her also whom you say that you so love what happiness can you give her as your wife oh frank is that the only answer you will make your mother on her knees  oh mother mother  no frank i will not let you ruin yourself i will not let you destroy yourself promise this at least that you will think of what i have said  think of it i do think of it  ah but think of it in earnest you will be absent now in london you will have the business of the estate to manage you will have heavy cares upon your hands think of it as a man and not as a boy  i will see her tomorrow before i go  no frank no grant me that trifle at any rate think upon this without seeing her do not proclaim yourself so weak that you cannot trust yourself to think over what your mother says to you without asking her leave though you be in love do not be childish with it what i have told you as coming from her is true word for word if it were not you would soon learn so think now of what i have said and of what she says and when you come back from london then you can decide  to so much frank consented after some further parley namely that he would proceed to london on the following monday morning without again seeing mary and in the meantime she was waiting with sore heart for his answer to that letter that was lying and was still to lie for so many hours in the safe protection of the silverbridge postmistress  it may seem strange but in truth his mothers eloquence had more effect on frank than that of his father and yet with his father he had always sympathised but his mother had been energetic whereas his father if not lukewarm had at any rate been timid i will ask no one frank had said in the strong determination of his heart and yet the words were hardly out of his mouth before he bethought himself that he would talk the thing over with harry baker not said he to himself that i have any doubt i have no doubt but i hate to have all the world against me my mother wishes me to ask harry baker harry is a good fellow and i will ask him and with this resolve he betook himself to bed  the following day was sunday after breakfast frank went with the family to church as was usual and there as usual he saw mary in dr thornes pew she as she looked at him could not but wonder why he had not answered the letter which was still at silverbridge and he endeavoured to read in her face whether it was true as his mother had told him that she was quite ready to give him up the prayers of both of them were disturbed as is so often the case with the prayers of other anxious people  there was a separate door opening from the greshamsbury pew out into the greshamsbury grounds so that the family were not forced into unseemly community with the village multitude in going to and from their prayers for the front door of the church led out into a road which had no connexion with the private path it was not unusual with frank and his father to go round after the service to the chief entrance so that they might speak to their neighbours and get rid of some of the exclusiveness which was intended for them on this morning the squire did so but frank walked home with his mother and sisters so that mary saw no more of him  i have said that he walked home with his mother and his sisters but he rather followed in their path he was not inclined to talk much at least not to them and he continued asking himself the questionwhether it could be possible that he was wrong in remaining true to his promise could it be that he owed more to his father and his mother and what they chose to call his position than he did to mary  after church mr gazebee tried to get hold of him for there was much still to be said and many hints to be given as to how frank should speak and more especially as to how he should hold his tongue among the learned pundits in and about chancery lane you must be very wide awake with messrs slow  bideawhile said mr gazebee but frank would not hearken to him just at that moment he was going to ride over to harry baker so he put mr gazebee off till the halfhour before dinneror else the halfhour after tea  on the previous day he had received a letter from miss dunstable which he had hitherto read but once his mother had interrupted him as he was about to refer to it and now as his fathers nag was being saddledhe was still prudent in saving the black horsehe again took it out  miss dunstable had written in an excellent humour she was in great distress about the oil of lebanon she said i have been trying to get a purchaser for the last two years but my lawyer wont let me sell it because the wouldbe purchasers offer a thousand pounds or so less than the value i would give ten to be rid of the bore but i am as little able to act myself as sancho was in his government the oil of lebanon did you hear anything of it when you were in those parts i thought of changing the name to london particular but my lawyer says the brewers would bring an action against me  i was going down to your neighbourhoodto your friend the dukes at least but i am prevented by my poor doctor who is so weak that i must take him to malvern it is a great bore but i have the satisfaction that i do my duty by him  your cousin george is to be married at last so i hear at least he loves wisely if not well for his widow has the name of being prudent and fairly well to do in the world she has got over the caprices of her youth dear aunt de courcy will be so delighted i might perhaps have met her at gatherum castle i do so regret it  mr moffat has turned up again we all thought you had finally extinguished him he left a card the other day and i have told the servant always to say that i am at home and that you are with me he is going to stand for some borough in the west of ireland hes used to shillelaghs by this time  by the by i have a cadeau for a friend of yours i wont tell you what it is nor permit you to communicate the fact but when you tell me that in sending it i may fairly congratulate her on having so devoted a slave as you it shall be sent  if you have nothing better to do at present do come and see my invalid at malvern perhaps you might have a mind to treat for the oil of lebanon ill give you all the assistance i can in cheating my lawyers  there was not much about mary in this but still the little that was said made him again declare that neither father nor mother should move him from his resolution i will write to her and say that she may send her present when she pleases or i will run down to malvern for a day it will do me good to see her and so resolved he rode away to mill hill thinking as he went how he would put the matter to harry baker  harry was at home but we need not describe the whole interview had frank been asked beforehand he would have declared that on no possible subject could he have had the slightest hesitation in asking harry any question or communicating to him any tidings but when the time came he found that he did hesitate much he did not want to ask his friend if he should be wise to marry mary thorne wise or not he was determined to do that but he wished to be quite sure that his mother was wrong in saying that all the world would dissuade him from it miss dunstable at any rate did not do so  at last seated on a stile at the back of the mill hill stables while harry stood close before him with both his hands in his pockets he did get his story told it was by no means the first time that harry baker had heard about mary thorne and he was not therefore so surprised as he might have been had the affair been new to him and thus standing there in the position we have described did mr baker junior give utterance to such wisdom as was in him on this subject  you see frank there are two sides to every question and as i take it fellows are so apt to go wrong because they are so fond of one side they wont look at the other theres no doubt about it lady arabella is a very clever woman and knows whats what and theres no doubt about this either that you have a very ticklish hand of cards to play  ill play it straightforward thats my game said frank  well and good my dear fellow thats the best game always but what is straightforward between you and me i fear theres no doubt that your fathers property has got into a deuce of a mess  i dont see that that has anything to do with it  yes but it has if the estate was all right and your father could give you a thousand a year to live on without feeling it and if your eldest child would be cocksure of greshamsbury it might be very well that you should please yourself as to marrying at once but thats not the case and yet greshamsbury is too good a card to be flung away  i could fling it away tomorrow said frank  ah you think so said harry the wise but if you were to hear tomorrow that sir louis scatcherd were master of the whole place and be d to him you would feel very uncomfortable had harry known how near sir louis was to his last struggle he would not have spoken of him in this manner thats all very fine talk but it wont bear wear and tear you do care for greshamsbury if you are the fellow i take you to be care for it very much and you care too for your father being gresham of greshamsbury  this wont affect my father at all  ah but it will affect him very much if you were to marry miss thorne tomorrow there would at once be an end to any hope of your saving the property  and do you mean to say im to be a liar to her for such reasons as that why harry i should be as bad as moffat only it would be ten times more cowardly as she has no brother  i must differ from you there altogether but mind i dont mean to say anything tell me that you have made up your mind to marry her and ill stick to you through thick and thin but if you ask my advice why i must give it it is quite a different affair to that of moffats he had lots of tin everything he could want and there could be no reason why he should not marryexcept that he was a snob of whom your sister was well quit but this is very different if i as your friend were to put it to miss thorne what do you think she would say herself  she would say whatever she thought best for me  exactly because she is a trump and i say the same there can be no doubt about it frank my boy such a marriage would be very foolish for you both very foolish nobody can admire miss thorne more than i do but you oughtnt to be a marrying man for the next ten years unless you get a fortune if you tell her the truth and if shes the girl i take her to be shell not accuse you of being false shell peak for a while and so will you old chap but others have had to do that before you they have got over it and so will you  such was the spoken wisdom of harry baker and who can say that he was wrong frank sat a while on his rustle seat paring his nails with his penknife and then looking up he thus thanked his friend  im sure you mean well harry and im much obliged to you i dare say youre right too but somehow it doesnt come home to me and what is more after what has passed i could not tell her that i wish to part from her i could not do it and besides i have that sort of feeling that if i heard she was to marry any one else i am sure i should blow his brains out either his or my own  well frank you may count on me for anything except the last proposition and so they shook hands and frank rode back to greshamsbury     chapter xlv  law business in london   on the monday morning at six oclock mr oriel and frank started together but early as it was beatrice was up to give them a cup of coffee mr oriel having slept that night in the house whether frank would have received his coffee from his sisters fair hands had not mr oriel been there may be doubted he however loudly asserted that he should not have done so when she laid claim to great merit for rising in his behalf  mr oriel had been specially instigated by lady arabella to use the opportunity of their joint journey for pointing out to frank the iniquity as well as madness of the course he was pursuing and he had promised to obey her ladyships behests but mr oriel was perhaps not an enterprising man and was certainly not a presumptuous one he did intend to do as he was bid but when he began with the object of leading up to the subject of franks engagement he always softened down into some much easier enthusiasm in the matter of his own engagement with beatrice he had not that perspicuous but not oversensitive strength of mind which had enabled harry baker to express his opinion out at once and boldly as he did it yet to do so without offence  four times before the train arrived in london he made some little attempt but four times he failed as the subject was matrimony it was his easiest course to begin about himself but he never could get any further  no man was ever more fortunate in a wife than i shall be he said with a soft euphuistic selfcomplacency which would have been silly had it been adopted to any other person than the brides brother his intention however was very good for he meant to show that in his case marriage was prudent and wise because his case differed so widely from that of frank  yes said frank she is an excellent good girl he had said it three times before and was not very energetic  yes and so exactly suited to me indeed all that i could have dreamed of how very well she looked this morning some girls only look well at night i should not like that at all  you mustnt expect her to look like that always at six oclock am said frank laughing young ladies only take that trouble on very particular occasions she wouldnt have come down like that if my father or i had been going alone no and she wont do so for you in a couple of years time  oh but shes always nice i have seen her at home as much almost as you could do and then shes so sincerely religious  oh yes of course that is i am sure she is said frank looking solemn as became him  shes made to be a clergymans wife  well so it seems said frank  a married life is im sure the happiest in the worldif people are only in a position to marry said mr oriel gradually drawing near to the accomplishment of his design  yes quite so do you know oriel i never was so sleepy in my life what with all that fuss of gazebees and one thing and another i could not get to bed till one oclock and then i couldnt sleep ill take a snooze now if you wont think it uncivil and then putting his feet upon the opposite seat he settled himself comfortably to his rest and so mr oriels last attempt for lecturing frank in the railwaycarriage faded away and was annihilated  by twelve oclock frank was with messrs slow  bideawhile mr bideawhile was engaged at the moment but he found the managing chancery clerk to be a very chatty gentleman judging from what he saw he would have said that the work to be done at messrs slow  bideawhiles was not very heavy  a singular man that sir louis said the chancery clerk  yes very singular said frank  excellent security excellent no better and yet he will foreclose but you see he has no power himself but the question is can the trustee refuse then again trustees are so circumscribed nowadays that they are afraid to do anything there has been so much said lately mr gresham that a man doesnt know where he is or what he is doing nobody trusts anybody there have been such terrible things that we cant wonder at it only think of the case of those hills how can any one expect that any one else will ever trust a lawyer again after that but thats mr bideawhiles bell how can any one expect it he will see you now i dare say mr gresham  so it turned out and frank was ushered into the presence of mr bideawhile he had got his lesson by heart and was going to rush into the middle of his subject such a course however was not in accordance with mr bideawhiles usual practice mr bideawhile got up from his large woodenseated windsor chair and with a soft smile in which however was mingled some slight dash of the attorneys acuteness put out his hand to his young client not indeed as though he were going to shake hands with him but as though the hand were some ripe fruit all but falling which his visitor might take and pluck if he thought proper frank took hold of the hand which returned him no pressure and then let it go again not making any attempt to gather the fruit  i have come up to town mr bideawhile about this mortgage commenced frank  mortgageah sit down mr gresham sit down i hope your father is quite well  quite well thank you  i have a great regard for your father so i had for your grandfather a very good man indeed you perhaps dont remember him mr gresham  he died when i was only a year old  oh yes no you of course cant remember him but i do well he used to be very fond of some port wine i had i think it was 11 and if i dont mistake i have a bottle or two of it yet but it is not worth drinking now port wine you know wont keep beyond a certain time that was very good wine i dont exactly remember what it stood me a dozen then but such wine cant be had now as for the madeira you know theres an end of that do you drink madeira mr gresham  no said frank not very often  im sorry for that for its a fine wine but then theres none of it left you know i have a few dozen im told theyre growing pumpkins where the vineyards were i wonder what they do with all the pumpkins they grow in switzerland youve been in switzerland mr gresham  frank said he had been in switzerland  its a beautiful country my girls made me go there last year they said it would do me good but then you know they wanted to see it themselves ha ha ha however i believe i shall go again this autumn that is to aix or some of those places just for three weeks i cant spare any more time mr gresham do you like that dining at the tables dhôte  pretty well sometimes  one would get tired of iteh but they gave us capital dinners at zurich i dont think much of their soup but they had fish and about seven kinds of meats and poultry and three or four puddings and things of that sort upon my word i thought we did very well and so did my girls too you see a great many ladies travelling now  yes said frank a great many  upon my word i think they are right that is if they can afford time i cant afford time im here every day till five mr gresham then i go out and dine in fleet street and then back to work till nine  dear me thats very hard  well yes it is hard work my boys dont like it but i manage it somehow i get down to my little place in the country on saturday i shall be most happy to see you there next saturday  frank thinking it would be outrageous on his part to take up much of the time of the gentleman who was constrained to work so unreasonably hard began again to talk about his mortgages and in so doing had to mention the name of mr yates umbleby  ah poor umbleby said mr bideawhile what is he doing now i am quite sure your father was right or he wouldnt have done it but i used to think that umbleby was a decent sort of man enough not so grand you know as your gazebees and gumptionseh mr gresham they do say young gazebee is thinking of getting into parliament let me see umbleby marriedwho was it he married that was the way your father got hold of him not your father but your grandfather i used to know all about it well i was sorry for umbleby he has got something i supposeeh  frank said that he believed mr yates umbleby had something wherewith to keep the wolf from the door  so you have got gazebee down there now gumption gazebee  gazebee very good people im sure only perhaps they have a little too much on hand to do your father justice  but about sir louis mr bideawhile  well about sir louis a very bad sort of fellow isnt he drinkseh i knew his father a little he was a rough diamond too i was once down in northamptonshire about some railway business let me see i almost forget whether i was with him or against him but i know he made sixty thousand pounds by one hours work sixty thousand pounds and then he got so mad with drinking that we all thought  and so mr bideawhile went on for two hours and frank found no opportunity of saying one word about the business which had brought him up to town what wonder that such a man as this should be obliged to stay at his office every night till nine oclock  during these two hours a clerk had come in three or four times whispering something to the lawyer who on the last of such occasions turned to frank saying well perhaps that will do for today if youll manage to call tomorrow say about two i will have the whole thing looked up or perhaps wednesday or thursday would suit you better frank declaring that the morrow would suit him very well took his departure wondering much at the manner in which business was done at the house of messrs slow  bideawhile  when he called the next day the office seemed to be rather disturbed and he was shown quickly into mr bideawhiles room have you heard this said that gentleman putting a telegram into his hands it contained tidings of the death of sir louis scatcherd frank immediately knew that these tidings must be of importance to his father but he had no idea how vitally they concerned his own more immediate interests  dr thorne will be up in town on thursday evening after the funeral said the talkative clerk and nothing of course can be done till he comes said mr bideawhile and so frank pondering on the mutability of human affairs again took his departure  he could do nothing now but wait for dr thornes arrival and so he amused himself in the interval by running down to malvern and treating with miss dunstable in person for the oil of lebanon he went down on the wednesday and thus failed to receive on the thursday morning marys letter which reached london on that day he returned however on the friday and then got it and perhaps it was well for marys happiness that he had seen miss dunstable in the interval i dont care what your mother says said she with emphasis i dont care for any harry whether it be harry baker or old harry himself you made her a promise and you are bound to keep it if not on one day then on another what because you cannot draw back yourself get out of it by inducing her to do so aunt de courcy herself could not improve upon that fortified in this manner he returned to town on the friday morning and then got marys letter frank also got a note from dr thorne stating that he had taken up his temporary domicile at the grays inn coffeehouse so as to be near the lawyers  it has been suggested that the modern english writers of fiction should among them keep a barrister in order that they may be set right on such legal points as will arise in their little narratives and thus avoid that exposure of their own ignorance of the laws which now alas they too often make the idea is worthy of consideration and i can only say that if such an arrangement can be made and if a counsellor adequately skilful can be found to accept the office i shall be happy to subscribe my quota it would be but a modest tribute towards the cost  but as the suggestion has not yet been carried out and as there is at present no learned gentleman whose duty would induce him to set me right i can only plead for mercy if i be wrong allotting all sir rogers vast possessions in perpetuity to miss thorne alleging also in excuse that the course of my narrative absolutely demands that she shall be ultimately recognised as sir rogers undoubted heiress  such after a not immoderate delay was the opinion expressed to dr thorne by his law advisers and such in fact turned out to be the case i will leave the matter so hoping that my very absence of defence may serve to protect me from severe attack if under such a will as that described as having been made by sir roger mary would not have been the heiress that will must have been described wrongly  but it was not quite at once that those tidings made themselves absolutely certain to dr thornes mind nor was he able to express any such opinion when he first met frank in london at that time marys letter was in franks pocket and frank though his real business appertained much more to the fact of sir louiss death and the effect that would immediately have on his fathers affairs was much more full of what so much more nearly concerned himself i will show it dr thorne himself said he and ask him what he thinks  dr thorne was stretched fast asleep on the comfortless horsehair sofa in the dingy sittingroom at the grays inn coffeehouse when frank found him the funeral and his journey to london and the lawyers had together conquered his energies and he lay and snored with nose upright while heavy london summer flies settled on his head and face and robbed his slumbers of half their charms  i beg your pardon said he jumping up as though he had been detected in some disgraceful act upon my word frank i beg your pardon butwell my dear fellow all well at greshamsburyeh and as he shook himself he made a lunge at one uncommonly disagreeable fly that had been at him for the last ten minutes it is hardly necessary to say that he missed his enemy  i should have been with you before doctor but i was down at malvern  at malvern eh ah so oriel told me the death of poor sir louis was very suddenwas it not  very  poor fellowpoor fellow his fate has for some time been past hope it is a madness frank the worst of madness only think of itfather and son and such a career as the father hadsuch a career as the son might have had  it has been very quickly run said frank  may it be all forgiven him i sometimes cannot but believe in a special providence that poor fellow was not able never would have been able to make proper use of the means which fortune had given him i hope they may fall into better hands there is no use in denying it his death will be an immense relief to me and a relief also to your father all this law business will now of course be stopped as for me i hope i may never be a trustee again  frank had put his hand four or five times into his breastpocket and had as often taken out and put back again marys letter before he could find himself able to bring dr thorne to the subject at last there was a lull in the purely legal discussion caused by the doctor intimating that he supposed frank would now soon return to greshamsbury  yes i shall go tomorrow morning  what so soon as that i counted on having you one day in london with me  no i shall go tomorrow im not fit for company for any one nor am i fit for anything read that doctor its no use putting it off any longer i must get you to talk this over with me just read that and tell me what you think about it it was written a week ago when i was there but somehow i have only got it today and putting the letter into the doctors hands he turned away to the window and looked out among the holborn omnibuses dr thorne took the letter and read it mary after she had written it had bewailed to herself that the letter was cold but it had not seemed cold to her lover nor did it appear so to her uncle when frank turned round from the window the doctors handkerchief was up to his eyes who in order to hide the tears that were there was obliged to go through a rather violent process of blowing his nose  well he said as he gave back the letter to frank  well what did well mean was it well or would it be well were he frank to comply with the suggestion made to him by mary  it is impossible he said that matters should go on like that think what her sufferings must have been before she wrote that i am sure she loves me  i think she does said the doctor  and it is out of the question that she should be sacrificed nor will i consent to sacrifice my own happiness i am quite willing to work for my bread and i am sure that i am able i will not submit to doctor what answer do you think i ought to give to that letter there can be no person so anxious for her happiness as you areexcept myself and as he asked the question he again put into the doctors hand almost unconsciously the letter which he had still been holding in his own  the doctor turned it over and over and then opened it again  what answer ought i to make to it demanded frank with energy  you see frank i have never interfered in this matter otherwise than to tell you the whole truth about marys birth  oh but you must interfere you should say what you think  circumstanced as you are nowthat is just at the present momentyou could hardly marry immediately  why not let me take a farm my father could at any rate manage a couple of thousand pounds or so for me to stock it that would not be asking much if he could not give it me i would not scruple to borrow so much elsewhere and frank bethought him of all miss dunstables offers  oh yes that could be managed  then why not marry immediately say in six months or so i am not unreasonable though heaven knows i have been kept in suspense long enough as for her i am sure she must be suffering frightfully you know her best and therefore i ask you what answer i ought to make as for myself i have made up my own mind i am not a child nor will i let them treat me as such  frank as he spoke was walking rapidly about the room and he brought out his different positions one after the other with a little pause while waiting for the doctors answer the doctor was sitting with the letter still in his hands on the head of the sofa turning over in his mind the apparent absurdity of franks desire to borrow two thousand pounds for a farm when in all human probability he might in a few months be in possession of almost any sum he should choose to name and yet he would not tell him of sir rogers will if it should turn out to be all wrong said he to himself  do you wish me to give her up said frank at last  no how can i wish it how can i expect a better match for her besides frank i love no man in the world so well as i do you  then you will help me  what against your father  against no not against anybody but will you tell mary that she has your consent  i think she knows that  but you have never said anything to her  look here frank you ask me for my advice and i will give it you go home though indeed i would rather you went anywhere else  no i must go home and i must see her  very well go home as for seeing mary i think you had better put it off for a fortnight  quite impossible  well thats my advice but at any rate make up your mind to nothing for a fortnight wait for one fortnight and i then will tell you plainlyyou and her toowhat i think you ought to do at the end of a fortnight come to me and tell the squire that i will take it as a great kindness if he will come with you she has suffered terribly terribly and it is necessary that something should be settled but a fortnight more can make no great difference  and the letter  oh theres the letter  but what shall i say of course i shall write tonight  tell her to wait a fortnight and frank mind you bring your father with you  frank could draw nothing further from his friend save constant repetitions of this charge to him to wait a fortnightjust one other fortnight  well i will come to you at any rate said frank and if possible i will bring my father but i shall write to mary tonight  on the saturday morning mary who was then nearly brokenhearted at her lovers silence received a short note      my own mary     i shall be home tomorrow i will by no means release you    from your promise of course you will perceive that i only    got your letter today     your own dearest     frank     psyou will have to call me so hundreds and hundreds of    times yet   short as it was this sufficed mary it is one thing for a young lady to make prudent heartbreaking suggestions but quite another to have them accepted she did call him dearest frank even on that one day almost as often as he had desired her     chapter xlvi  our pet fox finds a tail   frank returned home and his immediate business was of course with his father and with mr gazebee who was still at greshamsbury  but who is the heir asked mr gazebee when frank had explained that the death of sir louis rendered unnecessary any immediate legal steps  upon my word i dont know said frank  you saw dr thorne said the squire he must have known  i never thought of asking him said frank naïvely  mr gazebee looked rather solemn i wonder at that said he for everything now depends on the hands the property will go into let me see i think sir roger had a married sister was not that so mr gresham and then it occurred for the first time both to the squire and to his son that mary thorne was the eldest child of this sister but it never occurred to either of them that mary could be the baronets heir  dr thorne came down for a couple of days before the fortnight was over to see his patients and then returned again to london but during this short visit he was utterly dumb on the subject of the heir he called at greshamsbury to see lady arabella and was even questioned by the squire on the subject but he obstinately refused to say more than that nothing certain could be known for yet a few days  immediately after his return frank saw mary and told her all that had happened i cannot understand my uncle said she almost trembling as she stood close to him in her own drawingroom he usually hates mysteries and yet now he is so mysterious he told me frankthat was after i had written that unfortunate letter  unfortunate indeed i wonder what you really thought of me when you were writing it  if you had heard what your mother said you would not be surprised but after that uncle said  said what  he seemed to thinki dont remember what it was he said but he said he hoped that things might yet turn out well and then i was almost sorry that i had written the letter  of course you were sorry and so you ought to have been to say that you would never call me frank again  i didnt exactly say that  i have told him i will wait a fortnight and so i will after that i shall take the matter into my own hands  it may be well supposed that lady arabella was not well pleased to learn that frank and mary had been again together and in the agony of her spirit she did say some illnatured things before augusta who had now returned from courcy castle as to the gross impropriety of marys conduct but to frank she said nothing  nor was there much said between frank and beatrice if everything could really be settled at the end of that fortnight which was to witness the disclosure of the doctors mystery there would still be time to arrange that mary should be at the wedding it shall be settled then he said to himself and if it be settled my mother will hardly venture to exclude my affianced bride from the house it was now the beginning of august and it wanted yet a month to the oriel wedding  but though he said nothing to his mother or to beatrice he did say much to his father in the first place he showed him marys letter if your heart be not made of stone it will be softened by that he said mr greshams heart was not of stone and he did acknowledge that the letter was a very sweet letter but we know how the drop of water hollows stone it was not by the violence of his appeal that frank succeeded in obtaining from his father a sort of halfconsent that he would no longer oppose the match but by the assiduity with which the appeal was repeated frank as we have said had more stubbornness of will than his father and so before the fortnight was over the squire had been talked over and promised to attend at the doctors bidding  i suppose you had better take the hazlehurst farm said he to his son with a sigh it joins the park and the homefields and i will give you up them also god knows i dont care about farming any moreor about anything else either  dont say that father  well well but frank where will you live the old house is big enough for us all but how would mary get on with your mother  at the end of his fortnight true to his time the doctor returned to the village he was a bad correspondent and though he had written some short notes to mary he had said no word to her about his business it was late in the evening when he got home and it was understood by frank and the squire that they were to be with him on the following morning not a word had been said to lady arabella on the subject  it was late in the evening when he got home and mary waited for him with a heart almost sick with expectation as soon as the fly had stopped at the little gate she heard his voice and heard at once that it was quick joyful and telling much of inward satisfaction he had a goodnatured word for janet and called thomas an old blunderhead in a manner that made bridget laugh outright  hell have his nose put out of joint some day wont he said the doctor bridget blushed and laughed again and made a sign to thomas that he had better look to his face  mary was in his arms before he was yet within the door my darling said he tenderly kissing her you are my own darling yet awhile  of course i am am i not always to be so  well well let me have some tea at any rate for im in a fever of thirst they may call that tea at the junction if they will but if china were sunk under the sea it would make no difference to them  dr thorne always was in a fever of thirst when he got home from the railway and always made complaint as to the tea at the junction mary went about her usual work with almost more than her usual alacrity and so they were soon seated in the drawingroom together  she soon found that his manner was more than ordinarily kind to her and there was moreover something about him which seemed to make him sparkle with contentment but he said no word about frank nor did he make any allusion to the business which had taken him up to town  have you got through all your work she said to him once  yes yes i think all  and thoroughly  yes thoroughly i think but i am very tired and so are you too darling with waiting for me  oh no i am not said she as she went on continually filling his cup but i am so happy to have you home again you have been away so much lately  ah yes well i suppose i shall not go away any more now it will be somebody elses turn now  uncle i think youre going to take up writing mystery romances like mrs radcliffes  yes and ill begin tomorrow certainly with but mary i will not say another word tonight give me a kiss dearest and ill go  mary did kiss him and he did go but as she was still lingering in the room putting away a book or a reel of thread and then sitting down to think what the morrow would bring forth the doctor again came into the room in his dressinggown and with the slippers on  what not gone yet said he  no not yet im going now  you and i mary have always affected a good deal of indifference as to money and all that sort of thing  i wont acknowledge that it has been an affectation at all she answered  perhaps not but we have often expressed it have we not  i suppose uncle you think that we are like the fox that lost his tail or rather some unfortunate fox that might be born without one  i wonder how we should either of us bear it if we found ourselves suddenly rich it would be a great temptationa sore temptation i fear mary that when poor people talk disdainfully of money they often are like your fox born without a tail if nature suddenly should give that beast a tail would he not be prouder of it than all the other foxes in the wood  well i suppose he would thats the very meaning of the story but how moral youve become all of a sudden at twelve oclock at night instead of being mrs radcliffe i shall think youre mr Æsop  he took up the article which he had come to seek and kissing her again on the forehead went away to his bedroom without further speech what can he mean by all this about money said mary to herself it cannot be that by sir louiss death he will get any of all this property and then she began to bethink herself whether after all she would wish him to be a rich man if he were very rich he might do something to assist frank and then  there never was a fox yet without a tail who would not be delighted to find himself suddenly possessed of that appendage never let the untailed fox have been ever so sincere in his advice to his friends we are all of us the good and the bad looking for tailsfor one tail or for more than one we do so too often by ways that are mean enough but perhaps there is no tailseeker more mean more sneakingly mean than he who looks out to adorn his bare back with a tail by marriage  the doctor was up very early the next morning long before mary was ready with her teacups he was up and in his own study behind the shop arranging dingy papers pulling about tin boxes which he had brought down with him from london and piling on his writingtable one set of documents in one place and one in another i think i understand it all said he but yet i know i shall be bothered well i never will be anybodys trustee again let me see and then he sat down and with bewildered look recapitulated to himself sundry heavy items what those shares are really worth i cannot understand and nobody seems able to tell one they must make it out among them as best they can let me see thats boxall hill and this is greshamsbury ill put a newspaper over greshamsbury or the squire will know it and then having made his arrangements he went to his breakfast  i know i am wrong my much and truly honoured critic about these titledeeds and documents but when weve got that barrister in hand then if i go wrong after that let the blame be on my own shouldersor on his  the doctor ate his breakfast quickly and did not talk much to his niece but what he did say was of a nature to make her feel strangely happy she could not analyse her own feelings or give a reason for her own confidence but she certainly did feel and even trust that something was going to happen after breakfast which would make her more happy than she had been for many months  janet said he looking at his watch if mr gresham and mr frank call show them into my study what are you going to do with yourself my dear  i dont know uncle you are so mysterious and i am in such a twitter that i dont know what to do why is mr gresham coming herethat is the squire  because i have business with him about the scatcherd property you know that he owed sir louis money but dont go out mary i want you to be in the way if i should have to call for you you can stay in the drawingroom cant you  oh yes uncle or here  no dearest go into the drawingroom mary obediently did as she was bid and there she sat for the next three hours wondering wondering wondering during the greater part of that time however she well knew that mr gresham senior and mr gresham junior were both with her uncle below  at eleven oclock the doctors visitors came he had expected them somewhat earlier and was beginning to become fidgety he had so much on his hands that he could not sit still for a moment till he had at any rate commenced it the expected footsteps were at last heard on the gravelpath and a moment or two afterwards janet ushered the father and son into the room  the squire did not look very well he was worn and sorrowful and rather pale the death of his young creditor might be supposed to have given him some relief from his more pressing cares but the necessity of yielding to franks wishes had almost more than balanced this when a man has daily to reflect that he is poorer than he was the day before he soon becomes worn and sorrowful  but frank was well both in health and spirits he also felt as mary did that the day was to bring forth something which should end his present troubles and he could not but be happy to think that he could now tell dr thorne that his fathers consent to his marriage had been given  the doctor shook hands with them both and then they sat down they were all rather constrained in their manner and at first it seemed that nothing but little speeches of compliment were to be made at last the squire remarked that frank had been talking to him about miss thorne  about mary said the doctor  yes about mary said the squire correcting himself it was quite unnecessary that he should use so cold a name as the other now that he had agreed to the match  well said dr thorne  i suppose it must be so doctor he has set his heart upon it and god knows i have nothing to say against heragainst her personally no one could say a word against her she is a sweet good girl excellently brought up and as for myself i have always loved her frank drew near to his father and pressed his hand against the squires arm by way of giving him in some sort a filial embrace for his kindness  thank you squire thank you said the doctor it is very good of you to say that she is a good girl and if frank chooses to take her he will in my estimation have made a good choice  chooses said frank with all the enthusiasm of a lover  the squire felt himself perhaps a little ruffled at the way in which the doctor received his gracious intimation but he did now show it as he went on they cannot you know doctor look to be rich people  ah well well interrupted the doctor  i have told frank so and i think that you should tell mary frank means to take some land into his hand and he must farm it as a farmer i will endeavour to give him three or perhaps four hundred a year but you know better  stop squire stop a minute we will talk about that presently this death of poor sir louis will make a difference  not permanently said the squire mournfully  and now frank said the doctor not attending to the squires last words what do you say  what do i say i say what i said to you in london the other day i believe mary loves me indeed i wont be affectedi know she does i have loved heri was going to say always and indeed i almost might say so my father knows that this is no light fancy of mine as to what he says about our being poor why  the doctor was very arbitrary and would hear neither of them on this subject  mr gresham said he interrupting frank of course i am well aware how very little suited mary is by birth to marry your only son  it is too late to think about it now said the squire  it is not too late for me to justify myself replied the doctor we have long known each other mr gresham and you said here the other day that this is a subject as to which we have been both of one mind birth and blood are very valuable gifts  i certainly think so said the squire but one cant have everything  no one cant have everything  if i am satisfied in that matter began frank  stop a moment my dear boy said the doctor as your father says one cant have everything my dear friend and he gave his hand to the squiredo not be angry if i alluded for a moment to the estate it has grieved me to see it melting awaythe old family acres that have so long been the heritage of the greshams  we need not talk about that now dr thorne said frank in an almost angry tone  but i must frank for one moment to justify myself i could not have excused myself in letting mary think that she could become your wife if i had not hoped that good might come of it  well good will come of it said frank who did not quite understand at what the doctor was driving  i hope so i have had much doubt about this and have been sorely perplexed but now i do hope so frankmr gresham and then dr thorne rose from his chair but was for a moment unable to go on with his tale  we will hope that it is all for the best said the squire  i am sure it is said frank  yes i hope it is i do think it is i am sure it is frank mary will not come to you emptyhanded i wish for your sakeyes and for hers toothat her birth were equal to her fortune as her worth is superior to both mr gresham this marriage will at any rate put an end to your pecuniary embarrassmentsunless indeed frank should prove a hard creditor my niece is sir roger scatcherds heir  the doctor as soon as he made the announcement began to employ himself sedulously about the papers on the table which in the confusion caused by his own emotion he transferred hither and thither in such a manner as to upset all his previous arrangements and now he said i might as well explain as well as i can of what that fortune consists here this isno  but dr thorne said the squire now perfectly pale and almost gasping for breath what is it you mean  theres not a shadow of doubt said the doctor ive had sir abraham haphazard and sir rickety giggs and old neversaye die and mr snilam and they are all of the same opinion there is not the smallest doubt about it of course she must administer and all that and im afraid therell be a very heavy sum to pay for the tax for she cannot inherit as a niece you know mr snilam pointed that out particularly but after all that therell beive got it down on a piece of paper somewherethree grains of blue pill im really so bothered squire with all these papers and all those lawyers that i dont know whether im sitting or standing theres ready money enough to pay all the tax and all the debts i know that at any rate  you dont mean to say that mary thorne is now possessed of all sir roger scatcherds wealth at last ejaculated the squire  but thats exactly what i do mean to say said the doctor looking up from his papers with a tear in his eye and a smile on his mouth and what is more squire you owe her at the present moment exactlyive got that down too somewhere only i am so bothered with all these papers come squire when do you mean to pay her shes in a great hurry as young ladies are when they want to get married  the doctor was inclined to joke if possible so as to carry off as it were some of the great weight of obligation which it might seem that he was throwing on the father and son but the squire was by no means in a state to understand a joke hardly as yet in a state to comprehend what was so very serious in this matter  do you mean that mary is the owner of boxall hill said he  indeed i do said the doctor and he was just going to add and of greshamsbury also but he stopped himself  what the whole property there  thats only a small portion said the doctor i almost wish it were all for then i should not be so bothered look here these are the boxall hill titledeeds thats the simplest part of the whole affair and frank may go and settle himself there tomorrow if he pleases  stop a moment dr thorne said frank these were the only words which he had yet uttered since the tidings had been conveyed to him  and these squire are the greshamsbury papers and the doctor with considerable ceremony withdrew the covering newspapers look at them there they all are once again when i suggested to mr snilam that i supposed they might now all go back to the greshamsbury muniment room i thought he would have fainted as i cannot return them to you you will have to wait till frank shall give them up  but dr thorne said frank  well my boy  does mary know all about this  not a word of it i mean that you shall tell her  perhaps under such very altered circumstances  eh  the change is so great and so sudden so immense in its effects that mary may perhaps wish  wish wish what wish not to be told of it at all  i shall not think of holding her to her engagementthat is ifi mean to say she should have time at any rate for consideration  oh i understand said the doctor she shall have time for consideration how much shall we give her squire three minutes go up to her frank she is in the drawingroom  frank went to the door and then hesitated and returned i could not do it said he i dont think that i understand it all yet i am so bewildered that i could not tell her and he sat down at the table and began to sob with emotion  and she knows nothing of it said the squire  not a word i thought that i would keep the pleasure of telling her for frank  she should not be left in suspense said the squire  come frank go up to her again urged the doctor youve been ready enough with your visits when you knew that you ought to stay away  i cannot do it said frank after a pause of some moments nor is it right that i should it would be taking advantage of her  go to her yourself doctor it is you that should do it said the squire  after some further slight delay the doctor got up and did go upstairs he even was half afraid of the task it must be done he said to himself as his heavy steps mounted the stairs but how to tell it  when he entered mary was standing halfway up the room as though she had risen to meet him her face was troubled and her eyes were almost wild the emotion the hopes the fears of that morning had almost been too much for her she had heard the murmuring of the voices in the room below and had known that one of them was that of her lover whether that discussion was to be for her good or ill she did not know but she felt that further suspense would almost kill her i could wait for years she said to herself if i did but know if i lost him i suppose i should bear it if i did but knowwell she was going to know  her uncle met her in the middle of the room his face was serious though not sad too serious to confirm her hopes at that moment of doubt what is it uncle she said taking one of his hands between both of her own what is it tell me and as she looked up into his face with her wild eyes she almost frightened him  mary he said gravely you have heard much i know of sir roger scatcherds great fortune  yes yes yes  now that poor sir louis is dead  well uncle well  it has been left  to frank to mr gresham to the squire exclaimed mary who felt with an agony of doubt that this sudden accession of immense wealth might separate her still further from her lover  no mary not to the greshams but to yourself  to me she cried and putting both her hands to her forehead she seemed to be holding her temples together to me  yes mary it is all your own now to do as you like best with it allall may god in his mercy enable you to bear the burden and lighten for you the temptation  she had so far moved as to find the nearest chair and there she was now seated staring at her uncle with fixed eyes uncle she said what does it mean then he came and sitting beside her he explained as best he could the story of her birth and her kinship with the scatcherds and where is he uncle she said why does he not come to me  i wanted him to come but her refused they are both there now the father and son shall i fetch them  fetch them whom the squire no uncle but may we go to them  surely mary  but uncle  yes dearest  is it true are you sure for his sake you know not for my own the squire you knowoh uncle i cannot go  they shall come to you  nono i have gone to him such hundreds of times i will never allow that he shall be sent to me but uncle is it true  the doctor as he went downstairs muttered something about sir abraham haphazard and sir rickety giggs but these great names were much thrown away upon poor mary the doctor entered the room first and the heiress followed him with downcast eyes and timid steps she was at first afraid to advance but when she did look up and saw frank standing alone by the window her lover restored her courage and rushing up to him she threw herself into his arms oh frank my own frank my own frank we shall never be separated now     chapter xlvii  how the bride was received and who were asked to the wedding   and thus after all did frank perform his great duty he did marry money or rather as the wedding has not yet taken place and is indeed as yet hardly talked of we should more properly say that he had engaged himself to marry money and then such a quantity of money the scatcherd wealth greatly exceeded the dunstable wealth so that our hero may be looked on as having performed his duties in a manner deserving the very highest commendation from all classes of the de courcy connexion  and he received it but that was nothing that he should be fêted by the de courcys and greshams now that he was about to do his duty by his family in so exemplary a manner that he should be patted on the back now that he no longer meditated that vile crime which had been so abhorrent to his mothers soul this was only natural this is hardly worthy of remark but there was another to be fêted another person to be made a personage another blessed human mortal about to do her duty by the family of gresham in a manner that deserved and should receive lady arabellas warmest caresses  dear mary it was indeed not singular that she should be prepared to act so well seeing that in early youth she had had the advantage of an education in the greshamsbury nursery but not on that account was it the less fitting that her virtue should be acknowledged eulogised nay all but worshipped  how the party at the doctors got itself broken up i am not prepared to say frank i know stayed and dined there and his poor mother who would not retire to rest till she had kissed him and blessed him and thanked him for all he was doing for the family was kept waiting in her dressingroom till a very unreasonable hour of the night  it was the squire who brought the news up to the house arabella he said in a low but somewhat solemn voice you will be surprised at the news i bring you mary thorne is the heiress to all the scatcherd property  oh heavens mr gresham  yes indeed continued the squire so it is it is very very but lady arabella had fainted she was a woman who generally had her feelings and her emotions much under her own control but what she now heard was too much for her when she came to her senses the first words that escaped her lips were dear mary  but the household had to sleep on the news before it could be fully realised the squire was not by nature a mercenary man if i have at all succeeded in putting his character before the reader he will be recognised as one not over attached to money for moneys sake but things had gone so hard with him the world had become so rough so ungracious so full of thorns the want of means had become an evil so keenly felt in every hour that it cannot be wondered at that his dreams that night should be of a golden elysium the wealth was not coming to him true but his chief sorrow had been for his son now that son would be his only creditor it was as though mountains of marble had been taken from off his bosom  but lady arabellas dreams flew away at once into the seventh heaven sordid as they certainly were they were not absolutely selfish frank would now certainly be the first commoner in barsetshire of course he would represent the county of course there would be the house in town it wouldnt be her house but she was contented that the grandeur should be that of her child he would have heaven knows what to spend per annum and that it should come through mary thorne what a blessing she had allowed mary to be brought into the greshamsbury nursery dear mary  she will of course be one now said beatrice to her sister with her at the present moment one of course meant one of the bevy that was to attend her at the altar oh dear how nice i shant know what to say to her tomorrow but i know one thing  what is that asked augusta  she will be as mild and as meek as a little dove if she and the doctor had lost every shilling in the world she would have been as proud as an eagle it must be acknowledged that beatrice had had the wit to read marys character aright  but augusta was not quite pleased with the whole affair not that she begrudged her brother his luck or mary her happiness but her ideas of right and wrongperhaps we should rather say lady amelias ideaswould not be fairly carried out  after all beatrice this does not alter her birth i know it is useless saying anything to frank  why you wouldnt break both their hearts now  i dont want to break their hearts certainly but there are those who put their dearest and warmest feelings under restraint rather than deviate from what they know to be proper poor augusta she was the stern professor of the order of this philosophy the last in the family who practised with unflinching courage its cruel behests the last always excepting the lady amelia  and how slept frank that night with him at least let us hope nay let us say boldly that his happiest thoughts were not of the wealth which he was to acquire but yet it would be something to restore boxall hill to greshamsbury something to give back to his father those rumpled vellum documents since the departure of which the squire had never had a happy day nay something to come forth again to his friends as a gay young country squire instead of as a farmer clodcompelling for his bread we would not have him thought to be better than he was nor would we wish him to make him of other stuff than nature generally uses his heart did exult at marys wealth but it leaped higher still when he thought of purer joys  and what shall we say of marys dreams with her it was altogether what she should give not at all what she should get frank had loved her so truly when she was so poor such an utter castaway frank who had ever been the heir of greshamsbury frank who with his beauty and spirit and his talents might have won the smiles of the richest the grandest the noblest what ladys heart would not have rejoiced to be allowed to love her frank but he had been true to her through everything ah how often she thought of that hour when suddenly appearing before her he had strained her to his breast just as she had resolved how best to bear the deathlike chill of his supposed estrangements she was always thinking of that time she fed her love by recurring over and over to the altered feeling of that moment any now she could pay him for his goodness pay him no that would be a base word a base thought her payment must be made if god would so grant it in many many years to come but her store such as it was should be emptied into his lap it was soothing to her pride that she would not hurt him by her love that she would bring no injury to the old house dear dear frank she murmured as her waking dreams conquered at last by sleep gave way to those of the fairy world  but she thought not only of frank dreamed not only of him what had he not done for her that uncle of hers who had been more loving to her than any father how was he too to be paid paid indeed love can only be paid in its own coin it knows of no other legal tender well if her home was to be greshamsbury at any rate she would not be separated from him  what the doctor dreamed of that neither he or any one ever knew why uncle i think youve been asleep said mary to him that evening as he moved for a moment uneasily on the sofa he had been asleep for the last threequarters of an hourbut frank his guest had felt no offence no ive not been exactly asleep said he but im very tired i wouldnt do it all again frank to double the money you havent got any more tea have you mary  on the following morning beatrice was of course with her friend there was no awkwardness between them in meeting beatrice had loved her when she was poor and though they had not lately thought alike on one very important subject mary was too gracious to impute that to beatrice as a crime  you will be one now mary of course you will  if lady arabella will let me come  oh mary let you do you remember what you said once about coming and being near me i have so often thought of it and now mary i must tell you about caleb and the young lady settled herself on the sofa so as to have a comfortable long talk beatrice had been quite right mary was as meek with her and as mild as a dove  and then patience oriel came my fine young darling magnificent overgrown heiress said patience embracing her my breath deserted me and i was nearly stunned when i heard of it how small we shall all be my dear i am quite prepared to toady to you immensely but pray be a little gracious to me for the sake of auld lang syne  mary gave a long long kiss yes for auld lang syne patience when you took me away under your wing to richmond patience also had loved her when she was in her trouble and that love too should never be forgotten  but the great difficulty was lady arabellas first meeting with her i think ill go down to her after breakfast said her ladyship to beatrice as the two were talking over the matter while the mother was finishing her toilet  i am sure she will come up if you like it mamma  she is entitled to every courtesyas franks accepted bride you know said lady arabella i would not for worlds fail in any respect to her for his sake  he will be glad enough for her to come i am sure said beatrice i was talking with caleb this morning and he says  the matter was of importance and lady arabella gave it her most mature consideration the manner of receiving into ones family an heiress whose wealth is to cure all ones difficulties disperse all ones troubles give a balm to all the wounds of misfortune must under any circumstances be worthy of much care but when that heiress has been already treated as mary had been treated  i must see her at any rate before i go to courcy said lady arabella  are you going to courcy mamma  oh certainly yes i must see my sisterinlaw now you dont seem to realise the importance my dear of franks marriage he will be in a great hurry about it and indeed i cannot blame him i expect that they will all come here  who mamma the de courcys  yes of course i shall be very much surprised if the earl does not come now and i must consult my sisterinlaw as to asking the duke of omnium  poor mary  and i think it will perhaps be better continued lady arabella that we should have a larger party than we intended at your affair the countess im sure would come now we couldnt put it off for ten days could we dear  put it off ten days  yes it would be convenient  i dont think mr oriel would like that at all mamma you know he has made all his arrangements for his sundays  pshaw the idea of the parsons sundays being allowed to have any bearing on such a matter as franks wedding would now become why they would havehow much between twelve and fourteen thousand a year lady arabella who had made her calculations a dozen times during the night had never found it to be much less than the larger sum mr oriels sundays indeed  after much doubt lady arabella acceded to her daughters suggestion that mary should be received at greshamsbury instead of being called on at the doctors house if you think she wont mind the coming up first said her ladyship i certainly could receive her better here i should be moremoremore able you know to express what i feel we had better go into the big drawingroom today beatrice will you remember to tell mrs richards  oh certainly was marys answer when beatrice with a voice a little trembling proposed to her to walk up to the house certainly i will if lady arabella will receive meonly one thing trichy  whats that dearest  frank will think that i come after him  never mind what he thinks to tell you the truth mary i often call upon patience for the sake of finding caleb thats all fair now you know  mary very quietly put on her straw bonnet and said she was ready to go up to the house beatrice was a little fluttered and showed it mary was perhaps a good deal fluttered but she did not show it she had thought a good deal of her first interview with lady arabella of her first return to the house but she had resolved to carry herself as though the matter were easy to her she would not allow it to be seen that she felt that she brought with her to greshamsbury comfort ease and renewed opulence  so she put on her straw bonnet and walked up with beatrice everybody about the place had already heard the news the old woman at the lodge curtsied low to her the gardener who was mowing the lawn the butler who opened the front doorhe must have been watching marys approachhad manifestly put on a clean white neckcloth for the occasion  god bless you once more miss thorne said the old man in a halfwhisper mary was somewhat troubled for everything seemed in a manner to bow down before her and why should not everything bow down before her seeing that she was in truth the owner of greshamsbury  and then a servant in livery would open the big drawingroom door this rather upset both mary and beatrice it became almost impossible for mary to enter the room just as she would have done two years ago but she got through the difficulty with much selfcontrol  mamma heres mary said beatrice  nor was lady arabella quite mistress of herself although she had studied minutely how to bear herself  oh mary my dear mary what can i say to you and then with a handkerchief to her eyes she ran forward and hid her face on miss thornes shoulders what can i saycan you forgive me my anxiety for my son  how do you do lady arabella said mary  my daughter my child my franks own bride oh mary oh my child if i have seemed unkind to you it has been through love to him  all these things are over now said mary mr gresham told me yesterday that i should be received as franks future wife and so you see i have come and then she slipped through lady arabellas arms and sat down meekly down on a chair in five minutes she had escaped with beatrice into the schoolroom and was kissing the children and turning over the new trousseau they were however soon interrupted and there was perhaps some other kissing besides that of the children  you have no business in here at all frank said beatrice has he mary  none in the world i should think  see what he has done to my poplin i hope you wont have your things treated so cruelly hell be careful enough about them  is oriel a good hand at packing up fineryeh beatrice asked frank  he is at any rate too wellbehaved to spoil it thus mary was again made at home in the household of greshamsbury  lady arabella did not carry out her little plan of delaying the oriel wedding her idea had been to add some grandeur to it in order to make it a more fitting precursor of that other greater wedding which was to follow so soon in its wake but this with the assistance of the countess she found herself able to do without interfering with poor mr oriels sunday arrangements the countess herself with the ladies alexandrina and margaretta now promised to come even to this first affair and for the other the whole de courcy family would turn out count and countess lords and ladies honourable georges and honourable johns what honour indeed could be too great to show to a bride who had fourteen thousand a year in her own right or to a cousin who had done his duty by securing such a bride to himself  if the duke be in the country i am sure he will be happy to come said the countess of course he will be talking to frank about politics i suppose the squire wont expect frank to belong to the old school now  frank of course will judge for himself rosinawith his position you know and so things were settled at courcy castle  and then beatrice was wedded and carried off to the lakes mary as she had promised did stand near her but not exactly in the gingham frock of which she had once spoken she wore on that occasion but it will be too much perhaps to tell the reader what she wore as beatrices bridesmaid seeing that a couple of pages at least must be devoted to her marriagedress and seeing also that we have only a few pages to finish everything the list of visitors the marriage settlements the dress and all included  it was in vain that mary endeavoured to repress lady arabellas ardour for grand doings after all she was to be married from the doctors house and not from greshamsbury and it was the doctor who should have invited the guests but in this matter he did not choose to oppose her ladyships spirit and she had it all her own way  what can i do said he to mary i have been contradicting her in everything for the last two years the least we can do is to let her have her own way now in a trifle like this  but there was one point on which mary would let nobody have his or her own way on which the way to be taken was very manifestly to be her own this was touching the marriage settlements it must not be supposed that if beatrice were married on a tuesday mary could be married on the tuesday week following ladies with twelve thousand a year cannot be disposed of in that way and bridegrooms who do their duty by marrying money often have to be kept waiting it was spring the early spring before frank was made altogether a happy man  but a word about the settlements on this subject the doctor thought he would have been driven mad messrs slow  bideawhile as the lawyers of the greshamsbury familyit will be understood that mr gazebees law business was of quite a different nature and his work as regarded greshamsbury was now nearly overmessrs slow  bideawhile declared that it would never do for them to undertake alone to draw out the settlements an heiress such as mary must have lawyers of her own half a dozen at least according to the apparent opinion of messrs slow  bideawhile and so the doctor had to go to other lawyers and they had again to consult sir abraham and mr snilam on a dozen different heads  if frank became tenant in tail in right of his wife but under his father would he be able to grant leases for more than twentyone years and if so to whom would the right of trover belong as to flotsam and jetsamthere was a little property mr critic on the seashorethat was a matter that had to be left unsettled at the last such points as these do take a long time to consider all this bewildered the doctor sadly and frank himself began to make accusations that he was to be done out of his wife altogether  but as we have said there was one point on which mary would have her own way the lawyers might tie up as they would on her behalf all the money and shares and mortgages which had belonged to the late sir roger with this exception all that had ever appertained to greshamsbury should belong to greshamsbury again not in perspective not to her children or to her childrens children but at once frank should be lord of boxall hill in his own right and as to those other liens on greshamsbury let frank manage that with his father as he might think fit she would only trouble herself to see that he was empowered to do as he did think fit  but argued the ancient respectable family attorney to the doctor that amounts to twothirds of the whole estate twothirds dr thorne it is preposterous i should almost say impossible and the scanty hairs on the poor mans head almost stood on end as he thought of the outrageous manner in which the heiress prepared to sacrifice herself  it will all be the same in the end said the doctor trying to make things smooth of course their joint object will be to put the greshamsbury property together again  but my dear sirand then for twenty minutes the lawyer went on proving that it would by no means be the same thing but nevertheless mary thorne did have her own way  in the course of the winter lady de courcy tried very hard to induce the heiress to visit courcy castle and this request was so backed by lady arabella that the doctor said he thought she might as well go there for three or four days but here again mary was obstinate  i dont see it at all she said if you make a point of it or frank or mr gresham i will go but i cant see any possible reason the doctor when so appealed to would not absolutely say that he made a point of it and mary was tolerably safe as regarded frank or the squire if she went frank would be expected to go and frank disliked courcy castle almost more than ever his aunt was now more than civil to him and when they were together never ceased to compliment him on the desirable way in which he had done his duty by his family  and soon after christmas a visitor came to mary and stayed a fortnight with her one whom neither she nor the doctor had expected and of whom they had not much more than heard this was the famous miss dunstable birds of a feather flock together said mrs rantawaylate miss gushingwhen she heard of the visit the railway mans nieceif you can call her a nieceand the quacks daughter will do very well together no doubt  at any rate they can count their moneybags said mrs umbleby  and in fact mary and miss dunstable did get on very well together and miss dunstable made herself quite happy at greshamsbury although some peopleincluding mrs rantawaycontrived to spread a report that dr thorne jealous of marys money was going to marry her  i shall certainly come and see you turned off said miss dunstable taking leave of her new friend miss dunstable it must be acknowledged was a little too fond of slang but then a lady with her fortune and of her age may be fond of almost whatever she pleases  and so by degrees the winter wore awayvery slowly to frank as he declared often enough and slowly perhaps to mary also though she did not say so the winter wore away and the chill bitter windy early spring came round the comic almanacs give us dreadful pictures of january and february but in truth the months which should be made to look gloomy in england are march and april let no man boast himself that he has got through the perils of winter till at least the seventh of may  it was early in april however that the great doings were to be done at greshamsbury not exactly on the first it may be presumed that in spite of the practical commonsense spirit of the age very few people do choose to have themselves united on that day but some day in the first week of that month was fixed for the ceremony and from the end of february all through march lady arabella worked and strove in a manner that entitled her to profound admiration  it was at last settled that the breakfast should be held in the large diningroom at greshamsbury there was a difficulty about it which taxed lady arabella to the utmost for in making the proposition she could not but seem to be throwing some slight on the house in which the heiress had lived but when the affair was once opened to mary it was astonishing how easy it became  of course said mary all the rooms in our house would not hold half the people you are talking aboutif they must come  lady arabella looked so beseechingly nay so piteously that mary had not another word to say it was evident that they must all come the de courcys to the fifth generation the duke of omnium himself and others in concatenation accordingly  but will your uncle be angry if we have the breakfast up here he has been so very handsome to frank that i wouldnt make him angry for all the world  if you dont tell him anything about it lady arabella hell think that it is all done properly he will never know if hes not told that he ought to give the breakfast and not you  wont he my dear and lady arabella looked her admiration for this very talented suggestion and so that matter was arranged the doctor never knew till mary told him some year or so afterwards that he had been remiss in any part of his duty  and who was asked to the wedding in the first place we have said that the duke of omnium was there this was in fact the one circumstance that made this wedding so superior to any other that had ever taken place in that neighbourhood the duke of omnium never went anywhere and yet he went to marys wedding and mary when the ceremony was over absolutely found herself kissed by a duke dearest mary exclaimed lady arabella in her ecstasy of joy when she saw the honour that was done to her daughterinlaw  i hope we shall induce you to come to gatherum castle soon said the duke to frank i shall be having a few friends there in the autumn let me see i declare i have not seen you since you were good enough to come to my collection ha ha ha it wasnt bad fun was it frank was not very cordial with his answer he had not quite reconciled himself to the difference of his position when he was treated as one of the collection at gatherum castle he had not married money  it would be vain to enumerate all the de courcys that were there there was the earl looking very gracious and talking to the squire about the county and there was lord porlock looking very ungracious and not talking to anybody about anything and there was the countess who for the last week past had done nothing but pat frank on the back whenever she could catch him and there were the ladies alexandrina margaretta and selina smiling at everybody and the honourable george talking in whispers to frank about his widownot such a catch as yours you know but something extremely snugand have it all my own way too old fellow or i shant come to the scratch and the honourable john prepared to toady frank about his string of hunters and the lady amelia by herself not quite contented with these democratic nuptialsafter all she is so absolutely nobody absolutely absolutely she said confidentially to augusta shaking her head but before lady amelia had left greshamsbury augusta was quite at a loss to understand how there could be need for so much conversation between her cousin and mr mortimer gazebee  and there were many more de courcys whom to enumerate would be much too long  and the bishop of the diocese and mrs proudie were there a hint had even been given that his lordship would himself condescend to perform the ceremony if this should be wished but that work had already been anticipated by a very old friend of the greshams archdeacon grantly the rector of plumstead episcopi had long since undertaken this part of the business and the knot was eventually tied by the joint efforts of himself and mr oriel mrs grantly came with him and so did mrs grantlys sister the new deans wife the dean himself was at the time unfortunately absent at oxford  and all the bakers and the jacksons were there the last time they had all met together under the squires roof was on the occasion of franks coming of age the present gala doings were carried on a very different spirit that had been a very poor affair but this was worthy of the best days of greshamsbury  occasion also had been taken of this happy moment to make up or rather to get rid of the last shreds of the last feud that had so long separated dr thorne from his own relatives the thornes of ullathorne had made many overtures in a covert way but our doctor had contrived to reject them they would not receive mary as their cousin said he and i will go nowhere that she cannot go but now all this was altered mrs gresham would certainly be received in any house in the county and thus mr thorne of ullathorne an amiable popular old bachelor came to the wedding and so did his maiden sister miss monica thorne than whose no kinder heart glowed through all barsetshire  my dear said she to mary kissing her and offering her some little tribute i am very glad to make your acquaintance very it was not her fault she added speaking to herself and now that she will be a gresham that need not be any longer be thought of nevertheless could miss thorne have spoken her inward thoughts out loud she would have declared that frank would have done better to have borne his poverty than marry wealth without blood but then there are but few so stanch as miss thorne perhaps none in that countyalways excepting lady amelia  and miss dunstable also was a bridesmaid oh no said she when asked you should have them young and pretty but she gave way when she found that mary did not flatter her by telling her that she was either the one or the other the truth is said miss dunstable i have always been a little in love with your frank and so i shall do it for his sake there were but four the other two were the gresham twins lady arabella exerted herself greatly in framing hints to induce mary to ask some of the de courcy ladies to do her so much honour but on this head mary would please herself rank said she to beatrice with a curl on her lip has its drawbacksand must put up with them  and now i find that i have not one pagenot half a pagefor the weddingdress but what matters will it not be all found written in the columns of the morning post  and thus frank married money and became a great man let us hope that he will be a happy man as the time of the story has been brought down so near to the present era it is not practicable for the novelist to tell much of his future career when i last heard from barsetshire it seemed to be quite settled that he is to take the place of one of the old members at the next election and they say also that there is no chance of any opposition i have heard too that there have been many very private consultations between him and various gentlemen of the county with reference to the hunt and the general feeling is said to be that the hounds should go to boxall hill  at boxall hill the young people established themselves on their return from the continent and that reminds me that one word must be said of lady scatcherd  you will always stay here with us said mary to her caressing her ladyships rough hand and looking kindly into that kind face  but lady scatcherd would not consent to this i will come and see you sometimes and then i shall enjoy myself yes i will come and see you and my own dear boy the affair was ended by her taking mrs opie greens cottage in order that she might be near the doctor mrs opie green having marriedsomebody  and of whom else must we say a word patience also of course got a husbandor will do so dear patience it would be a thousand pities that so good a wife should be lost to the world whether miss dunstable will ever be married or augusta gresham or mr moffat or any of the tribe of the de courcysexcept lady ameliai cannot say they have all of them still their future before them that bridget was married to thomasthat i am able to assert for i know that janet was much put out by their joint desertion  lady arabella has not yet lost her admiration for mary and mary in return behaves admirably another event is expected and her ladyship is almost as anxious about that as she was about the wedding a matter you know of such importance in the county she whispered to lady de courcy  nothing can be more happy than the intercourse between the squire and his son what their exact arrangements are we need not specially inquire but the demon of pecuniary embarrassment has lifted his black wings from the demesne of greshamsbury  and now we have but one word left for the doctor if you dont come and dine with me said the squire to him when they found themselves both deserted mind i shall come and dine with you and on this principle they seem to act dr thorne continues to extend his practice to the great disgust of dr fillgrave and when mary suggested to him that he should retire he almost boxed her ears he knows the way however to boxall hill as well as he ever did and is willing to acknowledge that the tea there is almost as good as it ever was at greshamsbury
