59111309	what every woman knows  james m barrie    act i  james wylie is about to make a move on the dambrod and in the little scotch room there is an awful silence befitting the occasion james with his hand poisedfor if he touches a piece he has to play it alick will see to thatraises his red head suddenly to read alicks face his father who is alick is pretending to be in a panic lest james should make this move james grins heartlessly and his fingers are about to close on the man when some instinct of selfpreservation makes him peep once more this time alick is caught the unholy ecstasy on his face tells as plain as porridge that he has been luring james to destruction james glares and too late his opponent is a simple old father again james mops his head sprawls in the manner most conducive to thought in the wylie family and protruding his underlip settles down to a reconsideration of the board alick blows out his cheeks and a drop of water settles on the point of his nose  you will find them thus any saturday night after family worship which sends the servant to bed and sometimes the pauses are so long that in the end they forget whose move it is  it is not the room you would be shown into if you were calling socially on miss wylie the drawingroom for you and miss wylie in a coloured merino to receive you very likely she would exclaim this is a pleasant surprise though she has seen you coming up the avenue and has just had time to whip the dustcloths off the chairs and to warn alick david and james that they had better not dare come in to see you before they have put on a dickey nor is this the room in which you would dine in solemn grandeur if invited to drop in and take potluck which is how the wylies invite it being a family weakness to pretend that they sit down in the diningroom daily it is the real livingroom of the house where alick who will never get used to fashionable ways can take off his collar and sit happily in his stocking soles and james at times would do so also but catch maggie letting him  there is one very fine chair but heavens not for sitting on just to give the room a social standing in an emergency it sneers at the other chairs with an air of insolent superiority like a haughty bride who has married into the house for money otherwise the furniture is homely most of it has come from that smaller house where the wylies began there is the large and shiny chair which can be turned into a bed if you look the other way for a moment james cannot sit on this chair without gradually sliding down it till he is lying luxuriously on the small of his back his legs indicating like the hands of a clock that it is ten past twelve a position in which maggie shudders to see him receiving company  the other chairs are horsehair than which nothing is more comfortable if there be a good slit down the seat the seats are heavily dented because all the wylie family sit down with a dump the draughtboard is on the edge of a large centre table which also displays four books placed at equal distances from each other one of them a bible and another the family album if these were the only books they would not justify maggie in calling this chamber the library her dogged name for it while david and james call it the westroom and alick calls it the room which is to him the natural name for any apartment without a bed in it there is a bookcase of pitch pine which contains six hundred books with glass doors to prevent your getting at them  no one does try to get at the books for the wylies are not a reading family they like you to gasp when you see so much literature gathered together in one prisonhouse but they gasp themselves at the thought that there are persons chiefly clergymen who having finished one book coolly begin another nevertheless it was not all vainglory that made david buy this library it was rather a mighty respect for education as something that he has missed this same feeling makes him take in the contemporary review and stand up to it like a man alick who also has a respect for education tries to read the contemporary but becomes dispirited and may be heard muttering over its pages no no use no use no and sometimes even oh hell james has no respect for education and maggie is at present of an open mind  they are wylie and sons of the local granite quarry in which alick was throughout his working days a mason it is david who has raised them to this position he climbed up himself step by step and hewed the steps and drew the others up after him wylie brothers alick would have had the firm called but david said no and james said no and maggie said no first honour must be to their father and alick now likes it on the whole though he often sighs at having to shave every day and on some snell mornings he still creeps from his couch at four and even at two thinking that his mallet and chisel are calling him and begins to pull on his trousers until the grandeur of them reminds him that he can go to bed again sometimes he cries a little because there is no more work for him to do for ever and ever and then maggie gives him a spade without telling david or david gives him the logs to saw without telling maggie  we have given james a longer time to make his move than our kind friends in front will give him but in the meantime something has been happening david has come in wearing a black coat and his sabbath boots for he has been to a public meeting david is nigh forty years of age whiskered like his father and brother alicks whiskers being worn as a sort of cravat round the neck and he has the too brisk manner of one who must arrive anywhere a little before any one else the painter who did the three of them for fifteen pounds you may observe the canvases on the walls has caught this characteristic perhaps accidentally for david is almost stepping out of his frame as if to hurry off somewhere while alick and james look as if they were pinned to the wall for life all the six of them men and pictures however have a family resemblance like granite blocks from their own quarry they are as scotch as peat for instance and they might exchange eyes without any neighbour noticing the difference inquisitive little blue eyes that seem to be always totting up the price of things  the dambrod players pay no attention to david nor does he regard them dumping down on the sofa he removes his lastic sides as his sabbath boots are called by pushing one foot against the other gets into a pair of handsewn slippers deposits the boots as according to rule in the ottoman and crosses to the fire there must be something on davids mind tonight for he pays no attention to the game neither gives advice than which nothing is more maddening nor exchanges a wink with alick over the parlous condition of jamess crown you can hear the wagatthewall clock in the lobby ticking then david lets himself go it runs out of him like a hymn  david oh let the solid ground not fail beneath my feet before my life has found what some have found so sweet  this is not a soliloquy but is offered as a definite statement the players emerge from their game with difficulty  alick with jamess crown in his hand whats that youre saying david  david like a public speaker explaining the situation in a few wellchosen words the thing im speaking about is love  james keeping control of himself do you stand there and say youre in love david wylie  david me what would i do with the thing  james who is by no means without pluck i see no necessity for calling it a thing  they are two bachelors who all their lives have been afraid of nothing but woman david in his sportive dayswhich continuehas done roguish things with his arm when conducting a lady home under an umbrella from a soiree and has both chuckled and been scared on thinking of it afterwards james a commoner fellow altogether has discussed the sex over a glass but is too canny to be in the company of less than two young women at a time  david derisively oho has she got you james  james feeling the sting of it nobody has got me  david theyll catch you yet lad  james theyll never catch me youve been nearer catched yourself  alick yes kitty menzies david  david feeling himself under the umbrella it was a kind of a shave that  alick who knows all that is to be known about women and can speak of them without a tremor its a curious thing but a man cannot help winking when he hears that one of his friends has been catched  david thats so  james clinging to his manhood and fear of that wink is what has kept the two of us single men and yet whats the glory of being single  david theres no particular glory in it but its safe  james putting away his aspirations yes its lonely but its safe but who did you mean the poetry for then  david for maggie of course  you dont know david and james till you know how they love their sister maggie  alick i thought that  david coming to the second point of his statement about love i saw her reading poetry and saying those words over to herself  james she has such a poetical mind  david love theres no doubt as thats what maggie has set her heart on and not merely love but one of those grand noble loves for though maggie is undersized she has a passion for romance  james wandering miserably about the room its terrible not to be able to give maggie what her heart is set on  the others never pay much attention to james though he is quite a smart figure in less important houses  alick violently those idiots of men  david father did you tell her who had got the minister of galashiels  alick wagging his head sadly i had to tell her and then ii bought her a sealskin muff and i just slipped it into her hands and came away  james illustrating the sense of justice in the wylie family of course to be fair to the man he never pretended he wanted her  david none of them wants her thats what depresses her i was thinking father i would buy her that gold watch and chain in snibbys window she hankers after it  james slapping his pocket youre too late david ive got them for her  david its ill done of the minister many a pound of steak has that man had in this house  alick you mind the slippers she worked for him  james i mind them fine she began them for william cathro shes getting on in years too though she looks so young  alick i never can make up my mind david whether her curls make her look younger or older  david determinedly younger whist i hear her winding the clock mind not a word about the minister to her james dont even mention religion this day  james would it be like me to do such a thing  david it would be very like you and theres that other matter say not a syllable about our having a reason for sitting up late to night when she says its bedtime just all pretend were not sleepy  alick exactly and when  here maggie enters and all three are suddenly engrossed in the dambrod we could describe maggie at great length but what is the use what you really want to know is whether she was goodlooking no she was not enter maggie who is not goodlooking when this is said all is said enter maggie as it were with her throat cut from ear to ear she has a soft scotch voice and a more resolute manner than is perhaps fitting to her plainness and she stops short at sight of james sprawling unconsciously in the company chair  maggie james i wouldnt sit on the fine chair  james i forgot again  but he wishes she had spoken more sharply even profanation of the fine chair has not roused her she takes up her knitting and they all suspect that she knows what they have been talking about  maggie youre late david its nearly bedtime  david finding the subject a safe one i was kept late at the public meeting  alick glad to get so far away from galashiels was it a good meeting  david fairish with some heat that young john shand would make a speech  maggie john shand is that the student shand  david the same its true hes a student at glasgow university in the winter months but in summer hes just the railway porter here and i think its very presumptuous of a young lad like that to make a speech when he hasnt a penny to bless himself with  alick the shands were always an impudent family and jealous i suppose thats the reason they havent been on speaking terms with us this six years was it a good speech  david illustrating the familys generosity it was very fine but he neednt have made fun of me  maggie losing a stitch he dared  david depressed you see i can not get started on a speech without saying things like in rising for to make a few remarks  james whats wrong with it  david he mimicked me and said will our worthy chairman come for to go for to answer my questions and so on and they roared  james slapping his money pocket the sacket  david i did feel bitterly father the want of education without knowing it he has a beautiful way of pronouncing this noble word  maggie holding out a kind hand to him david  alick ive missed it sore david even now i feel the want of it in the very marrow of me im ashamed to think i never gave you your chance but when you were young i was so desperate poor how could i do it maggie  maggie it wasnt possible father  alick gazing at the bookshelves to be able to understand these books to up with them one at a time and scrape them as clean as though they were a bowl of brose lads its not to riches its to scholarship that i make my humble bow  james who is good at bathos theres ten yards of them and they were selected by the minister of galashiels he said  david quickly james  james i meani mean  maggie calmly i suppose you mean what you say james i hear david that the minister of galashiels is to be married on that miss turnbull  david on guard so they were saying  alick all i can say is she has made a poor bargain  maggie the damned i wonder at you father hes a very nice gentleman im sure i hope he has chosen wisely  james not him  maggie getting near her tragedy how can you say that when you dont know her i expect she is full of charm  alick charm its the very word he used  david havering idiot  alick what is charm exactly maggie  maggie oh itsits a sort of bloom on a woman if you have it you dont need to have anything else and if you dont have it it doesnt much matter what else you have some women the few have charm for all and most have charm for one but some have charm for none  somehow she has stopped knitting her menfolk are very depressed james brings his fist down on the table with a crash  james shouting i have a sister that has charm  maggie no james you havent  james rushing at her with the watch and chain hae maggie  she lets them lie in her lap  david maggie would you like a silk  maggie what could i do with a silk with a gust of passion you might as well dress up a little brown hen  they wriggle miserably  james stamping bring him here to me  maggie bring whom james  james david i would be obliged if you wouldnt kick me beneath the table  maggie rising lets be practical lets go to our beds  this reminds them that they have a job on hand in which she is not to share  david slily i dont feel very sleepy yet  alick nor me either  james youve just taken the very words out of my mouth  david with unusual politeness goodnight to you maggie  maggie fixing the three of them all of you unsleepy when as is well known ten oclock is your regular bedtime  james yes its common knowledge that we go to our beds at ten chuckling thats what were counting on  maggie counting on  david you stupid whelp  james what have i done  maggie folding her arms theres something up youve got to tell me david  david who knows when he is beaten go out and watch james  maggie watch  james takes himself off armed as maggie notices with a stick  david in his alert business way maggie there are burglars about  maggie burglars she sits rigid but she is not the kind to scream  david we hadnt meant for to tell you till we nabbed them but theyve been in this room twice of late we sat up last night waiting for them and were to sit up again tonight  maggie the silver plate  david its all safe as yet that makes us think that they were either frightened away these other times or that they are coming back for to make a clean sweep  maggie how did you get to know about this  david it was on tuesday that the polissman called at the quarry with a very queer story he had seen a man climbing out at this window at ten past two  maggie did he chase him  david it was so dark he lost sight of him at once  alick tell her about the window  david weve found out that the catch of the window has been pushed back by slipping the blade of a knife between the woodwork  maggie david  alick the polissman said he was carrying a little carpet bag  maggie the silver plate is gone  david no no we were thinking that very likely he has bunches of keys in the bag  maggie or weapons  david as for that we have some pretty stout weapons ourselves in the umbrella stand so if youll go to your bed maggie  maggie me and my brothers in danger  alick theres just one of them  maggie the polissman just saw one  david licking his palms i would be very pleased if there were three of them  maggie i watch with you i would be very pleased if there were four of them  david and they say she has no charm  james returns on tiptoe as if the burglars were beneath the table he signs to every one to breathe no more and then whispers his news  james hes there i had no sooner gone out than i saw him sliding down the garden wall close to the rhubarbs  alick whats he like  james hes an ugly customer thats all i could see there was a little carpet bag in his hand  david thats him  james he slunk into the rhodydendrons and hes there now watching the window  david we have him out with the light  the room is beautified by a chandelier fitted for three gas jets but with the advance of progress one of these has been removed and the incandescent light put in its place this alone is lit alick climbs a chair pulls a little chain and the room is now but vaguely lit by the fire it plays fitfully on four sparkling faces  maggie do you think he saw you james  james i couldnt say but in any case i was too clever for him i looked up at the stars and yawned loud at them as if i was tremendous sleepy  there is a long pause during which they are lurking in the shadows at last they hear some movement and they steal like ghosts from the room we see david turning out the lobby light then the door closes and an empty room awaits the intruder with a shudder of expectancy the window opens and shuts as softly as if this were a mother peering in to see whether her baby is asleep then the head of a man shows between the curtains the remainder of him follows he is carrying a little carpet bag he stands irresolute what puzzles him evidently is that the wylies should have retired to rest without lifting that piece of coal off the fire he opens the door and peeps into the lobby listening to the wagatthewall clock all seems serene and he turns on the light we see him clearly now he is john shand age twentyone boots muddy as an indignant carpet can testify he wears a shabby topcoat and a cockerty bonnet otherwise he is in the well worn corduroys of a railway porter his movements at first stealthy become almost homely as he feels that he is secure he opens the bag and takes out a bunch of keys a small paper parcel and a black implement that may be a burglars jemmy this cool customer examines the fire and piles on more coals with the keys he opens the door of the bookcase selects two large volumes and brings them to the table he takes off his topcoat and opens his parcel which we now see contains sheets of foolscap paper his next action shows that the jemmy is really a ruler he knows where the pen and ink are kept he pulls the fine chair nearer to the table sits on it and proceeds to write occasionally dotting the carpet with ink as he stabs the air with his pen he is so occupied that he does not see the door opening and the wylie family staring at him they are armed with sticks  alick at last when youre ready john shand  john hints back and then he has the grace to rise dogged and expressionless  james like a railway porter ticket please  david you cant think of anything clever for to go for to say now john  maggie i hope you find that chair comfortable young man  john i have no complaint to make against the chair  alick who is really distressed a native of the town the disgrace to your family i feel pity for the shands this night  john glowering ill thank you mr wylie not to pity my family  james canny canny  maggie that sense of justice again i think you should let the young man explain it maynt be so bad as we thought  david explain away my billie  john only the uneducated would need an explanation im a student with a little passion and im desperate for want of books you have all i want here no use to you but for display well i came here to study i come twice weekly amazement of his hosts  david who is the first to recover by the window  john do you think a shand would so far lower himself as to enter your door well is it a case for the police  james it is  maggie not so much out of the goodness of her heart as to patronise the shands it seems to me its a case for us all to go to our beds and leave the young man to study but not on that chair and she wheels the chair away from him  john thank you miss maggie but i couldnt be beholden to you  james my opinion is that hes nobody so out with him  john yes out with me and youll be cheered to hear im likely to be a nobody for a long time to come  david who had been beginning to respect him are you a poor scholar  john on the contrary im a brilliant scholar  david its siller then  john glorified by experiences he has shared with many a gallant soul my first year at college i lived on a barrel of potatoes and we had just a sofabed between two of us when the one lay down the other had to get up do you think it was hardship it was sublime but this year i cant afford it ill have to stay on here collecting the tickets of the illiterate such as you when i might be with romulus and remus among the stars  james summing up havers  david in whose head some design is vaguely taking shape whist james i must say young lad i like your spirit now tell me whats your professors opinion of your future  john they think me a young man of extraordinary promise  david you have a name here for high moral character  john and justly  david are you seriousminded  john i never laughed in my life  david who do you sit under in glasgow  john mr flemister of the sauchiehall high  david are you a sabbathschool teacher  john i am  david one more question are you promised  john to a lady  david yes  john ive never given one of them a single word of encouragement im too much occupied thinking about my career  david so he reflects and finally indicates by a jerk of the head that he wishes to talk with his father behind the door  james longingly do you want me too  but they go out without even answering him  maggie i dont know what maggot they have in their heads but sit down young man till they come back  john my names mr shand and till im called that i decline to sit down again in this house  maggie then im thinking young sir youll have a weary wait  while he waits you can see how pinched his face is he is little more than a boy and he seldom has enough to eat david and alick return presently looking as sly as if they had been discussing some move on the dambrod as indeed they have  david suddenly become genial sit down mr shand and pull in your chair youll have a thimbleful of something to keep the cold out briskly glasses maggie  she wonders but gets glasses and decanter from the sideboard which james calls the chiffy david and alick in the most friendly manner also draw up to the table  youre not a totaller i hope  john guardedly im practically a totaller  david so are we how do you take it is there any hot water maggie  john if i take it at all and i havent made up my mind yet ill take it cold  david youll take it hot james  james also sitting at the table but completely befogged no i  david decisively i think youll take it hot james  james sulking ill take it hot  david the kettle maggie  james has evidently to take it hot so that they can get at the business now on hand while maggie goes kitchenward for the kettle  alick now david quick before she comes back  david mr shand we have an offer to make you  john warningly no patronage  alick its strictly a business affair  david leave it to me father its thisbut to his annoyance the suspicious maggie has already returned with the kettle maggie dont you see that youre not wanted  maggie sitting down by the fire and resuming her knitting i do david  david i have a proposition to put before mr shand and women are out of place in business transactions  the needles continue to click  alick sighing well have to let her bide david  david sternly woman but even this does not budge her very well then sit there but dont interfere mind mr shand were willing the three of us to lay out l300 on your education if  john take care  david slowly which is not his wont on condition that five years from now maggie wylie if still unmarried can claim to marry you should such be her wish the thing to be perfectly open on her side but you to be strictly tied down  james enlightened so so  david resuming his smart manner now what have you to say decide  john after a pause i regret to say  maggie it doesnt matter what he regrets to say because i decide against it and i think it was very illdone of you to make any such proposal  david without looking at her quiet maggie  john looking at her i must say miss maggie i dont see what reasons you can have for being so set against it  maggie if you would grow a beard mr shand the reasons wouldnt be quite so obvious  john ill never grow a beard  maggie then youre done for at the start  alick come come  maggie seeing i have refused the young man  john refused  david thats no reason why we shouldnt have his friendly opinion your objections mr shand  john simply its a onesided bargain i admit im no catch at present but what could a man of my abilities not soar to with three hundred pounds something far above what she could aspire to  maggie oh indeed  david the position is that without the three hundred you cant soar  john you have me there  maggie yes but  alick you see youre safeguarded maggie you dont need to take him unless you like but he has to take you  john thats an unfair arrangement also  maggie i wouldnt dream of it without that condition  john then you are thinking of it  maggie poof  david its a good arrangement for you mr shand the chances are youll never have to go on with it for in all probability shell marry soon  james shes tremendous run after  john even if thats true its just keeping me in reserve in case she misses doing better  david relieved thats the situation in a nutshell  john another thing supposing i was to get fond of her  alick wistfully its very likely  john yes and then suppose she was to give me the goby  david you have to risk that  john or take it the other way supposing as i got to know her i could not endure her  david suavely you have both to take risks  james less suavely what you need john shand is a clout on the head  john three hundred pounds is no great sum  david you can take it or leave it  alick no great sum for a student studying for the ministry  john do you think that with that amount of money i would stop short at being a minister  david thats how i like to hear you speak a young scotsman of your ability let loose upon the world with l300 what could he not do its almost appalling to think of especially if he went among the english  john what do you think miss maggie  maggie who is knitting i have no thoughts on the subject either way  john after looking her over whats her age she looks young but they say its the curls that does it  david rather happily shes one of those women who are eternally young  john i cant take that for an answer  david shes twentyfive  john im just twentyone  james i read in a book that about four years difference in the ages is the ideal thing as usual he is disregarded  david well mr shand  john where is his mother im willing if shes willing  david maggie  maggie there can be no if about it it must be an offer  john a shand give a wylie such a chance to humiliate him never  maggie then all is off  david come come mr shand its just a form  john reluctantly miss maggie will you  maggie doggedly is it an offer   john dourly yes  maggie rising before i answer i want first to give you a chance of drawing back  david maggie  maggie bravely when they said that i have been run after they were misleading you im without charm nobody has ever been after me  john oho  alick they will be yet  john the innocent it shows at least that you havent been after them  his hosts exchange a selfconscious glance  maggie one thing more david said im twentyfive im twentysix  john aha  maggie now be practical do you withdraw from the bargain or do you not  john on reflection its a bargain  maggie then so be it  david hurriedly and thats settled did you say you would take it hot mr shand  john i think ill take it neat  the others decide to take it hot and there is some careful business here with the toddy ladles  alick heres to you and your career  john thank you to you miss maggie had we not better draw up a legal document lawyer crosbie could do it on the quiet  david should we do that or should we just trust to one anothers honour  alick gallantly let maggie decide  maggie i think we would better have a legal document  david well have it drawn up tomorrow i was thinking the best way would be for to pay the money in five yearly instalments  john i was thinking better bank the whole sum in my name at once  alick i think davids plans the best  john i think not of course if its not convenient to you  david touched to the quick its perfectly convenient what do you say maggie  maggie i agree with john  david with an odd feeling that maggie is now on the other side very well  john then as thats settled i think ill be stepping he is putting his papers back in the bag  alick politely if you would like to sit on at your books  john as i can come at any orra time now i think ill be stepping maggie helps him into his topcoat  maggie have you a muffler john  john i have he gets it from his pocket  maggie you had better put it twice round she does this for him  david well goodnight to you mr shand  alick and good luck  john thank you the same to you and ill cry in at your office in the morning before the 620 is due  david ill have the document ready for you there is the awkward pause that sometimes follows great events i think maggie you might see mr shand to the door  maggie certainly john is going by the window this way john  she takes him off by the more usual exit  david hes a fine frank fellow and you saw how cleverly he got the better of me about banking the money as the heads of the conspirators come gleefully together i tell you father he has a grand business head  alick lads hes canny hes cannier than any of us  james except maybe maggie he has no idea what a remarkable woman maggie is  alick best he shouldnt know men are nervous of remarkable women  james shes a long time in coming back  david not quite comfortable its a good sign hsh what sort of a night is it maggie  maggie its a little blowy  she gets a large dustcloth which is lying folded on a shelf and proceeds to spread it over the fine chair the men exchange selfconscious glances  david stretching himself yeswell well oh yes its getting late what is it with you father  alick im ten fortytwo  james im tenforty  david ten fortytwo  they wind up their watches  maggie its high time we were bedded she puts her hands on their shoulders lovingly which is the very thing they have been trying to avoid youre very kind to me  david havers  alick havers  james but this does not matter havers  maggie a little dolefully im a sort of sorry for the young man david  david not at all youll be the making of him she lifts the two volumes are you taking the books to your bed maggie  maggie yes i dont want him to know things i dont know myself  she departs with the books and alick and david the villains now want to get away from each other  alick yesyes oh yesay manit is soumpha youll lift the big coals off david  he wanders away to his spring mattress david removes the coals  james who would like to sit down and have an argybargy its a most romantical affair but he gets no answer i wonder how itll turn out no answer shes queer maggie i wonder how some clever writers has never noticed how queer women are its my belief you could write a whole book about them david remains obdurate it was very noble of her to tell him shes twentysix muttering as he too wanders away but i thought she was twentyseven  david turns out the light     act ii  six years have elapsed and john shands great hour has come perhaps his great hour really lies ahead of him perhaps he had it six years ago it often passes us by in the night with such a faint call that we dont even turn in our beds but according to the trumpets this is johns great hour it is the hour for which he has long been working with his coat off and now the coat is on again broadcloth but ill fitting for there is no more to do but await results he is standing for parliament and this is election night  as the scene discloses itself you get so to speak one of john shands posters in the face vote for shand shand shand shand civil and religious liberty faith hope freedom they are all fly blown names for shand have a placard about shand have a hundred placards about him it is snowing shand tonight in glasgow take the paste out of your eye and you will see that we are in one of shands committee rooms it has been a hairdressers emporium but shand shand shand has swept through it like a wind leaving nothing but the fixtures why shave why have your head doused in those basins when you can be brushed and scraped and washed up for ever by simply voting for shand  there are a few hard chairs for yelling shand from and then rushing away there is an iron spiral staircase that once led to the ladies hairdressing apartments but now leads to more shand shand shand a glass door at the back opens on to the shop proper screaming civil and religious liberty shand as it opens and beyond is the street crammed with still more shand pro and con men in every sort of garb rush in and out up and down the stair shouting the magic word then there is a lull and down the stair comes maggie wylie decidedly overdressed in blue velvet and let us get this over less good looking than ever she raises her hands to heaven she spins round like a little teetotum to her from the street suffering from a determination of the word shand to the mouth rush alick and david alick is thinner being older david is stouter being older and they are both in tweeds and silk hats  maggie davidhave theyis he quick quick david theres no news yet no news its terrible  the teetotum revolves more quickly  alick for gods sake maggie sit down   maggie i cant i cant  david hold her down  they press her into a chair james darts in stouter also his necktie has gone he will never again be able to

six years very well well begin another six tonight youll win yet fiercely never give in john never give in  the roar of the multitude breaks out again and comes rolling nearer  david i think hes coming  james is fired into the room like a squeezed onion  james hes coming  they may go on speaking but through the clang outside none could hear the populace seems to be trying to take the committee room by assault out of the scrimmage a man emerges dishevelled and bursts into the room closing the door behind him it is john shand in a five guinea suit including the hat there are other changes in him also for he has been delving his way through loamy ground all those years his right shoulder which he used to raise to pound a path through the crowd now remains permanently in that position his mouth tends to close like a box his eyes are tired they need some one to pull the lids over them and send him to sleep for a week but they are honest eyes still and faithful and could even light up his face at times with a smile if the mouth would give a little help  john clinging to a chair that he may not fly straight to heaven im in im elected majority two hundred and fortyfour im john shand mp  the crowd have the news by this time and their roar breaks the door open james is off at once to tell them that he is to be shands brotherinlaw a teardrop clings to alicks nose david

gentleman resumes his seat in a torrent of admiring applause  alick and david waggle their proud heads  john tolerantly maggie maggie  maggie youre not angry with me john  john no no  maggie but you glowered  john i was thinking of sir peregrine just because i beat him at the poll he took a shabby revenge he congratulated me in french a language i havent taken the trouble to master  maggie becoming a little taller would it help you john if you were to marry a woman that could speak french  david quickly not at all  maggie gloriously mon cher jean laissezmoi parler le francais voulezvous

honourable lady sybil tenterden frowns her shes his sister  maggie a married woman  john no the comtesse de la briere  maggie the scholar she must be french  john yes i think shes some relation shes a widow  james but what am i to say to them mr shands compliments and he will be proud to receive them is the very least that the wylies expect  john who was evidently made for great ends say im very busy but if they care to wait i hope presently to give them a few minutes  james thunderstruck good god mr shand  but it makes him johns more humble servant than ever and he departs with the message  john not unaware of the sensation he has created ill go up and let the crowd see me from the window  maggie butbutwhat are we to do with these ladies  john as he tramps upwards its your reception maggie this will prove you  maggie growing smaller tell me what you know about this lady sybil  john the only thing i know about her is that she thinks me vulgar  maggie you  john she has attended some of my meetings and im told she said that  maggie what could the woman mean  john i wonder when i come down ill ask her  with his departure maggies nervousness increases  alick encouragingly in at them maggie with your french  maggie its all slipping from me father  david gloomily im sure to say for to come for to go  the newcomers glorify the room and maggie feels that they have lifted her up with the tongs and deposited her in one of the basins they are far from intending to be rude it is not their fault that thus do swans scatter the ducks they do not know that they are guests of the family they think merely that they are waiting with other strangers in a public room they undulate inquiringly and if maggie could undulate in return she would have no cause for offence but she suddenly realises that this is an art as yet denied her and that though david might buy her eveninggowns as fine as theirs and is at this moment probably deciding to do so she would look better carrying them in her arms than on her person she also feels that to emerge from wraps as they are doing is more difficult than to plank your money on the counter for them the comtesse she could forgive for she is old but lady sybil is young and beautiful and comes lazily to rest like a stately ship of tarsus  comtesse smiling divinely and speaking with such a pretty accent i hope one is not in the way we were told we might wait  maggie bravely climbing out of the basin certainlyi am sure if you will be soit is  she knows that david and her father are very sorry for her   a high voice is heard orating outside  sybil screwing her nose deliciously he is at it again auntie  comtesse mon dieu like one begging pardon of the universe it is mr tenterden you understand making one more of his delightful speeches to the crowd would you be so charming as to shut the door  this to david in such appeal that she is evidently making the petition of her life david saves her  maggie determined not to go under jespere que voustrouvez cettereunioninteressante  comtesse vous parlez francais mais cest charmant voyons causons un peu racontezmoi tout de ce grand homme toutes les choses merveilleuses quil a faites  maggie iije connaisalas  comtesse naughtily forgive me mademoiselle i thought you spoke french  sybil who knows that david admires her shoulders how wicked of you auntie to maggie i assure you none of us can understand her when she gallops at that pace  maggie crushed it doesnt matter i will tell mr shand that you are here  sybil drawling please dont trouble him we are really only waiting till my brother recovers and can take us back to our hotel  maggie ill tell him  she is glad to disappear up the stair  comtesse the lady seems distressed is she a relation of mr shand  david not for to say a relation shes my sister our name is wylie  but granite quarries are nothing to them  comtesse how do you do you are the committee man of mr shand  david no just friends  comtesse gaily to the basins aha i know you next please sybil do you weigh yourself or are you asleep  lady sybil has sunk indolently into a weighingchair  sybil not quite auntie  comtesse the mirror of la politesse tell me all about mr shand was it here that hepicked up the pin  david the pin  comtesse as i have read a selfmade man always begins by picking up a pin after that as the memoirs say his rise was rapid  david however is once more master of himself and indeed has begun to tot up the cost of their garments  david it wasnt a pin he picked up my lady it was l300  alick who feels that johns greatness has been outside the conversation quite long enough and his rise wasnt so rapid just at first david  david he had his fight his original intention was to become a minister hes universityeducated you know hes not a workingman member  alick with reverence hes an ma but while he was a student he got a place in an ironcementers business  comtesse now far out of her depths ironcementer  david they scrape boilers  comtesse i see the fun men have sybil  david with some solemnity there have been millions made in scraping boilers they say father he went into business so as to be able to pay off the l300  alick slily so ive heard  comtesse ahait was a loan  david and alick are astride their great subject now  david no a giftof a sortfrom some wellwishers but they wouldnt hear of his paying it off father  alick not them  comtesse restraining an impulse to think of other things that was kind charming  alick with a look at david yes well my lady he developed a perfect genius for the ironcementing  david but his ambition wasnt satisfied soon he had public life in his eye as a heckler he was something fearsome they had to seat him on the platform for to keep him quiet next they had to let him into the chair after that he did all the speaking he cleared all roads before him like a fireengine and when this vacancy occurred you could hardly say it did occur so quickly did he step into it my lady there are few more impressive sights in the world than a scotsman on the make  comtesse i can well believe it and now he has said farewell to boilers  david impressively not at all the firm promised if he was elected for to make him their london manager at l800 a year  comtesse there is a strong man for you sybil but i believe you are asleep  sybil stirring herself honestly im not sweetly to the others but would you mind finding out whether my brother is drawing to a close  david goes out leaving poor alick marooned the comtesse is kind to him  comtesse thank you very much which helps alick out dont you love a strong man sleepy head  sybil preening herself i never met one  comtesse neither have i but if you did meet one would he wakes you up  sybil i dare say he would find there were two of us  comtesse considering her yes i think he would ever been in love you cold thing  sybil yawning i have never shot up in flame auntie  comtesse think you could manage it  sybil if mr right came along  comtesse as a girl of today it would be your duty to tame him  sybil as a girl of today i would try to do my duty  comtesse and if it turned out that he tamed you instead  sybil he would have to do that if he were my mr right  comtesse and then  sybil then of course i should adore him auntie i think if i ever really love it will be like mary queen of scots who said of her bothwell that she could follow him round the world in her nighty  comtesse my petite  sybil i believe i mean it  comtesse oh it is quite my conception of your character do you know i am rather sorry for this mr john shand  sybil opening her fine eyes why he is quite a boor is he not  comtesse for that very reason because his great hour is already nearly sped that wild bull manner that moves the multitudethey will laugh at it in your house of commons  sybil indifferent i suppose so  comtesse yet if he had education  sybil have we not been hearing how superbly he is educated  comtesse it is such as you or me that he needs to educate him now you could do it almost too well  sybil with that pretty stretch of neck i am not sufficiently interested i retire in your favour how would you begin  comtesse by asking him to drop in about five of course by the way i wonder is there a mrs shand  sybil i have no idea but they marry young  comtesse if there is not there is probably a lady waiting for him somewhere in a boiler  sybil i dare say  maggie descends  maggie mr shand will be down directly  comtesse thank you your brother has been giving us such an interesting account of his career i forget sybil whether he said that he was married  maggie no hes not married but he will be soon  comtesse ah she is merely making conversation a friend of yours  maggie now a scorner of herself i dont think much of her  comtesse in that case tell me all about her  maggie theres not much to tell shes common and stupid one of those who go in for selfculture and then when the test comes they break down with sinister enjoyment shell be the ruin of him  comtesse but is not that sad figure to yourself how many men with greatness before them have been shipwrecked by marrying in the rank from which they sprang  maggie ive told her that  comtesse but she will not give him up  maggie no  sybil why should she if he cares for her what is her name  maggie itsmaggie  comtesse still uninterested well i am afraid that maggie is to do for john john comes down ah our hero  john sorry i have kept you waiting the comtesse  comtesse and my niece lady sybil tenterden sybils head inclines on its stem she is not really all my niece i mean i am only half of her aunt what a triumph mr shand  john oh pretty fair pretty fair your brother has just finished addressing the crowd lady sybil  sybil then we must not detain mr shand auntie  comtesse who unless her heart is touched thinks insincerity charming only one word i heard you speak last night sublime just the sort of impassioned eloquence that your house of commons loves  john its very good of you to say so  comtesse but we must run bon soir  sybil bows as to some one far away  john goodnight lady sybil i hear you think im vulgar eyebrows are raised  comtesse my dear mr shand what absurd  john i was told she said that after hearing me speak  comtesse quite a mistake i  john doggedly is it not true  sybil waking up you seem to know mr shand and as you press me so unnecessarilywell yes that is how you struck me  comtesse my child  sybil who is a little agitated he would have it  john perplexed whats the matter i just wanted to know because if its true i must alter it  comtesse there sybil see how he values your good opinion  sybil her svelte figure giving like a fishingrod it is very nice of you to put it in that way mr shand forgive me  john but i dont quite understand yet of course it cant matter to me lady sybil what you think of me what i mean is that i mustnt be vulgar if it would be injurious to my career  the fishingrod regains its rigidity  sybil i see no of course i could not affect your career mr shand  john who quite understands that he is being challenged thats so lady sybil meaning no offence  sybil who has a naughty little impediment in her voice when she is most alluring of course not and we are friends again  john certainly  sybil then i hope you will come to see me in london as i present no terrors  john he is a man is john ill be very pleased  sybil any afternoon about five  john much obliged and you can teach me the things i dont know yet if youll be so kind  sybil the impediment becoming more assertive if you wish it i shall do my best  john thank you lady sybil and who knows there may be one or two things i can teach you  sybil it has now become an angels hiccough yes we can help one another goodbye till then  john goodbye maggie the ladies are going  during this skirmish maggie has stood apart at the mention of her name they glance at one another john escorts sybil but the comtesse turns back  comtesse are you then the maggie maggie nods rather defiantly and the comtesse is distressed but if i had known i would not have said those things please forgive an old woman  maggie it doesnt matter  comtesse ii dare say it will be all right mademoiselle if i were you i would not encourage those teteatetes with lady sybil i am the rude one but she is the dangerous one and i am afraid his impudence has attracted her bon voyage miss maggie  maggie goodbyebut i can speak french je parle francais isnt that right  comtesse but yes it is excellent making things easy for her cest tres bien  maggie je me suis embrouilleela derniere fois  comtesse good shall i speak more slowly  maggie no no nonon non faster faster  comtesse jadmire votre courage  maggie je comprends chaque mot  comtesse parfait bravo  maggie voila  comtesse superbe  she goes applauding and maggie has a moment of elation which however has passed before john returns for his hat  maggie have you more speaking to do john he is somehow in high goodhumour  john i must run across and address the cowcaddens club he sprays his throat with a handspray i wonder if i am vulgar maggie  maggie you are not but i am  john not that i can see  maggie look how overdressed i am john i knew it was too showy when i ordered it and yet i could not resist the thing but i will tone it down i will what did you think of lady sybil  john that young woman had better be careful shes a bit of a besom maggie  maggie shes beautiful john  john she has a neat way of stretching herself for playing with she would do as well as another  she looks at him wistfully  maggie you couldnt stay and have a talk for a few minutes  john if you want me maggie the longer you keep them waiting the more they think of you  maggie when are you to announce that were to be married john  john i wont be long youve waited a year more than you need have done so i think its your due i should hurry things now  maggie i think its noble of you  john not at all maggie the nobleness has been yours in waiting so patiently and your brothers would insist on it at any rate theyre watching me like cats with a mouse  maggie its so little ive done to help  john three hundred pounds  maggie im getting a thousand per cent for it  john and very pleased i am you should think so maggie  maggie is it terrible hard to you john  john its not hard at all i can say truthfully maggie that all or nearly all ive seen of you in these six years has gone to increase my respect for you  maggie respect  john and a bargains a bargain  maggie if it wasnt that youre so glorious to me john i would let you off  there is a gleam in his eye but he puts it out  john in my opinion maggie well be a very happy pair  she accepts this eagerly  maggie we know each other so well john dont we  john im an extraordinary queer character and i suppose nobody knows me well except myself but i know you maggie to the very roots of you  she magnanimously lets this remark alone  maggie and its not as if there was any other woman youfancied more john  john theres none whatever  maggie if there ever should beoh if there ever should be some woman with charm  john maggie you forget yourself there couldnt be another woman once i was a married man  maggie one has heard of such things  john not in scotsmen maggie not in scotsmen  maggie ive sometimes thought john that the difference between us and the english is that the scotch are hard in all other respects but soft with women and the english are hard with women but soft in all other respects  john youve forgotten the grandest moral attribute of a scotsman maggie that hell do nothing which might damage his career  maggie ah but john whatever you do you do it so tremendously and if you were to love what a passion it would be  john theres something in that i suppose  maggie and then what could i do for the desire of my life now john is to help you to get everything you want except just that i want you to have me too  john well get on fine maggie  maggie youre just making the best of it they say that love is sympathy and if thats so mine must be a great love for you for i see all you are feeling this night and bravely hiding i feel for you as if i was john shand myself he sighs  john i had best go to the meeting maggie  maggie not yet can you look me in the face john and deny that there is surging within you a mighty desire to be free to begin the new life untrammelled  john leave such maggots alone maggie  maggie its a shame of me not to give you up  john i would consider you a very foolish woman if you did  maggie if i were john shand i would no more want to take maggie wylie with me through the beautiful door that has opened wide for you than i would want to take an old pair of shoon why dont you bang the door in my face john a tremor runs through john  john a bargains a bargain maggie  maggie moves about an eerie figure breaking into little cries she flutters round him threateningly  maggie say one word about wanting to get out of it and ill put the lawyers on you  john have i hinted at such a thing  maggie the document holds you hard and fast  john it does  she gloats miserably  maggie the woman never rises with the man ill drag you down john ill drag you down  john have no fear of that i wont let you im too strong  maggie youll miss the prettiest thing in the world and all owing to me  john whats that  maggie romance  john poof  maggie alls cold and grey without it john they that have had it have slipped in and out of heaven  john youre exaggerating maggie  maggie youve worked so hard youve had none of the fun that comes to most men long before theyre your age  john i never was one for fun i cannot call to mind maggie ever having laughed in my life  maggie you have no sense of humour  john not a spark  maggie ive sometimes thought that if you had it might make you fonder of me i think one needs a sense of humour to be fond of me  john i remember reading of some one that said it needed a surgical operation to get a joke into a scotsmans head  maggie yes thats been said  john what beats me maggie is how you could insert a joke with an operation  he considers this and gives it up  maggie thats not the kind of fun i was thinking of i mean fun with the lasses johngay jolly harmless fun they could be impudent fashionable beauties now stretching themselves to attract you like that hiccoughing little devil and running away from you and crooking their fingers to you to run after them  he draws a big breath  john no i never had that  maggie its every mans birthright and you would have it now but for me  john i can do without maggie  maggie its like missing out all the saturdays  john you feel sure i suppose that an older man wouldnt suit you better maggie  maggie i couldnt feel surer of anything youre just my ideal  john yes yes well thats as it should be  she threatens him again  maggie david has the document its carefully locked away  john he would naturally take good care of it  the pride of the wylies deserts her  maggie john i make you a solemn promise that in consideration of the circumstances of our marriage if you should ever fall in love ill act differently from other wives  john there will be no occasion maggie  her voice becomes tremulous  maggie john david doesnt have the document he thinks he has but i have it here  somewhat heavily john surveys the fatal paper  john well do i mind the look of it maggie yes yes thats it umpha  maggie you dont ask why ive brought it  john why did you  maggie because i thought i might perhaps have the courage and the womanliness to give it back to you john has a brief dream will you never hold it up against me in the future that i couldnt do that  john i promise you maggie i never will  maggie to go back to the pans and take up my old life there when all these six years my eyes have been centred on this night ive been waiting for this night as long as you have been and now to go back there and wizen and dry up when i might be married to john shand  john and you will be maggie you have my word  maggie nevernevernever she tears up the document he remains seated immovable but the gleam returns to his eye she rages first at herself and then at him im a fool a fool to let you go i tell you youll rue this day for you need me youll come to grief without me theres nobody can help you as i could have helped you im essential to your career and youre blind not to see it  john whats that maggie in no circumstances would i allow any meddling with my career  maggie you would never have known i was meddling with it but thats over dont be in too great a hurry to marry john have your fling with the beautiful dolls first get the whiphand of the haughty ones john give them their licks every time they hiccough let them have an extra slap in memory of me and be sure to remember this my man that the one who marries you will find you out  john find me out  maggie however careful a man is his wife always finds out his failings  john i dont know maggie to what failings you refer  the cowcaddens club has burst its walls and is pouring this way to raise the new member on its crest the first wave hurls itself against the barbers shop with cries of shand shand shand for a moment john stems the torrent by planting his back against the door  you are acting under an impulse maggie and i cant take advantage of it think the matter over and well speak about it in the morning  maggie no i cant go through it again it ends tonight and now good luck john  she is immediately submerged in the sea that surges through the door bringing much wreckage with it in a moment the place is so full that another cupful could not find standing room some slippery ones are squeezed upwards and remain aloft as warnings john has jumped on to the stair and harangues the flood vainly like another canute it is something about freedom and noble minds and though unheard goes to all heads including the speakers by the time he is audible sentiment has him for her own  john but gentlemen one may have too much even of freedom no no yes mr adamson one may want to be tied never never i say yes willie cameron and i have found a young lady who i am proud to say is willing to be tied to me im to be married uproar her names miss wylie transport quiet shes here now frenzy she was here where are you maggie a small voiceim here a hundred great voiceswherewherewhere the small voiceim so little none of you can see me  three men name of wylie buffet their way forward  david james father have you grip of her  alick weve got her  david then hoist her up  the queer little elated figure is raised aloft with her fingers she can just touch the stars not unconscious of the nobility of his behaviour the hero of the evening points an impressive finger at her  john gentlemen the future mrs john shand cries of speech speech no no being a lady she cant make a speech but  the heroine of the evening surprises him  maggie i can make a speech and i will make a speech and its in two words and theyre these holding out her arms to enfold all the members of the cowcaddens clubmy constituents dementia     act iii  a few minutes ago the comtesse de la briere who has not recently been in england was shown into the london home of the shands though not sufficiently interested to express her surprise in words she raised her eyebrows on finding herself in a charming room she has presumed that the shand scheme of decoration would be as impossible as themselves  it is the little room behind the diningroom for which english architects have long been famous make something of this and you will indeed be a clever one they seem to say to you as they unveil it the comtesse finds that john has undoubtedly made something of it it is his study mon dieu the words these english use and there is nothing in it that offends there is so much not in it too that might so easily have been there it is not in the least ornate there are no colours quarrelling with each other unseen unheard by the blissful occupant of the revolving chair the comtesse has not even the gentle satisfaction of noting a suite in stained oak nature might have taken a share in the decorations so restful are they to the eyes it is the working room of a man of culture probably lately down from oxford at a first meeting there is nothing in it that pretends to be what it is not our visitor is a little disappointed but being fairminded blows her absent host a kiss for disappointing her  he has even she observes with a twinkle made something of the most difficult of his possessions the little wife for maggie who is here receiving her has been quite creditably toned down he has put her into a little grey frock that not only deals gently with her personal defects but is in harmony with the room evidently however she has not risen with him for she is as ever the comtesse who remembers having liked her the better of the two could shake her for being so stupid for instance why is she not asserting herself in that other apartment  the other apartment is really a correctly solemn diningroom of which we have a glimpse through partly open foldingdoors at this moment it is harbouring mr shands ladies committee who sit with pens and foolscap round the large table awaiting the advent of their leader there are nobly wise ones and some foolish ones among them for we are back in the strange days when it was considered unwomanly for women to have minds the comtesse peeps at them with curiosity as they arrange their papers or are ushered into the diningroom through a door which we cannot see to her frivolous ladyship they are a species of wild fowl and she is specially amused to find her niece among them she demands an explanation as soon as the communicating doors close  comtesse tell me since when has my dear sybil become one of these ladies it is not like her  maggie is obviously not clever enough to understand the woman question her eye rests longingly on a halffinished stocking as she innocently but densely replies   maggie i think it was about the time that my husband took up their cause  the comtesse has been hearing tales of lady sybil and the barbarian and after having the grace to hesitate she speaks with the directness for which she is famed in mayfair  comtesse mrs shand excuse me for saying that if half of what i hear be true your husband is seeing that lady a great deal too often maggie is expressionless she reaches for her stocking whereat her guest loses patience oh mon dieu put that down you can buy them at two francs the pair mrs shand why do not you compel yourself to take an intelligent interest in your husbands work  maggie i typewrite his speeches  comtesse but do you know what they are about  maggie they are about various subjects  comtesse oh  did maggie give her an unseen quizzical glance before demurely resuming the knitting one is not certain as john has come in and this obliterates her a scotsman on the make of whom david has spoken reverently is still to be readin a somewhat better bound volumein john shands person but it is as doggedly honest a face as ever and he champions women not for personal ends but because his blessed days of poverty gave him a light upon their needs his selfsatisfaction however has increased and he has pleasantly forgotten some things for instance he can now call out porter at railway stations without dropping his hands for the barrow maggie introduces the comtesse and he is still undaunted  john i remember you wellat glasgow  comtesse it must be quite two years ago mr shand  john has no objection to showing that he has had a classical education  john tempus fugit comtesse  comtesse i have not been much in this country since then and i return to find you a coming man  fortunately his learning is tempered with modesty  john oh i dont know i dont know  comtesse the ladies champion  his modesty is tempered with a respect for truth  john well well  comtesse and you are about as i understand to introduce a bill to give women an equal right with men to grow beards which is all she knows about it he takes the remark literally  john theres nothing about beards in it comtesse she gives him time to cogitate and is pleased to note that there is no result have you typed my speech maggie  maggie yes twentysix pages she produces it from a drawer  perhaps john wishes to impress the visitor  john im to give the ladies committee a general idea of it just see maggie if i know the peroration in conclusion mr speaker these are the reasonable demands of every intelligent englishwoman i had better say british womanand i am proud to nail them to my flag  the visitor is properly impressed  comtesse oho defies his leaders  john so long as i can do so without embarrassing the government  comtesse ah ah mr shand  john i call upon the front bench sir loyally but firmly  comtesse firm again  john either to accept my bill or to promise without delay to bring in one of their own and if they decline to do so i solemnly warn them that though i will not press the matter to a division just now  comtesse ahem  john i will bring it forward again in the near future and now comtesse you know that im not going to divideand not another soul knows it  comtesse i am indeed flattered by your confidence  john ive only told you because i dont care who knows now  comtesse oh  somehow maggie seems to be dissatisfied  maggie but why is that john  john i darent keep the government in doubt any longer about what i mean to do ill show the whips the speech privately tonight  maggie who still wants to know but not to go to a division is hedging isnt it is that strong  john to make the speech at all maggie is stronger than most would dare they would do for me if i went to a division  maggie bark but not bite  john now now maggie youre out of your depth  maggie i suppose thats it  the comtesse remains in the shallows  comtesse but what will the ladies say mr shand  john they wont like it comtesse but theyve got to lump it  here the maid appears with a card for maggie who considers it quietly  john any one of importance  maggie no  john then im ready maggie  this is evidently an intimation that she is to open the foldingdoors and he makes an effective entrance into the diningroom his thumb in his waistcoat there is a delicious clapping of hands from the committee and the door closes not till then does maggie who has grown thoughtful tell her maid to admit the visitor  comtesse another lady mrs shand  maggie the card says mr charles venables  the comtesse is really interested at last  comtesse charles venables do you know him  maggie i think i call to mind meeting one of that name at the foreign office party  comtesse one of that name he who is a minister of your cabinet but as you know him so little why should he call on you  maggie i wonder  maggies glance wanders to the drawer in which she has replaced johns speech  comtesse well well i shall take care of you petite  maggie do you know him  comtesse do i know him the last time i saw him he asked me toto hemma cherie it was thirty years ago  maggie thirty years  comtesse i was a pretty woman then i dare say i shall detest him now but if i find i do notlet us have a little ploti shall drop this book and then perhaps you will be so charming asas not to be here for a little while  mr venables who enters is such a courtly seigneur that he seems to bring the eighteenth century with him you feel that his sedan chair is at the door he stoops over maggies plebeian hand  venables i hope you will pardon my calling mrs shand we had such a pleasant talk the other evening  maggie of course is at once deceived by his gracious manner  maggie i think its kind of you do you know each other the comtesse de la briere  he repeats the name with some emotion and the comtesse half mischievously half sadly holds a hand before her face  venables comtesse  comtesse thirty years mr venables  he gallantly removes the hand that screens her face  venables it does not seem so much  she gives him a similar scrutiny  comtesse mon dieu it seems all that  they smile rather ruefully maggie like a kind hostess relieves the tension  maggie the comtesse has taken a cottage in surrey for the summer  venables i am overjoyed  comtesse no charles you are not you no longer care fickle one and it is only thirty years  he sinks into a chair beside her  venables those heavenly evenings comtesse on the bosphorus  comtesse i refuse to talk of them i hate you  but she drops the book and maggie fades from the room it is not a very clever departure and the old diplomatist smiles then he sighs a beautiful sigh for he does all things beautifully  venables it is moonlight comtesse on the golden horn  comtesse who are those two young things in a caique  venables is he the brave leander comtesse and is she hero of the lamp  comtesse no she is the foolish wife of the french ambassador and he is a goodfornothing british attache trying to get her husbands secrets out of her  venables is it possible they part at a certain garden gate  comtesse oh charles charles  venables but you promised to come back i waited there till dawn blanche if you had come back  comtesse how is mrs venables  venables she is rather poorly i think its gout  comtesse and you  venables i creak a little in the mornings  comtesse so do i there is such a good man at wiesbaden  venables the homburg fellow is better the way he patched me up last summeroh lord lord  comtesse yes charles the game is up we are two old fogies they groan in unison then she raps him sharply on the knuckles tell me sir what are you doing here  venables merely a friendly call  comtesse i do not believe it  venables the same woman the old delightful candour  comtesse the same man the old fibs she sees that the door is asking a question yes come mrs shand i have had quite enough of him i warn you he is here for some crafty purpose  maggie drawing back timidly surely not  venables really comtesse you make conversation difficult to show that my intentions are innocent mrs shand i propose that you choose the subject  maggie relieved there comtesse  venables i hope your husband is well  maggie yes thank you with a happy thought i decide that we talk about him  venables if you wish it  comtesse be careful he has chosen the subject  maggie i chose it didnt i  venables you know you did  maggie appealingly you admire john  venables very much but he puzzles me a little you scots mrs shand are such a mixture of the practical and the emotional that you escape out of an englishmans hand like a trout  maggie openeyed do we  venables well not you but your husband i have known few men make a worse beginning in the house he had the most atrocious bowwow publicpark manner  comtesse i remember that manner  maggie no he hadnt  venables soothingly at first but by his second session he had shed all that and he is now a pleasure to listen to by the way comtesse have you found any dark intention in that  comtesse you wanted to know whether he talks over these matter with his wife and she has told you that he does not  maggie indignantly i havent said a word about it have i  venables not a word then again i admire him for his impromptu speeches  maggie what is impromptu  venables unprepared they have contained some grave blunders not so much of judgment as of taste  maggie hotly i dont think so  venables pardon me but he has righted himself subsequently in the neatest way i have always found that the man whose second thoughts are good is worth watching well comtesse i see you have something to say  comtesse you are wondering whether she can tell you who gives him his second thoughts  maggie gives them to john i would like to see anybody try to give thoughts to john  venables quite so  comtesse is there anything more that has roused your admiration charles  venables purring let me see yes we are all much edified by his humour  comtesse surprised indeed his humour that man  maggie with hauteur why not  venables i assure you comtesse some of the neat things in his speeches convulse the house a word has even been coined for them shandisms  comtesse slowly recovering from a blow humour  venables in conversation i admit he strikes one as beingah somewhat lacking in humour  comtesse pouncing you are wondering who supplies his speeches with the humour  maggie supplies john  venables now that you mention it some of his shandisms do have a curiously feminine quality  comtesse you have thought it might be a woman  venables really comtesse  comtesse i see it all charles you thought it might be the wife  venables flinging up his hands i own up  maggie bewildered me  venables forgive me i see i was wrong  maggie alarmed have i been doing john any harm  venables on the contrary i am relieved to know that there are no hairpins in his speeches if he is at home mrs shand may i see him i am going to be rather charming to him  maggie drawn in two directions yes he isoh yesbut  venables that is to say comtesse if he proves himself the man i believe him to be  this arrests maggie almost as she has reached the diningroom door  maggie hesitating he is very busy just now  venables smiling i think he will see me  maggie is it something about his speech  venables the smile hardening well yes it is  maggie then i dare say i could tell you what you want to know without troubling him as ive been typing it  venables with a sigh i dont acquire information in that way  comtesse i trust not  maggie theres no secret about it he is to show it to the whips tonight  venables sharply you are sure of that  comtesse it is quite true charles i heard him say so and indeed he repeated what he called the peroration before me  maggie i know it by heart she plays a bold game these are the demands of all intelligent british women and i am proud to nail them to my flag  comtesse the very words mrs shand  maggie looking at her imploringly and i dont care how they may embarrass the government the comtesse is bereft of speech so suddenly has she been introduced to the real maggie shand if the right honourable gentleman will give us his pledge to introduce a similar bill this session i will willingly withdraw mine but otherwise i solemnly warn him that i will press the matter now to a division  she turns her face from the great man she has gone white  venables after a pause capital  the blood returns to maggies heart  comtesse who is beginning to enjoy herself very much then you are pleased to know that he means to as you say go to a division  venables delighted the courage of it will be the making of him  comtesse i see  venables had he been to hedge we should have known that he was a pasteboard knight and have disregarded him  comtesse i see  she desires to catch the eye of maggie but it is carefully turned from her  venables mrs shand let us have him in at once  comtesse yes yes indeed  maggies anxiety returns but she has to call john in  john impressed mr venables this is an honour  venables how are you shand  john sit down sit down becoming himself again i can guess what you have come about  venables ah you scotsmen  john of course i know im harassing the government a good deal  venables blandly not at all shand the government are very pleased  john you dont expect me to believe that  venables i called here to give you the proof of it you may know that we are to have a big meeting at leeds on the 24th when two ministers are to speak there is room for a third speaker and i am authorised to offer that place to you  john to me  venables yes  john swelling it would bethe government taking me up  venables dont make too much of it it would be an acknowledgment that they look upon you as one of their likely young men  maggie john  john not found wanting in a trying hour its a bribe you are offering me this on condition that i dont make my speech how can you think so meanly of me as to believe that i would play the womens cause false for the sake of my own advancement i refuse your bribe  venables liking him for the first time good but you are wrong there are no conditions and we want you to make your speech now do you accept  john still suspicious if you make me the same offer after you have read it i insist on your reading it first  venables sighing by all means  maggie is in an agony as she sees john hand the speech to his leader on the other hand the comtesse thrills  but i assure you we look on the speech as a small matter the important thing is your intention of going to a division and we agree to that also  john losing his head whats that  venables yes we agree  john butbutwhy you have been threatening to excommunicate me if i dared  venables all done to test you shand  john to test me  venables we know that a division on your bill can have no serious significance we shall see to that and so the test was to be whether you had the pluck to divide the house had you been intending to talk big in this speech and then hedge through fear of the government they would have had no further use for you  john heavily i understand but there is one thing he cannot understand which is why venables should be so sure that he is not to hedge  venables turning over the pages carelessly any of your good things in this shand  john whose one desire is to get the pages back no inoit isnt necessary you should read it now  venables from politeness only merely for my own pleasure i shall look through it this evening he rolls up the speech to put it in his pocket john turns despairingly to maggie though well aware that no help can come from her  maggie thats the only copy there is john to venables let me make a fresh one and send it to you in an hour or two  venables goodnaturedly i could not put you to that trouble mrs shand i will take good care of it  maggie if anything were to happen to you on the way home wouldnt whatever is in your pocket be considered to be the property of your heirs  venables laughing now there is forethought shand i think that after that he returns the speech to john whose hand swallows it greedily she is scotch too comtesse  comtesse delighted yes she is scotch too  venables though the only persons likely to do for me in the street shand are your ladies committee ever since they took the horse out of my brougham i can scent them a mile away  comtesse a mile charles peep in there  he softly turns the handle of the diningroom door and realises that his scent is not so good as he had thought it he bids his hostess and the comtesse goodbye in a burlesque whisper and tiptoes off to safer places john having gone out with him maggie can no longer avoid the comtesses reproachful eye that much injured lady advances upon her with accusing finger  comtesse so madam  maggie is prepared for her  maggie i dont know what you mean  comtesse yes you do i mean that there is some one who helps our mr shand  maggie theres not  comtesse and it is a woman and its you  maggie i help in the little things  comtesse the little things you are the pin he picked up and that is to make his fortune and now what i want to know is whether your john is aware that you help at all  john returns and at once provides the answer  john maggie comtesse ive done it again  maggie im so glad john  the comtesse is in an ecstasy  comtesse and all because you were not to hedge mr shand  his appeal to her with the wistfulness of a schoolboy makes him rather attractive  john you wont tell on me comtesse he thinks it out they had just guessed i would be firm because they know im a strong man you little saw maggie what a good turn you were doing me when you said you wanted to make another copy of the speech  she is dense  maggie how john  john because now i can alter the end  she is enlightened  maggie so you can  john heres another lucky thing maggie i hadnt told the ladies committee that i was to hedge and so they need never know comtesse i tell you theres a little cherub who sits up aloft and looks after the career of john shand  the comtesse looks not aloft but toward the chair at present occupied by maggie  comtesse where does she sit mr shand  he knows that women are not well read  john its just a figure of speech  he returns airily to his committee room and now again you may hear the click of maggies needles they no longer annoy the comtesse she is setting them to music  comtesse it is not down here she sits mrs shand knitting a stocking  maggie no it isnt  comtesse and when i came in i gave him credit for everything even for the prettiness of the room  maggie he has beautiful taste  comtesse goodbye scotchy   maggie goodbye comtesse and thank you for coming  comtesse goodbyemiss pin  maggie rings genteelly  maggie goodbye  the comtesse is now lost in admiration of her  comtesse you divine little wife he cant be worthy of it no man could be worthy of it why do you do it  maggie shivers a little  maggie he loves to think he does it all himself thats the way of men im six years older than he is im plain and i have no charm i shouldnt have let him marry me im trying to make up for it  the comtesse kisses her and goes away maggie somewhat foolishly resumes her knitting  some days later this same room is listeningwith the same inattentionto the outpouring of john shands love for the lady of the hiccoughs we arriveby arrangementrather late and thus we miss some of the most delightful of the pangs  one can see that these two are playing no game or if they are that they little know it the wonders of the world so strange are the instruments chosen by love have been revealed to john in hiccoughs he shakes in sybils presence never were more swimming eyes he who has been of a wooden face till now with ways to match has gone on flame like a piece of paper emotion is in flood in him we may be almost fond of john for being so worshipful of love much has come to him that we had almost despaired of his acquiring including nearly all the divine attributes except that sense of humour the beautiful sybil has always possessed but little of it also and what she had has been struck from her by cupids flail naked of the saving grace they face each other in awful rapture  john in a room sybil i go to you as a cold man to a fire you fill me like a peal of bells in an empty house  she is being brutally treated by the dear impediment for which hiccough is such an inadequate name that even to spell it is an abomination though a sign of ability how to describe a sound that is noiseless let us put it thus that when sybil wants to say something very much there are little obstacles in her way she falters falls perhaps once and then is over the while her appealing orbs beg you not to be angry with her we may express those sweet pauses in precious dots which some clever person can afterwards string together and make a pearl necklace of them  sybil i should not  let you say it  but  you  say it so beautifully  john you must have guessed  sybil i dreamed  i feared  but you were  scotch and i didnt know what to think  john do you know what first attracted me to you sybil it was your insolence i thought ill break her insolence for her  sybil and i thought ill break his strength  john and now your cooing voice plays round me the softness of you sybil in your pretty clothes makes me think of young birds the impediment is now insurmountable she has to swim for it she swims toward him it is you who inspire my work  he thrills to find that she can be touched without breaking  sybil i am so glad so proud  john and others know it sybil as well as i only yesterday the comtesse said to me no man could get on so fast unaided cherchez la femme mr shand  sybil auntie said that  john i said find her yourself comtesse  sybil and she  john she said i have found her and i said in my blunt way you mean lady sybil and she went away laughing  sybil laughing  john i seem to amuse the woman  sybil grows sad  sybil if mrs shandit is so cruel to her whom did you say she had gone to the station to meet  john her father and brothers  sybil it is so cruel to them we must think no more of this it is mad ness  john its fate sybil let us declare our love openly  sybil you cant ask that now in the first moment that you tell me of it  john the one thing i wont do even for you is to live a life of underhand  sybil the blow to her  john yes but at least she has always known that i never loved her  sybil it is asking me to give up everything every one for you  john its too much  john is humble at last  sybil to a woman who truly loves even that is not too much oh it is not i who matterit is you  john my dear my dear  sybil so gladly would i do it to save you but oh if it were to bring you down  john nothing can keep me down if i have you to help me  sybil i am dazed john i  john my love my love  sybil i oh here  john be brave sybil be brave  sybil   in this bewilderment of pearls she melts into his arms maggie happens to open the door just then but neither fond heart hears her  john i cant walk along the streets sybil without looking in all the shop windows for what i think would become you best as awkwardly as though his heart still beat against corduroy he takes from his pocket a pendant and its chain he is shy and she drops pearls over the beauty of the ruby which is its only stone it is a drop of my blood sybil  her lovely neck is outstretched and he puts the chain round it maggie withdraws as silently as she had come but perhaps the door whispered dn as it closed for sybil wakes out of paradise  sybil i thoughtdid the door shut  john it was shut already  perhaps it is only that sybil is bewildered to find herself once again in a world that has doors  sybil it seemed to me  john there was nothing but i think i hear voices they may have arrived  some pretty instinct makes sybil go farther from him maggie kindly gives her time for this by speaking before opening the door  maggie that will do perfectly david the maid knows where to put them she comes in theyve come john they would help with the luggage john goes out maggie is agreeably surprised to find a visitor how do you do lady sybil this is nice of you  sybil i was so sorry not to find you in mrs shand  the impediment has run away it is only for those who love it  maggie thank you youll sit down  sybil i think not your relatives  maggie they will be so proud to see that you are my friend  if maggie were less simple her guest would feel more comfortable she tries to make conversation  sybil it is their first visit to london  instead of relieving her anxiety on this point maggie has a long look at the gorgeous armful  maggie im glad you are so beautiful lady sybil  the beautiful one is somehow not flattered she pursues her investigations with growing uneasiness  sybil one of them is married now isnt he still there is no answer maggie continues looking at her and shivers slightly have they travelled from scotland today mrs shand why do you look at me so the door did open maggie nods what are you to do  maggie that would be telling sit down my pretty  as sybil subsides into what the wylies with one glance would call the best chair maggies menfolk are brought in by john all carrying silk hats and looking very active after their long rest in the train they are gazing about them they would like this lady they would like john they would even like maggie to go away for a little and leave them to examine the room is that linen on the walls for instance or just paper is the carpet as thick as it feels or is there brown paper beneath it had maggie got anything off that bookcase on account of the wormhole david even discovers that we were simpletons when we said there was nothing in the room that pretended to be what it was not he taps the marble mantelpiece and is favourably impressed by the tinny sound  david very fine imitation its a capital house maggie  maggie im so glad you like it do you know one another this is my father and my brothers lady sybil  the lovely form inclines towards them alick and david remain firm on their legs but james totters  james a ladyship well done maggie  alick sharply james i remember you my lady  maggie sit down father this is the study  james wanders round it inquisitively until called to order  sybil you must be tired after your long journey  david drawing the portraits of himself and partners in one lightning sketch tired your ladyship we sat on cushioned seats the whole way  james looking about him for the chair you sit on every seat in this room is cushioned  maggie you may say all my life is cushioned now james by this dear man of mine  she gives johns shoulder a loving pressure which sybil feels is a telegraphic communication to herself in a cypher that she cannot read alick and the brothers bask in the evidence of maggies happiness  john uncomfortably and is elizabeth hearty james  james looking down his nose in the manner proper to young husbands when addressed about their wives shes very well i thank you kindly  maggie james is a married man now lady sybil  sybil murmurs her congratulations  james i thank you kindly courageously yes im married he looks at david and alick to see if they are smiling and they are it wasnt a case of being catched it was entirely of my own free will he looks again and the mean fellows are smiling still is your ladyship married  sybil alas no  david james politely you will be yet my lady  sybil indicates that he is kind indeed  john perhaps they would like you to show them their rooms maggie  david fine would we like to see all the house as well as the sleeping accommodation but firsthe gives his father the look with which chairmen call on the next speaker  alick i take you david he produces a paper parcel from a roomy pocket it wasnt likely mr shand that we should forget the day  john the day  david the second anniversary of your marriage we came purposely for the day  james his fingers itching to take the parcel from his father its a lace shawl maggie from the three of us a pure tobermory you would never dare wear it if you knew the cost  the shawl in its beauty is revealed and maggie hails it with little cries of joy she rushes at the donors and kisses each of them just as if she were a pretty woman they are much pleased and give expression to their pleasure in a not very dissimilar manner  alick havers  david havers  james havers  john its a very fine shawl  he should not have spoken for he has set jamess volatile mind working  james you may say so what did you give her mr shand  john suddenly deserted by god and man me  alick yes yes lets see it  john ohi  he is not deserted by maggie but she can think of no way out  sybil prompted by the impediment which is in hiding quite close did he  forget  there is more than a touch of malice in the question it is a challenge and the wylies as a family are almost too quick to accept a challenge  maggie lifting the gage of battle john forget never its a pendant father  the impediment bolts john rises  alick a pendant one of those things on a chain  he grins remembering how once about sixty years ago he and a lady and a pendantbut we have no time for this  maggie yes  david who has felt the note of antagonism and is troubled you were slow in speaking of it mr shand  maggie this is her fight he was shy because he thought you might blame him for extravagance  david relieved oh thats it  james licking his lips lets see it  maggie a daughter of the devil where did you put it john  johns mouth opens but has nothing to contribute  sybil the impediment has stolen back again perhaps it has been  mislaid  the brothers echo the word incredulously  maggie not it i cant think where we laid it down john its not on that table is it james the wylies turn to look and maggies hand goes out to lady sybil john shand witness it is a very determined hand and presently a pendant is placed in it here it is alick and the brothers cluster round it weigh it and appraise it  alick preserve me is that stone real mr shand  john who has begun to look his grimmest yes  maggie who is now ready if he wishes it to take him on too john says its a drop of his blood  john wishing it and so it is  david well said mr shand  maggie scared and now if youll come with me i think john has something he wants to talk over with lady sybil recovering and taking him on or would you prefer john to say it before us all  sybil gasping no  john flinging back his head yes i prefer to say it before you all  maggie flinging back hers then sit down again  the wylies wonderingly obey  sybil mr shand mr shand  john maggie knows and it was only for her i was troubled do you think im afraid of them with mighty relief now we can be open  david lowering what is it whats wrong john shand  john facing him squarely it was to lady sybil i gave the pendant and all my love with it perhaps james utters a cry but the silence of alick and david is more terrible  sybil whose voice is smaller than we had thought what are you to do  it is to maggie she is speaking  david shell leave it for us to do  john thats what i want  the lords of creation look at the ladies  maggie interpreting you and i are expected to retire lady sybil while the men decide our fate sybil is ready to obey the law but maggie remains seated mans the oak womans the ivy which of us is it thats to cling to you john  with three stalwarts glaring at him john rather grandly takes sybils hand they are two against the world  sybil a heroine i hesitated but i am afraid no longer whatever he asks of me i will do  evidently the first thing he asks of her is to await him in the diningroom  it will mean surrendering everything for him i am glad it means all that she passes into the diningroom looking as pretty as a kiss  maggie so that settles it  alick im thinking that doesnt settle it  david no by god but his love for maggie steadies him there is even a note of entreaty in his voice have you nothing to say to her man  john i have things to say to her but not before you  david sternly go away maggie leave him to us  james who thinks it is about time that he said something yes leave him to us  maggie no david i want to hear what is to become of me i promise not to take any side  and sitting by the fire she resumes her knitting the four regard her as on an evening at the pans a good many years ago  david barking how long has this been going on  john if you mean how long has that lady been the apple of my eye im not sure but i never told her of it until today  maggie thoughtfully and without dropping a stitch i think it wasnt till about six months ago john that she began to be very dear to you at first you liked to bring in her name when talking to me so that i could tell you of any little things i might have heard she was doing but afterwards as she became more and more to you you avoided mentioning her name  john surprised did you notice that  maggie in her oldfashioned way yes  john i tried to be done with it for your sake ive often had a sore heart for you maggie  james youre proving it  maggie yes james he had ive often seen him looking at me very sorrowfully of late because of what was in his mind and many a kindly little thing he has done for me that he didnt use to do  john you noticed that too  maggie yes  david controlling himself well we wont go into that the thing to be thankful for is that its ended  alick who is looking very old yes yes thats the great thing  john all useless sir its not ended its to go on  david theres a devil in you john shand  john who is an unhappy man just now i dare say there is but do you think he had a walk over mr david  james man i could knock you down  maggie theres not one of you could knock john down  david exasperated quiet maggie one would think you were taking his part  maggie do you expect me to desert him at the very moment that he needs me most  david its him thats deserting you  john yes maggie thats what it is  alick wheres your marriage vow and your church attendances  james with terrible irony and your prize for moral philosophy  john recklessly all gone whistling down the wind  david i suppose you understand that youll have to resign your seat  john his underlip much in evidence there are hundreds of seats but theres only one john shand  maggie but we dont hear her thats how i like to hear him speak  david the ablest person in the room think man im old by you and for long ive had a pride in you it will be beginning the world again with more against you than there was eight years ago  john i have a better head to begin it with than i had eight years ago  alick hoping this will bite shell have her own money david  john shes as poor as a mouse  james thinking possibly of his elizabeths mother well go to her friends and tell them all theyll stop it  john shes of age  james theyll take her far away  john ill follow and tear her from them  alick your career  john to his credit to hell with my career do you think i dont know im on the rocks what can you or you or you understand of the passions of a man ive fought and ive given in when a ship founders as i suppose im foundering its not a thing to yelp at peace all of you he strides into the diningroom where we see him at times pacing the floor  david to james who gives signs of a desire to take off his coat let him be we cant budge him with bitter wisdom its true what he says true at any rate about me what do i know of the passions of a man im up against something i dont understand  alick its something wicked  david i dare say it is but its something big  james its that damned charm  maggie still by the fire thats it what was it that made you fancy elizabeth james  james sheepishly i can scarcely say  maggie it was her charm  david her charm  james pugnaciously yes her charm  maggie she had charm for james  this somehow breaks them up maggie goes from one to another with an odd little smile flickering on her face  david put on your things maggie and well leave his house  maggie patting his kind head not me david  this is a maggie they have known but forgotten all three brighten  david you havent given in  the smile flickers and expires  maggie i want you all to go upstairs and let me have my try now  james your try  alick maggie you put new life into me  james and into me  david says nothing the way he grips her shoulder says it for him  maggie ill save him david if i can  david does he deserve to be saved after the way he has treated you  maggie you stupid david what has that to do with it  when they have gone john comes to the door of the diningroom there is welling up in him a great pity for maggie but it has to subside a little when he sees that the knitting is still in her hand no man likes to be so soon supplanted sybil follows and the two of them gaze at the active needles  maggie perceiving that she has visitors come in john sit down lady sybil and make yourself comfortable im afraid weve put you about  she is after all only a few years older than they and scarcely looks her age yet it must have been in some such way as this that the little old woman who lived in a shoe addressed her numerous progeny  john im mortal sorry maggie  sybil who would be more courageous if she could hold his hand and i also  maggie soothingly im sure you are but as it cant be helped i see no reason why we three shouldnt talk the matter over in a practical way  sybil looks doubtful but john hangs on desperately to the word practical  john if you could understand maggie what an inspiration she is to me and my work  sybil indeed mrs shand i think of nothing else  maggie thats fine thats as it should be  sybil talking too much mrs shand i think you are very kind to take it so reasonably  maggie thats the scotch way when were you thinking of leaving me john  perhaps this is the scotch way also but sybil is english and from the manner in which she starts you would say that something has fallen on her toes  john who has heard nothing fall i think now that it has come to a breach the sooner the better his tone becomes that of james when asked after the health of his wife when it is convenient to you maggie  maggie making a rapid calculation it couldnt well be before wednesday thats the day the laundry comes home  sybil has to draw in her toes again  john and its the day the house rises stifling a groan it may be my last appearance in the house  sybil her arms yearning for him no no please dont say that  maggie surveying him sympathetically you love the house dont you john next to her its a pity you cant wait till after your speech at leeds mr venables wont let you speak at leeds i fear if you leave me  john what a chance it would have been but let it go  maggie the meeting is in less than a month could you not make it such a speech that they would be very loth to lose you  john swelling thats what was in my mind  sybil with noble confidence and he could have done it  maggie then weve come to something practical  john exercising his imagination with powerful effect no it wouldnt be fair to you if i was to stay on now  maggie do you think ill let myself be considered when your career is at stake a month will soon pass for me ill have a lot of packing to do  john its noble of you but i dont deserve it and i cant take it from you  maggie nows the time lady sybil for you to have one of your inspiring ideas  sybil ever ready yes yesbut what  it is odd that they should both turn to maggie at this moment  maggie who has already been saying it to herself what do you think of this i can stay on here with my father and brothers and you john can go away somewhere and devote yourself to your speech  sybil yes  john that might be considerately away from both of you where could i go  sybil ever ready where  maggie i know  she has called up a number on the telephone before they have time to check her  john on his dignity dont be in such a hurry maggie  maggie is this lambs hotel put me on to the comtesse de la briere please  sybil with a sinking what do you want with auntie  maggie her cottage in the country would be the very place she invited john and me  john yes but  maggie arguing and mr venables is to be there think of the impression you could make on him seeing him daily for three weeks  john theres something in that  maggie is it you comtesse im maggie shand  sybil you are not to tell her that  maggie no to the comtesse oh im very well never was better yes yes you see i cant because my folk have never been in london before and i must take them about and show them the sights but john could come to you alone why not  john with proper pride if shes not keen to have me i wont go  maggie shes very keen comtesse i could come for a day by and by to see how you are getting on yesyescertainly to john she says shell be delighted  john thoughtfully youre not doing this maggie thinking that my being absent from sybil for a few weeks can make any difference of course its natural you should want us to keep apart but  maggie grimly im founding no hope on keeping you apart john  john its what other wives would do  maggie i promised to be different  john his position as a strong man assured then tell her i accept he wanders back into the diningroom  sybil i thinkshe is not sure what she thinksi think you are very wonderful  maggie was that john calling to you  sybil was it she is glad to join him in the diningroom  maggie comtesse hold the line a minute she is alone and she has nearly reached the end of her selfcontrol she shakes emotionally and utters painful little cries there is something she wants to do and she is loth to do it but she does it are you there comtesse theres one other thing dear comtesse i want you to invite lady sybil also yes for the whole time that john is there no im not mad as a great favour to me yes i have a very particular reason but i wont tell you what it is oh call me scotchy as much as you like but consent do do do thank you thank you goodbye  she has control of herself now and is determined not to let it slip from her again when they reappear the stubborn one is writing a letter  john i thought i heard the telephone again  maggie looking up from her labours it was the comtesse she says shes to invite lady sybil to the cottage at the same time  sybil me  john to invite sybil then of course i wont go maggie  maggie wondering seemingly at these niceties what does it matter is anything to be considered except the speech it has been admitted that she was a little devil and with sybil on the spot john to help you and inspire you what a speech it will be  john carried away maggie you really are a very generous woman  sybil convinced at last she is indeed  john and youre queer too how many women in the circumstances would sit down to write a letter  maggie its a letter to you john  john to me  maggie ill give it to you when its finished but i ask you not to open it till your visit to the comtesse ends  john what is it about  maggie its practical  sybil rather faintly practical she has heard the word so frequently today that it is beginning to have a scotch sound she feels she ought to like maggie but that she would like her better if they were farther apart she indicates that the doctors are troubled about her heart and murmuring her adieux she goes john who is accompanying her pauses at the door  john with a queer sort of admiration for his wife maggie i wish i was fond of you  maggie heartily i wish you were john  he goes and she resumes her letter the stocking is lying at hand and she pushes it to the floor she is done for a time with knitting     act iv  mans most pleasant invention is the lawnmower all the birds know this and that is why when it is at rest there is always at least one of them sitting on the handle with his head cocked wondering how the delicious whirring sound is made when they find out they will change their note as it is you must sometimes have thought that you heard the mower very early in the morning and perhaps you peeped in neglige from your lattice window to see who was up so early it was really the birds trying to get the note  on this broiling morning however we are at noon and whoever looks will see that the whirring is done by mr venables he is in a linen suit with the coat discarded the bird is sitting on it and he comes and goes across the comtesses lawns pleasantly mopping his face we see him through a crooked bowed window generously open roses intruding into it as if to prevent its ever being closed at night there are other roses in such armfuls on the tables that one could not easily say where the room ends and the garden begins  in the comtesses pretty comic drawingroom for she likes the comic touch when she is in england sits john shand with his hostess on chairs at a great distance from each other no linen garments for john nor flannels nor even knickerbockers he envies the english way of dressing for trees and lawns but is too scotch to be able to imitate it he wears tweeds just as he would do in his native country where they would be in kilts like many another scot the first time he ever saw a kilt was on a sassenach indeed kilts were perhaps invented like golf to draw the english north john is doing nothing which again is not a scotch accomplishment and he looks rather miserable and dour the comtesse is already at her patience cards and occasionally she smiles on him as if not displeased with his long silence at last she speaks  comtesse i feel it rather a shame to detain you here on such a lovely day mr shand entertaining an old woman  john i dont pretend to think im entertaining you comtesse  comtesse but you are you know  john i would be pleased to be told how  she shrugs her impertinent shoulders and presently there is another heavy sigh from john  comtesse again why do not you go out on the river  john yes i can do that he rises  comtesse and take sybil with you he sits again no  john i have been on the river with her twenty times  comtesse then take her for a long walk through the fairloe woods  john we were there twice last week  comtesse there is a romantically damp little arbour at the end of what the villagers call the lovers lane  john one cant go there every day i see nothing to laugh at  comtesse did i laugh i must have been translating the situation into french  perhaps the music of the lawnmower is not to johns mood for he betakes himself to another room mr venables pauses in his labours to greet a lady who has appeared on the lawn and who is maggie she is as neat as if she were one of the army of typists who are quite the nicest kind of women and carries a little bag she comes in through the window and puts her hands over the comtesses eyes  comtesse they are a strong pair of hands at any rate  maggie and not very white and biggish for my size now guess  the comtesse guesses and takes both the hands in hers as if she valued them she pulls off maggies hat as if to prevent her flying away  comtesse dear abominable one not to let me know you were coming  maggie it is just a surprise visit comtesse i walked up from the station for a moment maggie seems to have borrowed sybils impediment how iseverybody  comtesse he is quite well but my child he seems to me to be a most unhappy man  this sad news does not seem to make a most unhappy woman of the child the comtesse is puzzled as she knows nothing of the situation save what she has discovered for herself  why should that please you o heartless one  maggie i wont tell you  comtesse i could take you and shake you maggie here have i put my house at your disposal for so many days for some sly scotch purpose and you will not tell me what it is  maggie no  comtesse very well then but i have what you call a nasty one for you the comtesse lures mr venables into the room by holding up what might be a foaming glass of lemon squash alas charles it is but a flower vase i want you to tell mrs shand what you think of her husbands speech  mr venables gives his hostess a reproachful look  venables ehahshand will prefer to do that himself i promised the gardeneri must not disappoint himexcuse me  comtesse you must tell her charles  maggie please mr venables i should like to know  he sits down with a sigh and obeys  venables your husband has been writing the speech here and by his own wish he read it to me three days ago the occasion is to be an important one and well there are a dozen young men in the party at present all capable of filling a certain small ministerial post he looks longingly at the mower but it sends no message to his aid and as he is one of them i was anxious that he should show in this speech of what he is capable  maggie and hasnt he  not for the first time mr venables wishes that he was not in politics  venables i am afraid he has  comtesse what is wrong with the speech charles  venables nothingand he can still deliver it it is a powerful wellthoughtout piece of work such as only a very able man could produce but it has no special quality of its ownnone of the little touches that used to make an old stager like myself want to pat shand on the shoulder the comtesses mouth twitches but maggie declines to notice it he pounds on manfully enough but if i may say so with a wooden leg it is as good i dare say as the rest of them could have done but they start with such inherited advantages mrs shand that he had to do better  maggie yes i can understand that  venables i am sorry mrs shand for he interested me his career has set me wondering whether if i had begun as a railway porter i might not still be calling out by your leave  maggie thinks it probable but not important  maggie mr venables now that i think of it surely john wrote to me that you were dissatisfied with his first speech and that he was writing another  the comtesses eyes open very wide indeed  venables i have heard nothing of that mrs shand he shakes his wise head and in any case i am afraidhe still hears the wooden leg  maggie but you said yourself that his second thoughts were sometimes such an improvement on the first  the comtesse comes to the help of the baggage  comtesse i remember you saying that charles  venables yes that has struck me politely well if he has anything to show mein the meantime  he regains the lawn like one glad to escape attendance at johns obsequies the comtesse is brought back to speech by the sound of the mowernothing wooden in it  comtesse what are you up to now miss pin you know as well as i do that there is no such speech  maggies mouth tightens  maggie i do not  comtesse it is a duel is it my friend  the comtesse rings the bell and maggies guilty mind is agitated  maggie what are you ringing for  comtesse as the challenged one miss pin i have the choice of weapons i am going to send for your husband to ask him if he has written such a speech after which i suppose you will ask me to leave you while you and he write it together  maggie wrings her hands  maggie you are wrong comtesse but please dont do that  comtesse you but make me more curious and my doctor says that i must be told everything the comtesse assumes the pose of her sex in melodrama put your cards on the table maggie shand orshe indicates that she always pinks her man maggie dolefully produces a roll of paper from her bag what precisely is that  the reply is little more than a squeak  maggie johns speech  comtesse you have written it yourself  maggie is naturally indignant  maggie its typed  comtesse you guessed that the speech he wrote unaided would not satisfy and you prepared this to take its place  maggie not at all comtesse it is the draft of his speech that he left at home thats all  comtesse with a few trivial alterations by yourself i swear can you deny it  no wonder that maggie is outraged she replaces johns speech in the bag with becoming hauteur  maggie comtesse these insinuations are unworthy of you may i ask where is my husband  the comtesse drops her a curtsey  comtesse i believe your haughtiness may find him in the dutch garden oh i see through you you are not to show him your speech but you are to get him to write another one and somehow all your additions will be in it think not creature that you can deceive one so old in iniquity as the comtesse de la briere  there can be but one reply from a good wife to such a charge and at once the comtesse is left alone with her shame anon a footman appears you know how they come and go  footman you rang my lady  comtesse did i ah yes but why he is but lately from the ploughshare and cannot help her in this quandary her eyes alight upon the bag she is unfortunately too abandoned to feel her shame she still thinks that she has the choice of weapons she takes the speech from the bag and bestows it on her servitor take this to mr venables please and say it is from mr shand thomasbut in the end we shall probably call him johndeparts with the dangerous papers and when maggie returns she finds that the comtesse is once more engaged in her interrupted game of patience you did not find him  all the bravery has dropped from maggies face  maggie i didnt see him but i heard him she is with him i think they are coming here  the comtesse is suddenly kind again  comtesse sybil shall i get rid of her  maggie no i want her to be here too now i shall know  the comtesse twists the little thing round  comtesse know what  maggie as soon as i look into his face i shall know  a delicious scent ushers in the fair sybil who is as sweet as a milking stool she greets mrs shand with some alarm  maggie how do you do lady sybil how pretty you look in that frock sybil rustles uncomfortably you are a feast to the eye  sybil please i wish you would not  shall we describe sybils frock in which she looks like a great strawberry that knows it ought to be plucked or would it be easier to watch the coming of john let us watch john  john you maggie you never wrote that you were coming  no let us watch maggie as soon as she looked into his face she was to know something of importance  maggie not dissatisfied with what she sees no john its a surprise visit i just ran down to say goodbye  at this his face falls which does not seem to pain her  sybil foreseeing another horrible scotch scene to say goodbye  comtesse thrilling with expectation to whom maggie  sybil deserted by the impediment which is probably playing with rough boys in the lovers lane auntie do leave us wont you  comtesse not i it is becoming far too interesting  maggie i suppose theres no reason the comtesse shouldnt be told as she will know so soon at any rate  john thats so sybil sees with discomfort that he is to be practical also  maggie its so simple you see comtesse john and lady sybil have fallen in love with one another and they are to go off as soon as the meeting at leeds has taken place  the comtesses breast is too suddenly introduced to caledonia and its varied charms  comtesse mon dieu  maggie i think thats putting it correctly john  john in a sense but im not to attend the meeting at leeds my speech doesnt find favour with a strange humility theres something wrong with it  comtesse i never expected to hear you say that mr shand  john wondering also i never expected it myself i meant to make it the speech of my career but somehow my hand seems to have lost its cunning  comtesse and you dont know how  john its inexplicable my brain was never clearer  comtesse you might have helped him sybil  sybil quite sulkily i did  comtesse but i thought she was such an inspiration to you mr shand  john going bravely to sybils side she slaved at it with me  comtesse strange wickedly becoming practical also so now there is nothing to detain you shall i send for a fly sybil  sybil with a cry of the heart auntie do leave us  comtesse i can understand your impatience to be gone mr shand  john heavily i promised maggie to wait till the 24th and im a man of my word  maggie but i give you back your word john you can go now  john looks at sybil and sybil looks at john and the impediment arrives in time to take a peep at both of them  sybil groping for the practical to which we must all come in the end he must make satisfactory arrangements about you first i insist on that  maggie with no more imagination than a hen thank you lady sybil but i have made all my arrangements  john stung maggie that was my part  maggie you see my brothers feel they cant be away from their business any longer and so if it would be convenient to you john i could travel north with them by the night train on wednesday  sybil iithe way you put things  john this is just the 21st  maggie my things are all packed i think youll find the house in good order lady sybil i have had the vacuum cleaners in ill give you the keys of the linen and the silver plate i have them in that bag the carpet on the upper landing is a good deal frayed but  sybil please i dont want to hear any more  maggie the ceiling of the diningroom would be the better of a new lick of paint  sybil stamping her foot small fours cant you stop her  john soothingly shes meaning well maggie i know its natural to you to value those things because your outlook on life is bounded by them but all this jars on me  maggie does it  john why should you be so ready to go  maggie i promised not to stand in your way  john stoutly you neednt be in such a hurry there are three days to run yet the french are so different from us that we shall probably never be able to understand why the comtesse laughed aloud here its just a joke to the comtesse  comtesse it seems to be no joke to you mr shand sybil my pet are you to let him off  sybil flashing let him off if he wishes it do you  john manfully i want it to go on something seems to have caught in his throat perhaps it is the impediment trying a temporary home its the one wish of my heart if you come with me sybil ill do all in a mans power to make you never regret it  triumph of the vere de veres  maggie bringing them back to earth with a dump and i can make my arrangements for wednesday  sybil seeking the comtesses protection no you cant auntie i am not going on with this im very sorry for you john but i see nowi couldnt face it  she cant face anything at this moment except the sofa pillows  comtesse noticing johns big sigh of relief so that is all right mr shand  maggie dont you love her any more john be practical  sybil to the pillows at any rate i have tired of him oh best to tell the horrid truth i am ashamed of myself i have been crying my eyes out over iti thought i was such a different kind of woman but i am weary of him i think himoh so dull  john his face lighting up are you sure that is how you have come to think of me  sybil im sorry with all her soul but yesyesyes  john by god its more than i deserve  comtesse congratulations to you both  sybil runs away and in the fulness of time she married successfully in cloth of silver which was afterwards turned into a bedspread  maggie you havent read my letter yet john have you  john no  comtesse imploringly may i know to what darling letter you refer  maggie its a letter i wrote to him before he left london i gave it to him closed not to be opened until his time here was ended  john as his hand strays to his pocket am i to read it now  maggie not before her please go away comtesse  comtesse every word you say makes me more determined to remain  maggie it will hurt you john distressed dont read it tear it up  john you make me very curious maggie and yet i dont see what can be in it  comtesse but you feel a little nervous give me the dagger  maggie quickly no but the comtesse has already got it  comtesse may i she must have thought they said yes for she opens the letter she shares its contents with them dearest john it is at my request that the comtesse is having lady sybil at the cottage at the same time as yourself  john what  comtesse yes she begged me to invite you together  john but why  maggie i promised you not to behave as other wives would do  john its not understandable  comtesse you may ask why i do this john and my reason is i think that after a few weeks of lady sybil every day and all day you will become sick to death of her i am also giving her the chance to help you and inspire you with your work so that you may both learn what her help and her inspiration amount to of course if your love is the great strong passion you think it then those weeks will make you love her more than ever and i can only say goodbye but if as i suspect you dont even now know what true love is then by the next time we meet dear john you will have had enough of heryour affectionate wife maggie oh why was not sybil present at the reading of the will and now if you two will kindly excuse me i think i must go and get that poor sufferer the eau de cologne  john its almost enough to make a man lose faith in himself  comtesse oh dont say that mr shand  maggie defending him you mustnt hurt him if you havent loved deep and true thats just because you have never met a woman yet john capable of inspiring it  comtesse putting her hand on maggies shoulder have you not mr shand  john i see what you mean but maggie wouldnt think better of me for any false pretences she knows my feelings for her now are neither more nor less than what they have always been  maggie who sees that he is looking at her as solemnly as a volume of sermons printed by request i think no one could be fond of me that cant laugh a little at me  john how could that help  comtesse exasperated mr shand i give you up  maggie i admire his honesty  comtesse oh i give you up also arcades ambo scotchies both  john when she has gone but this letter its not like you by gosh maggie youre no fool  she beams at this as any wife would  but how could i have made such a mistake its not like a strong man evidently he has an inspiration  maggie what is it  john the inspiration am i a strong man  maggie you of course you are and selfmade has anybody ever helped you in the smallest way  john thinking it out again no nobody  maggie not even lady sybil  john im beginning to doubt it its very curious though maggie that this speech should be disappointing  maggie its just that mr venables hasnt the brains to see how good it is  john that must be it but he is too good a man to rest satisfied with this no maggie its not somehow i seem to have lost my neat way of saying things  maggie almost cooing it will come back to you  john forlorn if you knew how ive tried  maggie cautiously maybe if you were to try again and ill just come and sit beside you and knit i think the click of the needles sometimes put you in the mood  john hardly that and yet many a shandism have i knocked off while you were sitting beside me knitting i suppose it was the quietness  maggie very likely  john with another inspiration maggie  maggie again what is it john  john what if it was you that put those queer ideas into my head  maggie me  john without your knowing it i mean  maggie but how  john we used to talk bits over and it may be that you dropped the seed so to speak  maggie john could it be this that i sometimes had the idea in a rough womanish sort of way and then you polished it up till it came out a shandism  john slowly slapping his knee i believe youve hit it maggie to think that you may have been helping me all the timeand neither of us knew it  he has so nearly reached a smile that no one can say what might have happened within the next moment if the comtesse had not reappeared  comtesse mr venables wishes to see you mr shand  john lost stolen or strayed a smile in the making hum  comtesse he is coming now  john grumpy indeed  comtesse sweetly it is about your speech  john he has said all he need say on that subject and more  comtesse quaking a little i think it is about the second speech  john what second speech  maggie runs to her bag and opens it  maggie horrified comtesse you have given it to him  comtesse impudently wasnt i meant to  john what is it what second speech  maggie cruel cruel willing to go on her knees you had left the first draft of your speech at home john and i brought it here with with a few little things ive added myself  john a sevenfooter whats that  maggie four foot ten at most just triflesthings i was to suggest to youwhile i was knittingand then if you liked any of them you could have polished themand turned them into something good john johnand now she has shown it to mr venables  john thundering as my work comtesse  but the comtesse is not of the women who are afraid of thunder  maggie it is your workninetenths of it  john in the black cap you presumed maggie shand very well then here he comes and now well see to what extent youve helped me  venables my dear fellow my dear shand i congratulate you give me your hand  john the speech  venables you have improved it out of knowledge it is the same speech but those new touches make all the difference john sits down heavily mrs shand be proud of him  maggie i am i am john  comtesse you always said that his second thoughts were best charles  venables pleased to be reminded of it didnt i didnt i those delicious little touches how good that is shand about the flowing tide  comtesse the flowing tide  venables in the first speech it was something like thisgentlemen the opposition are calling to you to vote for them and the flowing tide but i solemnly warn you to beware lest the flowing tide does not engulf you the second way is much better  comtesse what is the second way mr shand  john does not tell her  venables this is how he puts it now john cannot help raising his head to listen gentlemen the opposition are calling to you to vote for them and the flowing tide but i ask you cheerfully to vote for us and dam the flowing tide  venables and his old friend the comtesse laugh heartily but for different reasons  comtesse it is better mr shand  maggie i dont think so  venables yes yes its so virile excuse me comtesse im off to read the whole thing again for the first time he notices that john is strangely quiet i think this has rather bowled you over shand  johns head sinks lower  well well good news doesnt kill  maggie counsel for the defence surely the important thing about the speech is its strength and knowledge and eloquence the things that were in the first speech as well as in the second  venables that of course is largely true the wit would not be enough without them just as they were not enough without the wit it is the combination that is irresistible johns head rises a little shand you are our man remember that it is emphatically the best thing you have ever done how this will go down at leeds  he returns gaily to his hammock but lower sinks johns head and even the comtesse has the grace to take herself off maggies arms flutter near her husband not daring to alight  maggie you heard what he said john its the combination is it so terrible to you to find that my love for you had made me able to help you in the little things  john the little things it seems strange to me to hear you call me by my name maggie its as if i looked on you for the first time  maggie look at me john for the first time what do you see  john i see a woman who has brought her husband low  maggie only that  john i see the tragedy of a man who has found himself out eh i cant live with you again maggie  he shivers  maggie why did you shiver john  john it was at myself for saying that i couldnt live with you again when i should have been wondering how for so long you have lived with me and i suppose you have forgiven me all the time she nods and forgive me still she nods again dear god  maggie john am i to go or are you to keep me on she is now a little bundle near his feet im willing to stay because im useful to you if it cant be for a better reason his hand feels for her and the bundle wriggles nearer its nothing unusual ive done john every man who is high up loves to think that he has done it all himself and the wife smiles and lets it go at that its our only joke every woman knows that he stares at her in hopeless perplexity oh john if only you could laugh at me  john i cant laugh maggie  but as he continues to stare at her a strange disorder appears in his face maggie feels that it is to be now or never  maggie laugh john laugh watch me see how easy it is  a terrible struggle is taking place within him he creaks something that may be mirth forces a passage at first painfully no more joy in it than in the discoloured water from a spring that has long been dry soon however he laughs loud and long the spring water is becoming clear maggie claps her hands he is saved
