the liberty girls  chapter i the massmeeting  one might reasonably think that all dorfield had turned out to attend the much advertised meeting the masses completely filled the big public square the flaring torches placed at set intervals lighted fitfully the faces of the peoplefaces sober earnest thoughtfulall turned in the direction of the speakers platform  mr peter conant the chairman a prominent attorney of dorfield was introducing the orator of the evening colonel james hathaway whose slender erect form and handsome features crowned with snowwhite hair arrested the attention of all  you have been told began the old colonel in a clear ringing voice of our nations imperative needs money must be provided to conduct the great war on which we have embarkedmoney for our new army money for shipbuilding money for our allies and the people of america are permitted to show their loyalty and patriotism by subscribing for bondsbonds of the rich and powerful united statesthat all may participate in our noble struggle for the salvation of democracy and the peace of the world these bonds which you are asked to buy bear interest you will be investing in the corporation of right justice and freedom with the security of the nation as your shield as a stockholder in this noblest of corporations you risk nothing but you gain the distinction of personally assisting to defeat civilizations defiant and ruthless enemy  loud applause interrupted the speaker on one of the rows of seats at the back of the stand sat mary louise burrows the granddaughter of colonel hathaway with several of her girl friends and her heart leaped with pride to witness the ovation accorded her dear granpa jim  with well chosen words the old gentleman continued his discourse stating succinctly the necessity of the liberty bond issue and impressing upon his hearers the righteousness of the cause for which this money was required  the allotment of dorfield he added is one million dollars seemingly a huge sum for our little city to raise and invest but really insignificant when apportioned among those who can afford to subscribe there is not a man among you who cannot without hardship purchase at least one fiftydollar bond many of you can invest thousands yet we are approaching our time limit and so far less than two hundred thousand dollars worth of these magnificent liberty bonds have been purchased in our community but five days remain to us to subscribe the remaining eight hundred thousand dollars and thereby preserve the honor of our fair city that eight hundred thousand dollars will be subscribed we must subscribe it else will the finger of scorn justly be pointed at us forever after  another round of applause mr conant and mr jaswell the banker and other prominent members of the liberty loan committee began to look encouraged and to take heart  of course theyll subscribe it whispered mary louise to her friend alora jones the thing has looked like a failure lately but i knew if granpa jim talked to the slackers theyd see their plain duty granpa jim knows how to stir them to action  gradually the applause subsided the faces of the multitude that thronged about the stand seemed to mary louise stern and resolved determined to prove their loyalty and devotion to their country  and now mr jaswell advanced and seated himself at a table while mr conant requested those present to come forward and enter their subscriptions for the bonds he urged them to subscribe generously in proportion to their means and asked them not to crowd but to pass in line across the platform as swiftly as possible  let us raise that entire eight hundred thousand tonight shouted the colonel in clarion tones then the band struck up a popular war tune and the banker dipped a pen in ink and held it ready for the onslaught of signers  but no one came forward each man looked curiously at his neighbor but stood fast in his place the city even to its furthermost suburbs had already been systematically canvassed by the committee and their efforts had resulted in a bare two hundred thousand dollars of this sum colonel hathaway had himself subscribed twentyfive thousand noting the hesitation of his townsmen the old gentleman again arose and faced them the band had stopped playing and there was an ominous silence  let me encourage you said colonel hathaway by taking another twentyfive thousand dollars worth of these wonderful bonds put me down for that amount mr jaswell now then who are the patriots eager to follow my lead  there was applausesomewhat more mild in characterbut none came forward aloras father jason jones who had already signed for fifty thousand dollars rose and added another twentyfive thousand to that sum this act elicited another ripple of applause more questioning looks were exchanged between those assembled but there were no further offers to subscribe  the hearts of the committeemen fell was this meeting on which they had so greatly depended destined to prove a failure after all  jake kasker the owner of kaskers clothing emporium finally made his way to the platform and mounting the steps faced his townspeople there was a little murmur of surprise and a sudden tension the man had been distrusted in dorfield of late  you all know what i think about this war said kasker in a loud voice and with a slight german accent i dont approve of it whatever anyone says and i think we were wrong to get into it anyhow  a storm of hisses and cries of shame saluted him but he waited stolidly for the demonstration to subside then he continued  but whatever i think about the war i want to tell you that this flag that now waves over my head is as much my flag as it is yours for im an american citizen where that flag goes jake kasker will follow no matter what fools carry the standard if they dont think im too old to go to france ill pack up and go tomorrow thats jake kaskerwith a dutch name but a yankee heart some of you down there got yankee names an hearts that make the kaiser laugh i wouldnt trade with you now hear this i aint rich you know that but ill take two thousand dollars worth of liberty bonds  some one laughed jeeringly another shouted  make it three thousand jake  i will said kasker and if there aint enough of you warcrazy yellowhearted patriots in dorfield to take what we got to take then ill make it five thousand but if i have to do thatan i cant afford it but ill do itits me jake kasker thatll cry shame and hiss like a goose whenever you slackers pass my door  there was more laughter a few angry shouts and a movement toward the platform the german signed the paper mr jaswell placed before him and withdrew soon there was a line extending from the bankers table to the crowd below and the signatures for bonds were slowly but steadily secured  colonel hathaway faced the german clothier who stood a few paces back a cynical grin upon his features  thank you kasker said the old gentleman in a cold voice you have really helped us although you should have omitted those traitorous words they poisoned a deed you might have been proud of  we dont agree colonel replied kasker with a shrug when i talk im honest i say what i think he turned and walked away and colonel hathaway looked after him with an expression of dislike  i wonder why he did it whispered mary louise who had overheard the exchange of words and marked kaskers dogged opposition  he bought the bonds as a matter of business replied laura hilton its a safe investment and kasker knows it besides that he may have an idea it would disarm suspicion  also added alora jones he took advantage of the opportunity to slam the war that was worth something to a man like kasker   chapter ii mary louise takes command  when mary louise entered the library the next morning she found her grandfather seated at the table his head resting on his extended arms in an attitude of great depression the young girl was startled  what is it granpa jim she asked going to his side and laying a hand lovingly on his shoulder  the old gentleman looked up with a face drawn and gray  im nervous and restless my dear he said thats all go to breakfast mary louise iill join you presently  she sat down on the arm of his chair  havent you slept well granpa she asked anxiously and then her eyes wandered through the open door to the next room and rested on the undisturbed bed why you havent slept at all dear she cried in distress what is wrong are you ill  no no mary louise dont worry ii shall be all right presently buti was terribly disappointed in last nights meeting and  i see they didnt subscribe what they ought to but you cant help that granpa jim you did all that was possible and you mustnt take it so much to heart  it is so important child more important i fear than many of them guess this will be a desperate war and without the money to fight  oh the moneyll come granpa im sure of that if dorfield doesnt do its duty the rest of the country will so you mustnt feel badly about our failure in fact we havent failed as yet how much did they subscribe last night  in all a hundred and thirty thousand we have now secured barely a third of our allotment and only five days more to get the balance  mary louise reflected eyeing him seriously  granpa said she youve worn yourself out with work and worry they ought not to have put you on this liberty bond committee youre too old and youre not well or strong enough to endure all the anxiety and hard work  for the honor of  yes i know dear our country needs you so you mustnt break down now come and drink a cup of coffee and ill talk to you ive a secret to tell you  he smiled rather wanly and hopelessly but he permitted the girl to assist him to rise and to lead him to the breakfast room there mary louise poured his coffee and attacked her own breakfast although with indifferent appetite  granpa jim was the only relative she had in all the world and she loved him devotedly their life in the pretty little town had been peaceful and happy until recentlyuntil the war but the old colonel loyal veteran that he was promptly made it his war and was roused as mary louise had never seen him roused before in his mind was no question of the justice of our countrys participation in the world struggle he was proud to be an american and gloried in americas sacrifice to the cause of humanity too old to fight on the battlefield he felt honored at his appointment to the membership of the liberty bond committee and threw all his energies into the task assigned him so it is easy to understand that the coldness and reluctance to subscribe for bonds on the part of his fellow townsmen had well nigh broken his heart  this the girl his closest companion fully appreciated  granpa she said regarding him across the table after their old black mammy aunt sally had left them together i love my country as you know but i love you better  oh mary louise  its true and its right that i should if i had to choose between letting the germans capture the united states or losing you id let the germans come thats honest and its the way i feel love for ones country is a fine sentiment but my love for you is deeper i wouldnt whisper this to anyone else for no one else could understand it but you will understand it granpa jim and you know my love for you doesnt prevent my still being as good an american as the average however continued the young girl in a lighter tone ive no desire to lose you or allow the germans to whip us if i can help it so ive got two battles to fight the truth is granpa that youre used up with the hard work of the last few weeks and another five days of begging for subscriptions would wreck you entirely so youre to stop shortthis very minuteand rest up and take it easy and not worry  butmy dear  see here granpa jim with assumed sternness youve worked hard to secure dorfields quota and youve failed why the biggest subscribers for bonds in the whole city are you and jason jones theres plenty of wealth in dorfield and over at the mills and factories are thousands of workmen who can buy bonds but you and your committee dont know how to interest the people in your proposition the people are loyal enough but they dont understand and you dont understand how to make them understand  no he said shaking his head dolefully theyre a dense lot and we cant make them understand  well i can said mary louise cheerfully  you child  yes you mustnt imagine ive tackled the problem this very morning ive been considering it for some time and ive talked and consulted with alora and irene and laura and the other girls about the best way to redeem the situation we knew the situation was desperate long before last nights meeting so all our plans are made and we believe we can sell all the bonds required it was our policy to keep silent until we knew what the big massmeeting last night would accomplish but we suspected it would turn out just the way it dida fizzle so the jobs up to us and if youll sit quiet granpa jim and let us girls do the work well put dorfield in the honor column by saturday night  this is nonsense exclaimed the colonel but there was an accent of hope in his voice nevertheless  we girls are thoroughly organized said mary louise and well sell the bonds  girls  why just think of it granpa who would refuse a group of young girlsearnest and enthusiastic girls the trouble with you men is that you accept all sorts of excuses they tell you theyre hard up and cant spare the money theres a mortgage to pay or taxes or notes to meet and they cant afford it anyway but that kind of talk wont do when we girls get after them  what arguments can you use that we have disregarded  first well coax then well appeal to their patriotism then well threaten them with scorn and opprobrium which theyll richly deserve if they hang on till it comes to that if the threats dont make em buy well cryand every tear will sell a bond  the colonel stirred his coffee thoughtfully  you might try it he suggested ive read that in some cities the boy scouts have been successful in placing the bonds its an honorable undertaking in any event buti hope you will meet with no insults  if that rank progerman jake kasker will buy bonds there isnt a man in dorfield who can give a logical excuse for not doing likewise declared mary louise im going to use kasker to shame the rest of them but before i undertake this job i shall make a condition granpa you must stay quietly at home while we girls do the work  oh i could not do that mary louise  youre not fit to leave the house will you try my plan for one dayjust for today  ill think it over dear he said rising  she assisted him to the library and then ran down the street to the doctors office  dr mcgruer she said go over at once and see my grandfather hes completely exhausted with the work of selling liberty bonds be sure you order him to keep at home and remain quietat least for today   chapter iii the liberty girls  an hour later six girls met at the home of alora jones who lived with her father in a fine mansion across the street from colonel hathaways residence these girls were prepared to work and work diligently under the leadership of mary louise for they had been planning and discussing this event for several days patiently awaiting the word to start their campaign  some girls said mary louise are knitting and thats a good thing to do in a way others are making pajamas and pillows for the red cross and thats also an admirable thing to do but our duty lies on a higher plane for were going to get money to enable uncle sam to take care of our soldier boys  dodo you think we can make people buy bonds asked little laura hilton with a trace of doubt in her voice  mary louise gave her a severe look  we not only can but we shall make people buy she replied we shall ask them very prettily and they cannot refuse us weve all been loaded to the brim with arguments if arguments are necessary but we havent time to gossip with folks a whole lot of money must be raised and theres a short time to do it in  seems to me remarked edna barlow earnestly were wasting time just now lets get busy  well get on your costumes girls suggested alora jones they are all here in this big box and the banners are standing in the hall its after nine now and by ten oclock we must all be at work  they proceeded to dress themselves in the striking costumes they had secretly prepared a blue silk waist with white stars scattered over it a redandwhite striped skirt the stripes running from waistband to hem a godess of liberty cap and white canvas shoes attired in this fashion the liberty girls as they had dubbed themselves presented a most attractive and patriotic appearance and as they filed out through the hall each seized a handsome silken banner gold fringed which bore the words buy bonds of dorfields liberty girls  now then said mary louise we have each been allotted a certain district in the business part of the city for which we are individually responsible each one knows what she is expected to do let no one escape if any man claims to have already bought bonds make him buy more and remember were all to meet at my house at one oclock for luncheon and to report progress  a block away they secured seats in a streetcar and a few minutes thereafter reached the four corners the intersection of the two principal streets of dorfield but on the way they had sold old jonathan dodd who happened to be in the car and was overawed by the display of redwhiteandblue two hundred dollars worth of bonds as for old man dodd he realized he was trapped and bought his limit with a sigh of resignation  as they separated at the four corners each to follow her appointed route many surprised if not startled citizens regarded the liberty girls with approving eyes they were pretty girls all of them and their silken costumes were really becoming the patriots gazed admiringly the more selfish citizens gave a little shiver of dismay and scurried off to escape meeting these aggressive ones whose gorgeous banners frankly proclaimed their errand  mary louise entered the bank on the corner and made inquiry for mr jaswell the president  were off at last sir she said smiling at his bewildered looks and we girls are determined to make the dorfield people do their full duty may we depend upon your bank to fulfill your promises and carry those bond buyers who wish to make time payments  to be sure my dear replied the banker id no idea you young ladies were to wear uniforms but you certainly look fascinating if youre a fair sample of the others and i dont see how anyone can refuse to back up our girls in their patriotic drive god bless you mary louise and help you to achieve your noble object  there were many offices in the building above the bank and the girl visited every one of them her appearance garbed in the national colors and bearing her banner was a sign of conquest for it seemed to these busy men as if uncle sam himself was backing this crusade and all their latent patriotism was stirred to the depths so they surrendered at discretion and signed for the bonds  mary louise was modest and sweet in demeanor her pleas were as pleasant as they were persuasive there was nothing virulent or dominant in her attitude but when she said really mr soandso you ought to take more bonds than that you can afford it and our country needs the money the argument was generally effective and when she had smilingly pinned the bond button on a mans coat and passed on to interview others she left him wondering why he had bought more bonds than he ever had intended to or even provoked with himself that he had subscribed at all these were the people who had generally resisted all former pleadings of the regular committee and had resolved to ignore the bond sale altogether but perhaps their chagrin was equalled by their satisfaction in having been won over by a pretty girl whose manner and appearance were alike irresistible  the men of dorfield are a fair sample of men everywhere at this period the full meaning of the responsibilities we had assumed in this tremendous struggle was by no means fully realized the war was too far away and life at home was still running in its accustomed grooves they could not take the european war to themselves nor realize that it might sweep away their prosperity their libertieseven their homes fear had not yet been aroused pity for our suffering and hardpressed allies was still lightly considered the war had not struck home to the hearts of the people as it has since i doubt if even mary louise fully realized the vital importance of the work she had undertaken  when the liberty girls met at colonel hathaways for a light luncheon their eyes were sparkling with enthusiasm and their cheeks rosy from successful effort their individual sales varied of course for some were more tactful and winning than others but all had substantial results to report weve taken dorfield by storm was their exultant cry  altogether said mary louise figuring up the amounts weve sold thirtytwo thousand dollars worth of bonds this morning thats encouraging for three hours work but its not enough to satisfy us we must put in a busy afternoon and try to get a total of at least one hundred thousand by tonight tomorrow we must do better than that work as late as you can girls and at eight oclock we will meet again at aloras house and compare results  the girls needed no urging to resume their work for already they had gained confidence in their ability and were inspired to renewed effort  mary louise had optimistic plans for that afternoons work she first visited the big flour mill where she secured an interview with mr chisholme the president and general manager  we cant buy bonds he said peevishly our business is being ruined by the high price of wheat and the absurd activities of hoover we stand to operate at a loss or else shut down altogether the government ought to pay us compensation instead of asking us to contribute to the war  however if we fail to win the war mary louise quietly replied your enormous investment here will become worthless isnt it better to lose a little now for the sake of future winnings than to sacrifice the past and future and be reduced to poverty we are asking you to save yourself from threatened dangerthe national calamity that would follow our defeat in this war  he sat back in his chair and looked at the girl in amazement she was rather young to have conceived such ideas  well theres time enough to consider all that he said less gruffly youll have to excuse me now miss burrows im busy  but mary louise kept her seat and redoubled her arguments which were logical and straight to the point mr chisholmes attitude might have embarrassed her had she been pleading a personal favor but she felt she was the mouthpiece of the president of the nation of worldwide democracy and would not allow herself to feel annoyed she devoted threequarters of an hour to mr chisholme who gradually thawed in her genial sunshine she finally sold him fifty thousand dollars worth of liberty bonds and went on her way elated the regular bond committee had labored for weeks with this stubborn man who managed one of the largest enterprises in dorfield yet they had signally failed to convince him or to induce him to subscribe a dollar the girl had succeeded in less than an hour and sold him exactly the amount he should have bought  the mill subscription was a powerful leverage with which to pry money from other reluctant ones stacks sellem  stacks the big department store heretofore resisting all appeals bought from mary louise bonds to the amount of twentyfive thousand the denis hardware company took ten thousand then mary louise met her first serious rebuff she went into silas herrings wholesale grocery establishment and told mr herring she wanted to sell him bonds  this is outrageous cried herring indignantly when the men cant rob us or force us to back england in her selfish schemes they set girls on us to wheedle us out of money we have honestly earned this holdup game wont work i assure you and i advise you to get into more respectable business my money is mine it doesnt belong to the allies and they wont get a cent of it he was getting more angry as he proceeded in his harangue moreover he continued our weak administration cant use me to help it out of the hole it has foolishly stumbled into or make america the catspaw to pull british chestnuts out of the fire you ought to be ashamed miss burrows to lend yourself to such unpatriotic methods of bulldozing honest citizens  mary louise was distressed but undaunted the man was monstrously wrong and she knew it sitting in mr herrings private office at the time were professor john dyer the superintendent of dorfields schools and the hon andrew duncan a leading politician a former representative and now one of the county supervisors the girl looked at professor dyer whom she knew slightly and said pleadingly  wont you defend our administration and our country mr dyer  he smiled deprecatingly but did not speak he was a tall lean man quite roundshouldered and of studious appearance he wore double eyeglasses underneath which his eyes were somewhat watery the smile upon his thin features was a stationary one not as if assumed but molded with the features and lacking geniality  it was the hon andrew duncan who answered the liberty girl  the difference between mr herring and eighty percent of the american people said he in stilted pompous tones is that our friend herring unwisely voices his protest while the others merely thinkand consider it the part of wisdom to say nothing  i dont believe that cried mary louise indignantly the american people are loyal to their president there may be a few traitors were gradually discovering them but  i am busy herring interrupted her scowling and he swung his chair so that his back was toward her  you wont be busy long if you keep talking that way predicted the girl  tuttut said the hon andrew warningly your threats young lady are as unwise as mr herrings speech  but they carry more weight she asserted stoutly do you think any grocery man in dorfield would buy goods of mr herring if he knew him to be disloyal in this our countrys greatest crisis and theyre going to know it if i have to visit each one and tell him myself what mr herring has said  a tense if momentary silence followed broken by the professor who now said in his smooth unctuous way  mr herrings blunt expression of his sentiments was not intended for other ears than ours i am sure in confidence one may say many things to friends which he would prefer to withhold from an indiscriminating public we are well assured indeed that mr herring is a loyal american with americas best interests at heart but he does not regard our present national activities as leniently as we do i have been endeavoring in my humble way to change his attitude of mind here herring swung around and looked at the speaker stolidly and though i admit he is a bit obstinate i venture to assure you miss burrows that silas herring will stand by the stars and stripes as long as there is a shred of our banner to wave in the breeze of freedom justice and democracy  a cynical smile gradually settled on the grocers stern face the hon andrew was smiling with undisguised cheerfulness  we are all loyalthoroughly loyal said the latter ive bought some liberty bonds already my girl but you can put me down for a hundred dollars more we must support our country in every possible way with effort with money with our flesh and blood i have no children but my two nephews and a second cousin are now in france  for my part added professor dyer i have hesitated as to how much of my meagre salary i can afford to spend but i think i can handle five hundred dollars worth  thank you said mary louise somewhat puzzled by these offers it isnt like risking the money its a solid investment in the best securities in the world  i know returned the professor nodding gravely but im not thinking of that im a poor man as you probably know but what i have is at my countrys disposal since it is evident that my country needs it  doesnt that shame you sir asked mary louise brightly as she turned to silas herring youre a business man and they sayalthough i confess i doubt itthat youre a loyal american you can convince me of the fact by purchasing a liberal share of bonds then i can forget your dreadful words then i can carry to everyone the news that youve made a splendid investment in liberty bonds even if you honestly think the administration has been at fault it wont do any good to grumble we are in this war sir and weve got to win it that you and every other american may enjoy prosperity and freedom how much shall i say that you have subscribed mr herring  he studied her face his expression never changing mary louise wondered if he could read her suspicion and dislike of him despite her efforts to smother those feelings in the cause of liberty then herring looked at professor dyer who stood meekly with downcast eyes next the grocer gazed at the supervisor who smiled in a shrewd way and gave a brief nod  mr herring frowned he drummed nervously with his fingers on his mahogany desk then he reached for his checkbook and with grim deliberation wrote a check and handed it to mary louise  youve won young lady he admitted im too good an american to approve what has been done down at washington but ill help keep our flag waving as the professor suggests when weve won our warand of course we shall winthere will be a day of reckoning for every official who is judged by our citizens to have been disloyal however high his station good afternoon  the first impulse of mary louise was to crumple up the check and throw it in the mans face to show her resentment of his base insinuations but as she glanced at the check she saw it was for ten thousand dollars and that meant sinews of warhelp for our soldiers and our allies she couldnt thank the man but she bowed coldly and left the private office professor dyer accompanied her and at the outer door he said to the girl  silas herrings heart is in the right place as you see by his generous check of course he might have bought more bonds than that as he is very wealthy but he is an obstinate man and it is a triumph for our sacred cause that he was induced to buy at all you are doing a noble work my child and i admire you for having undertaken the task if i can be of service to you pray command me  urge everyone you meet to buy bonds suggested mary louise she did not care to discuss silas herring  ill do that indeed promised the school superintendent but as he watched her depart there was a queer expression on his lean face that it was well mary louise did not see   chapter iv the traitor  when the liberty girls met that evening at the home of alora jones it was found that mary louise had sold more bonds than any of the others although laura hilton had secured one subscription of fifty thousand dollars from the dorfield national steel works the manager of which industry mr colton was a relative of the girl altogether the days work had netted them two hundred and fourteen thousand dollars and as soon as she could escape mary louise rushed home to report their success to her grandfather  in one day granpa jim she cried exultantly and the old colonels eyes sparkled as he replied  that makes our great massmeeting look pretty small doesnt it my dear i consider it wonderful with four more such days our quota would be oversubscribed  thats what we shall try for she declared and then told him who the biggest bond buyers had beenmostly those who had refused to listen to the regular committee or had not been influenced by their carefully prepared arguments  its just because we are girls and they are ashamed to refuse us she acknowledged it seems like taking an unfair advantage of them i know but those who need urging and shaming to induce them to respond loyally to the nations needs deserve no consideration were not robbing them either she added but just inducing them to make a safe investment isnt that true granpa jim  what surprises me most he responded is how you ever managed to load your little head with so much mature wisdom id no idea mary louise you were so interested in the war and our national propaganda for waging it successfully  why i read the newspapers you know and ive listened to you spout patriotism and ever since we joined the allies against germany my girl chums and i have been secretly organized as a band of liberty girls determined to do our bit in winning the war this is the first chance though that weve ever had to show what we can do and we are very proud and happy tonight to realize that were backing uncle sam to some purpose  this war remarked the old soldier thoughtfully is bringing the women of all nations into marked prominence for it is undeniable that their fervid patriotism outranks that of the men but you are mere girls and i marvel at your sagacity and devotion heretofore unsuspected if you can follow todays success until saturday and secure our quota of subscriptions to the bonds not only dorfield but all the nation will be proud of your achievement  we shall do our best replied the girl simply although her cheeks glowed pink under such praise there are enough slackers still to be interviewed to bring the quota up to the required amount and with todays success to hearten us i am sure we shall end the week triumphantly  next morning the liberty girls sallied forth early all six aglow with enthusiasm mary louise consulted her carefully prepared list and found that her first calf was to be at mcgills drug store she found mr mcgill looking over his mornings mail but moments were precious so she at once stated her errand  the old druggist glanced up at the girl under his spectacles noted her patriotic attire and the eager look on her pretty face and slowly shook his head  im sorry miss burrows but i cant afford it he said evasively  oh mr mcgill im sure you are mistaken she replied you can afford insurance you know to protect your stock and this money for uncle sam is an insurance that your home and business will be protected from the ravages of a ruthless foe  he stared at her thoughtfully a moment then he selected a paper from his mail and handed it to her  read that he said briefly  mary louise read it it was a circular printed in small openfaced capital type on plain white paper and unsigned it said  the treasury department is asking us to invest billions in what are termed liberty bonds it has the liberty to lend these billions to irresponsible or bankrupt nations of europe who are fighting an unprofitable war some of our dollars will equip an army of amer ican boys to fight on europes battle fields this may be good business our excited politicians down at washington may think they are acting for our best good but what becomes of the money finally will our millionaire government contractors become billionaires when the moneyour moneyis spent do you think the days of graft are past and gone have politicians become honest now that they are handling untold sums let us consider these questions when we are asked to subscribe for liberty bonds  why this is treason cried mary louise gasping from sheer amazement and indignation its aatreacherous vile disloyal insinuation some german spy wrote that and he ought to be hanged for it  the druggist nodded he picked up the envelope that had contained the circular and scrutinized it closely  really it looks like foreign handwriting doesnt it he agreed handing her the envelope it is postmarked dorfield and was posted last evening the whole town is buzzing about the wonderful work of the liberty girls yesterday perhaps your success is responsible for this thisopposition  mary louises cheeks were burning her eyes flashed  may i keep thisthing she asked with a shudder of disgust as she thrust the circular into its envelope  certainly if you wish  and will you let an enemy attack like that influence you mr mcgill  he smiled rather grimly  yes ill invest five hundred in the bonds i had already decided to put in a hundred dollars but for a moment this veiled accusation bewildered me youre right its treasonable it will be hard for me to raise five hundred just now but ill do it i want that to be my answer to the german  mary louise thanked him and hurried away next door was laceys shoe store and mr lacey was reading a duplicate of that identical circular when the liberty girl approached him  the man bowed low to mary louise a deference she felt rendered to her redwhiteandblue uniform  good morning he said pleasantly recognizing the girl as one of his good customers glad to see you mary louise for if i give you a good fat check it may take a nasty taste out of my mouth acquired by reading a bit of german propaganda  i know mr lacey she replied earnestly ive seen that circular before do you mind my having itand the envelope  i wouldnt touch the filth if i were you he protested  im going to run the traitor down she said no man has the right to live in dorfieldor in americawho could be guilty of such disloyalty  he gave her the circular and his check for liberty bonds and she passed on to the next store during the morning mary louise discovered several more of the traitorous circulars some merchants would not admit having received the warning others through their arguments convinced the girl they had not only read the screed but had been influenced by it perhaps it did not seriously affect her sales of bonds but she felt that it did and her indignation grew steadily by noon she was tingling with resentment and when she joined the other liberty girls at luncheon she found them all excited over the circular and demanding vengeance on the offenderwhoever he might happen to be  isnt it dreadful exclaimed lucile neal and what could the person hope to gain by it  why he wanted to kill the liberty bond sale explained alora jones  a suspicion that this money is to be misapplied or that officials will steal part of it is likely to prevent a lot of foolish people from investing in the bonds all this morning i could see that men were influenced by this circular which has been pretty generally distributed  yes one or two repeated the very words of the circular to me said laura hilton but i just asked them if they considered the united states able to pay its bonds and they were forced to admit it was a safe investment however the money might be used  id like to know who sent that circular exclaimed edna barlow  im going to find out asserted mary louise  how my dear  there must be ways of tracing such a bunch of circulars as were mailed last evening im going to see the chief of police and put him on the trail  do you know said edna a thoughtful and rather quiet girl i already have a suspicion who the traitor is  who an eager chorus  im not sure i ought to speak his name for its only a suspicion and i may be wrong it would be an awful thing to accuse one unjustly of such a dastardly act wouldnt it butthink girlswho is known to be against the war and progerman who did we consider an enemy to the cause of liberty untiluntil he happened to buy some bonds the other night and indulge in some peanut patriotism to disarm a criticism he knew was becoming dangerous  they looked at one another half frightened at the suggestion for all knew whom she meant  perhaps said alora slowly jake kasker really believes in the bonds he certainly set the example to others and led them to buy a lot of bonds it doesnt seem reasonable after that to credit him with trying to prevent their sale  those progermans remarked little jane donovan are clever and sly they work in the dark kasker said he hated the war but loved the flag  im afraid of those people who think devotion to our flag can cover disloyalty to our president said mary louise earnestly  but the flag represents the president and kasker said hed stand by the flag to the last  all buncombe my dear said edna decidedly that flag talk didnt take the curse off the statement that the war is all wrong  he had to say something patriotic or hed have been mobbed was luciles serious comment i hadnt thought of jake kasker before but he may be the culprit  isnt he the only german in town who has denounced our going into the european war demanded edna  no said mary louise granpa has told me of several others but none has spoken so frankly as kasker anyhow theres no harm in suspecting him for if he is really innocent he can blame his own disloyal speeches for the suspicion but now let us check up the mornings work and get busy again as soon as possible we mustnt lose a single minute  and as we go around suggested alora let us keep our eyes and ears open for traces of the traitor there may be more than one progerman in the conspiracy for the circular was printed by somebody and there are several kinds of handwriting on the addressed envelopes we have gathered weve no time to do detective work just now but we can watch out just the same  mary louise did not mention the circular to colonel hathaway that evening for he was still ill and she did not wish to annoy him  the next day she found another circular had been put in the mails printed from the same queer openfaced type as the first not so many had been sent out of these but they were even more malicious in their suggestions the girls were able to collect several of them for evidence and were more angry and resentful than ever but they did not allow such outrageous antagonism to discourage them in their work  of course the liberty girls were not the only ones in dorfield trying to sell bonds mr jaswell and other bankers promoted the bond sale vigorously and the regular committee did not flag in its endeavors to secure subscriptions on account of colonel hathaways illness professor dyer was selected to fill his place on the committee and proved himself exceedingly industrious the only trouble with the professor was his reluctance to argue he seemed to work early and late visiting the wealthier and more prosperous citizens but he accepted too easily their refusals to buy on several occasions the liberty girls succeeded in making important sales where professor dyer had signally failed he seemed astonished at this and told mary louise with a deprecating shrug that he feared his talents did not lie in the direction of salesmanship  despite the natural proportion of failuresfor not all will buy bonds in any communityon the fourth day following the massmeeting dorfields quota of one million was fully subscribed and on saturday another hundred and fifty thousand was added creating jubilation among the loyal citizens and reflecting great credit on the liberty girls the committee and all who had labored so well for the cause  really said professor dyer his voice sounding regretful when he congratulated the girls our success is due principally to your patriotic organization the figures show that you secured subscriptions for over half a million dear me what a remarkable fact  more than that added jason jones aloras father who was a wealthy artist and himself a member of the committee our girls encouraged the faltering ones to do their duty many a man who coldly turned our committee down smiled at the pretty faces and dainty costumes of our liberty girls and wrote their checks without a murmur  all the credit is due mary louise declared alora it was she who proposed the idea and who organized us and trained us and designed our liberty costumes also mary louise made the most sales  nonsense cried mary louise blushing red i couldnt have done anything at all without the help of you girls no one of us is entitled to more credit than the others but all six of us may well feel proud of our success weve done our bit to help uncle sam win the war   chapter v unconvincing testimony  on sunday granpa jim relieved of all worry felt quite himself again as he expressed it and the old gentleman strutted somewhat proudly as he marched to church with his lovely granddaughter beside him although her uniform was today discarded for a neat tailorsuit mary louise had always been a favorite in dorfield but the past week had made her a heroine in the eyes of all patriotic citizens many were the looks of admiration and approval cast at the young girl this morning as she passed along the streets beside the old colonel  in the afternoon as they sat in the cosy study at home the girl for the first time showed her grandfather the disloyal circulars relating how indignant the liberty girls had been at encountering such dastardly opposition  colonel hathaway studied the circulars carefully he compared the handwritings on the different envelopes and when mary louise said positively that man must be discovered and arrested her grandfather nodded his head and replied  he is a dangerous man not especially on account of these mischievous utterances which are too foolish to be considered seriously but because such a person is sure to attempt other venomous deeds which might prove more important german propaganda must be dealt with sternly and all opposition to the administration thoroughly crushed it will never do to allow a man like this to go unrebuked and unpunished  what then would you suggest asked the girl  the police should be notified chief farnum is a clever officer and intensely patriotic from all i have heard i think he will have no difficulty in discovering who is responsible for these circulars  i shall go to him tomorrow decided mary louise i had the same idea granpa jim its a matter for the police to handle  but when she had obtained an interview with chief of police farnum the next morning and had silently laid one of the circulars on his desk before him an announcement of her errand farnum merely glanced at it smiled and then flashed a shrewd look into the girls face  well said the chief in an interrogative tone  those treasonable circulars have been mailed to a lot of our citizens said she  i know  they are progerman of course the traitor who is responsible for them ought to be arrested immediately  to be sure replied farnum calmly  well then do it she exclaimed annoyed by his bland smile  id like to miss burrows he rejoined the smile changing to a sudden frown and only two things prevent my obeying your request one is that the writer is unknown to me  i suppose you could find him sir thats what the police are for criminals dont usually come here and give themselves up i imagine or even send you their address but the city isnt so big that any man however clever could escape your dragnet  thank you for the compliment said the chief again smiling i believe we could locate the fellow were such a task not obviated by the second objection  and that  if youll read this circularthere are two others by the way mailed at different timesyou will discover that our objectionable friend has skillfully evaded breaking our present laws he doesnt assert anything treasonable at all he merely questions or suggests  he is disloyal however insisted mary louise  in reality yes legally no we allow a certain amount of free speech in this country altogether too much under present conditions the writer of this circular makes certain statements that are true and would be harmless in themselves were they not followed by a series of questions which insinuate that our trusted officials are manipulating our funds for selfish purposes a simple denial of these insinuations draws the fangs from every question we know very well the intent was to rouse suspicion and resentment against the government but if we had the author of these circulars in court we could not prove that he had infringed any of the existing statutes  and you will allow such a traitor as that to escape cried mary louise amazed and shocked  for a moment he did not reply but regarded the girl thoughtfully then he said  the police of a city miss burrows is a local organization with limited powers i dont mind telling you however that there are now in dorfield certain government agents who are tracing this circular and will not be so particular as we must be to abide by established law in making arrests their authority is more elastic in other words moreover these circulars were mailed and the postoffice department has special detectives to attend to those who use the mails for disloyal purposes  are any of these agents or detectives working on this case asked the girl more hopefully  let us suppose so he answered they do not confide their activities to the police although if they call upon us we must assist them i personally saw that copies of these circulars were placed in the hands of a government agent but have heard nothing more of the affair  and you fear they will let the matter drop she questioned trying to catch the drift of his cautiously expressed words  he did not answer that question at all instead he quietly arranged some papers on his desk and after a pause that grew embarrassing again turned to mary louise  whoever issued these circulars he remarked is doubtless clever he is also bitterly opposed to the administration and we may logically suppose he will not stop in his attempts to block the governments conduct of the war at every opportunity he will seek to poison the minds of our people and sooner or later he will do something that is decidedly actionable then we will arrest him and put an end to his career  you think that sir  im pretty sure of it from long experience with criminals  i suppose the kaiser is paying him said the girl bitterly  weve no grounds for that belief  he is helping the kaiser he is progerman  he is helping the kaiser but is not necessarily progerman we know he is against the government but on the other hand he may detest the germans that his propaganda directly aids our enemies there is no doubt yet his enmity may have been aroused by personal prejudice or intense opposition to the administration or to other similar cause such a person is an outandout traitor when his sentiments lead to actions which obstruct his countrys interests the traitors are not all progerman let us say they are antiamerican  mary louise was sorely disappointed  i think i know who this traitor is in spite of what you say she remarked and i think you ought to watch him mr farnum and try to prevent his doing more harm  the chief studied her face he seemed to have a theory that one may glean as much from facial expression as from words  one ought to be absolutely certain said he before accusing anyone of disloyalty a false accusation is unwarranted it is a crime in fact you have no idea miss burrows how many people come to us to slyly accuse a neighbor whom they hate of disloyalty in not a single instance have they furnished proof and we do not encourage mere telltales i dont want you to tell me whom you suspect but when you can lay before me a positive accusation backed by facts that can be proven ill take up the case and see that the lawbreaker is vigorously prosecuted  the girl went away greatly annoyed by the chiefs reluctance to act in the matter but when she had related the interview to granpa the old colonel said  i like farnums attitude which i believe to be as just as it is conservative suspicion based on personal dislike should not be tolerated why mary louise anyone might accuse you or me of disloyalty and cause us untold misery and humiliation in defending ourselves and proving our innocenceand even then the stigma on our good name would be difficult to remove entirely thousands of people have lost their lives in the countries of europe through false accusations but america is an enlightened nation and let us hope no personal animosities will influence us or no passionate adherence to our countrys cause deprive us of our sense of justice  our sense of justice asserted mary louise should lead us to unmask traitors and i know very well that somewhere in dorfield lurks an enemy to my country  we will admit that my dear but your country is watching out for those enemies within who are more to be feared than those without and if i were you mary louise id allow the proper officials to unmask the traitor as they are sure to do in time this war has placed other opportunities in your path to prove your usefulness to your country as you have already demonstrated is it not so  mary louise sighed  you are always right granpa jim she said kissing him fondly drat that traitor though how i hate a snake in the grass   chapter vi to help win the war  the activities of the liberty girls of dorfield did not cease with their successful liberty bond drive indeed this success and the approbation of their fellow townspeople spurred the young girls on to further patriotic endeavor in which they felt sure of enthusiastic encouragement  as long as uncle sam needs his soldiers said peter conant the lawyer hell need his liberty girls for they can help win the war  when mary louise first conceived the idea of banding her closest companions to support the government in all possible ways she was a bit doubtful if their efforts would prove of substantial value although she realized that all her friends were earnestly determined to do their bit whatever the bit might chance to be the local red cross chapter had already usurped many fields of feminine usefulness and with a thorough organization which included many of the older women was accomplishing a vast deal of good of course the liberty girls could not hope to rival the red cross  mary louise was only seventeen and the ages of the other liberty girls ranged from fourteen to eighteen so they had been somewhat ignored by those who were older and more competent through experience to undertake important measures of war relief the sensational bond sale however had made the youngsters heroinesfor the moment at least and greatly stimulated their confidence in themselves and their ambition to accomplish more  mary louise burrows was an orphan her only relative indeed was colonel james hathaway her mothers father whose love for his granddaughter was thoroughly returned by the young girl they were good comrades these two and held many interests in common despite the discrepancy in their ages the old colonel was welltodo and although he could scarcely be called wealthy in these days of huge fortunes his resources were ample beyond their needs the hathaway home was one of the most attractive in dorfield and mary louise and her grandfather were popular and highly respected their servants consisted of an aged pair of negroes named aunt sally and uncle eben who considered themselves family possessions and were devoted to de ole marse an young missy  alora jones who lived in the handsomest and most imposing house in the little city was an heiress and considered the richest girl in dorfield having been left several millions by her mother her father jason jones although he handled aloras fortune and surrounded his motherless daughter with every luxury was by profession an artista kindly man who encouraged the girl to be generous and charitable to a degree they did not advertise their good deeds and only the poor knew how much they owed to the practical sympathy of alora jones and her father alora however was rather reserved and inclined to make few friends her worst fault being a suspicion of all strangers due to some unfortunate experiences she had formerly encountered the little band of liberty girls included all of aloras accepted chums for they were the chums of mary louise whom alora adored their companionship had done much to soften the girls distrustful nature  the other liberty girls were laura hilton petite and pretty and bubbling with energy whose father was a prominent real estate broker lucile neal whose father and three brothers owned and operated the neal automobile factory and whose intelligent zeal and knowledge of war conditions had been of great service to mary louise edna barlow a widowed dressmakers only child whose sweet disposition had made her a favorite with her girl friends and jane donovan the daughter of the mayor of dorfield and the youngest of the group here described  these were the six girls who had entered the bond campaign and assisted to complete dorfields quota of subscriptions but there was one other liberty girl who had been unable to join them in this active work this was irene macfarlane the niece of peter conant she had been a cripple since childhood and was confined to the limits of a wheeled chair far from being gloomy or depressed however irene had the sunniest nature imaginable and was always more bright and cheerful than the average girl of her age from my knees down she would say confidentially im no good but from my knees up im as good as anybody she was an excellent musician and sang very sweetly she was especially deft with her needle she managed her chair so admirably that little assistance was ever required mrs conant called her the light of the house and to hear her merry laughter and sparkling conversation you would speedily be tempted to forget that fate had been unkind to her and decreed that for life she must be wedded to a wheeled chair  if irene resented this decree she never allowed anyone to suspect it and her glad disposition warded off the words of sympathy that might have pained her  while unable to sally forth in the liberty bond drive irene was none the less an important member of the band of liberty girls shes our inspiration said mary louise with simple conviction teeming with patriotism and never doubting her ability to do something helpful in defeating her countrys foes irene had many valuable suggestions to make to her companions and one of these she broached a few days after the bond sale ended so triumphantly on this occasion the liberty girls had met with irene at peter conants cosy home next door to the residence of colonel hathaway for consultation as to their future endeavors  everyone is knitting for the soldiers and sailors said irene and while that is a noble work i believe that we ought to do something different from the others such an important organization ought to render unusual and individual service on behalf of our beloved country is it not so  its all very well irene to back our beloved country remarked laura but the whole nation is doing that and i really hanker to help our soldier boys  so do i spoke up lucile the government is equal to the countrys needs im sure but the government has never taken any too good care of its soldiers and theyll lack a lot of things besides knitted goods when they get to the front  exactly agreed mary louise seems to me its the girls chief duty to look after the boys and a lot of the drafted ones are marching away from dorfield each day looking pretty glum even if loyally submitting to the inevitable i tell you girls these young and green soldiers need encouraging so theyll become enthusiastic and make the best sort of fighters and we ought to bend our efforts to cheering them up  irene laughed merrily  good she cried youre like a flock of sheep all you need is a hint to trail away in the very direction i wanted to lead you there are a lot of things we can do to add to our soldiers comfort they need chocolatesweets are good for themand comfortkits of the real sort not those useless dowdy ones so many wellintentioned women are wasting time and money to send them and theyll be grateful for lots and lots of cigarettes and  oh irene do you think that would be right from edna barlow  of course it would the government approves cigarettes and the french girls are supplying our boys across the pond with them even now surely we can do as much for our own brave laddies who are still learning the art of war not all smoke of course and some prefer pipes and tobacco which we can also send them another thing nearly every soldier needs a good pocket knife and a razor and they need games of all sorts such as dominoes and checkers and cribbageboards and good honest trench mirrors and  goodness me irene interrupted jane donovan how do you think we could supply all those things to equip a regiment with the articles you mention would cost a mint of money and wheres the money coming from and how are we to get it  there you go again helping me out smiled irene in your question my dear lies the crux of my suggestion we liberty girls must raise the money  how irene  i object to begging  the people are tired of subscribing to all sorts of schemes  we certainly are not female croesuses  perhaps you expect us to turn bandits and sandbag the good citizens on dark nights  irenes smile did not fade she simply glowed with glee at these characteristic protestations  i cant blame you girls for you havent thought the thing out and i have she stated my scheme isnt entirely original for i read the other day of a similar plan being tried in another city with good success a plan similar in some ways but quite different in others yet it gave me the idea  shoot us the idea then said jane who was inclined to favor slang  in order to raise money said irene slowly and more seriously than she had before spoken it is necessary for us to go into business the other day when i was riding with alora i noticed that the store between the postoffice and the citizens bank is vacant and a sign in the window said apply to peter conant agent peter conant being my uncle i applied to him that evening after dinner on behalf of the liberty girls its one of the best locations in town and right in the heart of the business district the store has commanded a big rental but in these times it is not in demand and it has been vacant for the last six months with no prospect of its being rented girls peter conant will allow us to use this store room without charge until someone is willing to pay the proper rent for it and so the first big problem is solved three cheers for uncle peter  they stared at her rather suspiciously not yet understanding her idea  so far so good my dear said mary louise we can trust dear old peter conant to be generous and patriotic but what good is a store without stock and how are we going to get a stock to selland sell it at a profit that will allow us to do all the things we long to do for the soldiers  explain that and im with you announced alora  explain that and were all with you declared lucile neal  all i need is the opportunity protested irene youre such chatterboxes that you wont let me talk nowlisten im not much of an executioner girls but i can plan and you can execute and in that way i get my finger in the pie now i believe ive a practical idea that will work out beautifully dorfield is an ancient city and has been inhabited for generations almost every house contains a lot of articles that are not in useare put aside and forgottenor are not in any way necessary to the comfort and happiness of the owners yet would be highly prized by some other family which does not possess such articles for instance a babycarriage or crib stored away in some attic could be sold at a bargain to some young woman needing such an article or some old brass candlesticks considered valueless by their owner would be eagerly bought by someone who did not possess such things and had a love for antiques  my proposition is simply this that you visit all the substantial homes in dorfield and ask to be given whatever the folks care to dispense with such items to be sold at the liberty girls shop and the money applied to our war fund to help the soldier boys luciles brother joe neal will furnish us a truck to cart all the things from the houses to our store and im sure we can get a whole lot of goods that will sell readily the people will be glad to give all that they dont want to so good a cause and what one doesnt want another is sure to want whatever money we take in will be all to the good and with it we can supply the boys with many genuine comforts now then how does my idea strike you  approvaleven the dawn of enthusiasmwas written on every countenance they canvassed all the pros and cons of the proposition at length and the more they considered it the more practical it seemed  the only doubtful thing said mary louise finally is whether the people will donate the goods they dont need or care for but that can be easily determined by asking them we ought to pair off and each couple take a residence street and make a careful canvass taking time to explain our plan one day will show us whether were to be successful or not and the whole idea hinges on the success of our appeal  not entirely objected alora we may secure the goods but be unable to sell them  nonsense said little laura hilton nothing in the world sells so readily as secondhand truck just think how the people flock to auctions and the like and we girls should prove good salesladies too for we can do a lot of coaxing and get better prices than an auctioneer all we need do is appeal to the patriotism of the prospective buyers  anyhow asserted edna it seems worth a trial and we must admit the idea is attractive and uniqueat least a novelty in dorfield  so they planned their method of canvassing and agreed to put in the next day soliciting articles to sell at the liberty girls shop   chapter vii the liberty shop  mary louise said to her grandfather that night after explaining irenes novel scheme to raise money we havent been housekeeping many years in dorfield and im not sure i can find among our household possessions anything to give the liberty shop but ive some jewelry and knickknacks that i never wear and if you dont mind granpa jim ill donate that to our shop  the colonel was really enthusiastic over the plan and not only approved his granddaughters proposition to give her surplus jewelry but went over the house with her and selected quite an imposing lot of odds and ends which were not in use and could readily be spared eager to assist the girls the old colonel next morning went to town and ordered a big sign painted to be placed over the store entrance and he also induced the editors of the two newspapers to give the liberty girls latest venture publicity in their columns inviting the cooperation of the public  peter conant turned over the keys of the big store to the girls and the first load of goods to be delivered was that from the hathaway residence  the liberty girls were astonished at the success of their solicitations from almost every house they visited they secured donations of more or less value it may have seemed rubbish to some of the donors but the variety of goods that soon accumulated in the store room presented an interesting collection and the girls arranged their wares enticingly and polished up the brass and copper ornaments and utensils until they seemed of considerable value  they did not open their doors to the public for ten days and joe neal began to grumble because one of his trucks was kept constantly running from house to house gathering up the articles contributed to the liberty girls shop but the girls induced other trucks to help joe and the enthusiasm kept growing curiosity was spurred by the big sign over the closed doors and every woman who donated was anxious to know what others had given to the shop it was evident there would be a crowd at the formal opening for much was expected from the unique enterprise  meantime the girls were busily occupied each day one group solicited donations while another stayed at the store to arrange the goods many articles of furniture more or less decrepit were received and a man was hired to varnish and patch and put the chairs stands tables desks and whatnots into the best condition possible alora jones thought the stock needed brightening so she induced her father to make purchases of several new articles which she presented the girls as her share of the donations and peter conant finding many small pieces of jewelry silverware and bricabrac among the accumulation rented a big showcase for the girls in which such wares were properly displayed  during these ten days of unflagging zeal the liberty girls were annoyed to discover that another traitorous circular had been issued a large contingent of the selective draft boys had just been ordered away to the cantonment and the day before they left all their parents received a circular saying that the draft was unconstitutional and that their sons were being sacrificed by autocratic methods to further the political schemes of the administration mr wilson it ended is trying to make for himself a place in history at the expense of the flesh and blood of his countrymen  this vile and despicable screed was printed from the same queer type as the former circulars denouncing the liberty bond sale and evidently emanated from the same source mary louise was the first to secure one of the papers and its envelope mailed through the local postoffice and her indignation was only equalled by her desire to punish the offender she realized however her limitations and that she had neither the time nor the talent to unmask the traitor she could only hope that the proper authorities would investigate the matter  that afternoon with the circular still in her handbag she visited the clothing store of jacob kasker and asked the proprietor if he had any goods he would contribute to the liberty girls shop  kasker was a stolid floridfaced man born in america of naturalized german parents and therefore his citizenship could not be assailed he had been quite successful as a merchant and was reputed to be the wealthiest clothing dealer in dorfield  no said kasker shortly in answer to the request mary louise was annoyed by the tone  you mean that you wont help us i suppose she said impatiently  he turned from his desk and regarded her with a slight frown usually his expression was stupidly genial  why should i give something for nothing he asked it isnt my war i didnt make it and i dont like it say i got a boyone son do you know theyve drafted himtook him from his work without his consent or mine and marched him off to a war that theres no good excuse for  well returned mary louise your boy is one of those were trying to help  you wont help make him a free american again youll just help give him knickknacks so he wont rebel against his slavery  the girls eyes flashed  mr kasker she said sternly i consider that speech disloyal and traitorous men are being jailed every day for less  he shrugged his shoulders  i believe that is true and it proves what a free country this isdoes it not mr wilsons democracy is the kind that wont allow people to express their opinions unless they agree with him if i say i will stand by the american constitution they will put me in jail  mary louise fairly gasped she devoutly wished she had never approached this dreadful man she felt ashamed to breathe the same air with him but she hated to retreat without a definite display of her disgust at his perfidious utterances drawing the circular from her bag she spread it before him on his desk and said  read that  he just glanced at it proving he knew well its wording mary louise was watching him closely  well what about it he asked brusquely  it expresses your sentiments i believe  he turned upon her suspiciously  you think i wrote it he demanded  my thoughts are my own retorted mary louise  kaskers frown deepened  your thoughts may get you into trouble my girl he said slowly let me tell you this however much i hate this war im not fighting it publicly to you i have spoken in privatejust a private conversation the trouble with me is i talk too much i dont know enough to keep my mouth shut i guess ill never learn that i aint a hypocrite and i aint a pacifist i say the united states must win this war because it has started the job and right or wrong must finish it i guess we could beat the whole world if we had to but i aint fool enough to say that all they do down at washington is right cause i know it aint but im standing by the flag my boy is standing by the flag and hell fight as well as any in the whole army to keep the flag flying over this great republic by and by well get better congressmen the ones we got now are accidents but in spite of all accidentsand theyre mostly our own faultim for america first last and all the time thats jake kasker i dont like the germans and i dont like the english for jake kasker is a george washington american what are you doing girl he suddenly asked with a change of tone  im putting down that speech in shorthand in my notebook said mary louise and i think ive got every word of it she slipped the book in her bag and picked up the circular good afternoon mr kasker  the german seemed bewildered he ran his fingers through his bushy hair as if trying to remember what he had said  wait he cried as she turned away ive changed my mind about those goods ill send some over to your shop to be sold  dont do it she replied for we wont accept them only those whose patriotism rings true are allowed to help us  then she marched out of the big store the proprietor at the desk staring at her fixedly until she had disappeared  thats it jake he said to himself turning to his papers you talk too much if a man prints a thing and nobody knows who printed it hes safe   chapter viii the detectives daughter  im pretty sure granpa jim said mary louise that evening that ive trailed the traitor to his lair and hes none other thanjake kasker  this was the first time she had mentioned her suspicion of kasker to him and her statement was received by the colonel with moderate surprise followed by a doubtful smile  i know jake he remarked and while he is uneducated and his mind is unformed concerning most things outside the clothing business i should hesitate to accuse him of downright disloyalty  hes a german and sympathizes with the kaiser asserted mary louise  did he say that  well not in so many words  a germanamerican is not usually progerman the colonel declared for germans who come to america come to escape the militarism and paternalism of the junkers which is proof in itself that they disapprove of what we term kaiserism i know that kasker talks foolishly against the war and resents the drafting of his son but i think he is a good american at heart he has bought liberty bonds more liberally than some who proclaim their patriotism from the housetops i dont fear these outspoken objectors my dear as much as those who work slyly in the darksuch as the writers of those disgraceful circulars  i practically accused kasker of sending out those circulars said mary louise and his defense was very lame and unconvincing listen grandpa to what he said i took the speech down in shorthand and that worried him im sure  the colonel listened and shook his head gravely  yes jake kasker talks too much he confessed and much that he says is disloyal to our government and calculated to do much harm especially if widely circulated this is no time to criticise the men who are working hard to win the war we should render them faithful support the task before us is difficult and it will require a united country to defeat our enemies i must talk to jake kasker  wont it be better to let the authorities deal with him suggested the girl theyre certain to get him in time if he goes on this way i believe i frightened him a bit this afternoon but hes too dull to take warning anyhow i shall relate the whole interview to chief farnum tomorrow morning  this she did but the chief gave her little satisfaction  no one pays any attention to kasker he said  hes a german and a traitor she insisted a womans intuition is seldom at fault and im convinced hes responsible for this latest and most dreadful circular and she laid it before him  a girls intuition is not as mature as a womans intuition the chief answered in an impatient tone you force me to say my dear young lady that you are dabbling in affairs that do not concern you ive plenty of those circulars on file and im attending to my duty and keeping an eye open for the rascal who wrote them but there is no proof that kasker is the man the federal officers are also investigating the case and i imagine they will not require your assistance  mary louise flushed but stood her ground  isnt it the duty of every patriotic person to denounce a traitor she inquired  yes if there is proof i think you are wrong about kasker but if you are able to bring me proof ill arrest him and turn him over to the federal agents for prosecution but for heavens sake dont bother me with mere suspicions  mary louise did not accept this rebuke graciously she went away with the feeling that chief farnum was for some reason condoning a crime and she was firmly resolved to obtain the required proof if it could be secured without subjecting herself to the annoyance of such rebuffs as the one she had just endured  we ought not to permit such a snake in the grass to exist in dear old dorfield she told her girl associates let us all try to discover absolute proof of kaskers treachery  the other liberty girls were as indignant as mary louise but were too intent on their present duties to pay much attention to jake kasker for the liberty girls shop was now open to the public and men women and children crowded in to see what the girls had to offer sales were so brisk during the first week that the stock became depleted and once more they made a house to house canvass to obtain a new supply of material  this kept all six of the girls busily occupied irene each morning rode down to the shop in the hathaway automobilewheelchair and alland acted as cashier so as to relieve the others of this duty she could accomplish this work very nicely and became the liberty girls treasurer and financial adviser each day she deposited in the bank the money received and the amounts were so liberal that enthusiasm was easily maintained  the soldier boys have reason to rejoice said irene complacently for we shall soon be able to provide them with numerous comforts and luxuriesall of which they are surely entitled to  so the new enterprise was progressing finely when one evening on reaching home from a busy day at the shop mary louise found a letter that greatly pleased her it was from an old and valued girl friend in washington and after rambling along pleasantly on a variety of subjects the writer concluded as follows  but we can talk all this over at our leisure my dear for im going to accept one of your many pressing invitations the first one of course and make you another little visit i love dorfield and i love you and the dear colonel and irene and alora and i long to see all of you again moreover daddy is being sent abroad on a secret mission and i should be lonely without him so expect me at any time in my usual erratic fashion i may follow on the heels of this letter or i may lag behind it for a few days but whenever i turn up at the hathaway gate ill demand a kiss and a welcome for josie ogorman  now this girl was in many ways so entirely unlike mary louise that one might wonder what link of sympathy drew them together unless it was the law of opposites however there was one quality in both their natures that might warrant the warm friendship existing between the two girls mary louise was sweet and winning with a charming wellbred manner and a ready sympathy for all who were in trouble she was attractive in person particular as to dress generous and considerate to a fault the girl had been carefully reared and had well repaid the training of the gallant old colonel her grandfather who had surrounded her with competent instructors yet mary louise had a passion for mysteries and was never quite so happy as when engaged in studying a baffling personality or striving to explain a seeming enigma granpa jim who was usually her confidant when she scented a mystery often accused her of allowing her imagination to influence her judgment but on several occasions the girl had triumphantly proven her intuitions to be correct you must not think from this statement that mary louise was prone to suspect everyone she met it was only on rare occasions she instinctively felt there was more beneath the surface of an occurrence than appeared to the casual observer and then if a wrong might be righted or a misunderstanding removedbut only in such eventshe eagerly essayed to discover the truth it was in this manner that she had once been of great service to her friend alora jones and to others as well it was this natural quality combined with sincere loyalty which made her long to discover and bring to justice the author of the progerman circulars  josie ogorman was small and pudgyher own expressionredhaired and freckledfaced and snubnosed her eyes redeemed much of this personal handicap for they were big and blue as turquoises and as merry and innocent in expression as the eyes of a child also the good humor which usually pervaded her sunny features led people to ignore their plainness in dress josie was somewhat eccentric in her selections and careless in methods of wearing her clothes but this might be excused by her engrossing interest in people rather than in apparel  the girl was the daughterthe only child indeedof john ogorman an old and trusted lieutenant of the governments secretservice from josies childhood the clever detective had trained her in all the subtle art of his craft and allowing for her youth which meant a limited experience of human nature and the intricacies of crime josie ogorman was now considered by her father to be more expert than the average professional detective while the astute secretservice agent was more than proud of his daughters talent he would not allow her to undertake the investigation of crime as a profession until she was older and more mature sometimes however he permitted and even encouraged her to practise on minor or unimportant cases of a private nature in which the united states government was not interested  josies talent drew mary louise to her magnetically the detectives daughter was likewise a delightful companion she was so well versed in all matters of national import as well as in the foibles and peculiarities of the human race that even conservative old colonel hathaway admired the girl and enjoyed her society josie had visited mary louise more than once and was assured a warm welcome whenever she came to dorfield most of the liberty girls knew josie ogorman and when they heard she was coming they straightway insisted she be made a member of their band  shell just have to be one of us said mary louise for im so busy with our wonderful shop that i cant entertain josie properly unless she takes a hand in our game which i believe she will be glad to do  and josie was glad and proclaimed herself a liberty girl the first hour of her arrival the moment she learned what the patriotic band had already accomplished and was determined to accomplish further  its just play you know and play of the right sortloyal and helpful to those who deserve the best we can give them our brave soldiers and sailors count me in girls and youll find me at the liberty shop early and late where i promise to sell anything from an old hoopskirt to a decayed piano at the highest market price weve had some rummage sales in washington you know but nothing to compare with this thorough and businesslike undertaking of yours but i wont wear your uniform i cant afford to allow the glorious redwhiteandblue to look dowdy as it would on my unseemly form   chapter ix gathering up the threads  josie ogorman had been in dorfield several days before mary louise showed her the traitorous circulars that had been issued by some unknown obstructionist at first she had been a little ashamed to acknowledge to her friend that a citizen of her own town could be so disloyal but the matter had weighed heavily on her mind and so she decided to unload it upon josies shrewder intelligence  i feel dear that the best service you can render us while herethe best you can render the nation toowill be to try to discover this secret enemy she said earnestly im sure he has done a lot of harm already and he may do much more if he is left undisturbed some folks are not too patriotic even now when we are facing the most terrible ordeal in our history and some are often so weak as to be influenced by what i am sure is progerman propaganda  josie studied the various circulars she studied the handwriting on the envelopes and the dates of the postmarks her attitude was tense as that of a pointer dog who suddenly senses a trail finally she asked  do the police know  mary louise related her two interviews with chief farnum  how about the agents of the department of justice  i dont know of any confessed mary louise  josie put the circulars in her pocket  now then tell me whom you suspect and why she said  until now mary louise had not mentioned the clothing merchant to josie but she related jake kaskers frank opposition to the war at the liberty bond massmeeting and her interview with him in his store in which he plainly showed his antagonism to the draft and to the administration generally she read to josie the shorthand notes she had taken and supplemented all by declaring that such a man could be guilty of any offense  you see she concluded all evidence points to kasker as the traitor but chief farnum is stubborn and independent and we must obtain positive proof that kasker issued those circulars then we can put an end to his mischiefmaking i dont know how to undertake such a job josie but you do im busy at the liberty shop and we can spare you from there better than any one else so if you want to practise heres an opportunity to do some splendid work  josie was a good listener she did not interrupt mary louise but let her say all she had to say concerning this interesting matter when her friend paused for lack of words josie remarked  every americans watchword should be swat the traitor war seems to breed traitors somehow during the civil war they were called copperheads as the most venomous term that could be applied to the breed we havent yet coined an equally effective word in this war but it will come in time meanwhile every personman or womanwho is not wholeheartedly with president wilson and intent on helping win the war is doing his country a vital injury thats the flat truth and id like to shake your jake kasker out of his suit of handmedown clothing if he isnt a traitor hes a fool and sometimes fools are more dangerous than traitors there all this has got me riled and an investigator has no business to get riled they must be calm and collected she slapped her forehead settled herself in her chair and continued in a more moderate tone now tell me what other people in dorfield have led you to suspect they are not in accord with the administration or resent our entry into the great war  mary louise gave her a puzzled look  oughtnt we to finish with kasker first she asked hesitatingly for she respected josies judgment  the girl detective laughed  ive an impression weve already finished with himunless i really give him that shaking she replied ill admit that such a person is mischievous and ought to be shut up either by jailing him or putting a plaster over his mouth but i cant believe jake kasker guilty of those circulars  why not in an aggrieved tone  well in spite of his disloyal mutterings his deeds are loyal hes disgruntled over the loss of his son and doesnt care who knows it but hell stand pat and spank the kid if he doesnt fight like a tartar he hates the warperhaps we all hate it in a waybut hell buy liberty bonds and help win a victory i know that sort theyre not dangerous just at war with themselves with folly and honesty struggling for the mastery let him alone and in a few months youll find kasker making patriotic speeches  oh josie  think of someone else  mary louise shook her head  what only one string to your bow of distrust fie mary louise when you were selling liberty bonds did you meet with no objectors  wellyes theres a wholesale grocer here who is named silas herring a very rich man but sour and disagreeable  did he kick on the bonds  yes  then tell me all about him  when i first entered his office mr herring made insulting remarks about the bonds and accused our government of being dominated by the english he was very bitter in his remarks but in his office were two other men who remonstrated with him and  what were the two men doing there  why they were talking about something when i entered i didnt hear what for when they saw me they became silent  were they clerks or grocerscustomers  no one was our supervisor andrew duncan  and the other man asked josie  our superintendent of schools professor dyer  oh then they were talking politics  i suppose likely i was obliged to argue with mr herring and became so incensed that i threatened him with the loss of his trade but mr duncan at once subscribed for liberty bonds and so did professor dyer and that shamed silas herring into buying a big bunch of them also  hmm murmured josie contentedly then neither of the three had purchased any bonds until then  i think not granpa jim had himself tried to sell mr herring and had been refused  i see how much did the supervisor invest in bonds  one hundred dollars  too little and the professor  five hundred  too much he couldnt afford it could he  he said it was more than his salary warranted but he wanted to be patriotic  oh well the rich grocer took them off his hands perhaps no disloyal words from the professor or the supervisor  no indeed they rebuked mr herring and made him stop talking  josie nodded thoughtfully  well who else did you find disloyal  no one so far as i can recollect everyone i know seems genuinely patrioticexcept as an afterthought little annie boyle and she doesnt count  who is little annie boyle  no one much her father keeps the mansion house one of the hotels here but not one of the best its patronized by cheap traveling men and the better class of clerks im told and mr boyle is said to do a good business annie knows some of our girls and they say she hates the war and denounces mr wilson and everybody concerned in the war but annies a silly little thing anyhow and of course she couldnt get out those circulars  josie wrote annie boyles name on her tabletslittle ivory affairs which she always carried and made notes on  do you know anyone else at the mansion house she inquired  not a soul  how old is annie  fourteen or fifteen  she didnt conceive her unpatriotic ideas she has heard someone else talk and like a parrot repeats what she has heard  perhaps so but  all right im not going to the liberty girls shop tomorrow mary louise at your invitation ill make myself scarce and nose around to be quite frank i consider this matter serious more serious than you perhaps suspect and since youve put this case in my hands im sure you and the dear colonel wont mind if im a bit eccentric in my movements while im doing detective work i know the town pretty well from my former visits so i wont get lost i may not accomplish anything but youd like me to try wouldnt you  yes indeed thats why ive told you all this i feel something ought to be done and i cant do it myself  josie slipped the tablets into her pocket  mary louise the united states is honeycombed with german spies she gravely announced theyre keeping daddy and all the department of justice pretty busy so ive an inkling as to their activities german spies are encouraged by german propagandists who are not always german but may be americans or even british by birth but are none the less deadly on that account the paid spy has no nationality he is true to no one but the devil and he and his abettors fatten on treachery his abettors are those who repeat sneering and slurring remarks about our conduct of the war you may set it down that whoever is not proamerican is progerman whoever does not favor the alliesall of them  mind youfavors the kaiser whoever is not loyal in this hour of our countrys greatest need is a traitor  youre right josie  now continued josie reflectively you and i must both understand that were undertaking a case that is none of our business its the business of mr bielaski of the department of justice first of all then its the business of mr flynn of the secret service then its the business of the local police together they have a thousand eyes but enemy propagandists are more numerous and scattered throughout the nation your chief of police doesnt want to interfere with the federal agents here and the federal agents are instructed not to pay attention to what is called spy hysteria and so theyre letting things slide but you believe and i believe that theres more treachery underlying these circulars than appears on the surface and if we can secure evidence that is important and present it to the proper officials we shall be doing our country a service so ill start out on my own responsibility  doesnt your secret service badge give you authority asked mary louise  no replied josie that badge is merely honorary daddy got it for me so that if ever i got into trouble it would help me out but it doesnt make me a member of the secret service or give me a bit of authority but that doesnt matter when i get evidence i know what authority to give it to and thats all that is necessary  anyhow said mary louise with a relieved sigh im glad you are going to investigate the author of those awful circulars it has worried me a good deal to think that dorfield is harboring a german spy and i have confidence that if anyone can discover the traitor you can  thats good of you returned josie with a grimace but i lack a similar confidence in myself dont you remember how many times ive foozled  but sometimes josie youve won and i hope youll win now  thank you said josie i hope so myself   chapter x the explosion  day was just beginning to break when a terrible detonation shook all dorfield houses rocked windows rattled a sudden wind swept over the town and then a glare that was not a presage of the coming sun lit the sky  a brief silence succeeded the shock but immediately thereafter whistles shrieked firebells clanged a murmur of agitated voices crying aloud was heard on every side and the people began pouring from the houses into the streets demanding the cause of the alarm  colonel hathaway still weak and nervous stood trembling in his bathrobe when mary louise came to him  its the airplane factory granpa jim she said i can see it from my windows something must have exploded and the buildings are on fire  the airplane works of dorfield had been one of the citys most unique institutions but until we entered the world war it was not deemed of prime importance the governments vast airplane appropriations however had resulted in the dorfield works securing contracts for the manufacture of war machines that straightway raised the enterprise to an important position the original plant had been duplicated a dozen times until now on the big field south of the city the cluster of buildings required for the construction of aircraft was one of the most imposing manufacturing plants in that part of the state skilled government aviators had been sent to dorfield to inspect every machine turned out although backed by local capital it was in effect a government institution because it was now devoted exclusively to government contracts therefore the explosion and fire filled every loyal heart with a sinister suspicion that an enemy had caused the calamity  splendid work on the part of the fire department subdued the flames after but two of the huge shedlike buildings had been destroyed by noon the fire was controlled a cordon of special police surrounded the entire plant and in one of the yards a hundred and fifty workmen were corralled under arrest until the federal officers had made an investigation and decided where to place the blame  reassuring reports had somewhat quieted colonel hathaway and mary louise but although they returned to their rooms they could not sleep aunt sally realizing the situation had an early breakfast prepared but when she called josie ogorman the girl was not in her room or in the house she appeared just as the others were finishing their meal and sat down with a sigh of content  my but the coffee smells good she exclaimed im worn out with the excitement  did you go to the fire josie asked mary louise  yes and got there in time to help drag some of the poor fellows out three men in the building where the explosion occurred were killed outright and two others seriously injured fortunately the night shift had just quit work or the casualties would have been much greater  its dreadful as it is said mary louise with a shudder  what was the cause of the explosion inquired the colonel  dynamite replied josie calmly  then it was not an accident  they dont use dynamite in making airplanes twentytwo machines all complete and packed ready for shipment were blown to smithereens a good many others in course of construction were ruined its a pretty bad mess i can tell you but the machines can be replaced and the lives cant  i wonder who did it said mary louise staring at her friend with frightened eyes  the kaiser declared josie he must be in fine fettle this morning since his propaganda of murder and arson has been so successful  ii dont quite understand you faltered mary louise  josie means that this is the work of a direct emissary of the kaiser explained the colonel we know that among us are objectors and pacifists and those who from political motives are opposing the activities of our president but these are not dynamiters nor do they display their disloyalty except through foolish and futile protests one who resorts to murder and arson in an attempt to block the governments plans and so retard our victory is doubtless a hired assassin and in close touch with the german masterspies who are known to be lurking in this country  thats the idea sir approved josie nodding her tousled red head and better expressed than any answer of mine could have been  well then cant this demon be arrested and punished asked mary louise  that remains to be seen said josie an investigation is already under way all the outgoing night shift and some of the incoming day shift have been held under suspicion until they can be examined and carefully questioned i heard your chief of policewhom i know and knows meassert that without doubt the bomb had been placed by one of the workmen i wonder what makes him think that also the police are hunting for everyone seen loitering about the airplane plant during the past twentyfour hours theyll spend daysperhaps weeksin investigating and then the affair will quiet down and be forgotten  you fear they will not be able to apprehend the criminal from the colonel  not the way the police are going at it theyre virtually informing the criminal that theyre hunting for him but dont know where to find him and that if he isnt careful theyll get him so hes going to be careful it is possible of course that the fellow has left traces clues that will lead to his discovery and arrest still im not banking much on that such explosions have been occurring for months in various parts of the country and the offenders have frequently escaped the government suspects that german spies are responsible but an indefinite suspicion is often as far as it gets evidence is lacking  how about your boasted department of justice and the secret service asked mary louise  theyre as good as the german spy system and sometimes a bit better dont think for a minute that our enemies are not clever said josie earnestly sometimes our agents make a grab sometimes the german spy remains undiscovered its diamond cut diamondfiftyfifty but when we get every alien enemy sequestered in zones removed from all factories doing government work were going to have less trouble a lot of these germans and austrians are libertyloving americans loyal and true but we must round up the innocent many in order to squelch the guilty few  the following week was one of tense excitement for dorfield federal officers poured into the city to assist in the investigation the victims were buried with honor and ceremony wrapped in american flags to show that these soldiers of industry had been slain by their countrys foe the courtrooms were filled with eager mobs hoping that evidence would be secured against some one of the many suspects gradually however the interest decreased as josie had predicted it would a half dozen suspects were held for further examination and the others released new buildings were being erected at the airplane plant and although somewhat crippled the business of manufacturing these necessary engines of war was soon going on much as usual   chapter xi a font of type  mary louise went into josie ogormans room and found the young girl bent over a table on which were spread the disloyal circulars  youve been studying those things for nearly two weeks josie she said have you made any discoveries  i know a lot more about the circulars than i did answered josie for instance there are nineteen printing offices in dorfield and only two of them have this kind of type  oh thats something indeed cried mary louise one of the two offices must have printed the circulars  no the curious fact is that neither printed them returned josie regarding the circulars with a frown  how do you know  its an old style of type not much in use at present explained the youthful detective in one printing office the case that contains this type face hasnt been used for months and months i found all the compartments covered with dust a quarter of an inch thick there wasnt a trace of the type having been disturbed i proved this by picking out a piece of type which scattered the dust and brought to light the shining bodies of the other type in that compartment so the circulars could never have been printed from that case of type  but the other printing office  well there they had a font of the same style of type which is occasionally used in job printing but its a small font and has only twentyfour small as i rummaged the whole shop and found none of the type standing out of the case another thing they had only three capital gs and one of those was jammed and damaged in the last circular issued no less than seven capital gs appear in the first one sent out i find fiftyeight small as all this convinces me the circulars were issued from no regular printing office  then how did it get printed asked mary louise  thats what puzzles me confessed josie three of the four big manufacturing concerns here have outfits and do their own printingor part of it anyhowand i dont mind saying i expected to find my clue in one of those places rather than in a regular printing office but ive made an exhaustive search aided by the managers and theres no type resembling that used in the circulars in any of the private print shops in fact im up a stump  but why do you attach so much importance to this matter queried mary louise  its the most direct route to the traitor find who printed the circulars and youve got your hand on the man who wrote and mailed them but the printing baffles me and so ive started another line of investigation  what line is that josie  the circular envelopes were addressed by hand with pen and ink the ink is a sort in common use the envelopes are an ordinary commercial kind the circulars are printed on half a sheet of lettersize typewriting paper sold in several stationery store in large quantities no clue there but the handwriting is interesting its disguised of course and the addressing was done by two different peoplethats plain  you are wonderful josie  im stupid as a clam mary louise see here she went to a closet and brought out a large cardboard box which she placed upon the table it was filled to the brim with envelopes addressed to many business firms in dorfield but all bearing the local postmark now ive been days collecting these envelopes continued the girl and ive studied them night after night im something of a handwriting expert you know for that is one of the things that daddy has carefully taught me these envelopes came from all sorts of peoplefolks making inquiries paying bills ordering goods and the like ive had an idea from the first that some prominent personno ordinary manis responsible for the circulars theyre well worded grammatical and the malicious insinuations are cleverly contrived to disconcert the loyal but weak brethren however these envelopes havent helped me a bit neither of the two persons who addressed the envelopes of the circulars addressed any of these business envelopes of that im positive  dear me said mary louise surprised id no idea youd taken so much trouble josie  well ive undertaken a rather puzzling case my dear and it will mean more trouble than you can guess before ive solved it this progerman scoundrel is clever he suspected that hed be investigated and has taken every precaution to prevent discovery nevertheless the cleverest criminal always leaves some trace behind him if one can manage to find it so im not going to despair at this stage of the game  do you know said mary louise thoughtfully ive had an idea that theres some connection between the explosion at the airplane works and the sender of these circulars  josie gave her a queer look  what connection do you suspect she asked quickly  why the man who wrote those circulars would not stop at any crime to harass the government and interfere with the promotion of the war  is that as far as youve gone  have you gone any farther josie  a step mary louise it looks to me as if there is an organized band of traitors in dorfield no one person is responsible for it all didnt i say two different people addressed the circulars in disguised handwriting now a bomb has to be constructed and placed and timed and i dont credit any one person with handling such a job and at the same time being aware that the utmost damage to the war departments plans would be accomplished by blowing up the airplane works that argues intelligent knowledge of national and local affairs there may be but two conspirators and there may be more but the more there are the easier it will be for me to discover them  naturally agreed mary louise but really josie i dont see how youre going to locate a clue that will guide you have you attended the trial of those suspected of the bomb outrage  ive seen all the testimony there isnt a culprit in the whole bunch the real criminal is not even suspected as yet declared josie the federal officers know this and are just taking things easy and making the trials string out to show theyre wide awake also ive met two secret service men herenorman addison and old jim crissey i know nearly all of the boys but they havent learned anything important either  are these men experienced detectives  theyve done some pretty good work but nothing remarkable in these times the government is forced to employ every man with any experience at all and crissey and addison are just ordinary boys honest and hardworking but not especially talented daddy would have discovered something in twentyfour hours but daddy has been sent abroad for some reason and there are many cases of espionage and sabotage fully as important as this in this spyinfested land thats why poor josie ogorman is trying to help the government without assignment or authority if i succeed however ill feel that i have done my bit  dont you get discouraged dear at times  never why mary louise discouragement would prove me a dub im puzzled though just now and feeling around blindly in the dark to grab a thread that may lead me to success if i have luck presently ill find it  she put away the envelopes as she spoke and resuming her seat drew out her tablets and examined the notes she had made thereon josie used strange characters in her memoranda a sort of shorthand she had herself originated and which could be deciphered only by her father or by herself  heres a list of suspects she said not that theyre necessarily connected with our case but are known to indulge in disloyal sentiments hal grober the butcher insists on selling meat on meatless days and wont defer to the wishes of mr hoover whom he condemns as a born american but a naturalized englishmen hes another jake kasker too noisy to be guilty of clever plotting  theyre both unamerican exclaimed mary louise there ought to be a law to silence such people josie  dont worry my dear theyll soon be silenced predicted her friend either better judgment will come to their aid or the federal courts will get after them we shouldnt allow anyone to throw stones at the government activities just at this crisis they may think what they please but must keep their mouths shut  im sorry they can even think disloyalty said mary louise  well even that will be remedied in time was the cheerful response no war more just and righteous was ever waged than this upon which our country has embarked and gradually that fact will take possession of those minds which through prejudice obstinacy or ignorance have not yet grasped it im mighty proud of my country mary louise and i believe this war is going to give us americans a distinction that will set us up in our own opinion and in the eyes of the world but always there is a willful objection on the part of some toward any good and noble action and we must deal charitably with these deluded ones and strive to win them to an appreciation of the truth  isnt that carrying consideration too far asked mary louise  no our ministers are after the unregenerates not after the godly the noblest act of humanity is to uplift a fellow creature even in our prisons we try to reform criminals to make honest men of them rather than condemn them to a future of crime it would be dreadful to say youre all yellow go to thunder  yes i believe youre right approved the other girl that is your theory is correct but the wicked sometimes refuse to reform  usually the fault of the reformers my dear but suppose we redeem a few of them isnt it worth while now let me see heres a washwoman who says the kaiser is a gentleman and a streetcar driver who says its a rich mans war no use bothering with such people in our present state of blind groping and heres the list that you yourself gave to me one silas herring a wholesale grocer im going to see him hes a big successful man and being opposed to the administration is dangerous herring is worth investigating and with him is associated professor john dyer superintendent of schools  oh professor dyer is all right said mary louise hastily it was he who helped bring mr herring to time and afterward he took granpa jims place on the bond committee and solicited subscriptions  did he get any  any what  subscriptions  i believe so really i dont know  well i know said josie for ive inspected the records your professorwho by the way is only a professor by courtesy and a politician by professionworked four days on the bond sale and didnt turn in a single subscription he had a lot of wealthy men on his list and approached them in such a manner that they all positively declined to buy bonds dyers activities kept these men from investing in bonds when had they been properly approached they would doubtless have responded freely  good gracious are you sure josie  im positive ive got a cross opposite the name of professor john dyer and im going to know more about himpresently his bosom chum is the honorable andrew duncan a man with an honest scotch name but only a thirtysecond or so of scotch blood in his veins his mother was a german and his grandmother irish and his greatgrandmother a spanish gipsy  how did you learn all that josie  by making inquiries duncan was born in dorfield and his father was born in the county hes a typical americana product of the great national meltingpotbut no patriot because he has no sympathy for any of the european nations at war or even with the war aims of his native land hes a selfish scheming unprincipled politician an officeholder ever since he could vote a man who would sacrifice all america to further his own personal ends  then you think mr duncan maymight beis  no said josie i dont the man might instigate a crime and encourage it in a subtle and elusive way but hes too shrewd to perpetrate a crime himself i wouldnt be surprised if duncan could name the manor the band of traitorswere looking for if he chose to but you may rest assured he has not involved his own personality in any scheme to balk the government  i cant understand that sort of person said mary louise plaintively  its because you havent studied the professional politician he has been given too much leeway heretofore but his days i firmly believe are now numbered josie answered now heres my excuse for investigating silas herring and his two cronies dyer and duncan all three of them happen to be political bosses in this section it is pretty generally known that they are not in sympathy with president wilson and the administration they are shrewd enough to know that the popularity of the war and the presidents eloquent messages have carried the country by storm so they cannot come right out into the open with their feelings at the same time they can feel themselves losing control of the situation in fact the herring gang is fearful that at the coming elections they will be swept aside and replaced with outandout loyal supporters of the president so theyre going to try to arouse sentiment against the administration and against the war in order to head off the threatened landslide dyer hoped to block the sale of liberty bonds blinding folks to his intent by subscribing for them himself but you girls foiled that scheme by your enthusiastic drive what the other conspirators have done i dont know but i imagine their energies will not be squelched by one small defeat i dont expect to land any of the three in jail but i think they all ought to be behind the bars and if i shadow them successfully one or the other may lead me to their tools or confederatesthe ones directly guilty of issuing the disloyal circulars and perhaps of placing the bomb that damaged the airplane works and murdered some of its employes  mary louise was pale with horror when josie finished her earnest and convincing statement she regarded her friends talent with profound admiration nevertheless the whole matter was becoming so deep so involved that she could only think of it with a shudder  im almost sorry said the girl regretfully that i ever mixed up in this dreadful thing  im not sorry returned josie chasing traitors isnt the pleasantest thing in the world even for a regular detective but its a duty i owe my country and im sufficiently interested to probe the affair to the extent of my ability if i fail nothing is lost and if i win ill have done something worth while heres another name on the list of suspects you gave meannie boyle the hotelkeepers daughter  dont bother about annie for goodness sake exclaimed mary louise she hasnt the brains or an opportunity to do any harm so youd better class her with kasker and the butcher  but josie shook her head  theres a cross opposite her name said she i dont intend to shuffle annie boyle into the discard until i know more about her   chapter xii josie buys a desk  the liberty girls shop was proving a veritable mint expenses were practically nothing so all the money received could be considered clear profit it was amusing to observe the people who frequented the shop critically examining the jumble of wares displayed wondering who had donated this or that and meantime searching for something that could be secured at a bargain most of the shrewd women had an idea that these young girls would be quite ignorant of values and might mark the articles at prices far below their worth but the values of such goods could only be conjectural and therefore the judgment of the older women was no more reliable than that of the girls they might think they were getting bargains and perhaps were but that was problematic  the one outstanding fact was that people were buying a lot of things they had no use for merely because they felt they were getting them cheaply and that their money would be devoted to a good cause  mrs brown who had given the shop a lot of discarded articles purchased several discarded articles donated by mrs smith her neighbor while mrs smith eagerly bought the castoff wares of mrs brown either would have sneered at the bare idea of taking truck which the other had abandoned had the medium of exchange not been the popular liberty girls shop for it was a popular shop the best families patronized it society women met there to chat and exchange gossip it was considered a mark of distinction and highly patriotic to say oh yes ive given the dear girls many really valuable things to sell theyre doing such noble work you know  even the eminent mrs charleworth premier aristocrat of dorfield condescended to visit the shop not once but many times she would sit in one of the chairs in the rear of the long room and hold open court while her sycophants grouped around her hanging on her words for mrs charleworths status was that of social leader she was a middleaged widow very handsome wore wonderful creations in dress was of charming personality was exceedingly wealthy and much traveled when she visited new york the metropolitan journals took care to relate the interesting fact mrs charleworth was quite at home in london paris berlin and vienna she was visiting friends in dresden when the european war began and by advice of herr zimmerman of the german foreign office who was in some way a relative had come straight home to avoid embarrassment this much was generally known  it had been a matter of public information in the little town for a generation that dick charleworth had met the lady in paris when she was at the height of her social glory and had won the hand of the beautiful girl and brought her to dorfield as his wife but the wealthy young manufacturer did not long survive his marriage on his death his widow inherited his fortune and continued to reside in the handsome residence he had built although until the war disrupted european society she passed much time abroad  the slight taint of german blood in mrs charleworths veins was not regarded seriously in dorfield her mother had been a russian court beauty she spoke several languages fluently she was discreet in speech and negative in sympathy concerning the merits of the war this lasted however only while the united states preserved neutrality as soon as we cast our fortunes with the allies mrs charleworth organized the daughters of helpfulness an organization designed to aid our national aims but a society cult as well under its auspices two private theatrical entertainments had been given at the opera house and the proceeds turned over to the red cross a grand charity ball had been announced for a future date  it may easily be understood that when mrs charleworth became a patroness of the liberty girls shop and was known to have made sundry purchases there the high standing of that unique enterprise was assured some folks perhaps frequented the place to obtain a glimpse of the great mrs charleworth herself but of course these were without the pale of her aristocratic circle  their social triumph however was but one reason for the girls success the youngsters were enticing in themselves and they proved to be clever in making sales the first stock soon melted away and was replaced by new contributions which the girls took turns in soliciting the best residences in dorfield were first canvassed then those of people in moderate circumstances the merchants were not overlooked and mary louise took the regular stores personally in charge  anything you have that you cant sell we will take was her slogan and most of the merchants found such articles and goodnaturedly contributed them to the shop  sooner or later we shall come to the end of our resources predicted alora jones weve ransacked about every house in town for contributions  lets make a second canvas then suggested lucile and especially let us make a second appeal to those who did not give us anything on our first round our scheme wasnt thoroughly understood at first you know but now folks regard it an honor to contribute to our stock  yes said jane donovan i had to laugh when mrs charleworth asked mrs dyer yesterday what she had given us and mrs dyer stammered and flushed and said that when we called on her the dyers were only renting the house and furniture which belonged to the dudleymarkhams who are in south america but mrs dyer added they have now bought the placeold furniture and alland perhaps she would yet find some items she can spare  very good said edna barlow the dyers are in my district and ill call upon them at once  have the dyers really bought the dudleymarkham place asked mary louise  so it seems replied jane  butit must have cost a lot of money  isnt the professor rich inquired josie ogorman who was present and had listened quietly to the conversation  idontknow answered mary louise and the other girls forbore to answer more definitely  that evening however josie approached the subject when she and mary louise were sitting quietly at home and the conversation more confidential  the dyers explained her friend were not very prosperous until the professor got the appointment as superintendent of schools he was a teacher in a boys school for years on a small salary and everyone was surprised when he secured the appointment  how did it happen asked josie  mary louise looked across at her grandfather  how did it happen granpa jim she repeated  the old colonel lowered his book  we havent been residents of dorfield many years said he so i am not well acquainted with the towns former history but i remember to have heard that the herring political ring which elected our board of education proposed john dyer for the position of school superintendentand the board promptly gave him the appointment  was he properly qualified josie asked  i think so a superintendent is a sort of business manager he doesnt teach you know but i understand the professor received his education abroadat heidelburgand is well versed in modern educational methods our schools seem to be conducted very well  josie was thoughtful for a time and after the colonel had resumed his book she asked mary louise  who was mrs dyer before her marriage  that is ancient history as far as i am concerned but i heard the girls talking about her just the other day her family it seems was respectable but unimportant yet mrs dyer is very well liked shes not brilliant but kindly when we first came here the dyers lived in a little cottage on juniper street and it is only lately that they moved to the big house theyve just bought mrs dyer is now trying hard for social recognition but seems to meet with little encouragement mrs charleworth speaks to her you know but doesnt invite mrs dyer to her affairs  next day edna barlow after a mornings quest of contributions returned to the shop in triumph  theres almost a truckload of stuff outside to be unloaded she announced and a good half of it is from mrs dyera lot of the old dudleymarkham rubbish you know it has class to it girls and when it has been freshened up were sure to get good prices for the lot  im surprised that mrs dyer was so liberal said mary louise  well at first she said the professor had gone to chicago on business and so she couldnt do anything for us replied edna but i insisted that we needed goods right now so she finally said we could go up in the attic and rummage around and take whatever we could find my what a lot of useless stuff there was that attic has more smashed and battered and brokenlegged furniture in it than would furnish six housesprovided it was in shape the accumulation of ages but a lot of it is antique girls and worth fixing up ive made the best haul of our career i verily believe  then laura hilton who had accompanied edna added  when mrs dyer saw our men carrying all that stuff down she looked as if she regretted her act and would like to stop us but she didntwas ashamed to probablyso we lugged it off never having been used to antique furniture the poor woman couldnt realize the value of it  this seems to me almost like robbery remarked lucile doubtfully do you think it right for us to take advantage of the womans ignorance  remember the cause for which we fight admonished irene from her chair if the things people are not using and do not want can provide comforts for our soldier boys we ought to secure themif we have to take them by force  the attic of the old house had really turned out a number of interesting articles there were tables stands settees chairs and a quaint old desk set on a square pedestal with a base of carved lions feet this last interested josie as soon as it was carried into the shop the top part was somewhat dilapidated the cover of the desk being broken off and some of the pigeonhole compartments smashed but there was an odd lot of tiny drawers located in every conceivable place all pretty well preserved and the square pedestal and the base were in excellent condition  josie open drawer after drawer and looked the old cabinetdesk over thoroughly quite unobserved because the others in the shop were admiring a chippendale chair or waiting upon their customers presently josie approached mary louise and asked  what will you take for the pedestaldeskjust as it stands  why ill let irene put a price on it was the reply she knows values better than the rest of us  if its fixed up it will be worth twenty dollars said irene after wheeling her chair to the desk for a critical examination of it  well what will it cost to fix it up demanded josie  perhaps five dollars  then ill give you fifteen for it just as it stands proposed josie  you what could you do with the clumsy thing  ship it home to washington was the prompt reply it would tickle daddy immensely to own such an unusual article so i want to make him a present of it on his birthday  hand over the fifteen dollars please decided irene  josie paid the money she caught the drayman who had unloaded the furniture and hired him to take the desk at once to the hathaway residence she even rode with the man on the truck and saw the battered piece of furniture placed in her own room leaving it there she locked her door and went back to the shop  the girls were much amused when they learned they had made so important a sale to one of themselves  if we had asked mrs dyer to give us fifteen dollars cold cash remarked laura she would have snubbed us properly but the first article from her attic which we sold has netted us that sum and i really believe we will get from fifty to seventyfive dollars more out of the rest of the stuff  mrs charleworth dropped in during the afternoon and immediately became interested in the dudleymarkham furniture the family to whom it had formerly belonged she knew had been one of the very oldest and most important in dorfield the dudleymarkhams had large interests in argentine and would make their future home there but here were the possessions of their grandmothers and greatgrandmothers rescued from their ancient dust and mrs charleworth was a person who loved antiques and knew their sentimental and intrinsic values  the dyers were foolish to part with these things she asserted of course mary dyer isnt supposed to know antiques but the professor has lived abroad and is well educated  the professor wasnt at home explained edna perhaps that was lucky for us he is in chicago and we pleaded so hard that mrs dyer let us go into the attic and help ourselves  well that proves she has a generous heart said the grand lady with a peculiar sphinxlike smile i will buy these two chairs at your price when you are ready to sell them  we will hold them for you replied edna theyre to be revarnished and properly restored you know and weve a man in our employ who knows just how to do it  when mary louise told colonel hathaway jokingly at dinner that evening of josies extravagant purchase her girl friend accepted the chaffing composedly and even with a twinkle in her babyblue eyes she made no comment and led mary louise to discourse on other subjects  that night josie sat up late locked in her own room with only the pedestaldesk for company first she dropped to her knees pushed up a panel in the square base and disclosed the fact that in this inappropriate place were several cleverly constructed secret compartments two of which were well filled with papers the papers were not those of the dudleymarkhams they were not yellowed with age they were quite fresh  there whispered the girl triumphantly the traitor is in my toils is it just luck i wonder or has fate taken a hand in the game how the kaiser would frown if he knew what i am doing tonight and how daddy would laugh butlets seeperhaps this is just a wedge and ill need a sledgehammer to crack open the whole conspiracy  the reason josie stayed up so late was because she carefully examined every paper and copied most of those she had found but toward morning she finished her selfimposed task replaced the papers slid the secret panel into place and then dragged the rather heavy piece of furniture into the far end of the deep closet that opened off her bedroom before the desk she hung several dresses quite masking it from observation then she went to bed and was asleep in two minutes   chapter xiii joe langley soldier  strange as it may seem mary louise and her liberty girls were regarded with envy by many of the earnest women of dorfield who were themselves working along different lines to promote the interests of the government in the great war every good woman was anxious to do her duty in this national emergency but every good woman loves to have her efforts appreciated and since the advent of the bevy of pretty young girls in the ranks of female patriotism they easily became the favorites in public comment and appreciation young men and old cheerfully backed the liberty girls in every activity they undertook the dorfield red cross was a branch of the wonderful national organization the hoover conservation club was also national in its scope the navy league knitting knot sent its work to washington headquarters all were respectfully admired and financially assisted on occasion but the liberty girls of dorfield were distinctly local and a credit to the city their pretty uniforms were gloriously emblematic their fresh young faces glowed with enthusiasm their specialty of helping our soldier boys appealed directly to the hearts of the people many a man cold and unemotional heretofore in his attitude toward the war was won to a recognition of its menace its necessities and his personal duty to his country by the arguments and example of the liberty girls if there was a spark of manhood in him he would not allow a young girl to outdo him in patriotism  mary louise gradually added to her ranks as girl after girl begged to be enrolled in the organization after consulting the others it was decided to admit all desirable girls between the ages of 14 and 18 and six companies were formed during the following weeks each company consisting of twenty girls the captains were the original sixalora laura edna lucile jane and mary louise irene macfarlane was made adjutant and quartermaster because she was unable to participate actively in the regimental drills  mary louise wanted josie to be their general but josie declined she even resigned temporarily from membership saying she had other duties to attend to that would require all her time then the girls wanted mary louise to be general of the dorfield liberty girls but she would not consent  we will just have the six companies and no general at all she said nor do we need a colonel or any officers other than our captains each and every girl in our ranks is just as important and worthy of honor as every other girl so the fewer officers the better  about this time joe langley came back from france with one arm gone he was sergeant joe langley now and wore a decoration for bravery that excited boundless admiration and pride throughout all dorfield joe had driven a milk wagon before he left home and went to canada to join the first contingent sent abroad but no one remembered his former humble occupation a hero has no past beyond his heroism the young mans empty sleeve and his decoration admitted him to intercourse with the best society of dorfield which promptly placed him on a pedestal  you know said joe rather shamefacedly deprecating the desire to lionize him there wasnt much credit in what i did im even sorry i did it for my foolishness sent me to the hospital an put me out o the war but there was tom mcchesney lyin out there in no mans land with a bullet in his chest an moanin for water tom was a good chum o mine an i was mad when i saw him falljest as the boches was drivin us back to our trenches i knowd the poor cuss was in misery an i knowd what id expect a chum o mine to do if i was in toms place so out i goes with my capn yellin at me to stop an i got to tom an give him a good honest swig the bullets pinged around us although i saw a german officera decent young fellowtry to keep his men from shootin but he couldnt hold em in so i hoisted tom on my back an started for our trenches got there too you know jest as a machinegun over to the right started spoutin it didnt matter my droppin tom in the trench an tumblin after him the boys buried him decent while the sawbones was cuttin what was left of my arm away an puttin me to sleep with dope it was a fool trick after all though god knows ill never forget the look in toms eyes as he swallered that swig o cool water thats all folks im out o the game an i spose the genral jus pinned this thing on my coat so i wouldnt take my discharge too much to heart  that was joe langley do you wonder they forgot he was once a milkman or that every resident of dorfield swelled with pride at the very sight of him just one of our soldier boys just one of the boys the liberty girls were trying to assist  theyre all alike said mary louise i believe every american soldier would be a joe langley if he had the chance  joe took a mighty interest in the liberty girls he volunteered to drill and make soldiers of them and so well did he perform this task perhaps because they admired him and were proud of their drillmaster that when the last big lot of selected draft men marched away the entire six companies of liberty girls marched with them to the train bands playing and banners flyingand it was conceded to be one of the greatest days dorfield had ever known because everyone cheered until hoarse   chapter xiv the professor is annoyed  josie ogorman after resigning from the liberty girls becameso she calmly stateda loafer she wandered around the streets of dorfield in a seemingly aimless manner shopped at the stores without buying visited the houses of all sorts of people on all sorts of gossipy errands interviewed lawyers bankers and others in an inconsequential way that amused some and annoyed others and conducted herself so singularly that even mary louise was puzzled by her actions  but josie said to mary louise my what a lot im learning theres nothing more interestingor more startlingor sometimes more repulsivethan human nature  have you learned anything about the german spy plot questioned mary louise eagerly  not yet my quest resembles a cartwheel i go all around the outer rim first and mark the spokes when i come to them then i follow each spoke toward the center theyll all converge to the hub you know and when ive reached the hub with all my spokes of knowledge radiating from it im in perfect control of the whole situation  oh how far are you from the hub josie  im still marking the spokes mary louise  are there many of them  more than i suspected  well i realize dear that youll tell me nothing until you are ready to confide in me but please remember josie how impatient i am and how i long to bring the traitors to justice  i wont forget mary louise were partners in this case and perhaps i shall ask your help before long some of my spokes may be blinds and until i know something positive theres no use in worrying you with confidences which are merely surmises  soon after this conversation mary louise found herself as head of the liberty girls in an embarrassing position professor dyer returned from chicago on an evening train and early next morning was at the shop even before its doors were opened impatiently awaiting the arrival of mary louise  there has been a mistake he said to her hastily as she smilingly greeted him in my absence mrs dyer has thoughtlessly given you some old furniture which i value highly it was wifes blunder of course but i want back two of the articles and im willing to pay your shop as much for them as you could get elsewhere  oh im awfully sorry professor said the girl really distressed as she unlocked the shop door come in please mrs dyer told our girls to go into the attic and help themselves to anything they wanted weve done splendidly with the old furniture and fenders and brassware but i hope the two articles you prize are still unsold if so you shall not pay us for them but we will deliver them to your house immediately  he did not reply for already he was searching through the accumulation of odds and ends with which the storeroom was stocked  perhaps i can help you suggested mary louise  he turned to her seeming to hesitate  one was a chair a chair with spindle legs and a high back richly carved it is made of black oak i believe  oh i remember that well said the girl mrs charleworth bought it from us  mrs charleworth well perhaps she will return it to me i know the lady slightly and will explain that i did not wish to part with it still his eyes were roving around the room and his interest in the chair seemed somewhat perfunctory the other piece of furniture was a sort of escritoire set on a square pedestal that had a carved base of lions feet his voice had grown eager now although he strove to render it calm and there was a ring of anxiety in his words  mary louise felt relieved as she said assuringly  that at least i can promise you will be returned my friend josie ogorman bought it and had it sent to our house where she is visiting as soon as some of the girls come here to relieve me ill take you home with me and have uncle eben carry the desk to your house in our motor car it isnt so very big and uncle eben can manage it easily  the tense look on the mans face relaxed it evident that professor dyer was greatly relieved  thank you he said id like to get it back as soon as possible  but when half an hour later they arrived at the hathaway residence and met josie just preparing to go out the latter said with a bewildered look in her blue eyes the old desk why i sent that home to washington days ago  you did mary louise was quite surprised why you said nothing to me about that josie  i didnt mention it because id no idea you were interested daddy loves old things and i sent it home so he would have it on his return by freight you are away at the shop all day you know so i asked uncle eben to get me a big box which he brought to my room the desk fitted it nicely i nailed on the cover myself and uncle eben took it to the freight office for me see heres the receipt in my pocketbook  she unfolded a paper and held it out to professor dyer who read it with a queer look on his face it was indeed a freight receipt for one piece of furniture boxed to be shipped to john ogorman washington d c the sender was described as miss j ogorman dorfield there was no questioning josies veracity but she called the black servant to substantiate her story  yes miss josie said uncle eben i done took de box to de freight office an got de receipt lak yo tol me tuesday it were las tuesday  professor dyer was thoughtful  you say your father is away from home at present he asked  yes hes abroad  do you suppose the freight office in washington would deliver the box to me on your order  im afraid not said josie its consigned to john ogorman and only john ogorman can sign for its receipt  again the professor reflected he seemed considerably disturbed  what is the business of john ogorman your father he presently inquired  hes a member of the governments secret service josie replied watching his face  the professors eyes widened he stood a moment as if turned to stone then he gave a little forced laugh and said  im obliged to make a trip to washington on business and i thought perhaps id pick up theahthe box there and ship to dorfield the old desk isnt valuable exceptexcept that itsahantique andunusual id like to get it back and ill return to you the money you paid for it and the freight charges if youll write a note to the railway company saying the box was wrongly addressed and asking that it be delivered to my order i think i can get it  josie agreed to this at once she wrote the note and also gave professor dyer the freight receipt but she refused to take his money  there might be some hitch she explained if you get the box and it reaches dorfield safely then ill accept the return of my money but railroads are unreliable affairs and have queer rules so lets wait and see what happens  the professor assured her however that there was no doubt of his getting the box but he would wait to pay her if she preferred to let the matter rest when he had gone awayseeming far more cheerful than when he camemary louise said to josie  this is a very unfortunate and embarrassing affair all around im so sorry we took that furniture from mrs dyer before her husband came home and gave his consent it is very embarrassing  im glad for my part was the reply josies blue eyes were shining innocently and her smile was very sweet mary louise regarded her suspiciously  what is it josie she demanded what has that old desk to do withwith  the german spy plot just wait and see mary louise  you wont tell me  not now dear  but why did you ship the thing to washington if it is likely to prove a valuable clue  why ask questions that i cant answer see here mary louise it isnt wise or even safe for me to tell you anything just yet what i know frightens meeven me cant you wait andtrust me  oh of course responded mary louise in a disappointed voice but i fail to understand what professor dyers old desk can possibly have to do with our quest  josie laughed  it used to belong to the dudleymarkhams  the dudleymarkhams great heavens butsee herethey left dorfield long before this war started and so  im going out was josies inconsequent remark do you think those are rain clouds mary louise i hate to drag around an umbrella if its not needed   chapter xv suspenders for sale  the two girls parted at the liberty shop mary louise went in to attend to business while josie ogorman strolled up the street and paused thoughtfully before the windows of kaskers clothing emporium at first she didnt notice that it was kaskers she looked in the windows at the array of mens wear just so she could think quietly without attracting attention for she was undecided as to her next move but presently realizing this was kaskers place she gave a little laugh and said to herself this is the fellow poor little mary louise suspected of being the arch traitor i wonder if he knows anything at all or if i could pump it out of him if he does guess ill interview old jake if only to satisfy myself that hes the harmless fool i take him to be  with this in mind she walked into the store a clerk met her other clerks were attending to a few scattered customers  is mr kasker in she asked the young man  in his office miss to the right half way down  he left her to greet another who entered and josie walked down the aisle as directed the office was raised a step above the main floor and was railed in with a small swinging gate to allow entrance this was not the main business office but the proprietors special den and his desk was placed so he could overlook the entire establishment with one glance just at present kasker was engaged in writing or figuring for his bushy head was bent low  josie opened the gate walked in and took a chair that stood beside the desk  good morning mr kasker she said sweetly  he looked up swept her with a glance and replied  whats the matter cant one of the clerks attend to you im busy  ill wait was josies quiet reply id rather deal with you than a clerk  he hesitated laid down his pen and turned his chair toward her she knew the man by sight but if he had ever seen the girl he did not recall the fact his tone was now direct and businesslike  very well miss tell me what i can do for you  it had only taken her an instant to formulate her speech  im interested in the poor children of dorfield she began having been sent here as the agent of an organization devoted to clothing our needy little ones i find since i have been soliciting subscriptions in dorfield and investigating the requirements of the poor that there are a lot of boys especially in this city who are in rags and i want to purchase for them as many outfits as my money will allow but on account of the war and its demands on people formerly charitably inclined i realize my subscription money is altogether too little to do what i wish thats too bad but its true everywhere they talk warwarwar and its hardships the war demands money for taxes bonds mess funds the red cross and all sorts of things and in consequence our poor are being sadly neglected  he nodded somewhat absently but said nothing josie felt her clever bait had not been taken as she had expected so she resolved to be more audacious in her remarks  it seems a shame she said with assumed indignation that the poor of the country must starve and be in want while the money is all devoted to raising an army for the germans to shoot and mangle  he saw the point and answered with a broad smile  is that the alternative young lady must one or the other happen wellyes the soldiers must be killed god help em but himmel we dont let our kiddies freeze for lack of clothes do we see here theyre taking everything away from us merchantsour profits our goods everythingbut the little we got left the kiddies can have the war is a robber it destroys it puts its hand in an honest mans pocket without asking his consent all wars do that the men who make wars have no soulsno mercy but they make wars wars are desperate things and require desperate methods there is always the price to pay and the people always pay it the autocrats of war do not say please to us they say hold up your hands and sowhat is there to do but hold up our hands  josie was delighted she was exultant jake kasker was falling into her trap very swiftly  but the little ones he continued suddenly checking himself in his tirade must not be made to suffer like the grownup folks they at least are innocent of it all young lady id do more for the kids than id do for the warand ill do it willingly of my own accord tell me then how much money you got and ill give you the boys suits at cost price ill do more for every five suits you buy from me at cost ill throw an extra one in freejake kaskers own contribution  this offer startled and somewhat dismayed josie she had not expected the interview to take such a turn and kaskers generosity seriously involved her while at the same time it proved to her without a doubt that the man was a man he was loud mouthed and foolish that was all  while she gathered her wits to escape from an unpleasant situation a quick step sounded on the aisle and a man brusquely entered the office and exclaimed  hello jake im here again hows the suspender stock  kasker gave him a surly look  you come pretty often abe kauffman he muttered suspenders bah i only buy em once a year and you come around evry month or so i dont think it pays you to keep pesterin merchants  abe kauffman laugheda big laughand sat down in a chair  one time you buy jake and other times i come to dorfield somebody else buys how do i know you dont get a run on suspenders some time and if i dont visit all my customers whether they buy or not they think i neglect em whos this jake your daughter  he turned his bland smile on josie he was a short thickset man with a german cast of countenance he spoke with a stronger german accent than did kasker though his face persistently smiled his eyes were half closed and shrewd when he looked at her josie gave a little shudder and slightly drew back  ah thats a wrong guess said mr kauffman quickly i must beg your pardon my girl but i meant a compliment to you both accept my card please and he drew it from his pocket and handed it to her with a bow  josie glanced at it  kauffman suspender company chicago abe kauffman president  my business does not interest ladies he went on in a light tone meant to be jovial but with the menahwith the men its a holdup game ha ha hee one of our trade jokes its an elastic business kauffmans suspenders keep their wearers in suspense ha ha pretty good eh  do you ever sell any asked josie curiously  do i do i jake ha ha but not so many now the war has ruined the suspender business like everything else kasker can tell you that miss  kasker wont though asserted jake in a surly tone the girl however was now on another scent  dont you like the war then josie asked the salesman  like it the eyes half opened with a flash who likes war then does humanity which bears the burden for memyselfill say war is a good thing but i wont tell you why or how i profit by it ill only say war is a curse to humanity and if i had the power id stop it tomorrowtodaythis very hour and at that id lose by it  his voice shook with a passion almost uncontrollable he half rose from his chair with clinched fists but suddenly remembering himself or reading the expression on the girls face he sank back again passed his hand over his face and forced another bland unmirthful smile  id hate to be the man who commits his country to war he said in mild regretful tones  but here kasker who had been frowning darkly on the suspender man broke in  see here abe i dont allow that kind of talk in my store he growled  you youre like me you hate the war jake  i did once abe but i dont now i aint got time to hate it its here and i cant help it were in the war and were going ahead to win it cause there aint no hope in backing down stop it why man we cant stop it its like a man who is pushed off a high bank into a river hes got to swim to a landing on the other side or elsesink we americans aint goin to sink abe kauffman well swim over and land safe its got to be so it will be  all right i said didnt i that it wont hurt my pocket but it hurts my heart josie was amazed that he claimed a heart but its funny to hear you talk for the war jake when you always hated it  well ive quit kickin till were out of the woods im an american abe and the american flag is flying in france if our boys cant hold it in the face of the enemy jake kasker will go do it himself  kauffman stood up casting a glance of scorn on his customer  you talk like a fool jake you talk like you was talking for the papersnot honest but as if someone had scared you  yes its the fellows like you that scare me retorted the clothing merchant evry time you curse the war youre keeping us from winning the war as quick as we ought to youre tripping the soldiers the government the presidentthe whole machine ill admit i dont like the war but im for it just the same can you figure that out abe kauffman once i had more sense than you have but now i got a better way of thinking it aint for me to say whether the wars right or not my countrys honor is at stake so ill back my country to the last ditch  kauffman turned away  i guess you dont need any suspenders he said and walked out of the store  kasker gave a sigh of relief and sat down again  now young lady he began well talk about  excuse me said josie hastily im going now but ill be back i want to see you again mr kasker  she ran down the aisle to the door looked up and down the street and saw the thickset form of the suspender salesman just disappearing around the corner to the south instantly she stepped out josie was an expert in the art of shadowing   chapter xvi mrs charleworth  when mary louise reached home that evening she was surprised to find a note from josie which said  ive decided to change my boarding place for a week or so although i shall miss aunt sallys cooking and a lot of other comforts but this is business if you meet me in the street dont recognize me unless im quite alone weve quarrelled if anyone asks you pretty soon well make up again and be friends of course youll realize im working on our case which grows interesting so keep mum and behave  i wish i knew where shes gone was mary louises anxious comment as she showed the note to granpa jim  dont worry my dear advised the colonel josie possesses the rare faculty of being able to take care of herself under all circumstances had she not been so peculiarly trained by her detective father i would feel it a duty to search for her but she is not like other girls and wouldnt thank us for interfering im sure  i cant see the necessity of her being so mysterious about it declared the girl josie ought to know im worthy of her confidence and she said just the other day that were partners  you must be the silent partner then said her grandfather smiling at her vexed expression josie is also worthy of confidence she may blunder but if so shell blunder cleverly i advise you to be patient with her  well ill try granpa when we see her again she will probably know something important said mary louise resignedly  as for little redheaded josie ogorman she walked into the office of the mansion house that afternoon lugging a battered suitcase borrowed from aunt sally and asked the clerk at the desk for weekly rates for room and board the clerk spoke to mr boyle the proprietor who examined the girl critically  where are you from he asked  new york answered josie im a newspaper woman but the war cost me my job because the papers are all obliged to cut down their forces so i came here to get work  the war affects dorfield too and weve only two papers said the man but your business isnt my business in any event i suppose you can pay in advance  for a week anyhow she returned perhaps two weeks if the papers cant use me ill try for some other work  know anybody here  i know colonel hathaway but im not on good terms with his granddaughter mary louise we had a fight over the war give me a quiet room not too high up this place looks like a firetrap  as she spoke she signed her name on the register and opened her purse  boyle looked over his keyboard  give me 47 if you can said josie carelessly she had swiftly run her eye over the hotel register fortyseven is always my lucky number  its taken said the clerk  well 43 is the next best asserted josie i made fortythree dollars the last week i was in new york is 43 taken also  no said boyle but i can do better by you fortythree is a small room and has only one window  just the thing declared josie i hate big rooms  he assigned her to room 43 and after she had paid a week in advance a bellboy showed her to the tiny apartment and carried her suitcase  number 45ll be vacant in a day or two remarked the boy as he unlocked her door kauffman has it now but he wont stay long hes a suspender drummer and comes about every monthsometimes oftenerand always has 45 when he goes ill let you know so you can speak for it fortyfive is one of our best rooms  thank you said josie and tipped him a quarter  as she opened her suitcase and settled herself in the room she reflected on the meeting in kaskers store which had led her to make this queer move  a fool for luck they say she muttered i wonder what intuition induced me to interview jake kasker the clothing merchant isnt a bad fellow she continued to herself looking over the notes she had made on her tablets he didnt make a single disloyal speech hates the war and i cant blame him for that but wants to fight it to a finish now the other mankauffmanhates the war too but he did not make any remark that was especially objectionable but that mans face betrayed more than his words and some of his words puzzled me kauffman said at two different times that the war would make him money theres only one way a man like him can make money out of the war and that isby serving the kaiser i suppose he thought we wouldnt catch that idea or hed been more careful what he said all criminals are reckless in little ways thats how they betray themselves and give us a chance to catch them however i havent caught this fellow yet and hes tricky enough to give me a long chase unless i act boldly and get my evidence before he suspects im on his trail that must be my programmeto act quickly and lose no time  kauffman saw her when she entered the hotel dining room for dinner that evening and he walked straight over to her table and sat down opposite her  met again he said with his broad smile you selling something  brains returned josie composedly  good did jake kasker buy any of you  ive all my stock on hand sir im a newspaper womanspecial writer or advertising expert quit new york last week and came on here  wasnt new york good enough for you he asked after ordering his dinner of the waitress  im too independent to suit the metropolitan journals i couldnt endorse their gumshoe policies for instance they wanted me to eulogize president wilson and his cabinet rave over the beauties of the war and denounce any congressman or private individual who dares think for himself explained josie eating her soup the while soim looking for another job  kauffman maintained silence studying the billoffare when he was served he busied himself eating but between the slits of his halfclosed eyes he regarded the girl furtively from time to time his talkative mood had curiously evaporated he was thoughtful only when josie was preparing to leave the table did he resume the conversation  what did you think of jake kaskers kind of patriotism he asked  oh the clothing man i didnt pay much attention never met kasker before you know isnt he like most of the rabble thinking what hes told to think and saying what hes told to say  she waited for a reply but none was forthcoming even this clever lead did not get a rise out of abe kauffman indeed he seemed to suspect a trap for when she rose and walked out of the dining room she noticed that his smile had grown ironical  on reaching her room through the dimly lighted passage josie refrained from turning on her own lights but she threw open her one little window and leaned out the window faced a narrow unlighted alley at the rear of the hotel one window of room 45 next to her opened on an iron fireescape that reached to within a few feet of the ground josie smiled withdrew her head and sat in the dark of her room for hours with a patience possible only through long training  at ten oclock kauffman entered his room she could distinctly hear him moving about a little later he went away walking boldly down the corridor to the elevator  josie rose and slipped on her hat and coat  leaving the hotel kauffman made his way down the street to broadway dorfields main thoroughfare he wore a soft hat and carried a cane the few people he passed paid no attention to him steadily proceeding he left the business district and after a while turned abruptly to the right  this was one of the principal residence sections of the city kauffman turned the various corners with a confidence that denoted his perfect acquaintance with the route but presently his pace slowed and he came to a halt opposite an imposing mansion set far back in ample grounds beautifully cared for and filled with rare shrubbery  only for a moment however did the man hesitatejust long enough to cast a glance up and down the deserted street which was fairly well lighted no one being in sight he stepped from the sidewalk to the lawn and keeping the grass under his feet noiselessly made his way through the shrubbery to the south side of the residence here a conservatory formed a wing which jutted into the grounds  the german softly approached mounted the three steps leading to a glass door and rapped upon the sash in a peculiar manner almost immediately the door was opened by a woman who beckoned him in the conservatory was unlighted save by a mellow drift that filtered through the plants from a doorway beyond leading to the main house  from behind the concealment of a thick bush josie ogorman had noted the womans form but was unable to see her face the girl happened to know the house however it was the residence of dorfields social leader mrs charleworth  josie squatted behind that bush for nearly half an hour then the glass door opened and kauffman stepped out  by the way he said in a low voice its just as well we didnt take kasker in with us hes a loudmouthed fool ive tested him and find he blats out everything he knows  we do not need him since ive decided to finance the affair returned the woman and josie recognized her voice it was the great mrs charleworth herself mrs charleworth in secret conference with abe kauffman the suspender salesman  then josie experienced another surprise a second man stepped through the shadowy doorway joining kauffman on the steps  it seems to me said this last person that there is danger in numbers of course thats your affair kauffman and none of my business but if im to help you pull it off id rather there wouldnt be too many of us its a ticklish thing at the best and  shut up growled kauffman suspiciously peering around him into the darkness the less we talk in the open the better  that is true good night said the woman and went in closing the door behind her  i think i will light a cigar said kauffman  wait until you are in the street cautioned the other  they walked on the grass avoiding the paths and keeping in the darkest places finally they emerged upon the sidewalk and finding the coast clear traveled on side by side  at times they conversed in low tones so low that the little redheaded girl dodging through the parkings in their wake could not overhear the words they spoke but as they approached the more frequented part of the town they separated kauffman turning into broadway and the other continuing along a side street  josie ogorman followed the latter person he was tall and thin and stooped a trifle she had been unable so far to see his face he seemed from the turnings he made to be skirting the business section rather than pass directly through it so the girl took a chance darted down one street and around the corner of another and then slipped into a dim doorway near which hung an electric streetlight  she listened eagerly and soon was rewarded by a sound of footsteps the man she was shadowing leisurely approached passed under the light and continued on his way failing to note the motionless form of the girl in the doorway  josie gave a little laugh  youre a puzzling proposition professor she whispered to herself and you came near fooling me very properly for i imagined you were on your way to washington and here youve mixed up with another important job   chapter xvii the black satchel  when josie reached the hotel it was nearly midnight half the lights in the office had been extinguished and behind the desk reading a novel the night clerk sprawled in an easy chair  she hadnt seen the night clerk before he was a sallowfaced boy scarcely twenty years old attired in a very striking suit of clothes and wearing a gorgeous jewelled scarfpin in his cravat as he read he smoked a cigarette  hello said this brilliant individual as josie leaned over the counter and regarded him with a faint smile youre no 43 i guess and its lucky old boyle aint here to read you a lectureor to turn you out he wont stand for unmarried lady guests bein out till this hour an you may as well know it first as last  hes quite right was josies calm reply ill not do it again my key please  he rose reluctantly and gave her the key  do you sit up all night she asked sweetly  im sposed to he answered in a tone less gruff but towards mornin i snooze a little only way to pass the time with nothn to do an nobody to talk to its a beastly job at the best an im goin to quit it  why dont you start a hotel of your own she suggested  you think youre kiddin me dont you but i might even do that if i wanted to he asserted glaring at her as if he challenged contradiction it aint money that stops me but hotel keepin is a dogs life ive made a bid for a cigarstore down the street an if they take me up somebody can have this job  i see youre ambitious said josie well i hope you get the cigarstore good night mr  my names tom linnet i wont tell the ol boy you was out so late so long  the elevator had stopped running so josie climbed the stairs and went thoughtfully to her room kauffman had preceded her she heard him drop his shoes heavily upon the floor as he undressed  she turned on the light and made some notes on her tablets using the same queer characters that she always employed the last note read tom linnet night clerk at the mansion house new clothes new jewelry has money recently acquired for no one with money would be a night clerk wants to quit his job and buy a cigar store query who staked tom and why  as she crawled into bed josie reflected mary louise would be astonished if she knew what i have learned tonight but then im astonished myself i feel like the boy who went fishing for sunfish and caught a whale  next morning she was up early alert to continue her investigations when she heard mr kauffman go down to breakfast she took a bunch of passkeys from her bag went boldly through the hall to the door of 45 unlocked it with ease and walked in a hurried glance showed her a large suitcase lying open upon a table she examined its contents one side was filled with samples of suspenders the other with miscellaneous articles of male apparel  josie was not satisfied she peered under the bed softly opened all the drawers in the dresser and finally entered the closet here on the rear shelf a newspaper was placed in such manner as to hide from observation anything behind it to an ordinary person glancing toward it the newspaper meant nothing to josies practised eye it was plainly a shield being short of stature the girl had to drag in a chair in order to reach the high shelf she removed the newspaper took down a black handsatchelit was dreadfully heavy and she almost dropped itand then replaced the paper as it had been before  josie was jubilant she removed the chair again closed the closet door and leaving the room practically as she had found it stole back to her own apartment the heavy satchel concealed in the folds of her frock but no one saw her the hall being vacant and she breathed a sigh of relief as she locked her own door against possible intruders  then she placed the black satchel on a stand and bent over it the lock was an unusual one she tried all the slender keys upon her bunch without effectthey were either too large or did not fit the keyhole next she took a thin hairpin bent and twisted it this way and that and tried to pry the lock open failure however she was beginning to understand the mechanism of the lock by this time from that allcontaining handbag which was her inseparable companion she drew out a file and taking one of the masterkeys began to file it to fit the lock of the black satchel  this operation consumed more time than she was aware so interesting was the intricate work she was presently startled by a sound in the corridor mr kauffman was coming back to his room whistling an aria from die walkure josie paused motionless her heart almost stopped beating  the man unlocked his door and entered still whistling sometimes the whistle was soft and low again it was louder and more cheerful josie listened in suspense as long as the whistling continued she realized that the theft of the black satchel remained undiscovered  kauffman remained in his room but a few moments when he departed carefully locking his door after him he was still whistling josie ran to her own door and when he had passed it opened it just a crack to enable her to gaze after him underneath his arm he carried a bundle of the sample suspenders  good she whispered softly retreating to bend over the satchel again mr abe kauffman will sell suspenders this morning as a blind to his more important industries so i neednt hurry  sooner than she expected the lock clicked and sprang open her eyes at first fell upon some crumpled soiled shirts but these she hurriedly removed the remainder of the satchel contained something enclosed in a green flannel bag it was heavy as she found when she tried to lift it out and a sudden suspicion led her to handle the thing very gingerly she put it on the table beside the satchel and cautiously untied the drawstring at the mouth of the bag a moment later she had uncovered a round ball of polished blue steel to which was attached a tube covered with woven white cotton  josie fell back on a chair fairly gasping and stared with big eyes at the ball in her desire to investigate the possessions of the suspender salesman she had scarcely expected to find anything like this the most she had hoped to discover were incriminating papers  its a bomb she stammered regarding the thing fearfully a real honestfortrue bomb and it is meant to carry death and destruction to loyal supporters of our government theres no doubt of that but the thoughts that followed so amazing an assertion were too bewildering to be readily classified they involved a long string of conjectures implicating in their wide ramifications several persons of important standing in the community the mere suggestion of what she had uncovered sufficed to fill josies heart and brain with terror  here i mustnt try to think it out just yet she told herself trying with a little shiver of repulsion for the thing to collect her wits one idea at a time josie my girl or youll go nutty and spoil everything now heres a bomba live deathdealing bomband thats the first and only thing to be considered at present  controlling her aversion and fear the girl turned the bomb over and over giving it a thorough examination she had never seen such a thing before but they had often been explained to her and she had an inkling as to the general method of their construction this one before her was of beautiful workmanship its surface as carefully turned and polished as if it had been intended for public exhibition grooves had been cut in the outer surface and within these grooves lay the coils of the time fuse which was marked with black ink into regular sections the first section from the end of the fuse was marked 6 the next section 5 and so on down to the section nearest the bomb which was divided by the marks 11214  i see said josie nodding her head with intelligent perception each section when lighted will burn for one hour running along its groove but harmless until the end of the fuse is reached if the entire fuse is lighted it will require just six hours to explode the bomb while if it is cut off to the last mark and then lighted the bomb will explode in fifteen minutes the operator can set it to suit himself as circumstances require  the manner in which the fuse was attached to the bomb was simple the hole made in the bomb was exactly the size of the fuse inserted into it there were two little knobs one on each side the hole after pushing the fuse into the hole a fine wire was wound around it and attached to the tiny knobs thus holding it firmly in place  josie took a pair of small pincers unwound the wire and cautiously withdrew the fuse from the hole examining the end of the fuse she saw it was filled with a powdery substance which when ignited would explode the bomb she had recourse to her hairpin again and carefully picked the powder out of the fuse for the distance of the entire first section this proved difficult and painstaking work but when completed not a grain of the powder remained in the woven cotton casing for the distance of six inches from the end  having accomplished that much josie sat looking at the thing in a speculative way she could not have told you at the moment why her first act had been to render the bomb impotent in so queer a manner when she could have simply destroyed the entire fuse but of course no one would try to use the fiendish contrivance unless it was supplied with a fuse  after a period of thought the girl decided what to do next she removed the bomb fuse green bageven the satchelto the big lower drawer of her bureau and turned the lock  no one is likely to come in but the chambermaid and she will be too busy to disturb anything josie decided and then she locked her room door and went down stairs to breakfast   chapter xviii a hint feom annie boyle  josie was late in the breakfast room she found but one guest besides herself an old lady with a putty face but there was also a young girl seated at a nearby table who was grumbling and complaining to the maid who waited upon her  it aint my fault miss annie protested the maid the cook says you ordered your breakfast half an hour ago an then went away we tried to keep it hot for you and if its cold its your own fault  i was talking with mr kauffman pouted the girl who seemed a mere child ive a good notion to order another breakfast  if you do cook will tell your father  this threat seemed effective the girl with a sour face began eating and the maid came over to take josies order the tables were near enough for conversation so when the maid had gone to the kitchen josie said sweetly  that mr kauffmans a nice man isnt he i dont wonder you forgot your breakfast isnt this miss annie boyle  yes was the answer do you know abe kauffman  ive met him said josie  he an pa used to be good friends said annie boyle who did not seem at all shy in conversing with strangers but pas soured on him lately i dont know why praps because abe is a german an everybodys tryin to fling mud at the germans but abe says the germanamericans are the backbone of this country and as good citizens as any  he dont seem to like the war though remarked josie carelessly  well do you know why abes had two brothers and five cousins in the german army and all of ems been killed thats why hes sore on the war says his brothers deserved what they got for not comin to america an bein american citizens like abe is but i know hes dreadful sorry bout their bein killed just the same german folks seem to think a good deal of their families an so jest to mention the war makes abe rave an swear  thats foolish said josie hell get himself into trouble  abes no fool he knows how far he can go an when to stop talkin hell cuss the war but you never hear him cussn the united states he told me just a while ago that the warll make him rich cause hes smart enough to use it for his own good but he said i mustnt talk about that she added with a sudden realization that josie was regarding her curiously abe an mes chums an what he says is between us praps he was only jokin bout gettin rich abes a great joker anyhow  that this was a rather lame retraction was apparent even to annie boyle she gave josie a suspicious look but josies face was absolutely expressionless the maid was placing her order before her and she calmly began her breakfast a moment later the old lady rose and tottered out of the room  gee i wish i had her money remarked annie boyle looking after her shes got a wad of stocks an just has to cut coupons off em lives here easy an dont worry if i had her dough id she stopped suddenly  moneys a good thing to have said josie theres tom linnet now hes going to buy a cigar store  howd you know asked annie quickly  why he told me  oh are you an tom friends  were not enemies toms in luck to have so much money  wall said annie hes a fool to flash it all of a sudden pa took him for night clerk when he didnt have a centand it wasnt so long ago either he gets his board an five dollars a week folks are goin to wonder where he got all his fine clothes an them dimonds an how he can afford to buy barkers cigar store i asked abe about it an abe says he guesses tom got the money from an aunt that jus died  perhaps he did  well whered he get the aunt toms got two brothers that are peddlers an a father whos a trackwalker an hes got a mother what takes in washin if theres an aunt shes some relation to the rest of the family so why didnt she leave them some money as well as tom  i dont know but im glad tom is so well fixed answered josie rather absently for her eye had fallen on the menu card beside her plate and the menu card had somehow conveyed a new thought to her mind she picked it up and examined it critically part of it was printed in a queer openfaced typeall capitalswhile the balance of the list of dishes had been written in with pen and ink these printed bills would do for a good many breakfasts for they mentioned only the staples while the supplementary dishes were day by day added in writing  i wonder who prints your billsoffare she said to annie boyle  why do you wonder that demanded annie  i like the type and i want to get some cards printed from it  we print our own bills said the child theres a press an type an the fixings in a room in the basement an tom linnet used to print a new card every day for all the three meals he did it at night you know between two an six oclock when nobodys ever around the hotel they was swell billsoffare but tom claimed he couldnt do so much printin although thats part o the night clerks duty an pa thought it used up too much good cardboard at wartime prices so now we jus get out a new bill once a week an write the extry dishes on it  that does very well said josie does tom still do the printing  yes pa hired him as night clerk cause hed worked in a printin office an could do printin but since tom got rich he dont like to work an the bills aint printed as good as they used to be  this looks pretty good to me said josie eyeing it approvingly  i guess if tom wasnt goin to leave pa would fire him asserted annie rising from the table good mornin miss ill see you again if youre stoppin here  after she had gone josie finished her breakfast thoughtfully three distinct facts she had gleaned from annie boyles careless remarks first tom linnet had acquired sudden riches second the type used on the hotel menu cards was identically the same that the disloyal circulars had been printed from third between the hours of two and five in the mornings the night clerks duties permitted him to be absent from the hotel office  josie decided that annie boyle had not been admitted to the inner confidences of the conspirators and that tom linnet was their tool and had been richly paid for whatever services he had performed she was now gathering clues so fast that it made her head swim that chance meeting with kauffman at kaskers she told herself led me directly into the nest of traitors im in luck not that im especially clever but because theyre so astonishingly reckless thats usually the way with criminals they close every loophole but the easiest one to peep throughand then imagine theyre safe from discovery   chapter xix the printing office  after breakfast josie sallied out upon the street and found a hardware store there after some exploration she purchased an asbestos tablemat with this she returned to her room and locked herself in  the chambermaid had been and gone but josies drawer was still locked and its precious contents intact the girl scraped the surface of the tablemat with her penknife until she had secured enough loose fibre to serve her purpose and then she proceeded to restuff the fuse with the asbestos fibre the entire length of the section from which she had removed the powder then she pushed the end of the fuse into the hole in the bomb wired it as before and replaced the long fuse in its grooves  now said josie surveying her work with satisfaction if they light that fuse and expect it to explode the bomb in an hour or more theyll be badly fooled also i shall have prevented another catastrophe like the explosion at the airplane factory  she replaced the bomb in its bag placed the bag in the black satchel tucked in the soiled shirts to cover it and with her improvised key managed to relock the satchel watching for a time when the corridor was vacant she went to 45 entered the room and replaced the satchel on its shelf taking care to arrange the newspaper before it as a mask  she had taken the chair from the closet and was about to leave the room when she heard footsteps coming down the hallway accompanied by a whistle which she promptly recognized  caught she exclaimed and gave a hurried glance around her to hide within the room was impossible but the window was open and the iron fireescape within easy reach in an instant she had mounted it and seizing the rounds of the iron ladder climbed upward until she had nearly reached the next window directly above on the third floor then she paused clinging to get her breath  kauffman was annoyed to find the door of his room unlocked he paused a moment in the middle of the room and looked around him confound that chambermaid josie heard him mutter and then he opened the closet door and looked in apparently reassured he approached the open window stuck out his head and looked down the fireescape josies heart gave a bound but kauffman didnt look upward he drew in his head resumed his whistling and busied himself repacking the sample suspenders in his suitcase  josie hoped he would soon go out again but he seemed to have no intention of doing so so she climbed her ladder until she could look into the window above which was also open the old lady she had seen at breakfast was lying upon the bed her eyes closed josie wondered if she was asleep the door leading from the room to the hallway also stood open the weather was warm and the old lady evidently wanted plenty of air  while josie hesitated what to do a boy came up the alley noticed her on the fireescape and paused to look at her in astonishment the girl couldnt blame him for being interested for her attitude was certainly extraordinary others were likely to discover her too and might suspect her of burglary and raise a hue and cry so she deliberately entered the room tiptoed across to the hall and escaped without arousing the old lady but it was a desperate chance and she breathed easier when she had found the stairs and descended to her own floor safe in her own room she gave a little laugh at her recent predicament and then sat down to note her latest discoveries on her tablets  josie ogorman was very particular in this regard details seemingly of trifling moment but which may prove important are likely to escape ones memory her habit was to note every point of progress in a case and often review every point from the beginning fitting them into their proper places and giving each its due importance a digest of such information enabled her to proceed to the next logical step in her investigation  these items all dovetail very nicely she decided with a satisfied nod at the quaint characters on the tabletswhich all the world might read and be no wiser i must however satisfy myself that tom linnet actually printed those circulars the evidence at hand indicates that he did but i want positive proof also id like to know which one of the gang employed himand paid him so liberally however that suggestion opens up a new line of conjecture i dont believe tom linnet got all his wealth merely for printing a few circulars helping to address them and keeping his mouth shut butwhat else has he been paid for  she brooded on this for a while and then determined to take one thing at a time and follow it to a conclusion so she once more quitted her room and descended by the elevatoropenly this timeto the office it was now noon and the hotel office was filled with guests and the clerks and bellboys were all busily occupied josie wandered carelessly around until she found the stairway leading to the basement watching her opportunity she slipped down the stairs  the basement was not as barren as she expected to find it there was an open central space on one side of which were rooms for the barber shop baths and a pool room all more or less occupied by guests and attendants on the opposite side at the rear were baggage and storerooms just beside her she noted a bootblacks stand where a colored boy listlessly waited for customers  shine miss he inquired  no said josie in a businesslike tone im looking for the printing office  secon door miss indicating it with a gesture but dey aint nobody dere de rooms mosly kep locked  i know said josie and advancing to the door drew out her keys  her very boldness disarmed suspicion the boy was not sufficiently interested to watch her for a man came out of the barbershop and seated himself in the bootblacks chair  this sort of lock didnt phase josie at all at the second trial she opened the door walked in and closed the door behind her  it was a small room dimly lighted and very disorderly scraps of paper were strewn around the floor dust had settled on the inkrollers of the footpress a single case of type stood on a rack and the form of a billoffarepartly piedwas on a marble slab which formed the top of a small table on an upturned soapbox was a pile of unprinted menu cards josie noted a few cans of ink a bottle of benzine and a few printing tools lying carelessly about but the room contained nothing more  having sized up tom linnets printing room with one swift glance the girl stooped down and began searching among the scraps that littered the floor they were mostly torn bits of cardboard or crumpled papers on which trial impressions had been made  josie expected momentarily to be interrupted so she conducted her search as rapidly as was consistent with thoroughness she paid no attention to the card scraps but all papers she smoothed out one by one finally with a little cry of triumph she thrust one of these into her handbag she made this discovery just back of the press and glancing up she noted a hook that had formerly been hidden from her view on which were impaled a number of papersthe chefs copy from which various bills had been printed running through these papers she suddenly paused pulled one away from the hook and tucked it into her bag  she was fairly satisfied now but still continued her search amongst the litter it was not easy to decipher writing or printing in that dim light but her eyes were good and the longer she remained in the room the more distinctly she saw there was an electric globe suspended over the press but she dared not turn on the light for fear of attracting attention several scraps on which writing appeared she secured without trying to read them but presently she decided she had made as thorough an examination of the place as was necessary  she left the room locked the door again and boldly mounted the stairs to the office meeting and passing several men who scarcely noticed her then she took the elevator to her room and washed her grimy hands and prepared for luncheon  at the table she slipped another of the printed bills into her bag to use for comparison and afterward ate her lunch as calmly as if she were not inwardly elated at the success of her mornings work josie felt indeed that she had secured the proof necessary to confound the traitors and bring them to the bar of justice but there might be other interesting developments her trap was still set theres no hurry she told herself lets see this thing throughto the end  indeed on reflection she realized that several threads of evidence had not yet been followed to their source some points of mystification still remained to be cleared up her facts were mingled with theories and she had been taught that theories are mighty uncertain things  on leaving the dining room josie got on her hat and jacket went out to the street and caught an oak avenue car  oh josie cried a wellknown voice and there sat mary louise on her way home from the shop  josie gave her a haughty look walked straight to the far end of the car and sat down in a vacant seat the car was half filled with passengers  mary louise pushed forward and sat beside her friend josie stared straight ahead stolidly  no one here knows you whispered mary louise wont you speak to me josie  no reply  where are you stopping what are you doing how are you getting along on the case pleaded mary louise so softly that no one else could overhear  josie maintained silence her features were expressionless  i know you told me in case we met not to recognize you continued mary louise but im so anxious for news dear cant you come home tonight and have a good talk with me you owe me that much consideration josie  the car stopped at a street intersection josie stood up  not tonight she replied and alighted from the car just as it started to move again  bother mary louise she muttered she has made me walk three whole blocks  mary louise was human and she was provoked there was really no need for josie ogorman to be so absurdly mysterious had she not known her so well mary louise would have felt that josie had deliberately insulted her as it was she blamed her friend for inexcusable affectation im not sure she reflected that a girl can be a detectivea regular detectivewithout spoiling her disposition or losing to some an extent her maidenly modesty of course josie has been brought up in an atmosphere of mystery and cant be blamed for her peculiarities butim glad im not a detectives daughter  josie however wasnt worrying over any resentment her friend might feel at the necessary snub she was on a keen scent and already had forgotten her meeting with mary louise three blocks farther on she turned into the walk leading to an old but picturesque residence at one time a show place of dorfield and the pride of the dudleymarkhams but now overshadowed by modern and more imposing mansions  josie rang the doorbell and presently the door was opened by a young and rather untidy maid  id like to see professor dyer said josie  hes gone to washington was the reply  indeed are you quite sure  yes said the maid and then mrs dyers head appeared in the opening and she gave josie a curious if comprehensive examination then  if youre from one of the schools im sorry to tell you that professor dyer went to washington by the early train this morning i dont know how soon he will be back professor harrington of the high school is in charge but perhaps it is something i can do  no thank you i can wait said josie and went away  so she said to herself as she made her way back to town in a street car if dyer has really gone to washington he hopes to get possession of the old desk and its hidden papers pretty important to him those papers are and i wouldnt blame him for chasing them up buthas he really gone mrs dyer thinks so but all evidence points to the fact that shes not in her husbands confidence now if dyer is on his way to washington what did last nights secret meeting mean his absence will complicate matters i fear anyhow i must revise my conclusions a bit   chapter xx one girls wits  as she entered the hotel josie encountered joe langley the onearmed soldier back from the war she had taken a great interest in this young fellow and admired his simple manly nature having had several interesting conversations with him at the liberty girls shop and at the drills josie felt she needed an ally at this juncture and here was one who could be trusted  joe she said earnestly drawing him aside are you going to be busy this evening  yes miss ogorman im busy every evening now he replied ive taken a job you know and my loafing days and social stunts are over there wasnt any breadanbutter in telling the society dames about my war experiences so i had to go to work im night watchman at the steel works and go on duty at seven oclock  josie was disappointed looking at him musingly she asked  are they making munitions now at the steel works  of course its practically under government control they say but is still operated by the old company they make shells for the big guns you know and theyve ten carloads on hand just now ready to be shipped tomorrow  josie drew a long breath this was real news and her active mind jumped to a quick conclusion  are the shells loaded joe she inquired  all ready for war replied the soldier you see a night watchman in such a place has an important position i guard those shells by night and another man does nothing but guard them by day  where are they stored was josies next question  in the room just back of mr coltons officethe big main building  so mr colton is still the head of the company  hes vicepresident and general manager and he knows the steel and ammunition business from a to z asserted joe langley mr colton represents the government as well as the steel works the president is mr jaswell the banker but he doesnt do anything but attend the board meetings  joe said josie impressively you know who i am dont you  why youre one of the liberty girls i guess  im from washington she said my father john ogorman is one of the governments secret service officers im working on a case here in the interests of our government and i may want you to help me foil a german spy plot  count on me said sergeant joe emphatically and then he added id like to make sure though that youre really what you claim to be  josie opened her hand bag and from a side pocket drew a silver badge engraved u s secret service no l2o1 that was her fathers number and a complimentary badge but joe was satisfied he had to glance inside the handbag to see it for the girl dared not exhibit it more openly  if you want to know more about me ask colonel hathaway continued josie  no said joe i believe youre on the square but id never have suspected it of you tell me what im to do  nothing at present but should a crisis arrive stand by me and obey my instructions  ill do that promised the man  when the girl had regained her room in the hotel she sat down with a businesslike air and wrote upon a sheet of paper in her peculiar cypher the story of her discoveries and the conclusions they justified up to the present hour this was to fix all facts firmly in her mind and to enable her to judge their merits the story was concise enough and perhaps josie was quite unaware how much she had drawn upon her imagination it read this way  disloyal circulars have been issued from time to time in dorfield designed to interfere with sales of liberty bonds to cause resentment at conscription and to arouse antipathy for our stalwart allies the english these circulars were written by john dyer superintendent of schools who poses as a patriot the circulars were printed in the basement of the mansion house by tom linnet a night clerk who was well paid for his work papers found secreted in an old desk from the attic of dyers house prove that dyer is in the pay of german agents in this country and has received fabulous sums for his services said services not being specified in the documents in addition to these payments there were found in the desk notes of the imperial german government for large amounts such notes to be paid after the war  dyer is clearly the head of the german spy plot in dorfield but the person who acts as medium between dyer and the master spy is an alleged suspender salesman calling himself abe kauffman this kauffman makes frequent trips to dorfield giving orders to dyer and on one occasion kauffman who stops at the mansion house while in town hired tom linnet to place a bomb in the airplane factory causing an explosion which destroyed many government airplanes and killed several employees the sum paid linnet for this dastardly act has made him rich and he has bought or is about to buy a cigar store kauffman now has another bomb in his possession doubtless brought here to be placed when opportunity arrives to do the most possible damage indications are that he may attempt to blow up the steel works where a large amount of shells are now completed and ready for shipment tomorrowmeaning that the job must be done tonight if at all perhaps linnet will place the bomb perhaps kauffman will do it himself dyer has lost his incriminating papers and notes and is on his way to washington in an endeavor to recover them  associated with dyer in his horrible activities is mrs augusta charleworth occupying a high social position but of german birth and therefore a german sympathizer she is clever and her brains supplement those of dyer who seems more shrewd than initiative being content to execute the orders of others dyer was educated at heidelburg in germany which accounts perhaps for his being progerman although i suspect he is proanything that will pay him money  dyer and the hon andrew duncan while political pals are not connected in this spy plot but i suspect that peter boyle the proprietor of the mansion house may be one of the gang ive no evidence yet that implicates boyle but he harbors kauffman as a guest and ought to know that his night clerk is printing traitorous propaganda so far the evidence incriminates kauffman mrs charleworth dyer and tom linnet i believe mrs dyer to be innocent of any knowledge of her husbands crimes otherwise she would never have parted with that important deskthe desk that will prove his ruin and ought to cost him his life  my plan is this concluded the notation to catch kauffman or linnet in the act of placing the bomb tonight make the arrest round up the other guilty ones and jail them and then turn the case over to the federal officers for prosecution a telegram to washington will secure professor dyers arrest on his arrival there  josie read this through twice and nodded her red head with intense satisfaction  all clear as crystal she asserted gleefully i have proof of every statement and the finale cant go very wrong with such knowledge in my possession tonight unless all signs fail will prove a warm night warm enough to scorch these dreadful murderous tools of the kaiser  and now josie skipped over to the police station and had a somewhat lengthy conference with chief farnum who knew her father and treated the girl detective with professional consideration after this she hunted up the two government agentsold jim crissey and young norman addisonwho knew her well as john ogormans clever kid the pride of her doting daddy they listened to her with interest and genuine respect for her talent and not only promised their assistance whenever it might be needed but congratulated her warmly on her good work  this concluded josies afternoon labors and it was with a sense of triumphant elation that she returned to her hotel to rest and prepare for the expected crisis   chapter xxi surprises  josie went to dinner as soon as the dining room opened when she came out she met abe kauffman going in he stopped and spoke to her  sell any brains yet in a jocular way  not today she replied with her innocent babylike stare  well i didnt sell any suspenders either there are no spenders for suspenders ha ha ha  that doesnt seem to worry you much asserted josie pointedly  he gave a shrug  well tomorrow morning i leave by the 530 train east so if i dont see you any more i hope the brains will find a market  thank you  she went on glad to escape the man he told me about leaving on the 530 and is probably giving everyone else the same information so he cant be connected with the explosion she reflected clever mr kauffman but not clever enough to realize he is near the end of his infamous career  josies plans perfected during that afternoon primarily involved the shadowing of abe kauffman every moment from now on abe kauffman and his black satchel for it grew dark early at this time of year and already the brief twilight was fading so the girl hastened to her room and exchanged her gray walking suit for a darker one that was inconspicuous and allowed free movement then she slipped her little pearlmounted revolverher fathers giftinto her handbag and decided she was ready for any emergency  having extinguished the light in her room she glanced from the window into the alley below where the shadows were now gathering deeply  i think kauffman will go down the fireescape and drop into the alley she mused but he must first come to his room for the black satchel in any event and from that instant i must never lose sight of him  suddenly she discovered a form pacing slowly up and down the otherwise deserted alley fearful that other detectives were on the watch and might disrupt her plans she strained her eyes to discover this persons identity there was but one light to relieve the gloom and that was far down the alley a spot the prowler for some time avoided finally however he came to a point where the light touched his face and josie instantly recognized tom linnet  he is waiting for someone she decided and kauffman is still at dinnerkilling time because its yet too early to undertake his nefarious task tom linnet may be the tool he has selected and i ought to get in touch with the boy somehow before he meets the arch conspirator kauffman is the one i prefer to land  with this in mind she hurried down passed out at the front office doorway and turned into a narrow drive at the south of the hotel which led to the rear alley a great business block now dark and deserted loomed on the other side of the driveway which was used by the baggage and supply wagons in the daytime  when the girl reached the corner of the alley she found herself in very deep shadow so she ventured to protrude her head far enough to look after tom linnet to her surprise the party he had been waiting for had already joined him for she discovered two dusky forms pacing the alley  it could not be kauffman while she hesitated whether to steal closer or maintain her position the two advanced almost to her corner and paused therein the blackest spot they could find  i tell you i wont do it said tom in a hard dogged tone that was tense with excitement im through and thats all there is to it  thats a mistaken notion was the quiet reply youre too deep in the plot to draw back and the pay is well worth while  i dont want any more money growled tom  youll get two thousand for this nights work cash and there is no risk you know that  risk god man cant you guess how i dream of those poor devils i sent to their death in the airplane job i hate the money i got ii  see here said the other voice impatiently that was a mistake and you know it we didnt intend murder but the explosion was delayed no one will get hurt tonight  not through me declared tom  if you fail us youll come to grief  if i come to grief so will you peach on me and ill blow the whole deal there was a moments silence  would three thousand satisfy you demanded the tempter  no asserted tom stoutly im goin to quit whats done cant be undone but im through with you itits too blamed terrible thats what it is leave me alone an let me turn honest why dont you do the job yourself  i think i will said the other calmly if you intend to turn down a good thing ill do my own work and save the money but remember linnet silence is your only salvation dont talk at all if you do youre liable to say the wrong thingand you cant afford to do that  im no fool responded the night clerk a shade of relief in his tone but dont come to me again professor im done with you  professor josie felt a distinct shock she had to flatten herself against the wall too and remain rigid for the man abruptly turned the corner and marched down the driveway half way to the brilliantly lighted street he dodged behind the building opposite the hotel threading his way through narrow back yards josie followed swift and silent finally they reached a place where the man was forced to pass beneath the rays of a lamp and josie was near enough to see his face it was in reality professor john dyer  that assurance was all the girl wanted just now she let him go his way and turned to regain the hotel it was not quite eight oclock yet she felt it important to keep an eye on kauffman and the bomb the bomb especially for until dyer took possession of the infernal contrivance he could do no mischief  in the hotel lobby she entered a public telephone booth and called up jim crissey then she went straight to her room she could hear a low whistling in 45 which informed her that kauffman had not yet gone out and that he was in a cheerful mood  im beginning to understand their method of work josie reflected kauffman prepares the bombs or brings them here under the guise of a suspender salesman dyer arranges for their being placed having secured information as to where an explosion will do the most damage to the government and tom linnet is used as the tool to do the actual work mrs charleworth probably assists dyer in getting special information and advises the gang but doesnt take an active part in the perpetration of the crimes her brains and position would naturally place her at the head of the conspirators in dorfield although im pretty sure kauffman as the agent of the master spy can dictate what they must do  kauffman slammed his door and locked it he was going out josie opened her own door a crack to look after him he was walking deliberately down the corridor openly carrying in his left hand the black satchel  to josie this seemed the essence of effrontery he had no intention of using the fireescape after all he trusted in bravado as so many careless criminals do as she stealthily followed him she observed the man stop in the office and exchange commonplaces with one or two guests whom he knew  in reality this was his safest plan the black bag did not look suspicious presently the bomb would be turned over to dyer and kauffmans responsibility would then end his very boldness was calculated to prevent suspicion  leaving the hotel kauffman walked leisurely up the lighted street only when he turned a corner did josie momentarily lose sight of him there were many pedestrians at this hour and they masked the girls form and for a while enabled her to keep near to the man she was shadowing the only thing that puzzled josie was the fact that kauffman was proceeding in a direction exactly opposite that taken by dyer a short time before dyer went south and kauffman was going north  when the business section of dorfield was passed the streets became more deserted they were not well lighted either which favored josie the more  kauffman kept steadily on and as the houses along the way thinned josie decided he was headed directly for the steel works that upset her calculations a bit for she knew he had not seen dyer since the latters interview with tom linnet nor had he seen linnet therefore he could not know that any arrangements he had previously made with them had fallen through the germans present actions however indicated that he had decided to place the bomb himself without the assistance of his fellow conspirators had he been warned of linnets defection had he means of communicating with dyer unknown to josie dyer was a mystery even his wife believed he was now on his way to washington  surprises in josies line of work were not uncommon and this was no time to consider whys and wherefores the one thing she was sure of was that the bomb was in the black satchel and the black satchel in kauffmans hand no matter where the other conspirators might be or how they were implicated in tonights plot as long as she kept her eye on the bomb she would be able to control the situation   chapter xxii a slight mistake  from the edge of the town to the steel works the road led through a common overgrown with brush and weeds there was no moon and although the distance was not great it was a lonely dark and creepy place as soon as the girl saw kauffman take the road to the works she decided to get there before he could do so knowing well she could not be seen she branched off through the brush and finding her way by instinct rather than sight ran swiftly in a half circle over the fields and struck the road again considerably in advance of the more deliberate kauffman  she now set off at her swiftest run and on reaching the managers office in the front of the main building perceived that it was lighted  josie rapped upon the door and it was opened by onearmed joe langley the night watchman  quick she said let me in and hide me somewhere where i cant be seen  joe pulled her in closed the outer door and locked it and then faced her  whats up he demanded  theres a man coming here with a bomb in a black satchel she panted he intends to blow up this building in which all the shells axe stored i want to catch him in the act joe and you must hide me somewhere  joe glanced around with a puzzled look  where he asked helplessly  so josie looked around her too this end of the long building was partitioned off for offices as it fronted the town the central section was a big space containing a table benches etc while on either side were little glass rooms with partitions between them reaching about seven feet in height the ceiling being some twelve feet from the floor the first room to the left of the entrance was marked manager on its glass door the next office purchasing agent and the third chief engineer on the right hand side the corresponding offices were marked secretary examiner and superintendent all the office doors were locked except that of the purchasing agent which stood ajar josie sprang into that office and cast a hurried glance around the glass division between that and the managers office was frosted with white paint but so carelessly done that she found places where she could see through into the office of the manager also she could see into the main or reception room even with her door closed  while she examined this place a knock came on the outer doora loud imperative knock  this will do whispered josie to joe go an let him in but dont let him suspect im here  joe was not quickwitted but on the battlefields of france he had learned prompt obedience to orders josie as a government agent was now his commander so he merely nodded to her as he walked over to unlock the outer door  kauffman stepped in satchel in hand  youre the watchman i suppose he said cheerfully is mr colton here  no answered joe  i was to meet him here at this time said kauffman  he said hed be back this evening returned joe just recalling that fact but he isnt here yet  all right said the man ill wait  he carefully placed the satchel on the table and sat down on a bench joe regarded him suspiciously remembering the girls warning but said nothing more josie was watching kauffman from her retreat but as her little office was dark and the german sat under a bright light it was impossible for him to know that his every movement was under observation  the minutes dragged a big clock on the wall ticked with an ominous sound kauffman drew out his watch and compared it with the clock he appeared to grow restless  josies quick ears caught the distant sound of a motor car coming down the road perhaps kauffman heard it also he rose from his seat and going to the table unlocked the black satchel pressed the top open and looked inside it still bending over the satchel he placed a cigarette in his mouth lighted a match and applied the flame to his cigarette his back was toward josie but she comprehended instantly the action  he has lighted the fuse she murmured triumphantly  the motor car came to a sudden halt outside the door which joe had left unlocked but while the german turned expectantly toward the door the maimed soldier hearing josies whisper approached her little room and slightly opened her door  he has lighted the fuse of the bomb she said to him excitedly the bomb is in the satchel  joe turned quickly to the table he dived into the bag with his one good hand drew out the heavy ball of steel and rushed with it to the door just as the manager mr colton opened it and stepped in  so swift were joes actions that kauffman had no time to interfere both he and the manager stared in amazement as joe langley rushed outside and with all his might hurled the bomb far out upon the common  confound you cried kauffman what did you do that for  what is it inquired the astonished manager  a bomb cried josie stepping from her retreat and confronting them a bomb with the fuse lighted and timed to blow up this building after you had gone away mr colton that man before you is a german spy and i arrest him in the name of the law put up your hands abe kauffman  the little revolver was in her hand steadily covering him kauffman gave an amused laugh but he slowly raised his arms as commanded  i dont quite understand said the puzzled manager looking from one to the other  well i brought the new projectile colton as i had agreed answered the german coolly but your quaint watchman has thrown it away as for the girl he added with a broad grin she has fooled me she said she had brains and i find she was mistaken  the manager turned to josie  may i ask who you are miss and how you came to be in my office  i am josie ogorman an agent of the government secret service she replied not quite truthfully ive been shadowing this man for some time i tell you sir he brought a bomb here to destroy this building and under pretense of lighting a cigarette he has just lighted the time fuse the bomb was in that satchel but she added impressively as a matter of fact the thing was harmless as i had already removed the powder from the fuse  kauffman gave a low whistle  how did you manage that he asked curiously  never mind how she retorted i did it  kauffman turned to the manager  will you please order your man to get the projectile he asked it is lucky for us all that the thing isnt loaded or there really would have been an explosion he now turned to josie with his hands still in the air and explained it is meant to explode through impact and ordering it tossed out there was the most dangerous thing you could have done  at the managers command joe took an electric searchlight and went out to find the steel ball  if you please miss said kauffman may i put down my arms they are tired and i assure you i will not try to escape  josie lowered the revolver her face was red she was beginning to wonder if she had bungled the case a second thought howevera thought of the papers she had found in the old deskreassured her she might have been wrong in some respects but surely she was right in the main  this man said mr colton pointing to kauffman is known to me as a munition expert he bears the endorsement of the secretary of war and is the inventor of the most effective shells we now manufacture what you have mistaken for a bomb is his latest design of projectile for an eightinch gun he had arranged to bring it here and explain to me its mechanism tonight and also to submit a proposition giving our company the control of its manufacture if you are a government agent you surely understand that these arrangements must be conducted with great secrecy if we purchase the right to make this projectile we must first induce the government to use it by demonstrating its effectiveness and then secure our contracts so your interference at this time isahemannoying  josies face was a little more red than before a second motor car drew up at the door and to her astonishment mrs charleworth entered and greeted both the manager and kauffman in her usual charming manner then she looked inquiringly at the girl  pardon me madam said mr colton there has been a singular misunderstanding it seems and our friend here has been accused of being a german spy by this young lady who is a government detective oror claims to be such the precious projectile in which you are so deeply interested has just been tossed out upon the common but joe langley is searching for it  mrs charleworths face wore an amused smile  we are so beset with spies on every hand that such an error is quite likely to occur said she i recognize this young lady as a friend of the hathaway family and i have met her at the liberty girls shop so she is doubtless sincereif misled let us hope we can convince her miss ogorman isnt itthat we are wholly innocent of attempting to promote the kaisers interests  joe came in with the steel ball which he deposited upon the table then at a nod from the manager the soldier took his searchlight and departed through the door leading to the big room in the rear it was time to make his regular rounds of the works and perhaps mr colton preferred no listeners to the conversation that might follow   chapter xxiii the flashlight  perhaps said josie her voice trembling a little i have assumed too much and accused this man pointing to kauffman unjustly i was trying to serve my country but i am somewhat confused even yet in regard to this affair will you please tell me mrs charleworth what connection you have with mr kauffman or with hisprojectile  very gladly said the lady graciously i am a stockholder in this steel companya rather important stockholder i believeand while i am not a member of the board of directors mr colton represents my interests two years ago we bought the kauffman shell and paid liberally for it but mr kauffman unfortunately invested his money in a transatlantic merchant ship which was sunk with its entire cargo by a german submarine again penniless he began the manufacture of suspenders in a small way with money i loaned him but was not very successful then he conceived the idea of a new projectile very effective and quite different from others he asked our company to finance him while he was experimenting and perfecting the new projectile the company couldnt undertake to do that but i personally financed mr kauffman having confidence in his ability he has been six months getting the invention made tested and ready to submit to government experts and up to the present it has cost a lot of money however it is now considered perfect and mr kauffman has brought it here tonight to exhibit and explain it to mr colton if mr colton approves it from a manufacturing standpoint our company will secure an option for the sole right to manufacture it  mr kauffman has been in dorfield several days said josie why did he not show you the projectile before  i have been out of town explained the manager i returned this afternoon especially for this interview and made the appointment for this evening i am a busy manthese are war times you knowand i must make my evenings count as well as my days  josie scented ignominous defeat but she had one more shot to fire  mrs charleworth she stated with a severe look john dyer the school superintendent was at your house last night in secret conference with mr kauffman and yourself  oh so you are aware of that interview  clever said kauffman id no idea i was being shadowed then the two exchanged glances and smiled it seems impossible continued the man to keep any little matter of business dark these days although the war office insists on secrecy in regard to all munitions affairs and publicity would surely ruin our chances of getting the new projectile accepted for government use  i am awaiting an explanation of that meeting declared josie sternly perhaps you do not realize how important it may be  well answered mrs charleworth a thoughtful expression crossing her pleasant face i see no objection to acquainting you with the object of that mysterious meeting although it involves confiding to you a bit of necessary diplomacy mr colton will tell you that the dorfield steel works will under no circumstances purchase the right to manufacture the kauffman projectileor any other article of munition until it is approved and adopted by the war department that approval is not easily obtained because the officials are crowded with business and a certain amount of red tape must be encountered experience has proved that the inventor is not the proper person to secure government endorsement he labors under a natural disadvantage neither is mr colton as the prospective manufacturer free from suspicion of selfish interest therefore it seemed best to have the matter taken up with the proper authorities and experts by someone not financially interested in the projectile  now professor dyer has a brotherinlaw who is an important member of the munitions board under general crozier and we have induced the professor after much urging to take our projectile to washington have it tested and secure contracts for its manufacture if he succeeds we are to pay liberally for his services that was how he came to be at our house last evening when arrangements were finally made  was such secrecy necessary asked josie suspiciously  it was kauffman who answered this question speaking with apparent good humor but with a tinge of sarcasm in his voice my dear young lady your own disposition to secrecya quality quite necessary in a detectiveshould show you the absurdity of your question can we be too careful in these days of espionage no emissary of the kaiser must know the construction of this wonderful projectile none should even know that it exists even should our government refuse to adopt it we must not let the central powers know of it my own negotiations with mr colton and mrs charleworth have been camouflaged by my disguise as a suspender merchant it was equally important that mr dyers connection with us be wholly unsuspected when the projectile is adopted and these works are manufacturing it in quantities to help win the war still no information concerning it must be made public you must realize that  that is all true agreed mr colton these frank statements miss have only been made to you because of your claim to being a government agent if you fail to substantiate that claim we shall place you under arrest and turn you over to the authorities for our own protection  to be sure said josie that will be your duty i am the daughter of john ogorman one of the high officers of the united states secret service who is now in europe in the interests of the government i came to dorfield to visit my friend mary louise burrows as mrs charleworth is aware and while here my suspicions were aroused of the existence of a german spy plot therefore i set to work to bring the criminals to justice  and like the regulation detective you have followed a false trail commented kauffman with his provoking smile  not altogether retorted josie i have already secured proof that will convict two persons at least and i am amazed that you have intrusted your secrets to that archtraitor professor dyer will you tell me mrs charleworth what you know about that man  mrs charleworth seemed astounded  professor john dyer is one of dorfields old residents i believe she answered slowly as if carefully considering her words he is also the superintendent of schools and in that capacity seems highly respected i have never heard anything against the man until now his important public position should vouch for his integrity  isnt his position a political appointment inquired josie  the lady looked at mr colton yes said the manager it is true that john dyer was active in politics long before he was made superintendent of schools however he was an educator as well as a politician so it seems his appointment was merited  how well do you know him personally madam asked the girl  not very well she admitted we do not meet socially so our acquaintance until very recently was casual but i have looked upon him as a man of importance in the community on learning that he had a relative on the munitions board i asked him to come to my house where i made him the proposition to take our projectile to washington and secure its adoption i offered liberal terms for such service but at first the professor seemed not interested i arranged a second meeting last evening at which mr kauffman was present to explain technical details and we soon persuaded mr dyer to undertake the commission we felt that we could trust him implicity  when did he intend to go to washington was josies next question  on the 530 tomorrow morning after exhibiting the projectile to mr colton and securing the firms option to manufacture it on a royalty basis we are to take it to my house where mr dyer will receive it and obtain our final instructions  one question more if you please said josie what connection with your enterprise has tom linnet  linnet i do not know such a person declared mrs charleworth  who is he asked the manager  i know him said kauffman hes the night clerk at the mansion house where i stop sometimes i see him when i come in late hes not of special account hes weak ignorant and  a sharp report interrupted him and alarmed them all  josie swung around quickly for the soundshe knew it was a revolver shotcame from the rear as colton and kauffman sprang to their feet and mrs charleworth shrank back in a fright the girl ran to the back door opened it and started to make her way through the huge dark building beyond the partition the manager followed in her wake and as he passed through the door he turned a switch which flooded the big storeroom with light  in the center of the building were long broad tables used for packing a few shells still remained grouped here and there upon the boards on either side the walls were lined with tiers of boxes bound with steel bands and ready for shipment no person was visible in this room but at the farther end an outer door stood ajar and just outside it a motionless form was outlined  josie and mr colton approaching this outer door nearly at the same time controlled their haste and came to an abrupt halt the upright figure was that of sergeant joe langley and the light from the room just reached a human form huddled upon the ground a few feet distant joe had dropped his flashlight and in his one hand held a revolver josie drew a long shuddering breath the manager took a step forward hesitated and returned to his former position his face deathly white  what is it whats the matter called kauffman coming upon the scene panting for he was too short and fat to run easily  joe turned and looked at them as if waking from a trance his stolid face took on a shamed expression  couldnt help it sir he said to the manager i caught him in the act it was the flashlight that saved us when it struck him he looked up and the bullet hit him fair  who is it and what was he doing asked mr colton hoarsely  its under him sir and he was alighting of it  as he spoke sergeant joe approached the form and with a shove of his foot pushed it over it rolled slightly unbent and now lay at full length facing them josie picked up the flashlight and turned it upon the face  oh she cried aloud and shivered anew but was not surprised  i guess said joe slowly theyll have to get another school superintendent  but whats it all about what did he do demanded kauffman excitedly  joe took the light from josies hand and turned it upon a curious object that until now had been hidden by the dead mans body  its a infernal machine sir an i aint sure even yet that it wont go off an blow us all up he was leanin down an bendin over it twisting that dial you see when on a sudden i spotted him i didnt stop to think my capn used to say act first an think afterwards an thats what i did i didnt know till now it was the school boss but it wouldnt have made any difference i done my duty as i saw it an i hope i did it right mr colton  kauffman was already stooping over the machine examining it with a skilled mechanical eye  its ticking he said and began turning the dial backward to zero the ticking stopped then the inventor stood up and with his handkerchief wiped the perspiration from his face  gott he exclaimed this is no joke weve all been too near death to feel comfortable  this is horrible said mr colton i cant yet believe that dyer could be guilty of so fiendish an act  i can asserted josie grimly and it isnt the first time he has planned murder either dyer was responsible for the explosion at the airplane factory  footsteps were heard out of the darkness between the group of buildings appeared two men crissey and addison  are we too late miss ogorman asked crissey  yes she replied how did you lose track of dyer  hes a slippery fellow said addison and threw us off the scent but finally we traced him here and  and there he is concluded josie in a reproachful tone  crissey caught sight of the machine  great caesar he exclaimed who saved you  i did answered joe putting the revolver in his hip pocket but i wish youd had the job stranger  chapter xxiv after the crisis  mrs charleworth drove josie who was sobbing nervously and quite bereft of her usual selfcommand to colonel hathaways residence the woman was unnerved too and had little to say on the journey  the old colonel had retired but mary louise was still up reading a book and she was shocked when josie came running in and threw herself into her friends arms crying and laughing by turns hysterically  whats the matter dear asked mary louise in an anxious voice  ive bbbungled that whole miserable ggerman spy plot wailed josie  wasnt there any plot then  of course but i ggrabbed the wrong end of it oh im so glad daddy wasnt here to see my humiliation im a dub mary louisea miserable ignorant foozlebrained dub  never mind dear said mary louise consolingly no one can know everything josie even at our age now sit down and wipe that wet off your face and tell me all about it  josie complied she snivelled a little as she began her story but soon became more calm indeed in her relation she tried to place the facts in such order that she might herself find excuse for her erroneous theories as well as prove to mary louise that her suspicions of abe kauffman and mrs charleworth were well founded  no girl is supposed to know the difference between a bomb and a cannonballor projectileor whatever it is was her friends comment when josie had reached the scene in the managers office and any man who is a german and acts queerly is surely open to suspicion go on josie what happened next  even mary louise was startled and horrified at the terrible retribution that had overtaken professor dyer although josies story had aroused her indignation toward him and prepared her for the mans final infamous attempt to wreck the steel plant  and what about tom linnet she asked  chief farnum is to arrest him tonight said josie he will confess everything of course and then the whole plot will be made public  poor mrs dyer sighed mary louise  but fate decreed a different ending to the nights tragedy when the police tried to arrest tom linnet the young man was not to be found he had not bought the cigar store but with what funds remained to him he had absconded to parts unknown  chief farnum wired his description to all parts of the country meantime on the morning after the affair at the steel works an earnest conference was held between mr colton colonel hathaway josie ogorman mrs charleworth the chief of police and the two secret service agents at this conference it was deemed inadvisable to acquaint the public with the truth about john dyers villainy the government would be fully informed of course but it seemed best not to tell the people of dorfield that a supposedly respectable citizen had been in the pay of the kaisers agents it would be likely to make them suspicious of one another and have a bad influence generally the criminal had paid the penalty of his crimes the murders he had committed and attempted to commit were avenged  so it was announced that the school superintendent had been killed by an accidental explosion at the munition works and the newspapers stated that mrs dyer did not desire a public funeral indeed she was too overwhelmed by the tragedy to express any desire regarding the funeral but left it all to colonel hathaway and mr colton who volunteered to attend to the arrangements the burial was very unostentatious and the widow received much sympathy and did not suffer in the esteem of the community mrs dyer in fact was never told of her husbands dishonor and so mourned him sincerely  immediately following the conference referred to josie brought the chief of police and the secret service men to her room and in their presence dragged the old pedestaldesk from her closet mary louise who had been admitted exclaimed in surprise  why josie i thought you sent the desk to washington  no answered josie i merely shipped an empty box i knew very well that dyer would try to get back the desk hoping i had not discovered its secret so i deceived him and gained time by proving that i had sent a box home by freight  that explains his decision to take the projectile to washington commented detective crissey he believed he could kill two birds with one stoneget back his papers and earn a big fee from mrs charleworth  also added josie he would be able to give the german master spy full information concerning the projectile and so reap another reward but all his diabolical schemes were frustrated by joe langleys bullet  well heres the desk said chief farnum but where are those important papers miss ogorman  and what do they prove added crissey  josie slid back the panel in the square pedestal disclosing the two compartments filled with papers these she allowed the police and the detectives to read arid they not only proved that john dyer was in the pay of an organized band of german spies having agents in washington new york and chicago but crissey was confident the notes contracts and agreements would furnish clues leading to the discovery and apprehension of the entire band so the papers were placed in his charge to take to washington and their importance was a further argument for secrecy concerning john dyers death  so far as i am concerned josie said afterward to colonel hathaway and mary louise the spy case is ended when they arrest tom linnet they will be able to prove from the scraps of paper i found in the printing room of the hotel that linnet printed the circulars from copy furnished by dyer and that dyer and linnet together directed the envelopes probably in the still hours of the morning at the hotel desk where they were not likely to be disturbed the circulars may not be considered legally treasonable but the fact that linnet personally placed the bomb that destroyed the airplane works will surely send him to the scaffold  i suppose you will be called as a witness suggested mary louise because you are the only one who overheard his verbal confession of the crime  it wont take much to make linnet confess predicted josie he is yellow all through or he wouldnt have undertaken such dastardly work for the sake of money his refusal to undertake the second job was mere cowardice not repentance i understand that sort of criminal pretty well and i assure you he will confess as soon as he is captured  but somewhat to the astonishment of the officers tom linnet managed to evade capture they found his trail once or twice and lost it again after a time they discovered he had escaped into mexico afterward they heard of a young man of his description in argentine finally he disappeared altogether  the arms of the law are long and strong farreaching and mercilessly persistent they may embrace tom linnet yet but until now he has miraculously avoided them   chapter xxv decorating  colonel hathaway and mary louise were walking down the street one day when they noticed that the front of jake kaskers clothing emporium was fairly covered with american flags even the signs were hidden by a fluttering display of the stars and stripes  i wonder what this means said the colonel  lets go in and inquire proposed mary louise i dont suppose the man has forgiven me yet for suspecting his loyalty but youve always defended him granpa jim so he will probably tell you why he is celebrating  they entered the store and kasker came forward to meet them  whats the meaning of all the flags jake asked the colonel  didnt you hear said kasker my boys been shotmy little jakie tears came to his eyes  dear me exclaimed mary louise with ready sympathy i hope hehe isnt dead  no said kasker wiping his eyes not that thank god a shell splinter took out a piece of his legmy little jakies legand hes in a hospital at soissons his letter says in a few weeks he can go back to his company i got a letter from his captain too the captain says jakie is a good soldier and fights like wildcats thats what he says of jakie  still said colonel hathaway with a puzzled look i do not quite understand why you should decorate so profusely on account of so sad an event  sad exclaimed the clothing man not a bit thats glory the way i look at it colonel if my jakies blood is spilled for his country and he can go back and spill it again it makes great honor for the name of kasker say once they called me progerman cause i said i hated the war dont my jakies blood put my name on americas honor roll im pretty proud of jakie he wiped his eyes again ill give him an interest in the business if he comes back and if he dontif those cursed germans put an end to himthen folks will say see jake kasker over there well he gave his son for his countryhis only son seems to me colonel that evens the score america gives us germans protection and prosperity and we give our blood to defend americas honor im sorry i couldnt find a place for any more flags  the colonel and mary louise were both a little awed but as kasker accompanied them to the door they strove to express their sympathy and approval as they parted however the man leaned over and whispered just the same i hate the war but if it has to be lets stand together to fight and win it         granpa jim said mary louise when they were on the street again im ashamed i once told you i loved you better than my country but jake kasker loves his country better than his son   chapter xxvi keeping busy  the liberty girls were forced to abandon their shop when a substantial offer was made by a business firm to rent the store they had occupied however they were then near the end of their resources with depleted stock for they had begged about all the odds and ends people would consent to part with what goods remained to them were of inferior worth and slow to dispose of so they concluded their enterprise with a grand auction peter conant acting as auctioneer and cleaned up the entire stock in a blaze of glory as mary louise enthusiastically described the event  the venture had been remarkably successful and many a soldier had cause to bless the liberty girls shop for substantial comforts provided from its funds  but what can we do now inquired mary louise anxiously as the six captains met with irene one afternoon following the closing of the shop we must keep busy of course cant someone think of something  one and all had been thinking on that subject it seemed various proposals were advanced none of which however seemed entirely practical until irene said  we mustnt lose our reputation for originality you know nor must we interfere with those who are doing war relief work as well if not much better than we could ive pondered the case some during the past few days and in reading of the progress of events i find that quite the most important thing on the government programme at present is the conservation of foods food will win the war is the latest slogan and anyone who can help mr hoover will be doing the utmost for our final victory  thats all very well irene said alora but im sure we are all as careful as possible to conserve food  dont ask us to eat any less pleaded edna for my appetite rebels as it is  i dont see how we liberty girls can possibly help mr hoover more than everyone else is doing remarked laura  well ive an idea we can replied irene but this is just another case where i can only plan and you girls must execute now listen to my proposition the most necessary thing to conserve it seems is wheat  so it seems dear  people are eating large quantities of wheat flour simply because they dont know what else to eat irene continued now corn properly prepared is far more delicious and equally as nourishing as wheat the trouble is that people dont know how to use cornmeal and cornflour to the best advantage  that is true and theyre not likely to learn in time to apply the knowledge usefully commented mary louise  not unless you girls get busy and teach them admitted irene while a smile went round the circle dont laugh girls you are all very fair cooks and if properly trained in the methods of preparing corn for food you could easily teach others and soon all dorfield would be eating corn and conserving wheat that would be worth while wouldnt it  but whos to train us and how could we manage to train others asked mary louise  the proposition sounds interesting irene and if carried through would doubtless be valuable but is it practical  let us see was the reply some time ago i read of the wonderful success of mrs manton in preparing corn for food shes one of the most famous professional cooks in america and her name is already a household word we use her cookbook every day now mrs manton has been teaching classes in cleveland and i wrote her and asked what she would charge to come here and teach the liberty girls the practical methods of preparing her numerous corn recipes heres her answer girls she wants her expenses and one hundred dollars for two weeks work and she will come next week if we telegraph her at once  they considered and discussed this proposition very seriously  at the masonic temple said mary louise there is a large and fully equipped kitchen adjoining the lodge room and it is not in use except on special occasions granpa jim is a high mason and so is aloras father perhaps they could secure permission for us to use the lodge kitchen for our class in cookery  the colonel and jason jones being consulted promised the use of the kitchen and highly approved the plan of the liberty girls mrs manton was telegraphed to come to dorfield and the cookery class was soon formed alora confessed she had no talent whatever for cooking but all the other five were ready to undertake the work and a selection was made from among the other liberty girlsof the rank and filewhich brought the total number of culinary endeavorers up to fifteenas large a class as mrs manton was able to handle efficiently  while these fifteen were being trained by means of practical daily demonstration in the many appetizing preparations for the table from cornmeal and cornflour alora and one or two others daily visited the homes of dorfield and left samples of bread buns cookies cakes desserts and other things that had come fresh from the ovens and range of the cookingschool at the same time an offer was made to teach the family cookwhether mistress or servantin this patriotic branch of culinary art and such offers were usually accepted with eagerness especially after tasting the delicious corn dainties  when mrs manton left dorfield after two weeks of successful work she left fifteen liberty girls fully competent to teach others how to prepare every one of her famous corn recipes and these fifteen divided into shifts and with several large kitchens at their disposal immediately found themselves besieged by applicants for instruction before winter set in all dorfield as predicted by irene was eating corn and liking it better than wheat and in proof of their success the liberty girls received a highly complimentary letter from mr hoover thanking them for their help in the time of the nations greatest need a fee sufficient to cover the cost of the material used had been exacted from all those willing and able to pay for instruction so no expense was involved in this work aside from the charges of mrs manton which were cared for by voluntary subscription on the part of a few who were interested in the girls patriotic project  another thing the liberty girls did was to start community concerts one evening each week which were held in various churches and attended by throngs of men women and children who joined lustily in the singing of patriotic and popular songs this community singing became immensely popular and did much to promote patriotic fervor as well as to entertain those in attendance  and so mary louises liberty girls at the time this story ends are still active workers in the cause of liberty justice and democracy and will continue to support their countrys welfare as long as they can be of use  were a real part of the war mary louise has often told her coworkers and im sure that in the final day of glorious victory our girls will be found to have played no unimportant part  the end
