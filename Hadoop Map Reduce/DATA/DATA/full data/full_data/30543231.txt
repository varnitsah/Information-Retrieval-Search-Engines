30543231	mrs general talboys  by anthony trollope     why mrs general talboys first made up her mind to pass the winter of 1859 at rome i never clearly understood  to myself she explained her purposes soon after her arrival at the eternal city by declaring in her own enthusiastic manner that she was inspired by a burning desire to drink fresh at the still living fountains of classical poetry and sentiment  but i always thought that there was something more than this in it  classical poetry and sentiment were doubtless very dear to her but so also i imagine were the substantial comforts of hardover lodge the generals house in berkshire and i do not think that she would have emigrated for the winter had there not been some slight domestic misunderstanding let this however be fully made clearthat such misunderstanding if it existed must have been simply an affair of temper  no impropriety of conduct has i am very sure ever been imputed to the lady  the general as all the world knows is hot and mrs talboys when the sweet rivers of her enthusiasm are unfed by congenial waters can i believe make herself disagreeable  but be this as it may in november 1859 mrs talboys came among us english at rome and soon succeeded in obtaining for herself a comfortable footing in our society  we all thought her more remarkable for her mental attributes than for physical perfection but nevertheless she was in her own way a sightly woman  she had no special brilliance either of eye or complexion such as would produce sudden flames in susceptible hearts nor did she seem to demand instant homage by the form and step of a goddess but we found her to be a goodlooking woman of some thirty or thirtythree years of age with soft peachlike cheeksrather too like those of a cherub with sparkling eyes which were hardly large enough with good teeth a white forehead a dimpled chin and a full bust such outwardly was mrs general talboys  the description of the inward woman is the purport to which these few pages will be devoted  there are two qualities to which the best of mankind are much subject which are nearly related to each other and as to which the world has not yet decided whether they are to be classed among the good or evil attributes of our nature  men and women are under the influence of them both but men oftenest undergo the former and women the latter  they are ambition and enthusiasm  now mrs talboys was an enthusiastic woman  as to ambition generally as the world agrees with mark antony in stigmatising it as a grievous fault i am myself clear that it is a virtue but with ambition at present we have no concern  enthusiasm also as i think leans to virtues side or at least if it be a fault of all faults it is the prettiest  but then to partake at all of virtue or even to be in any degree pretty the enthusiasm must be true  bad coin is known from good by the ring of it and so is bad enthusiasm  let the coiner be ever so clever at his art in the coining of enthusiasm the sound of true gold can never be imparted to the false metal  and i doubt whether the cleverest she in the world can make false enthusiasm palatable to the taste of man  to the taste of any woman the enthusiasm of another woman is never very palatable  we understood at home that mrs talboys had a considerable family four or five children we were told but she brought with her only one daughter a little girl about twelve years of age  she had torn herself asunder as she told me from the younger nurslings of her heart and had left them to the care of a devoted female attendant whose love was all but maternal  and then she said a word or two about the general in terms which made me almost think that this quasimaternal love extended itself beyond the children  the idea however was a mistaken one arising from the strength of her language to which i was then unaccustomed  i have since become aware that nothing can be more decorous than old mrs upton the excellent headnurse at hardover lodge and no gentleman more discreet in his conduct than general talboys  and i may as well here declare also that there could be no more virtuous woman than the generals wife  her marriage vow was to her paramount to all other vows and bonds whatever  the generals honour was quite safe when he sent her off to rome by herself and he no doubt knew that it was so  illi robur et aes triplex of which i believe no weapons of any assailant could get the better but nevertheless we used to fancy that she had no repugnance to impropriety in other womento what the world generally calls impropriety  invincibly attached herself to the marriage tie she would constantly speak of it as by no means necessarily binding on others and virtuous herself as any griffin of propriety she constantly patronised at any rate the theory of infidelity in her neighbours  she was very eager in denouncing the prejudices of the english world declaring that she had found existence among them to be no longer possible for herself  she was hot against the stern unforgiveness of british matrons and equally eager in reprobating the stiff conventionalities of a religion in which she said that none of its votaries had faith though they all allowed themselves to be enslaved  we had at that time a small set at rome consisting chiefly of english and americans who habitually met at each others rooms and spent many of our evening hours in discussing italian politics  we were most of us painters poets novelists or sculptorsperhaps i should say wouldbe painters poets novelists and sculptors aspirants hoping to become some day recognised and among us mrs talboys took her place naturally enough on account of a very pretty taste she had for painting  i do not know that she ever originated anything that was grand but she made some nice copies and was fond at any rate of art conversation  she wrote essays too which she showed in confidence to various gentlemen and had some idea of taking lessons in modelling  in all our circle conrad mackinnon an american was perhaps the person most qualified to be styled its leader  he was one who absolutely did gain his living and an ample living too by his pen and was regarded on all sides as a literary lion justified by success in roaring at any tone he might please  his usual roar was not exactly that of a suckingdove or a nightingale but it was a goodhumoured roar not very offensive to any man and apparently acceptable enough to some ladies  he was a big burly man near to fifty as i suppose somewhat awkward in his gait and somewhat loud in his laugh  but though nigh to fifty and thus ungainly he liked to be smiled on by pretty women and liked as some said to be flattered by them also  if so he should have been happy for the ladies at rome at that time made much of conrad mackinnon  of mrs mackinnon no one did make very much and yet she was one of the sweetest dearest quietest little creatures that ever made glad a mans fireside  she was exquisitely pretty always in good humour never stupid selfdenying to a fault and yet she was generally in the background  she would seldom come forward of her own will but was contented to sit behind her teapot and hear mackinnon do his roaring  he was certainly much given to what the world at rome called flirting but this did not in the least annoy her  she was twenty years his junior and yet she never flirted with any one  women would tell hergoodnatured friendshow mackinnon went on but she received such tidings as an excellent joke observing that he had always done the same and no doubt always would until he was ninety  i do believe that she was a happy woman and yet i used to think that she should have been happier there is however no knowing the inside of another mans house or reading the riddles of another mans joy and sorrow  we had also there another liona lion cubentitled to roar a little and of him also i must say something  charles obrien was a young man about twentyfive years of age who had sent out from his studio in the preceding year a certain bust supposed by his admirers to be unsurpassed by any effort of ancient or modern genius  i am no judge of sculpture and will not therefore pronounce an opinion but many who considered themselves to be judges declared that it was a goodish head and shoulders and nothing more  i merely mention the fact as it was on the strength of that head and shoulders that obrien separated himself from a throng of others such as himself in rome walked solitary during the days and threw himself at the feet of various ladies when the days were over  he had ridden on the shoulders of his bust into a prominent place in our circle and there encountered much feminine admirationfrom mrs general talboys and others  some eighteen or twenty of us used to meet every sunday evening in mrs mackinnons drawingroom  many of us indeed were in the habit of seeing each other daily and of visiting together the haunts in rome which are best loved by artloving strangers but here in this drawingroom we were sure to come together and here before the end of november mrs talboys might always be found not in any accustomed seat but moving about the room as the different male mental attractions of our society might chance to move themselves  she was at first greatly taken by mackinnonwho also was i think a little stirred by her admiration though he stoutly denied the charge  she became however very dear to us all before she left us and certainly we owed to her our love for she added infinitely to the joys of our winter  i have come here to refresh myself she said to mackinnon one eveningto mackinnon and myself for we were standing together  shall i get you tea said i  and will you have something to eat mackinnon asked  no no no she answered  tea yes but for heavens sake let nothing solid dispel the associations of such a meeting as this  i thought you might have dined early said mackinnon  now mackinnon was a man whose own dinner was very dear to him  i have seen him become hasty and unpleasant even under the pillars of the forum when he thought that the party were placing his fish in jeopardy by their desire to linger there too long  early  yes  no i know not when it was  one dines and sleeps in obedience to that dull clay which weighs down so generally the particle of our spirit  but the clay may sometimes be forgotten here i can always forget it  i thought you asked for refreshment i said  she only looked at me whose small attempts at prose composition had up to that time been altogether unsuccessful and then addressed herself in reply to mackinnon  it is the air which we breathe that fills our lungs and gives us life and light  it is that which refreshes us if pure or sinks us into stagnation if it be foul  let me for awhile inhale the breath of an invigorating literature  sit down mr mackinnon i have a question that i must put to you  and then she succeeded in carrying him off into a corner  as far as i could see he went willingly enough at that time though he soon became averse to any long retirement in company with mrs talboys  we none of us quite understood what were her exact ideas on the subject of revealed religion  somebody i think had told her that there were among us one or two whose opinions were not exactly orthodox according to the doctrines of the established english church  if so she was determined to show us that she also was advanced beyond the prejudices of an old and dry school of theology i have thrown down all the barriers of religion she said to poor mrs mackinnon and am looking for the sentiments of a pure christianity  thrown down all the barriers of religion said mrs mackinnon in a tone of horror which was not appreciated  indeed yes said mrs talboys with an exulting voice  are not the days for such trammels gone by  but yet you hold by christianity  a pure christianity unstained by blood and perjury by hypocrisy and verbose genuflection  can i not worship and say my prayers among the clouds  and she pointed to the lofty ceiling and the handsome chandelier  but ida goes to church said mrs mackinnon  ida talboys was her daughter  now it may be observed that many who throw down the barriers of religion so far as those barriers may affect themselves still maintain them on behalf of their children  yes said mrs talboys dear ida her soft spirit is not yet adapted to receive the perfect truth  we are obliged to govern children by the strength of their prejudices  and then she moved away for it was seldom that mrs talboys remained long in conversation with any lady  mackinnon i believe soon became tired of her  he liked her flattery and at first declared that she was clever and nice but her niceness was too purely celestial to satisfy his mundane tastes mackinnon himself can revel among the clouds in his own writings and can leave us sometimes in doubt whether he ever means to come back to earth but when his foot is on terra firma he loves to feel the earthly substratum which supports his weight  with women he likes a hand that can remain an unnecessary moment within his own an eye that can glisten with the sparkle of champagne a heart weak enough to make its owners arm tremble within his own beneath the moonlight gloom of the coliseum arches  a dash of sentiment the while makes all these things the sweeter but the sentiment alone will not suffice for him  mrs talboys did i believe drink her glass of champagne as do other ladies but with her it had no such pleasing effect  it loosened only her tongue but never her eye her arm i think never trembled and her hand never lingered  the general was always safe and happy perhaps in his solitary safety  it so happened that we had unfortunately among us two artists who had quarrelled with their wives  obrien whom i have before mentioned was one of them  in his case i believe him to have been almost as free from blame as a man can be whose marriage was in itself a fault  however he had a wife in ireland some ten years older than himself and though he might sometimes almost forget the fact his friends and neighbours were well aware of it  in the other case the whole fault probably was with the husband  he was an illtempered badhearted man clever enough but without principle and he was continually guilty of the great sin of speaking evil of the woman whose name he should have been anxious to protect  in both cases our friend mrs talboys took a warm interest and in each of them she sympathised with the present husband against the absent wife  of the consolation which she offered in the latter instance we used to hear something from mackinnon  he would repeat to his wife and to me and my wife the conversations which she had with him  poor brown she would say i pity him with my very hearts blood  you are aware that he has comforted himself in his desolation mackinnon replied  i know very well to what you allude  i think i may say that i am conversant with all the circumstances of this heartblighting sacrifice  mrs talboys was apt to boast of the thorough confidence reposed in her by all those in whom she took an interest yes he has sought such comfort in another love as the hard cruel world would allow him  or perhaps something more than that said mackinnon  he has a family here in rome you know two little babies  i know it i know it she said  cherub angels and as she spoke she looked up into the ugly face of marcus aurelius for they were standing at the moment under the figure of the great horseman on the campidoglio  i have seen them and they are the children of innocence  if all the blood of all the howards ran in their veins it could not make their birth more noble  not if the father and mother of all the howards had never been married said mackinnon  what that from you mr mackinnon said mrs talboys turning her back with energy upon the equestrian statue and looking up into the faces first of pollux and then of castor as though from them she might gain some inspiration on the subject which marcus aurelius in his coldness had denied to her  from you who have so nobly claimed for mankind the divine attributes of free action  from you who have taught my mind to soar above the petty bonds which one man in his littleness contrives for the subjection of his brother mackinnon you who are so great  and she now looked up into his face  mackinnon unsay those words  they are illegitimate said he and if there was any landed property  landed property and that from an american  the children are english you know  landed property  the time will shortly comeay and i see it comingwhen that hateful word shall be expunged from the calendar when landed property shall be no more  what shall the free soul of a godborn man submit itself for ever to such trammels as that shall we never escape from the clay which so long has manacled the subtler particles of the divine spirit  ay yes mackinnon and then she took him by the arm and led him to the top of the huge steps which lead down from the campidoglio into the streets of modern rome  look down upon that countless multitude  mackinnon looked down and saw three groups of french soldiers with three or four little men in each group he saw also a couple of dirty friars and three priests very slowly beginning the side ascent to the church of the ara coeli  look down upon that countless multitude said mrs talboys and she stretched her arms out over the halfdeserted city  they are escaping now from these trammelsnow nownow that i am speaking  they have escaped long ago from all such trammels as that of landed property said mackinnon  ay and from all terrestrial bonds she continued not exactly remarking the pith of his last observation from bonds quasi terrestrial and quasicelestial  the fullformed limbs of the present age running with quick streams of generous blood will no longer bear the ligatures which past times have woven for the decrepit  look down upon that multitude mackinnon they shall all be free  and then still clutching him by the arm and still standing at the top of those stairs she gave forth her prophecy with the fury of a sybil  they shall all be free  oh rome thou eternal one thou who hast bowed thy neck to imperial pride and priestly craft thou who hast suffered sorely even to this hour from nero down to pio nonothe days of thine oppression are over  gone from thy enfranchised ways for ever is the clang of the praetorian cohorts and the more odious drone of meddling monks  and yet as mackinnon observed there still stood the dirty friars and the small french soldiers and there still toiled the slow priests wending their tedious way up to the church of the ara coeli  but that was the mundane view of the mattera view not regarded by mrs talboys in her ecstasy  o italia she continued o italia una one and indivisible in thy rights and indivisible also in thy wrongs to us is it given to see the accomplishment of thy glory  a people shall arise around thine altars greater in the annals of the world than thy scipios thy gracchi or thy caesars  not in torrents of blood or with screams of bereaved mothers shall thy new triumphs be stained  but mind shall dominate over matter and doomed together with popes and bourbons with cardinals diplomatists and police spies ignorance and prejudice shall be driven from thy smiling terraces  and then rome shall again become the fair capital of the fairest region of europe  hither shall flock the artisans of the world crowding into thy marts all that god and man can give  wealth beauty and innocence shall meet in thy streets  there will be a considerable change before that takes place said mackinnon  there shall be a considerable change she answered  mackinnon to thee it is given to read the signs of the time and hast thou not read  why have the fields of magenta and solferino been piled with the corpses of dying heroes  why have the waters of the mincio ran red with the blood of martyrs  that italy might be united and rome immortal  here standing on the capitolium of the ancient city i say that it shall be so and thou mackinnon who hearest me knowest that my words are true  there was not then in romei may almost say there was not in italy an englishman or an american who did not wish well to the cause for which italy was and is still contending as also there is hardly one who does not now regard that cause as wellnigh triumphant but nevertheless it was almost impossible to sympathise with mrs talboys  as mackinnon said she flew so high that there was no comfort in flying with her  well said he brown and the rest of them are down below  shall we go and join them  poor brown  how was it that in speaking of his troubles we were led on to this heartstirring theme  yes i have seen them the sweet angels and i tell you also that i have seen their mother  i insisted on going to her when i heard her history from him  and what is she like mrs talboys  well education has done more for some of us than for others and there are those from whose morals and sentiments we might thankfully draw a lesson whose manners and outward gestures are not such as custom has made agreeable to us  you i know can understand that i have seen her and feel sure that she is pure in heart and high in principle  has she not sacrificed herself and is not self sacrifice the surest guarantee for true nobility of character would mrs mackinnon object to my bringing them together  mackinnon was obliged to declare that he thought his wife would object and from that time forth he and mrs talboys ceased to be very close in their friendship  she still came to the house every sunday evening still refreshed herself at the fountains of his literary rills but her special prophecies from henceforth were poured into other ears  and it so happened that obrien now became her chief ally  i do not remember that she troubled herself much further with the cherub angels or with their mother and i am inclined to think that taking up warmly as she did the story of obriens matrimonial wrongs she forgot the little history of the browns  be that as it may mrs talboys and obrien now became strictly confidential and she would enlarge by the halfhour together on the miseries of her friends position to any one whom she could get to hear her  ill tell you what fanny mackinnon said to his wife one dayto his wife and to mine for we were all together we shall have a row in the house if we dont take care  obrien will be making love to mrs talboys  nonsense said mrs mackinnon  you are always thinking that somebody is going to make love to some one  somebody always is said he  shes old enough to be his mother said mrs mackinnon  what does that matter to an irishman said mackinnon  besides i doubt if there is more than five years difference between them  there must be more than that said my wife  ida talboys is twelve i know and i am not quite sure that ida is the eldest  if she had a son in the guards it would make no difference said mackinnon  there are men who consider themselves bound to make love to a woman under certain circumstances let the age of the lady be what it may  obrien is such a one and if she sympathises with him much oftener he will mistake the matter and go down on his knees  you ought to put him on his guard he said addressing himself to his wife  indeed i shall do no such thing said she if they are two fools they must like other fools pay the price of their folly as a rule there could be no softer creature than mrs mackinnon but it seemed to me that her tenderness never extended itself in the direction of mrs talboys  just at this time towards the end that is of november we made a party to visit the tombs which lie along the appian way beyond that most beautiful of all sepulchres the tomb of cecilia metella  it was a delicious day and we had driven along this road for a couple of miles beyond the walls of the city enjoying the most lovely view which the neighbourhood of rome affordslooking over the wondrous ruins of the old aqueducts up towards tivoli and palestrina  of all the environs of rome this is on a fair clear day the most enchanting and here perhaps among a world of tombs thoughts and almost memories of the old old days come upon one with the greatest force  the grandeur of rome is best seen and understood from beneath the walls of the coliseum and its beauty among the pillars of the forum and the arches of the sacred way but its history and fall become more palpable to the mind and more clearly realised out here among the tombs where the eyes rest upon the mountains whose shades were cool to the old romans as to usthan anywhere within the walls of the city  here we look out at the same tivoli and the same praeneste glittering in the sunshine embowered among the faroff valleys which were dear to them and the blue mountains have not crumbled away into ruins  within rome itself we can see nothing as they saw it  our party consisted of some dozen or fifteen persons and as a hamper with luncheon in it had been left on the grassy slope at the base of the tomb of cecilia metella the expedition had in it something of the nature of a picnic  mrs talboys was of course with us and ida talboys  obrien also was there  the hamper had been prepared in mrs mackinnons room under the immediate eye of mackinnon himself and they therefore were regarded as the dominant spirits of the party  my wife was leagued with mrs mackinnon as was usually the case and there seemed to be a general opinion among those who were closely in confidence together that something would happen in the obrientalboys matter  the two had been inseparable on the previous evening for mrs talboys had been urging on the young irishman her counsels respecting his domestic troubles  sir cresswell cresswell she had told him was his refuge  why should his soul submit to bonds which the world had now declared to be intolerable  divorce was not now the privilege of the dissolute rich  spirits which were incompatible need no longer be compelled to fret beneath the same cobbles  in short she had recommended him to go to england and get rid of his wife as she would with a little encouragement have recommended any man to get rid of anything  i am sure that had she been skilfully brought on to the subject she might have been induced to pronounce a verdict against such ligatures for the body as coats waistcoats and trowsers  her aspirations for freedom ignored all bounds and in theory there were no barriers which she was not willing to demolish  poor obrien as we all now began to see had taken the matter amiss  he had offered to make a bust of mrs talboys and she had consented expressing a wish that it might find a place among those who had devoted themselves to the enfranchisement of their fellow creatures  i really think she had but little of a womans customary personal vanity  i know she had an idea that her eye was lighted up in her warmer moments by some special fire that sparks of liberty shone round her brow and that her bosom heaved with glorious aspirations but all these feelings had reference to her inner genius not to any outward beauty  but obrien misunderstood the woman and thought it necessary to gaze into her face and sigh as though his heart were breaking  indeed he declared to a young friend that mrs talboys was perfect in her style of beauty and began the bust with this idea  it was gradually becoming clear to us all that he would bring himself to grief but in such a matter who can caution a man  mrs mackinnon had contrived to separate them in making the carriage arrangements on this day but this only added fuel to the fire which was now burning within obriens bosom  i believe that he really did love her in his easy eager susceptible irish way  that he would get over the little episode without any serious injury to his heart no one doubted but then what would occur when the declaration was made  how would mrs talboys bear it  she deserves it said mrs mackinnon  and twice as much my wife added  why is it that women are so spiteful to each other  early in the day mrs talboys clambered up to the top of a tomb and made a little speech holding a parasol over her head  beneath her feet she said reposed the ashes of some bloated senator some glutton of the empire who had swallowed into his maw the provision necessary for a tribe  old rome had fallen through such selfishness as that but new rome would not forget the lesson  all this was very well and then obrien helped her down but after this there was no separating them  for her own part she would sooner have had mackinnon at her elbow  but mackinnon now had found some other elbow  enough of that was as good as a feast he had said to his wife and therefore mrs talboys quite unconscious of evil allowed herself to be engrossed by obrien  and then about three oclock we returned to the hamper  luncheon under such circumstances always means dinner and we arranged ourselves for a very comfortable meal  to those who know the tomb of cecilia metella no description of the scene is necessary and to those who do not no description will convey a fair idea of its reality  it is itself a large low tower of great diameter but of beautiful proportion standing far outside the city close on to the side of the old roman way  it has been embattled on the top by some latterday baron in order that it might be used for protection to the castle which has been built on and attached to it  if i remember rightly this was done by one of the frangipani and a very lovely ruin he has made of it  i know no castellated old tumble down residence in italy more picturesque than this baronial adjunct to the old roman tomb or which better tallies with the ideas engendered within our minds by mrs radcliffe and the mysteries of udolpho  it lies along the road protected on the side of the city by the proud sepulchre of the roman matron and up to the long ruined walls of the back of the building stretches a grassy slope at the bottom of which are the remains of an old roman circus beyond that is the long thin graceful line of the claudian aqueduct with soracte in the distance to the left and tivoli palestine and frascati lying among the hills which bound the view that frangipani baron was in the right of it and i hope he got the value of his money out of the residence which he built for himself i doubt however that he did but little good to those who lived in his close neighbourhood  we had a very comfortable little banquet seated on the broken lumps of stone which lie about under the walls of the tomb  i wonder whether the shade of cecilia metella was looking down upon us  we have heard much of her in these latter days and yet we know nothing about her nor can conceive why she was honoured with a bigger tomb than any other roman matron  there were those then among our party who believed that she might still come back among us and with due assistance from some cognate susceptible spirit explain to us the cause of her widowed husbands liberality  alas alas if we may judge of the romans by ourselves the true reason for such sepulchral grandeur would redound little to the credit of the lady cecilia metella herself or to that of crassus her bereaved and desolate lord  she did not come among us on the occasion of this banquet possibly because we had no tables there to turn in preparation for her presence but had she done so she could not have been more eloquent of things of the other world than was mrs talboys  i have said that mrs talboys eye never glanced more brightly after a glass of champagne but i am inclined to think that on this occasion it may have done so  obrien enacted ganymede and was perhaps more liberal than other latterday ganymedes to whose services mrs talboys had been accustomed  let it not however be suspected by any one that she exceeded the limits of a discreet joyousness  by no means  the generous wine penetrated perhaps to some inner cells of her heart and brought forth thoughts in sparkling words which otherwise might have remained concealed but there was nothing in what she thought or spoke calculated to give umbrage either to an anchorite or to a vestal  a word or two she said or sung about the flowing bowl and once she called for falernian but beyond this her converse was chiefly of the rights of man and the weakness of women of the iron ages that were past and of the golden time that was to come  she called a toast and drank to the hopes of the latter historians of the nineteenth century  then it was that she bade obrien fill high the bowl with samian wine  the irishman took her at her word and she raised the bumper and waved it over her head before she put it to her lips  i am bound to declare that she did not spill a drop  the true falernian grape she said as she deposited the empty beaker on the grass beneath her elbow  viler champagne i do not think i ever swallowed but it was the theory of the wine not its palpable body present there as it were in the flesh which inspired her  there was really something grand about her on that occasion and her enthusiasm almost amounted to reality  mackinnon was amused and encouraged her as i must confess did i also  mrs mackinnon made useless little signs to her husband really fearing that the falernian would do its good offices too thoroughly  my wife getting me apart as i walked round the circle distributing viands remarked that the woman was a fool and would disgrace herself  but i observed that after the disposal of that bumper she worshipped the rosy god in theory only and therefore saw no occasion to interfere  come bacchus she said and come silenus if thou wilt i know that ye are hovering round the graves of your departed favourites  and ye too nymphs of egeria and she pointed to the classic grove which was all but close to us as we sat there  in olden days ye did not always despise the abodes of men  but why should we invoke the presence of the godswe who can become godlike ourselves  we ourselves are the deities of the present age  for us shall the tables be spread with ambrosia for us shall the nectar flow  upon the whole it was very good foolingfor awhile and as soon as we were tired of it we arose from our seats and began to stroll about the place  it was beginning to be a little dusk and somewhat cool but the evening air was pleasant and the ladies putting on their shawls did not seem inclined at once to get into the carriages  at any rate mrs talboys was not so inclined for she started down the hill towards the long low wall of the old roman circus at the bottom and obrien close at her elbow started with her  ida my dear you had better remain here she said to her daughter you will be tired if you come as far as we are going  oh no mamma i shall not said ida  you get tired much quicker than i do  oh yes you will besides i do not wish you to come  there was an end of it for ida and mrs talboys and obrien walked off together while we all looked into each others faces  it would be a charity to go with them said mackinnon  do you be charitable then said his wife  it should be a lady said he  it is a pity that the mother of the spotless cherubim is not here for the occasion said she  i hardly think that any one less gifted will undertake such a self sacrifice  any attempt of the kind would however now have been too late for they were already at the bottom of the hill  obrien had certainly drunk freely of the pernicious contents of those longnecked bottles and though no one could fairly accuse him of being tipsy nevertheless that which might have made others drunk had made him bold and he dared to do perhaps more than might become a man  if under any circumstances he could be fool enough to make an avowal of love to mrs talboys he might be expected as we all thought to do it now  we watched them as they made for a gap in the wall which led through into the large enclosed space of the old circus  it had been an arena for chariot games and they had gone down with the avowed purpose of searching where might have been the meta and ascertaining how the drivers could have turned when at their full speed  for awhile we had heard their voicesor rather her voice especially  the heart of a man obrien should suffice for all emergencies we had heard her say  she had assumed a strange habit of calling men by their simple names as men address each other when she did this to mackinnon who was much older than herself we had been all amused by it and other ladies of our party had taken to call him mackinnon when mrs talboys was not by but we had felt the comedy to be less safe with obrien especially when on one occasion we heard him address her as arabella  she did not seem to be in any way struck by his doing so and we supposed therefore that it had become frequent between them  what reply he made at the moment about the heart of a man i do not knowand then in a few minutes they disappeared through the gap in the wall  none of us followed them though it would have seemed the most natural thing in the world to do so had nothing out of the way been expected  as it was we remained there round the tomb quizzing the little foibles of our dear friend and hoping that obrien would be quick in what he was doing  that he would undoubtedly get a slap in the facemetaphoricallywe all felt certain for none of us doubted the rigid propriety of the ladys intentions  some of us strolled into the buildings and some of us got out on to the road but we all of us were thinking that obrien was very slow a considerable time before we saw mrs talboys reappear through the gap  at last however she was there and we at once saw that she was alone  she came on breasting the hill with quick steps and when she drew near we could see that there was a frown as of injured majesty on her brow  mackinnon and his wife went forward to meet her  if she were really in trouble it would be fitting in some way to assist her and of all women mrs mackinnon was the last to see another woman suffer from illusage without attempting to aid her i certainly never liked her mrs mackinnon said afterwards but i was bound to go and hear her tale when she really had a tale to tell  and mrs talboys now had a tale to tellif she chose to tell it the ladies of our party declared afterwards that she would have acted more wisely had she kept to herself both obriens words to her and her answer  she was well able to take care of herself mrs mackinnon said and after all the silly man had taken an answer when he got it  not however that obrien had taken his answer quite immediately as far as i could understand from what we heard of the matter afterwards  at the present moment mrs talboys came up the rising ground all alone and at a quick pace  the man has insulted me she said aloud as well as her panting breath would allow her and as soon as she was near enough to mrs mackinnon to speak to her  i am sorry for that said mrs mackinnon  i suppose he has taken a little too much wine  no it was a premeditated insult  the basehearted churl has failed to understand the meaning of true honest sympathy  he will forget all about it when he is sober said mackinnon meaning to comfort her  what care i what he remembers or what he forgets she said turning upon poor mackinnon indignantly  you men grovel so in your ideas  and yet as mackinnon said afterwards she had been telling me that i was a fool for the last three weeksyou men grovel so in your ideas that you cannot understand the feelings of a truehearted woman  what can his forgetfulness or his remembrance be to me  must not i remember this insult  is it possible that i should forget it  mr and mrs mackinnon only had gone forward to meet her but nevertheless she spoke so loud that all heard her who were still clustered round the spot on which we had dined  what has become of mr obrien a lady whispered to me  i had a fieldglass with me and looking round i saw his hat as he was walking inside the walls of the circus in the direction towards the city  and very foolish he must feel said the lady  no doubt he is used to it said another  but considering her age you know said the first who might have been perhaps three years younger than mrs talboys and who was not herself averse to the excitement of a moderate flirtation  but then why should she have been averse seeing that she had not as yet become subject to the will of any imperial lord  he would have felt much more foolish said the third if she had listened to what he said to her  well i dont know said the second nobody would have known anything about it then and in a few weeks they would have gradually become tired of each other in the ordinary way  but in the meantime mrs talboys was among us  there had been no attempt at secresy and she was still loudly inveighing against the grovelling propensities of men  thats quite true mrs talboys said one of the elder ladies but then women are not always so careful as they should be  of course i do not mean to say that there has been any fault on your part  fault on my part  of course there has been fault on my part  no one can make any mistake without fault to some extent  i took him to be a man of sense and he is a fool  go to naples indeed  did he want you to go to naples asked mrs mackinnon  yes that was what he suggested  we were to leave by the train for civita vecchia at six tomorrow morning and catch the steamer which leaves leghorn tonight  dont tell me of wine  he was prepared for it  and she looked round about on us with an air of injured majesty in her face which was almost insupportable  i wonder whether he took the tickets overnight said mackinnon  naples she said as though now speaking exclusively to herself the only ground in italy which has as yet made no struggle on behalf of freedoma fitting residence for such a dastard  you would have found it very pleasant at this season said the unmarried lady who was three years her junior  my wife had taken ida out of the way when the first complaining note from mrs talboys had been heard ascending the hill  but now when matters began gradually to become quiescent she brought her back suggesting as she did so that they might begin to think of returning  it is getting very cold ida dear is it not said she  but where is mr obrien said ida  he has fledas poltroons always fly said mrs talboys  i believe in my heart that she would have been glad to have had him there in the middle of the circle and to have triumphed over him publicly among us all  no feeling of shame would have kept her silent for a moment  fled said ida looking up into her mothers face  yes fled my child  and she seized her daughter in her arms and pressed her closely to her bosom  cowards always fly  is mr obrien a coward ida asked  yes a coward a very coward  and he has fled before the glance of an honest womans eye  come mrs mackinnon shall we go back to the city  i am sorry that the amusement of the day should have received this check  and she walked forward to the carriage and took her place in it with an air that showed that she was proud of the way in which she had conducted herself  she is a little conceited about it after all said that unmarried lady  if poor mr obrien had not shown so much premature anxiety with reference to that little journey to naples things might have gone quietly after all  but the unmarried lady was wrong in her judgment  mrs talboys was proud and conceited in the matterbut not proud of having excited the admiration of her irish lover  she was proud of her own subsequent conduct and gave herself credit for coming out strongly as a nobleminded matron  i believe she thinks said mrs mackinnon that her virtue is quite spartan and unique and if she remains in rome shell boast of it through the whole winter  if she does she may be certain that obrien will do the same said mackinnon  and in spite of his having fled from the field it is upon the cards that he may get the best of it  mrs talboys is a very excellent woman  she has proved her excellence beyond a doubt but nevertheless she is susceptible of ridicule  we all felt a little anxiety to hear obriens account of the matter and after having deposited the ladies at their homes mackinnon and i went off to his lodgings  at first he was denied to us but after awhile we got his servant to acknowledge that he was at home and then we made our way up to his studio  we found him seated behind a halfformed model or rather a mere lump of clay punched into something resembling the shape of a head with a pipe in his mouth and a bit of stick in his hand  he was pretending to work though we both knew that it was out of the question that he should do anything in his present frame of mind  i think i heard my servant tell you that i was not at home said he  yes he did said mackinnon and would have sworn to it too if we would have let him  come dont pretend to be surly  i am very busy mr mackinnon  completing your head of mrs talboys i suppose before you start for naples  you dont mean to say that she has told you all about it and he turned away from his work and looked up into our faces with a comical expression half of fun and half of despair  every word of it said i  when you want a lady to travel with you never ask her to get up so early in winter  but obrien how could you be such an ass said mackinnon  as it has turned out there is no very great harm done  you have insulted a respectable middleaged woman the mother of a family and the wife of a general officer and there is an end of it unless indeed the general officer should come out from england to call you to account  he is welcome said obrien haughtily  no doubt my dear fellow said mackinnon that would be a dignified and pleasant ending to the affair  but what i want to know is thiswhat would you have done if she had agreed to go  he never calculated on the possibility of such a contingency said i  by heavens then i thought she would like it said he  and to oblige her you were content to sacrifice yourself said mackinnon  well that was just it  what the deuce is a fellow to do when a woman goes on in that way  she told me down there upon the old race course you know that matrimonial bonds were made for fools and slaves  what was i to suppose that she meant by that  but to make all sure i asked her what sort of a fellow the general was  dear old man she said clasping her hands together  he might you know have been my father  i wish he were said i because then youd be free  i am free said she stamping on the ground and looking up at me as much as to say that she cared for no one then said i accept all that is left of the heart of wenceslaus obrien and i threw myself before her in her path  hand said i i have none to give but the blood which runs red through my veins is descended from a double line of kings  i said that because she is always fond of riding a high horse  i had gotten close under the wall so that none of you should see me from the tower  and what answer did she make said mackinnon  why she was pleased as punchgave me both her hands and declared that we would be friends for ever  it is my belief mackinnon that that woman never heard anything of the kind before  the general no doubt did it by letter  and how was it that she changed her mind  why i got up put my arm round her waist and told her that we would be off to naples  im blest if she didnt give me a knock in the ribs that nearly sent me backwards  she took my breath away so that i couldnt speak to her  and then  oh there was nothing more  of course i saw how it was  so she walked off one way and i the other  on the whole i consider that i am well out of it  and so do i said mackinnon very gravely  but if you will allow me to give you my advice i would suggest that it would be well to avoid such mistakes in future  upon my word said obrien excusing himself i dont know what a man is to do under such circumstances  i give you my honour that i did it all to oblige her  we then decided that mackinnon should convey to the injured lady the humble apology of her late admirer  it was settled that no detailed excuses should be made  it should be left to her to consider whether the deed which had been done might have been occasioned by wine or by the folly of a momentor by her own indiscreet enthusiasm  no one but the two were present when the message was given and therefore we were obliged to trust to mackinnons accuracy for an account of it  she stood on very high ground indeed he said at first refusing to hear anything that he had to say on the matter  the foolish young man she declared was below her anger and below her contempt  he is not the first irishman that has been made indiscreet by beauty said mackinnon  a truce to that she replied waving her hand with an air of assumed majesty  the incident contemptible as it is has been unpleasant to me  it will necessitate my withdrawal from rome  oh no mrs talboys that will be making too much of him  the greatest hero that lives she answered may have his house made uninhabitable by a very small insect  mackinnon swore that those were her own words  consequently a sobriquet was attached to obrien of which he by no means approved  and from that day we always called mrs talboys the hero  mackinnon prevailed at last with her and she did not leave rome she was even induced to send a message to obrien conveying her forgiveness  they shook hands together with great eclat in mrs mackinnons drawingroom but i do not suppose that she ever again offered to him sympathy on the score of his matrimonial troubles
