thats the best joke this spring shouted jerry muskrat  with a squeal of rage johnny sprang at the gray old chuck  if polly wanted to live there she should  have you called on johnny chuck at his new home yet asked sammy jay     i  gentle sister south wind arrives   good news good news for every one above or down below for master winsome bluebirds come to whistle off the snow  all the green meadows and all the green forest had heard the news peter rabbit had seen to that and just as soon as each of the little meadow and forest folks heard it he hurried out to listen for himself and make sure that it was true and each when he heard that sweet voice of winsome bluebird had kicked up his heels and shouted hurrah  you see they all knew that winsome bluebird never is very far ahead of gentle sister south wind and that when she arrives blustering rough brother north wind is already on his way back to the cold cold land where the ice never melts  of course winsome bluebird doesnt really whistle off the snow but after he comes the snow disappears so fast that it seems as if he did it is surprising what a difference a little good news makes of course nothing had really changed that first day when winsome bluebirds whistle was heard on the green meadows and in the green forest but it seemed as if everything had changed and it was all because that sweet whistle was a promise a promise that every one knew would come true and so there was joy in all the hearts on the green meadows and in the green forest even grim old granny fox felt it and as for reddy fox why reddy even shouted goodnaturedly to peter rabbit and hoped he was feeling well  and then gentle sister south wind arrived she came in the night and in the morning there she was hard at work making the green meadows and the green forest ready for mistress spring she broke the icy bands that had bound the smiling pool and the laughing brook so long and the smiling pool began to smile once more and the laughing brook to gurgle and then to laugh and finally to sing merrily  she touched the little banks of snow that remained and straightway they melted and disappeared she kissed the eight babies of unc billy possum and they kicked off the bedclothes under which old mrs possum had tucked them and scrambled out of the big hollow tree to play  she peeped in at the door of johnny chuck and called softly and johnny chuck awoke from his long sleep and yawned and began to think about getting up she knocked at the door of digger the badger and digger awoke she tickled the nose of striped chipmunk who was about half awake and striped chipmunk sneezed and then he hopped out of bed and hurried up to his doorway to shout good morning after her as she hurried over to see if bobby coon was still sleeping  peter rabbit followed her about he couldnt understand it at all peter had smiled to himself when he heard how softly she had called at the doorway of johnny chucks house for many and many a time during the long winter peter had stopped at johnny chucks house and shouted down the long hall at the top of his voice without once waking johnny chuck now peter nearly tumbled over with surprise as he heard johnny chuck yawn at the first low call of gentle sister south wind  how does she do it i dont understand it at all said peter as he scratched his long left ear with his long left hind leg  gentle sister south wind smiled at peter there are a lot of things in this world that you will never understand peter rabbit you will just have to believe them without understanding them and be content to know that they are so she said and hurried over to the green forest to tell unc billy possum that his old friend ol mistah buzzard was on his way up from ol virginny     ii  johnny chuck receives callers   the morning after gentle sister south wind arrived on the green meadows peter rabbit came hopping and skipping down the lone little path from the green forest peter was happy he didnt know why he just was happy it was in the air everybody else seemed happy too peter had to stop every few minutes just to kick up his heels and try to jump over his own shadow he had felt just that way ever since gentle sister south wind arrived      i simply have to kick and dance      i cannot help but gaily prance      somehow i feel it in my toes      whenever gentle south wind blows  so sang peter rabbit as he hopped and skipped down the lone little path suddenly he stopped right in the middle of the verse he sat up very straight and stared down at johnny chucks house some one was sitting on johnny chucks doorstep it looked like johnny chuck no it looked like the shadow of johnny chuck peter rubbed his eyes and looked again then he hurried as fast as he could lippertylipperty lip the nearer he got the less like johnny chuck looked the one sitting on johnny chucks doorstep johnny chuck had gone to sleep round and fat and rolypoly so fat he could hardly waddle this fellow was thin even thinner than peter rabbit himself he waved a thin hand to peter  hello peter rabbit i told you that i would see you in the spring how did you stand the long winter  that certainly was johnny chucks voice peter was so delighted that in his hurry he fell over his own feet is it really and truly you johnny chuck he cried  of course its me who did you think it was replied johnny chuck rather crossly for peter was staring at him as if he had never seen him before  iii didnt know confessed peter rabbit i thought it was you and i thought it wasnt you what have you been doing to yourself johnny chuck your coat looks three sizes too big for you and when i last saw you it didnt look big enough peter hopped all around johnny chuck looking at him as if he didnt believe his own eyes  illustration is it really and truly you johnny chuck he cried  oh johnnys all right hes just been living on his own fat said another voice it was jimmy skunk who had spoken and he now stood holding out his hand to johnny chuck and grinning goodnaturedly he had come up without either of the others seeing him  peters big eyes opened wider than ever do you mean to say that he has been eating his own fat he gasped  johnny chuck and jimmy skunk both laughed no said jimmy skunk he didnt eat it but he lived on it just the same while he was asleep all winter dont you see he hasnt got a particle of fat on him now  but how could he live on it if he didnt eat it asked peter staring at johnny chuck as if he had never seen him before  jimmy skunk shrugged his shoulders dont ask me that is one of old mother natures secrets youll have to ask her he replied  and dont ask me said johnny chuck for ive been asleep all the time my but im hungry  so am i said another voice there was reddy fox grinning at them johnny chuck dove into the doorway of his house with peter rabbit at his heels for there was nowhere else to go jimmy skunk just stood still and chuckled he knew that reddy fox didnt dare touch him     iii  the singers of the smiling pool   mistress spring was making everybody happy on the green meadows and in the green forest and around the smiling pool with her gentle fingers she wakened one by one all the little sleepers who had spent the long winter dreaming of warm summer days and not knowing anything at all of rough blustering brother north wind or jack frost as they wakened many began to sing for joy but the clearest loudest singers of all lived in the smiling pool  it was a long time before peter rabbit and johnny chuck knew where they lived every night just before going to bed johnny chuck would sit on his doorstep just to listen and as he listened somehow he felt better and happier and he always had pleasant dreams after listening to the sweet singers of the smiling pool even after he had curled himself up for the night deep down in his snug bedroom he could hear those sweet voices and whenever he waked up in the night he would hear them      spring spring spring spring      beautiful beautiful beautiful spring      so gentle so loving so sweet and so fair      oh who can be cross when theres love in the air      be happy be joyful and join in our song      and help us to send the glad tidings along      spring spring spring spring      beautiful beautiful beautiful spring  when johnny chuck had first heard them he had looked in all the tree tops for the singers but not one could he see then he had thought that they must be hidden in the bushes but when he went to look he found that the sweet singers were not there it was very mysterious finally he asked peter rabbit if he knew who the sweet singers were and where they were peter didnt know but he was willing to try to find out peter is always willing to try to find out about things he doesnt already know about so johnny chuck and peter rabbit started out to find the sweet singers  i believe they are down in the old bulrushes around the smiling pool said peter rabbit as he stood listening with a hand behind one long ear  so over to the smiling pool they hurried the nearer they got the louder became the voices singing      spring spring spring spring      beautiful beautiful beautiful spring  but look as they would they couldnt see a single singer among the brown bulrushes it was very strange very strange indeed it seemed as if the voices came right out of the smiling pool itself  when peter rabbit made a little noise as he hopped out on the bank where he could look all over the smiling pool the singing stopped after he had sat perfectly still for a little while it began again there was no doubt about it this time those voices came right out of the water  johnny chuck stared at peter rabbit and peter stared at johnny chuck nobody was to be seen in the smiling pool and yet there were those voicesoh so many of themcoming right out of the water  how can birds stay under water and still sing asked johnny chuck  ho ho ho ha ha ha  peter rabbit and johnny chuck whirled around to find jerry muskrat peeping up at them from a hole in the bank almost under their feet  illustration ho ho ho thats the best joke this spring shouted jerry muskrat  ho ho ho thats the best joke this spring shouted jerry muskrat and laughed until he had to hold his sides birds under water ho ho ho     iv  johnny chuck finds out who the sweet singers are   johnny chuck couldnt keep away from the smiling pool no sir johnny chuck couldnt keep away from the smiling pool ever since he and peter rabbit had gone over there looking for the sweet singers who every night and part of the day told all who would listen how glad they were that mistress spring had come to the green meadows and the green forest johnny chuck had had something on his mind and this is why he couldnt keep away from the smiling pool  you see it was this way johnny and peter had thought that of course the sweet singers were birds they hadnt dreamed of anything else so of course they went looking for birds when they reached the smiling pool the voices came right out of the water johnny knew that some birds like many of the cousins of mrs quack can stay under water a long time and so he didnt know but some other birds might  jerry muskrat was always watching for johnny whenever he came to the smiling pool and his eyes would twinkle as he would gravely say  hello johnny chuck have you seen the birds sing under water yet  johnny would smile goodnaturedly and reply not yet jerry muskrat wont you point them out to me  then jerry would reply      two eyes you have bright as can be      perhaps some day youll learn to see  then johnny chuck would sit as still as ever he knew how and watch and watch the smiling pool but not a bird did he see in the water though the singers were still there one day a sudden thought popped into his head perhaps those singers were not birds at all why hadnt he thought of that before perhaps it was because he was looking so hard for birds that he hadnt seen anything else johnny began to look not for anything in particular but to see everything that he could  almost right away he saw some tiny little dark spots on the water they didnt look like much of anything they were so small that he hadnt noticed them before one of them was quite close to him and as johnny chuck looked at it it began to look like a tiny nose and thenwhy just then johnny was very sure that one of those singing voices came right from that very spot  he was so surprised that he hopped to his feet and excitedly beckoned to jerry muskrat the instant he did that the voices near him stopped singing and the little spots on the water disappeared leaving just the tiniest of little rings just such tiny little rings as drops of rain falling on the smiling pool would make and when that tiny spot nearest to him that looked like a tiny nose disappeared johnny chuck caught just a glimpse of a little form under the water  whywhyee the singers are grandfather frogs children cried johnny chuck  no theyre not but they are own cousins to them they are the grandchildren of old mr tree toad and they are called hylas said jerry muskrat laughing and rubbing his hands in great glee i told you that if you used your eyes youd learn to see  my but theyve got voices bigger than they are said johnny chuck as he started home across the green meadows im glad i know who the singers of the smiling pool are and i mustnt forget their name hylas what a funny name but farmer browns boy listening to their song that evening didnt call them hylas he said hear the peepers spring is surely here     v  johnny chuck becomes dissatisfied   johnny chuck was unhappy here it was the glad springtime when everybody is supposed to be the very happiest and johnny chuck was unhappy why was he unhappy well he hardly knew himself he had slept comfortably all the long winter he had awakened very very hungry but now he had plenty to eat all about him the birds were singing or busily at work building new homes and still johnny chuck felt unhappy it was dreadful to feel this way and not have any good reason for it  one bright morning johnny chuck sat on his doorstep watching drummer the woodpecker building a new home in the old appletree drummers red head flew back and forth back and forth and his sharp bill cut out tiny bits of wood it was slow work it was hard work but drummer seemed happy very happy indeed it was watching drummer that started johnny chuck to thinking about his own home he had always thought it a very nice home he had built it just as he wanted it from the doorstep he could look in all directions over the green meadows it had a front door and a hidden back door yes it was a very nice home indeed  but now all of a sudden johnny chuck became dissatisfied with his home it was too near the lone little path too many people knew where it was it wasnt big enough the front door ought to face the other way dear me what a surprising lot of faults a discontented heart can find with things that have always been just right it was so with johnny chuck that house in which he had spent so many happy days which had protected him from all harm of which he had been so proud when he first built it was now the meanest house in the world if other people had new houses why shouldnt he the more he thought about it the more dissatisfied and discontented he became and of course the more unhappy you know one cannot be dissatisfied and discontented and happy at the same time  now dissatisfied and discontented people are not at all pleasant to have around johnny chuck had always been one of the best natured of all the little meadow people and everybody liked him so jimmy skunk didnt know quite what to make of it when he came down the lone little path and found johnny chuck so out of sorts that he wouldnt even answer when spoken to  jimmy skunk was feeling very goodnatured himself he had just had a fine breakfast of fat beetles and he was at peace with all the world so he sat down beside johnny chuck and began to talk just as if johnny chuck was his usual goodnatured self  its a fine day said jimmy skunk  johnny chuck just sniffed  youre looking very fine said jimmy  johnny just scowled  i think youve got the best place on the green meadows for a house said jimmy pretending to admire the view  johnny scowled harder than ever  and such a splendid house said jimmy i wish i had one like it  im glad you like it you can have the old thing snapped johnny chuck  whats that demanded jimmy skunk opening his eyes very wide  i said that you can have it im going to move replied johnny chuck  now he really hadnt thought of moving until that very minute and he didnt know why he had said it but he had said it and because he is an obstinate little fellow he stuck to it  when can i move in asked jimmy skunk his eyes twinkling  right away if you want to replied johnny chuck and swaggered off down the lone little path leaving jimmy skunk to stare after him as if he thought johnny chuck had suddenly gone crazy as indeed he did     vi  johnny chuck turns tramp   johnny chuck had turned tramp yes sir johnny chuck had turned tramp it was a funny thing to do but he had done it he didnt know why he had done it excepting that he had become dissatisfied and discontented and unhappy in his old home and then almost without thinking what he was doing he had told jimmy skunk that he could have the house he had worked so hard to build the summer before and of which he had been so proud then johnny chuck had swaggered away down the lone little path without once looking back at the home he was leaving  where was he going well to tell the truth johnny didnt know he was going to see the world and perhaps when he had seen the world he would build him a new house so as long as he was in sight of jimmy skunk he swaggered along quite as if he was used to traveling about without any snug house to go to at night but right down in his heart johnny chuck didnt feel half so bold as he pretended  you see not since he was a little chuck and had run away from old mother chuck with peter rabbit had he ever been very far from his own doorstep he had always been content to grow fat and rolypoly right near his own home and listen to the tales of the great world from jimmy skunk and peter rabbit and bobby coon and unc billy possum all of whom are great travelers  but now here he was actually setting forth and without a home to come back to you see he had made up his mind that no matter what happened he wouldnt come back after having given his house to jimmy skunk  when he had reached a place where he thought jimmy skunk couldnt see him johnny chuck turned and looked back and a queer little feeling seemed to make a lump that filled his throat and choked him the fact is johnny chuck already began to feel homesick but he swallowed very hard and tried to make himself think that he was having a splendid time he stopped looking back and started on and as he tramped along he tried to sing a song he had once heard jimmy skunk sing      the world may stretch full far and wide      what matters that to me      ill tramp it up ill tramp it down      for i am bold and free  it was a very brave little song but johnny chuck didnt feel half so brave and bold as he tried to think he did already he was beginning to wonder where he should spend the night then he thought of old whitetail the marshhawk who had given him such a fright and had so nearly caught him when he was a little fellow the thought made him look around hastily and there was old whitetail himself sailing back and forth hungrily just ahead of him a great fear took possession of johnny chuck and he made himself as flat as possible in the grass for there was no place to hide he made up his mind that anyway he would fight  nearer and nearer came old whitetail finally he passed right over johnny chuck but he didnt offer to touch him indeed it seemed to johnny that old whitetail actually grinned and winked at him and right then all his fear left him  pooh said johnny chuck scornfully whos afraid of him he suddenly realized that he was no longer a helpless little chuck who couldnt take care of himself but big and strong with sharp teeth with which his old enemy had no mind to make a closer acquaintance when there were mice and snakes to be caught without fighting so he puffed out his chest and went on and actually began to enjoy himself and almost wished for a chance to show how big and strong he was     vii  johnnys first adventure   after old whitetail the marshhawk passed johnny chuck without offering to touch him johnny began to feel very brave and bold and important he strutted and swaggered along as much as his short legs would let him he held his head very high already he felt that he had had an adventure and he longed for more he forgot the terrible lonesome feeling of a little while before he forgot that he had given away the only home he had he didnt know just why but right down deep inside he had a sudden feeling that he really didnt care a thing about that old home in fact he felt as if he wouldnt care if he never had another home yes sir that is the way that johnny chuck felt do you know why just because he had just begun to realize how big and strong he really was  now it is a splendid thing to feel big and strong and brave a very splendid thing but it is a bad thing to let that feeling turn to pride foolish pride of course old whitetail hadnt really been afraid of johnny chuck he had simply passed johnny with a wink because there was plenty to eat without the trouble of fighting and whitetail doesnt fight just for the fun of it  but foolish johnny chuck really thought that old whitetail was afraid of him the more he thought about it the more tickled he felt and the more puffed up he felt he began to talk to himself and to brag yes sir johnny chuck began to brag     im not afraid of any one      theyre all afraid of me      i only have to show my teeth      to make them turn and flee  pooh said a voice pooh it would take two like you to make me run away  johnny chuck gave a startled jump there was a strange chuck glaring at him from behind a little bunch of grass he was a big gray old chuck whom johnny never had seen on the green meadows before and he didnt look the least bit afraid no sir he didnt look the teeniest weeniest bit afraid somehow johnny chuck didnt feel half so big and strong and brave as he had a few minutes before but it wouldnt do to let this stranger know it of course not so though he felt very small inside johnny made all his hair bristle up and tried to look very fierce  who are you and what are you doing on my green meadows he demanded  your green meadows your green meadows ho ho ho your green meadows the stranger laughed an unpleasant laugh how long since you owned the green meadows i have just come down on to them from the old pasture and i like the looks of them so well that i think i will stay so run along little boaster there isnt room for both of us here and the sooner you trot along the better the stranger suddenly showed all his teeth and gritted them unpleasantly  now when johnny chuck heard this great anger filled his heart a stranger had ordered him to leave the green meadows where he had been born and always lived he could hardly believe his own ears he johnny chuck would show this stranger who was master here  with a squeal of rage johnny sprang at the gray old chuck then began such a fight as the merry little breezes of old mother west wind had never seen before they danced around excitedly and cried how dreadful and hoped that johnny chuck would win for you know they loved him very much  over and over the two little fighters rolled biting and scratching and tearing and growling and snarling jolly round red mr sun hid his face behind a cloud so as not to see such a dreadful sight the stranger had been in many fights and he was very crafty for a while johnny felt that he was getting the worst of it and he began to wonder if he really would have to leave the green meadows the very thought filled him with new rage and he fought harder than ever  now the stranger was old and his teeth were worn while johnny was young and his teeth were very sharp after a long long time johnny felt the stranger growing weaker johnny fought harder than ever at last the stranger cried enough and when he could break away started back towards the old pasture johnny chuck had won     viii  johnny has another adventure   johnny chuck lay stretched out on the cool soft grass of the green meadows panting for breath he was very tired and very sore his face was scratched and bitten his clothes were torn and he smarted dreadfully in a dozen places but still johnny chuck was happy when he raised his head to look he could see a gray old chuck limping off towards the old pasture once in a while the gray old chuck would turn his head and show his teeth but he kept right on towards the old pasture johnny chuck smiled  it had been a great fight and more than once johnny chuck had thought that he should have to give up he thought of this now and then he thought with shame of how he had bragged and boasted just before the fight what if he had lost he resolved that he would never again brag or boast but he also made up his mind that if any one should pick a quarrel with him he would show that he wasnt afraid  it was getting late in the afternoon when johnny finally felt rested enough to go on he had got to find a place to spend the night he hobbled along for he was very stiff and sore until he came to the edge of the green meadows where they meet the green forest  jolly round red mr sun was almost ready to go down to his bed behind the purple hills shadows were already beginning to creep through the green forest somehow they gave johnny chuck that same lonesome feeling that he had had when he first left his old home you see he had always lived out in the green meadows and somehow he was afraid of the green forest in the night  so instead of going into the green forest he wandered along the edge of it looking for a place in which to spend the night at last he came to a hollow log lying just out on the edge of the green meadows very carefully johnny chuck examined it to be sure that no one else was using it  its just the place im looking for he said aloud  just then there was a sharp hiss a very fierce hiss johnny chuck felt the hair on his neck rise as it always did when he heard that hiss and he wasnt at all surprised when he turned his head to find mr blacksnake close by mr blacksnake glided swiftly up to the old log and coiled himself in front of the opening then he raised his head and ran out his tongue in the most impudent way  run along johnny chuck ive decided to sleep here myself tonight he said sharply  now when johnny chuck was a very little fellow he had been in great fear of mr blacksnake as he had had reason to be and because he didnt know any better he had been afraid ever since mr blacksnake knew this and so now he looked as ugly as he knew how but you see he didnt know about the great fight that johnny chuck had just won  now to win an honest fight always makes one feel very strong and very sure of oneself johnny looked at mr blacksnake and saw that mr blacksnake didnt look half as big as johnny had always thought he did he made up his mind that as he had found the old log first he had the best right to it  i found it first and im going to keep it snapped johnny chuck and with every hair on end and gritting his teeth he walked straight towards mr blacksnake  now mr blacksnake is a great bluffer while at heart he is really a coward with a fierce hiss he rushed right at johnny chuck expecting to see him turn tail and run but johnny stood his ground and showed all his sharp teeth instead of attacking johnny mr blacksnake glided past him and sneaked away through the grass  johnny chuck chuckled as he crept into the hollow log  only a coward runs away without fighting he murmured sleepily     ix  another strange chuck   johnny chuck awoke just as jolly round red mr sun pulled his own nightcap off at first johnny couldnt think where he was he blinked and blinked then he rolled over ouch cried johnny chuck you see he was so stiff and sore from his great fight the day before that it hurt to roll over but when he felt the smart of those wounds he remembered where he was he was in the old hollow log that he had found on the edge of the green meadows just before dark it was the first time that johnny had ever slept anywhere excepting underground and as he lay blinking his eyes it seemed very strange and rather nice too  well well well what are you doing here cried a sharp voice  johnny chuck looked towards the open end of the old log there peeping in was a little face as sharp as the voice  hello chatterer cried johnny  i say what are you doing here persisted chatterer the red squirrel for it was he  just waking up replied johnny with a grin  its time replied chatterer but that isnt telling me what you are doing so far from home  i havent any home said johnny his face growing just a wee bit wistful  you havent any home chatterers voice sounded as if he didnt think he had heard aright what have you done with it  given it to jimmy skunk replied johnny chuck  now chatterer never gives anything to anybody and how any one could give away his home was more than he could understand he stared at johnny as if he thought johnny had gone crazy finally he found his tongue i dont believe it he snapped if jimmy skunk has got your old home its because he put you out of it  no such thing id like to see jimmy skunk or anybody else put me out of my home johnny chuck spoke scornfully i gave it to him because i didnt want it any longer im going to see the world and then im going to build me a new home everybody else seems to be building new homes this spring why shouldnt i  im not retorted chatterer i know enough to know when i am well off      who has a discontented heart      is sure to play a sorry part  johnny chuck crawled out of the old log and stretched himself somewhat painfully that may be but there are different kinds of discontent       who never looks for better things      will live his life in little rings  well i must be moving along if i am to see the world so johnny chuck bade chatterer goodby and started on it was very delightful to wander over the green meadows on such a beautiful spring morning the violets and the windflowers nodded to him and the dandelions smiled up at him johnny almost forgot his torn clothes and the bites and scratches of his great fight with the gray old chuck the day before it was fun to just go where he pleased and not have a care in the world  he was thinking of this as he sat up to look over the green meadows his heart gave a great throb what was that over near the lone elm tree it wasyes it certainly was another chuck could it be the old gray chuck come back for another fight a great anger filled the heart of johnny chuck and he whistled sharply the strange chuck didnt answer johnny ground his teeth and started for the lone elmtree he would show this other chuck who was master of the green meadows     x  why johnny chuck didnt fight        anger is an awful thing      it never stops to reason      it boils right over all at once      no matter what the season  it was so with johnny chuck the minute he caught sight of the strange chuck over by the lone elmtree anger filled his heart and fairly boiled over until he was in a terrible rage of course it was foolish very foolish indeed the strange chuck hadnt said or done anything to make johnny chuck angry not the least thing in the world excepting to come down on to the green meadows now the green meadows are very broad and there is room for many chucks it was pure selfishness on the part of johnny chuck to want to drive away every other chuck  but anger never stops to reason it didnt now johnny chuck hurried as fast as his short legs could take him towards the lone elmtree and in his mind was just one thoughtto drive that strange chuck off the green meadows and to punish him so that he never never would dare even think of coming back so great was johnnys anger that every hair stood on end and as he ran he chattered and scolded  ill fix him these are my green meadows and no one else has any business here unless i say so ill fix him ill fix him  then johnny would grind his teeth and in his eyes was the ugliest look he wasnt nice to see not a bit nice the merry little breezes of old mother west wind didnt know what to make of him could this be the johnny chuck they had known so long the goodnatured happy johnny chuck whom everybody loved they drew away from him for they didnt want anything to do with any one in such a frightful temper but johnny chuck didnt even notice and if he had he wouldnt have cared that is the trouble with anger it crowds out everything else when it once fills the heart  when johnny had first seen the stranger he had thought right away that it was the old gray chuck with whom he had had such a terrible fight the day before and whom he whipped perhaps that was one reason for johnny chucks terrible anger now for the old gray chuck had tried to drive johnny chuck off the green meadows  but when he had to stop for breath and sat up to look again he saw that it wasnt the old gray chuck at all it was a younger chuck and much smaller than the old gray chuck it was smaller than johnny himself  hell be all the easier to whip muttered johnny as he started on again never once thinking of how unfair it would be to fight with one smaller than himself that was because he was so angry anger never is fair  pretty soon he reached the lone elmtree the stranger wasnt to be seen no sir the stranger wasnt anywhere in sight johnny chuck sat up and looked this way and looked that way but the stranger was nowhere in sight  pooh said johnny chuck hes afraid to fight hes a coward but he cant get away from me so easily hes hiding and ill find him and then johnny didnt finish but he ground his teeth and it wasnt a pleasant sound to hear  so johnny chuck hunted for the stranger and the longer he hunted the angrier he grew somehow the stranger managed to keep out of his sight he was almost ready to give up when he almost stumbled over the stranger hiding in a little clump of bushes and then a funny thing happened what do you think it was  why all the anger left johnny chuck his hair no longer stood on end he didnt know why but all of a sudden he felt foolish very foolish indeed  who are you he demanded gruffly  iim polly chuck replied the stranger in a small timid voice    xi  the greatest thing in the world   johnny chuck had begun to think about his clothes yes sir he spent a whole lot of time thinking about how he looked and wishing that he had a handsomer coat for the first time in all his life he began to envy reddy fox because of the beautiful red coat of which reddy is so proud it seemed to johnny that his own coat was so plain and so dull that no one would look at it twice besides it was torn now because of the great fight johnny had had with the old gray chuck who came down from the old pasture johnny smoothed it down and brushed it carefully and tried to make himself look as spick and span as he knew how  oh dear he sighed i dont see why old mother nature didnt give me as handsome a coat as she did reddy fox and there are jimmy skunk and happy jack the gray squirrel andandwhy almost every one has a handsomer coat than i have now this wasnt at all like johnny chuck first he had been discontented with his house and had given it to jimmy skunk now he was discontented with his clothes what was coming over johnny chuck he really didnt know himself at least he wouldnt have admitted that he knew but right down deep in his heart was a great desirethe desire to have polly chuck admire him yes sir that is what it was and it seemed to him that she would admire him a great deal more if he wore fine clothes you see he hadnt learned yet what peter rabbit had learned a long time ago which is that       fine clothes but catch the passing eye      fine deeds win love from low and high  so johnny chuck wished and wished that he had a handsome suit but as he didnt and no amount of wishing would bring him one he just made the one he did have look as good as he could and then went in search of polly chuck  sometimes she would not notice him at all sometimes he would find her shyly peeping at him from behind a clump of grass then johnny chuck would try to make himself look very important and would strut about as if he really did own the green meadows  sometimes she would hide from him and when he found her she would run away other times she would be just as nice to him as she could be and they would have a jolly time hunting for sweet clover and other nice things to eat then johnny chucks heart would swell until it seemed to him that it would fairly burst with happiness  instead of wanting to drive polly chuck away from the green meadows as he had the old gray chuck johnny began to worry for fear that polly chuck might not stay on the green meadows whenever he thought of that his heart would sink way way down and he would hurry to look for her and make sure that she was still there  when he was beside her he felt very big and strong and brave and longed for a chance to show her how brave he was she was such a timid little thing herself that the least little thing frightened her and johnny chuck was glad that this was so for it gave him a chance to protect her  when he wasnt with her he spent his time looking for new patches of sweet clover to take her to at first she wouldnt go without a great deal of coaxing but after a while he didnt have to coax at all she seemed to delight to be with him as much as he did to be with her  so johnny chuck grew happier and happier he was happier than he had ever been in all his life before you see johnny chuck had found the greatest thing in the world do you know what it is it is called love     xii  johnny chuck proves his love   these spring days were beautiful days on the green meadows it seemed to johnny chuck that the green meadows never had been so lovely or the songs of the birds so sweet he had forgotten all about his old friends jimmy skunk and peter rabbit and the other little meadow people  you see he couldnt think of anybody but polly chuck and he didnt want to be with anybody but polly chuck he had even forgotten that he had started out to see the world he didnt care anything more about the world all he wanted was to be where polly chuck was then he was perfectly happy that was because johnny chuck had found the greatest thing in the world which is love but johnny still had one great wish the wish that he might show polly chuck just how brave and strong he was and how well he could take care of her  one morning they were feasting in a patch of sweet clover over near an old stone wall it was the same stone wall in which johnny chuck had escaped from old whitetail the marshhawk when johnny was a very little fellow  suddenly polly gave a little scream of fright johnny chuck looked up to see a dog almost upon her johnnys first thought was to run to the old stone wall he was nearer to it than polly was then he saw that that dreadful dog would catch polly before she could reach the stone wall  a great rage filled johnnys heart just as it had when he had fought the old gray chuck every hair stood on end not with fear but with anger and he sprang in front of polly  run polly run he cried and polly ran  but johnny didnt run oh my no johnny didnt run he drew himself together ready to spring he showed all his sharp teeth and ground them savagely little sparks of fire seemed to snap out of his eyes there was no sign of fear in johnny chuck then not the least little bit just in front of him the dog stopped and barked he was a little dog a young and foolish dog and he was terribly excited he barked until he almost lost his breath he didnt like the looks of johnny chucks sharp teeth so he circled around johnny trying to get behind him but johnny turned as the dog circled and always the little dog found those sharp teeth directly in front of him he barked and barked until it seemed as if he would bark his head off  finally the little dog who was young and foolish grew tired of just dancing around and barking pooh said he to himself hes nothing but a chuck then he stopped barking and sprang straight at johnny with an ugly growl  johnny chuck was ready for him and he was quicker than the little dog his sharp teeth closed on one of the little dogs ears and he held on while with his stout claws he scratched and tore  the little dog who was young and foolish and hadnt yet learned how to fight couldnt get hold of johnny chuck anywhere then he tried to shake johnny chuck off but he couldnt because johnny held on to that ear with his sharp teeth  kiyiyiyiyi yelled the little dog for those teeth hurt dreadfully kiyiyiyiyi  over and over they rolled and tumbled the little dog trying to get away and johnny chuck holding on to the little dogs ear finally johnny had to let go to get his breath the little dog sprang to his feet and started for home across the green meadows as fast as he could run  johnny chuck shook himself and grinned as he heard the little dogs kiyiyiyi grow fainter and fainter im glad it wasnt bowser the hound muttered johnny chuck as he started towards the old stone wall there he found polly chuck peeping out at him and all of a tremble with fright  my how brave you are said polly chuck  pooh thats nothing replied johnny chuck     xiii  polly and johnny chuck go house hunting   johnny chuck was happy yes sir johnny chuck was happyso happy that he felt like doing foolish things you see johnny chuck loved polly chuck and he knew now that polly chuck loved him he had known it ever since he had fought with the foolish little dog who had dared to frighten polly chuck  after the fight was over and the little dog had been sent home kiyi yiing polly chuck had crept out of the old stone wall where she had been hiding and snuggled up beside johnny chuck and looked at him as if she thought him the most wonderful chuck in all the world as indeed she did and johnny had felt his heart swell and swell with happiness until it almost choked him  so now once more johnny chuck began to think of a new home he had forgotten all about seeing the world all he wanted now was a new house built just so with a front door and a hidden back door and big enough for two for no more would johnny chuck live alone so with shy little polly chuck by his side he began to search for a place to make a new home  the more he thought about it the more johnny wanted to build his house over by the lone elmtree where he had first seen polly chuck it was a splendid place from it you could see a great way in every direction it would be shady on hot summer days it was near a great big patch of sweet clover it seemed to johnny chuck that it was the best place on all the green meadows he whispered as much to polly chuck she turned up her nose  its too low said she  oh replied johnny and looked puzzled for really it was one of the highest places on the green meadows  yes said polly in a brisk decided way its altogether too low probably it is wet  oh said johnny once more of course he knew that it wasnt wet but if polly didnt want to live there he wouldnt say a word of course not  now theres a place right over there continued polly i think well build our house right there  johnny opened his mouth to say something but he closed it again without speaking and meekly trotted after polly chuck to the place she had picked out it was in a little hollow johnny knew before he began to dig that the ground was damp almost wet but if polly wanted to live there she should and johnny began to dig by and by he stopped to rest where was polly he looked this way and that way anxiously just as he was getting ready to go hunt for her she came hurrying back  illustration if polly wanted to live there she should  ive found a perfectly lovely place for our new home she cried  johnny looked ruefully at the hole he had worked so hard to dig then he brushed the dirt from his clothes and followed her this time johnny had no fault to find with the ground it was high and dry but polly had chosen a spot close to a road that wound down across the green meadows johnny shook his head doubtfully but he began to dig this time however he kept one eye on polly chuck and the minute he found that she was wandering off he stopped digging and chuckled as he watched her it wasnt long before back she came in great excitement she had found a better place  so they wandered over the green meadows polly leading the way johnny had learned by this time to waste no time digging and he had made up his mind to one thing what do you think it was it was this he would follow polly until she found a place to suit him but when she did find such a place she shouldnt have a chance to change her mind again     xiv  a new home at last        home no matter where it be      or it be big or small      is just the one place in the world      that dearest is of all  johnny chuck was thinking of this as he worked with might and main it was a new house that he was building but already he felt that it was home and every time he thought of it he felt a queer little tugging at his heart you see while it was his home it was polly chucks home too and that made it doubly dear to johnny chuck even before it was finished  and where do you think johnny was building his new home it was clear way over on the edge of farmer browns old orchard yes sir after all the fuss johnny chuck had made over any other chuck living on the green meadows and after driving the old gray chuck back to the old pasture johnny chuck had left the green meadows himself  it wasnt of his own accord that johnny chuck had left the green meadows no indeed he loved them too well for that but he loved polly chuck more and although he had grumbled a little he had followed her up to the old orchard and now they were going to stay there sometimes johnny shivered when he thought how near were farmer brown and farmer browns boy and bowser the hound  he had never been so far from his old home on the green meadows before and it was all very strange up here it was very lovely too besides it was in this very old orchard that polly chuck had been born and she knew every part of it johnny felt better when he found that out so he set to work to build a home and this time he meant business polly chuck could change her mind as many times as she pleased that was going to be their home and that was where they were going to live  now johnny chuck had grown wise in the ways of the world since he first ran away from the home where he was born twice since then he had built a new home and now this would be better than either of the others he paid no heed to polly when she pouted because he did not dig where she wanted him to he went from tree to tree big old apple trees they were and at the very last tree way down in a corner near a tumbleddown stone wall he found what he wantedtwo spreading roots gave him a chance to dig between them  polly watched him get ready for work and she pouted some more  it would be a lot nicer out in that grassy place and a lot easier to dig said she  johnny chuck smiled and made the dirt fly it certainly would be easier to dig said he when he stopped for breath easier for me and easier for bowser the hound or for old granny fox if either wanted to dig us out now these old roots are just far enough apart for us to go in and out they make a beautiful doorway but bowser the hound cannot get through if he tries and he cant make our doorway any larger dont you see how safe it is  polly chuck had to own up that it was safer than a home in the open could possibly be and johnny went on digging he made a long hall down to the snuggest of bedrooms deep deep down under ground then he made a long back hall and all the sand from this he carried out the front way by and by he made a back door at the end of the back hall and it opened right behind a big stone fallen from the old stone wall you would never have guessed that there was a back door there  his new house was finished now and johnny chuck and polly chuck sat on the doorstep and watched jolly round red mr sun go to bed behind the purple hills and were happy     xv  sammy jay finds the new home   johnny chuck was missed from his old home on the green meadows if he had known how much he was missed he certainly would have tried to go back for at least a call on his old neighbors there had been great surprise when it had been discovered that jimmy skunk was living in johnnys old house and at first some of the little meadow people were inclined to look at jimmy a wee bit distrustfully when he told how johnny chuck had given away his house  when johnny sent back word by the merry little breezes that it was true they believed jimmy skunk and forgot the unpleasant things that they had begun to hint at about him but they one and all thought that johnny chuck must be crazy yes sir they thought that johnny chuck must be crazy they were sure of it when the merry little breezes brought word of how johnny had started out to see the world  but everybody was so busy about their own affairs in the beautiful bright springtime that they couldnt spend much time wondering about johnny chuck they missed him every time they passed his old house and then forgot him that is most of the little meadow people did  peter rabbit didnt peter used to stop every day to gossip with johnny chuck and tell him all the news and now that johnny chuck was no longer there peter missed him greatly jimmy skunk was always asleep or off somewhere besides he was such a traveler that he knew all the news almost as soon as peter himself  the merry little breezes told peter that johnny chuck was still on the green meadows hunting for a new home so peter made up his mind that just as soon as johnny got settled peter would hunt him up and call you see he never dreamed that johnny would leave the green meadows and he thought that of course the merry little breezes would tell him just where johnny chucks new house was whenever it was built but there is where peter made a mistake  the merry little breezes are the friends of all the little meadow and forest people but they wouldnt be very long if they told everything that they find out       their merry tongues they guard full well      and things they shouldnt never tell      for long ago they learned the way      to keep a secret night and day  and so when they found johnny chucks new house in the corner of farmer browns old orchard they promised johnny that they wouldnt tell anybody and they didnt so it was a long time before any one else found out what had become of johnny chuck for no one thought of looking in the corner of the old orchard  the merry little breezes used to come every day and bring johnny chuck the news and he and polly chuck would laugh and tickle as they thought of peter rabbit hunting and hunting and never finding them  then one morning as johnny chuck sat on his doorstep half dozing in the sun with his heart filled with contentment he happened to look up straight into two sharp eyes peering down at him from among the leaves of the appletree under which he had built his house he knew those eyes they were such sharp eyes that they were unpleasant he didnt even have to look for the blue and white coat of the owner to know who had found his snug home but he pretended to keep right on dozing and pretty soon the owner of the eyes disappeared without making a sound  oh dear sighed johnny chuck now the whole world will know where we live for that was sammy jay then his face brightened as he added anyway he didnt see polly chuck and he doesnt know anything about her so ill keep twice as sharp a watch as before     xvi  sammy jay plans mischief        mischief may not mean to be really truly bad      but somehow it seems to make other people sad      does a mean unpleasant thing and tries to think it fun      then alas it runs away when trouble has begun  of all the little people who live in the green forest and on the green meadows none is more mischievous than sammy jay it seems sometimes as if there was more mischief under that pert little cap sammy jay wears than in the heads of all the other little meadow and forest people put together when he isnt actually in mischief sammy jay is planning mischief you see it has grown to be a habit with sammy jay and habits especially bad habits have a way of growing and growing  now sammy jay had no quarrel with johnny chuck oh my no he would have told you that he liked johnny chuck everybody likes johnny chuck but just as soon as sammy jay found johnny chucks new house he began to plan mischief he didnt really want any harm to come to johnny chuck but he wanted to make johnny uncomfortable that is sammy jays idea of funseeing somebody else uncomfortable so he slipped away to a thick hemlocktree in the green forest to try to think of some plan to tease johnny chuck and make him uncomfortable  of course he knew that johnny had hidden his new house in the corner of farmer browns old orchard because he wanted it to be a secret he didnt know why johnny wanted it a secret and he didnt care if johnny wanted it a secret it would be fun to tell everybody about it as he sat wondering who he should tell first he saw reddy fox trotting down the lone little path  hi reddy fox he shouted  reddy looked up hello sammy jay what have you got on your mind this morning said reddy  nothing much replied sammy jay whats the news  reddy grinned there isnt any news said he i was just going to ask you the same thing  it was sammy jays turn to grin just as if i could tell you any news reddy fox just as if i could tell you any news he exclaimed why everybody knows that you are so smart that you find out everything as soon as it happens  reddy fox felt flattered you know people who do a great deal of flattering themselves are often the very easiest to flatter if you know how reddy pretended to be very modest but no one likes to be thought smart and important more than reddy fox does and it pleased him greatly that sammy jay should think him so smart that no one could tell him any news sammy knew this perfectly well and he chuckled to himself as he watched reddy fox pretending to be so modest  have you called on johnny chuck at his new home yet asked sammy jay in the most matteroffact way  no replied reddy but i mean to soon he said this just as if he knew all about johnny chucks new home when all the time he hadnt the remotest idea in the world where it was in fact he had hunted and hunted for it but hadnt found a trace of it and all the time sammy jay knew that reddy didnt know where it was but sammy didnt let on that he knew  i just happened to be up in farmer browns old orchard this morning so i thought id pay johnny chuck a call said sammy and chuckled as he saw reddys ears prick up by the way he thinks you dont know where he lives now  huh said reddy fox as if johnny chuck could fool me well i must be moving along goodby sammy jay  reddy trotted off towards the green meadows but the minute he was out of sight of sammy jay he turned towards farmer browns old orchard just as sammy jay had known he would  i guess johnny chuck will have a visitor chuckled sammy jay as he started to look for jimmy skunk     xvii  more mischief        mischiefs like a snowball      sent rolling down a hill      with every turn it bigger grows      and bigger bigger still  sammy jay had started mischief by telling reddy fox where johnny chucks new house was if you had asked him sammy jay would have said that he hadnt told all he had said was that he had happened to be up in farmer browns old orchard and so had called on johnny chuck in his new house  now reddy fox is very sly oh very sly he had pretended to sammy jay that he knew all the time where johnny chuck was living when he left sammy jay he had started in the direction of the green meadows just as if he had no thought of going over to farmer browns old orchard  but sammy jay is just as sly as reddy fox he wasnt fooled for one minute not one little minute he chuckled to himself as he started to look for jimmy skunk then he changed his mind  i think ill go up to the old orchard myself said sammy jay and away he flew  he got there first and hid in the top of a big appletree where he could see all that went on it wasnt long before he saw reddy fox steal out from the green forest and over to the old orchard reddy was nervous very nervous you see it was broad daylight and the old orchard was very near farmer browns house reddy knew that he ought to have waited until night but he knew that then johnny chuck would be fast asleep now perhaps johnny chuck thinking that no one knew where he lived would not be on watch and he might be able to catch johnny  so reddy with one eye on farmer browns house and one eye on the watch for some sign of johnny chuck stole into the old orchard every few steps he would stop and look and listen at every little noise he would start nervously then sammy jay would chuckle under his breath  so reddy fox crept and tiptoed about through the old orchard every minute he grew more nervous and every minute he grew more disappointed for he could find no sign of johnny chucks house he began to think that sammy jay had fooled him and the very thought made him grind his teeth at last he decided to give it up  he was down in the far corner of the old orchard close by the old stone wall now and he got all ready to jump over the old stone wall when he just happened to look on the other side of the big appletree he was under and there was what he was looking forjohnny chucks new house johnny chuck wasnt in sight but there was the new house and johnny must be either inside or not far away reddy grinned it was a sly wicked hungry grin he flattened himself out in the grass behind the big appletree  ill give johnny chuck the surprise of his life muttered reddy fox under his breath  now sammy jay had been watching all this time he knew that johnny chuck was safely inside his house for johnny had seen reddy when he first came into the old orchard and sammy knew that johnny chuck knew that when reddy found that new house he would hide just as he had done  johnny chuck wont come out again today and there wont be any excitement at all thought sammy jay in disappointment for he had hoped to see a fight between reddy fox and johnny chuck just then sammy looked over to farmer browns house and there was farmer browns boy getting ready to saw wood the imp of mischief under sammys pert cap gave him an idea he flew over to the old appletree just over reddys head and began to scream at the top of his lungs  farmer browns boy stopped work and looked over towards the old orchard  when a jay screams like that there is usually a fox around he muttered as he unfastened bowser the hound     xviii  farmer browns boy makes a discovery   reddy fox glared up at sammy jay whats the matter with you snarled reddy fox why dont you mind your own affairs instead of making trouble for other people you see reddy was afraid that johnny chuck would hear sammy jay and take warning  hello reddy fox i thought you had gone down to the green meadows sammy said this as if he was very much surprised to see reddy there he wasnt for you know he had been watching reddy hunt for johnny chucks new house but reddy had pretended that he was going down to the green meadows early that morning and so now sammy pretended that he had thought that reddy really had gone  i changed my mind he snapped what are you screaming so for  just to exercise my lungs so as to be sure that i can scream when i want to replied sammy screaming still louder  well go somewhere else and scream i want to sleep said reddy crossly  now sammy jay knew perfectly well that reddy fox had no thought of taking a nap but was hiding there to try to catch johnny chuck and sammy knew that farmer browns boy could hear him scream and that he knew that when sammy screamed that way it meant there was a fox about sitting in the top of the appletree sammy could see farmer browns boy starting for the old orchard with bowser the hound running ahead of him  farmer browns boy had no gun so sammy knew that no harm would come to reddy but that reddy would get a dreadful scare and that is what sammy wanted just out of pure mischief so he screamed louder than ever  reddy fox lost his temper he sat up and called sammy jay all the bad names he could think of he forgot where he was he told sammy jay what he thought of him and what he would do to him if ever he caught him  sammy jay kept right on screaming he made such a noise that reddy didnt hear footsteps coming nearer and nearer suddenly there was a great roar right behind him bow wow wow bow wow wow wow just like that  reddy was so frightened that he didnt even look to see where he was jumping and bumped his head against the appletree then he started for the green forest with bowser the hound at his heels  sammy jay laughed till he lost his breath and nearly tumbled off his perch then he flew away still laughing he thought it the greatest joke ever  farmer browns boy had followed bowser the hound into the old orchard  i wonder what a fox was doing up here in broad daylight said he talking to himself perhaps one of my hens has stolen her nest down here and he has found it ill have a look anyway  so he walked on down to the far corner of the old orchard straight to the place from which he had seen reddy fox jump when he got there of course he saw johnny chucks new house right away  ho cried farmer browns boy brer fox was hunting chucks ill keep my eye on this and if mr chuck makes any trouble in my garden ill know where to catch him     xix  johnny chucks pride   ever since farmer browns boy and reddy fox had found his new house in the far corner of the old orchard johnny chuck had been worried it was not that he was afraid for himself oh my no johnny chuck felt perfectly able to take care of himself but there was polly chuck he was terribly afraid that something might happen to polly chuck you see she was not big and strong like him and then polly chuck was apt to be careless so for a while johnny chuck worried a great deal  but reddy fox didnt come again in daytime you see bowser the hound had given him such a scare that he didnt dare to he sometimes came at night and sniffed hungrily at johnny chucks doorway but johnny and polly were safe inside and this didnt trouble them a bit and farmer browns boy seemed to have forgotten all about the new house so after a while johnny chuck stopped worrying so much the fact is johnny chuck had something else to think about he had a secret yes sir johnny chuck had a secret  sammy jay came up to the old orchard almost every morning his sharp eyes were not long in finding out that johnny chuck had a secret but try as he would he could not find out what that secret was whatever it was it made johnny chuck very happy he would come out on his doorstep and smile and sometimes give a funny little whistle of pure joy  it puzzled sammy jay a great deal he couldnt see why johnny chuck should be any happier than he ever was to be sure it was a happy time of year everybody was happy for it was springtime and the green forest and the green meadows even the old pasture were very lovely but somehow sammy jay felt sure that it was something more than this a secret that johnny chuck was keeping all to himself that was making him so happy but what it was sammy jay couldnt imagine he spent so much time thinking about it and wondering what it could be that it actually kept him out of mischief  one morning johnny chuck came out looking happier than ever he chuckled and chuckled as only a happy chuck can then he did foolish things he kicked up his heels he rolled over and over in the grass he whistled he even tried to sing which is something no chuck can do or should ever try to do then suddenly he scrambled to his feet carefully brushed his coat and tried to look very dignified he strutted back and forth in front of his doorway as if he was very proud of something there was pride in the very way in which he took each step there was pride in the very way in which he held his head it was too much for sammy jay  what are you so proud about johnny chuck he demanded in his harsh voice if i didnt have a better looking coat than youve got i wouldnt put on airs  you know sammy jay is very proud of his own handsome blue and white coat and dearly loves to show it off  it isnt that said johnny chuck  well if it is because you think yourself so smart to hide yourself up here in the old orchard let me tell you that i found you out long ago and so did reddy fox and bowser the hound and farmer browns boy sneered sammy jay in the most disagreeable way  it isnt that said johnny chuck  well what is it then snapped sammy jay  thats for you to find out replied johnny chuck  theres foolish pride and silly pride and pride of low degree  a better pride is honest pride and thats the pride for me  and with that johnny chuck disappeared in his new house     xx  sammy jay understands   it was a beautiful morning jolly round red mr sun had thrown his bedclothes off very early and started to climb up the sky smiling his broadest old mother west wind had swept his path clear of clouds the merry little breezes who you know are mother west winds children had danced across the green meadows up to the old orchard where they pelted each other with white and pink petals of apple blossoms until the ground was covered each appletree was like a huge bouquet of loveliness yes indeed it was very beautiful that spring morning  sammy jay had gotten up almost as early as mr sun and old mother west wind as soon as he had swallowed his breakfast he flew up to the old orchard and hid among the white and pink apple blossoms to watch for johnny chuck you see he knew that johnny chuck had some sort of a secret which filled johnny with very great pride but what it was sammy jay couldnt even guess and nothing troubles sammy jay quite so much as the feeling that he cannot find out the secrets of other people so he sat very very still among the apple blossoms and waited and watched  by and by johnny chuck appeared on his doorstep he seemed very much excited did johnny chuck he sat up very straight and looked this way and looked that way he looked up in the appletrees and sammy jay held his breath for fear that johnny would see him but sammy was so well hidden that bright as johnny chucks eyes are they failed to see him then johnny chuck actually climbed up on the old stone wall so as to see better and he sat there a long time looking and looking  sammy jay grew impatient he seems to be terribly watchful this morning i never knew him to be so watchful before i dont understand it muttered sammy to himself  after a while johnny chuck seemed quite satisfied that there was no one about he hopped down from the old stone wall and scampered over to the doorway of his new house and there he began to chatter sammy jay stretched his neck until it ached trying to hear what johnny chuck was saying but he couldnt because johnnys head was inside his doorway  pretty soon johnny chuck backed out and sat up and he looked very proud and important then sammy jay saw something that nearly took his breath away it was the head of polly chuck peeping out of the doorway it was the first time that he had seen polly chuck  why gasped sammy jay it must be that johnny chuck has a mate and i didnt know a thing about it so thats his secret and the reason he has appeared so proud lately  polly chuck came out on the doorstep she looked just as proud as johnny chuck and at the same time she seemed terribly anxious she sat up beside johnny chuck and she looked this way and that way just as johnny had then she put her head in at the doorway and began to call in the softest voice  in a minute sammy jay saw something more it surprised him so that he nearly lost his balance it was another head peeping out of the doorway a head just like johnny chucks only it was a teenyweeny one then there was another and another polly kept talking and talking in the softest voice while johnny chuck swelled himself up until he looked as if he would burst with pride  sammy jay understood now why johnny chuck had been so proud for the last few days it was because he had a family sammy looked down at the three little chucks sitting on the doorstep trying to sit up the way johnny chuck sat and they looked so funny that sammy forgot himself and laughed right out loud in a flash the three little chucks and polly chuck had disappeared inside the house while johnny chuck looked up angrily he knew that his secret was a secret no longer     xxi  sammy jay has a change of heart        theres no one ever quite so bad      that somewhere way down deep inside      a little goodness does not find      a place wherein to creep and hide  it is so with sammy jay yes sir it is so with sammy jay you may think that because sammy jay is vain a troublemaker and a thief he is all bad he isnt there is some good in sammy jay just as there is some good in everybody if there wasnt old mother nature never never would allow sammy jay to go his mischievous way through the green forest he dearly loves to get other people into all kinds of trouble and this is one reason why nobody loves him but if you watch out sharp enough you will find that hidden under that beautiful blue and white coat of his there really is some good you may have to look a long time for it but sooner or later you will find it johnny chuck did  sammy jay had already made a lot of trouble for johnny chuck you see he had been the first of the little forest and meadow people to find johnny chucks new house and then just to make trouble for johnny chuck he had told reddy fox about it and after that he had called bowser the hound and farmer browns boy over to it now he had discovered johnny chucks greatest secretthat johnny had a family what a chance to make trouble now  sammy started for the green forest as fast as his wings could take him he would tell reddy fox and redtail the hawk they were very fond of young chucks it would be great fun to see the fright of johnny chuck and his family when reddy fox or redtail the hawk appeared  sammy jay chuckled wickedly as he flew when he reached the green forest and stopped in his favorite hemlocktree to rest he was still chuckling but by that time it was a different kind of a chuckle yes sir it was a different kind of a chuckle it was a better chuckle to hear the fact is sammy jay was no longer chuckling over the thought of the trouble he could make he was laughing at the memory of how funny those three little baby chucks had looked sitting up on johnny chucks doorstep and trying to do whatever johnny chuck did the more he thought about it the more he tickled and laughed  right in the midst of his laughter along came redtail the hawk sammy jay opened his mouth to call to redtail and tell him about johnny chucks secret then he closed it again with a snap  i wont tell him yet said sammy to himself for he might catch one of those baby chucks and they are such funny little fellows that that would really be too bad i guess ill wait a while and with that off flew sammy jay to hunt for some other mischief you see he had had a change of heart the little goodness way down deep inside had come out of hiding  but of course johnny chuck didnt know this and over in his new house in the far corner of the old orchard he and polly chuck were worrying and worrying for they felt sure that now every one would know their secret and it wouldnt be safe for the dear little baby chucks to so much as put their funny little noses outside the door     xxii  johnny chuck is kept busy   johnny chuck is naturally lazy you see johnny has very simple tastes and usually he is contented he does not have to go far from his own doorstep to get all he wants to eat he does not have to hunt for his food as so many of the little meadow and forest people do and so he has a great deal of time to sit on his doorstep and watch the world go by and dream pleasant daydreams and grow fat now people who do not have to work usually become lazy it is the easiest habit in the world to learn and the hardest to get over and so because he seldom has to work johnny chuck quite naturally is lazy  but johnny can work when there really is need of it no one unless it is digger the badger or miner the mole can dig faster than johnny chuck and when there is real need of working johnny works with a will when he was a very tiny chuck old mother chuck had taught him this      when work there is that must be done      dont fret and whine and spoil the day      the quicker that you do your work      the longer time youll have to play  johnny never has forgotten this and when it is really necessary that he should work no one works harder than he does but he always first makes sure that it is necessary work and that he will not be wasting his time in doing foolish unnecessary things  and now johnny chuck was the busiest he had ever been in all his life if he felt lazy these beautiful spring days he didnt have time to think about it no sir he actually didnt have time to remember that he is naturally lazy you see he had a family to look out forthree babies to find sweet tender young clover for and to teach all the things that every chuck should know and to watch out for that no harm should come to them so johnny chuck was busy so busy that he hardly had time to get enough to eat  every morning johnny would come out as soon as jolly round red mr sun began his daily climb up in the blue blue sky he would look this way and look that way to make sure that reddy fox or granny fox or redtail the hawk or bowser the hound or any other danger was nowhere near and he never forgot to look up in the appletrees to make sure that sammy jay was not there then he would call to polly chuck and the three baby chucks  polly chuck would come out with a very worried air and after her would come the three funny little baby chucks who would roll and tumble over each other on the doorstep when he thought they had played enough johnny chuck would lead the way along a little private path which he had made through the grass after him one behind another would trot the three little chucks and behind them would march polly chuck to see that none went astray  when they reached the patch of tender sweet young clover johnny chuck would sit up very straight and still watching as sharp as he knew how for the least sign of danger when the three little stomachs were full of sweet tender young clover he would proudly lead the way home again and then as before he would sit up very straight and watch for danger while the three baby chucks sprawledout on the doorstep for a sunnap  oh those were busy days for johnny chuck and anxious days too you see he had not forgotten that sammy jay had found out his secret and he hadnt the least doubt in the world that sammy jay would tell reddy fox so from the first thing in the morning until the very last thing at night johnny chuck was on the watch for danger  and all the time though johnny didnt know it a pair of sharp eyes were watching him from a snug hidingplace in one of the old apple trees whose were they why sammy jays to be sure you see sammy jay hadnt told johnny chucks great secret after all     xxiii  the school in the old orchard        little foxes little chucks      little squirrels mice and mink      just like little boys and girls      go to school to learn to think  you didnt know that did you well its a fact yes sir its a fact all the babies born in the green forest or on the green meadows or around the smiling pool have to go to school just as soon as they are big enough to leave their own doorsteps they go to the greatest school in the world and it is called the school of experience  old mother nature has charge of it but the teachers usually are father and mother for the first few weeks anyway after that old mother nature herself gives them a few lessons and a very stern teacher she is they just have to learn her lessons if they dont something dreadful is almost sure to happen  of course sammy jay knew all this because he had had to go to school when he was a little fellow so sammy was not much surprised when from his snug hidingplace in one of the old appletrees he discovered that there was a school in farmer browns old orchard johnny chuck was the teacher and his three baby chucks were the pupils sammy jay was so interested in that funny little school in the old orchard that he quite forgot to think about mischief  the very first lesson that the three little chucks had to learn was obedience johnny chuck was very particular about that you see he knew that unless they learned this first of all none of the other lessons would do them much good they must first learn to mind instantly without asking questions dear me dear me johnny chuck certainly did have his hands full teaching those three little chucks to mind they were such lively little chaps and there was so much that was new and wonderful to see that it was dreadfully hard work to sit perfectly still just because johnny chuck told them to but if they didnt mind instantly they were sure to have their ears soundly boxed and sometimes were sent back to the house without a taste of the sweet tender young clover of which they were so fond  after a few lessons of this kind they found out that it was always best to obey instantly and then johnny began to teach them other things things which it is very important that every chuck should know  first there were signals when johnny whistled a certain way it meant a stranger in sight possible danger  then each little chuck would sit up very straight and not move the teeniest weeniest bit so that from a little distance they looked for all the world like tiny stumps but all the time their sharp little eyes would be looking this way and that way to see what the danger might be after a while johnny would give another little whistle which meant danger past then they would once more begin to fill their little stomachs with sweet tender young clover  sometimes however johnny would whistle sharply that meant run then they would scamper as fast as they could along the nearest little path to the house under the old appletree in the far corner and never once look around they would dive head first one after the other in at the doorway and not show their noses outside again until johnny or polly chuck told them they could  then there was a still different whistle it meant danger very near lie low when they heard that they flattened themselves right down in the grass just wherever they happened to be and held their breath and didnt move until johnny signaled that they might of course there never was any real danger johnny was just teaching them so that when danger did come as it surely would sooner or later they would know just what to do  it surely was a funny little school and sometimes sammy jay had hard work to keep from laughing right out     xxiv  sammy jay proves that he is not all bad   sammy jay hadnt had so much fun for a long time as he found in watching the funny little school in farmer browns old orchard where johnny chuck was teaching his three baby chucks the things that every little chuck must learn if he would grow up into a big chuck when they had learned to mind without waiting to ask why and had learned the signals which told them just what to do when danger was near johnny began to lead them farther and farther away from home  he took them up along the old stone wall and showed them how to find safe hidingplaces among the stones then he took them off a little way and suddenly gave the danger signal it was funny very funny indeed to see the three little chucks scamper for the old stone wall and crawl out of sight  the first time two of them tried to squeeze into the same hole together and each was in such a hurry that he wouldnt let the other go first then both lost their tempers and they began to fight about it quite forgetting that if there was really any danger near they surely would come to harm such a scolding as johnny chuck did give those two little chucks then he made them try it all over again  once he found a foot print which reddy fox had made in some soft earth during the night and made each little chuck smell of it while he told them all about reddy and old granny fox and how smart and sly they were and how very very fond they were of tender young chucks for dinner  the three little chucks shivered when they smelled of reddys track and the hair along their backs stood up in a way that was very funny to see  then johnny chuck took them over to the edge of the old orchard where they could peep out over the green meadows he pointed out old whitetail the marshhawk sailing back and forth over the meadows and told them how once when he was a little chuck and had run away from home old whitetail had nearly caught him he told them about farmer browns boy and about bowser the hound and a great many other things that little chucks should learn about  now all the time that johnny chuck was teaching these things he was keeping the sharpest kind of a watch for danger and there were many times when he would give the danger signal then they would all lie flat down in the grass and keep perfectly still or else scamper as fast as they could along the little paths which johnny had made to the safety of the snug home under the old appletree but even the most watchful are surprised sometimes  one morning when johnny chuck had led the three little chucks farther from home than usual farmer browns boy took it into his head to visit the old orchard johnny chuck did not see him coming you see the orchard grass had grown so tall that even when he sat up his very straightest johnny could not always see over the top of it so this morning he failed to see farmer browns boy coming  but sammy jay sitting in his snug hidingplace in the top of one of the old appletrees saw him at first sammy jays sharp eyes twinkled there would be some fun now perhaps farmer browns boy would catch one of the little chucks sammy jay could picture to himself the fright of johnny chuck and the three little chucks he fairly hugged himself in delight for you know sammy jay dearly loves to see other people in trouble  then he thought of all the fun he had had watching those three little chucks learn their lessons and suddenly the thought of anything happening to them made sammy jay feel uncomfortable almost without stopping to think he screamed at the top of his lungs  run johnny chuck run here comes farmer browns boy  and johnny chuck ran he didnt wait to ask questions or even to look he started the three little chucks ahead of him and he nipped their heels to make them run faster and just in time they reached the snug house under the old appletree in the far corner  farmer browns boy was just in time to see them disappear he watched sammy jay flying over to the green forest and screaming thief thief as he flew  i wonder now if that jay warned those chucks purposely said he as he scratched his head thoughtfully  if peter rabbit had been there he could have told him that sammy jay did for he knows all about sammy jay and his tricks but peter wasnt there the fact is peter was very busy doing the most foolish of all the foolish things he has ever donetrying to change his name you may read all about it in the adventures of peter cottontail you see it takes a whole book to tell all about peter and his doings
