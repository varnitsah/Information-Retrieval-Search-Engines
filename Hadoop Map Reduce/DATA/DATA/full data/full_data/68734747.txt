68734747	drydens palamon and arcite   edited with introduction and notes george e eliot am english master in the morgan school  to henry a beers professor of english literature in yale university who first aroused my interest in dryden and directed my study of his works   this volume is respectfully inscribed  preface  to edit an english classic for study in secondary schools is difficult the lack of anything like uniformity in the type of examination required by the colleges and universities complicates treatment not only do two distinct institutions differ in the scope and character of their questions but the same university varies its demands from year to year the only safe course to pursue is therefore a generally comprehensive one but here again we are hampered by limited space and are forced to content ourselves with a bare outline which the individual instructor can fill in as much or as little as he pleases  the ignorance of most of our classical students in regard to the history of english literature is appalling and yet it is impossible properly to study a given work of a given author without some knowledge of the background against which that particular writer stands i have therefore sketched the politics society and literature of the age in which dryden lived and during which he gave to the world his palamon and arcite in the critical comments of the introduction i have contented myself with little more than hints that particular line of study whether it concerns the poets style his verse forms or the possession of the divine instinct itself can be much more satisfactorily developed by the instructor as the students knowledge of the poem grows  it is certainly a subject for congratulation that so many youth will be introduced through the medium of drydens crisp and vigorous verse to one of the tales of chaucer may it now as in his own century accomplish the poets desire and awaken in them appreciative admiration for the old bard the best storyteller in the english language   g e e clinton conn july 26 1897  introduction  the background   the fifty years of drydens literary production just fill the last half of the seventeenth century it was a period bristling with violent political and religious prejudices provocative of strife that amounted to revolution its social life ran the gamut from the severity of the commonwealth puritan to the unbridled debauchery of the restoration courtier in literature it experienced a remarkable transformation in poetry and developed modern prose watched the production of the greatest english epics smarted under the lash of the greatest english satires blushed at the brilliant wit of unspeakable comedies and applauded the beginnings of english criticism  when the period began england was a commonwealth charles i by obstinate insistence upon absolutism by fickleness and faithlessness had increased and strengthened his enemies parliament had seized the reins of government in 1642 had completely established its authority at naseby in 1645 and had beheaded the king in front of his own palace in 1649 the army had accomplished these results and the army proposed to enjoy the reward cromwell the idolized commander of the ironsides was placed at the head of the newformed state with the title of lord protector and for five years he ruled england as she had been ruled by no sovereign since elizabeth he suppressed parliamentary dissensions and royalist uprisings humbled the dutch took vengeance on the spaniard and made england indisputably mistress of the ocean he was succeeded at his death in 1658 by his son richard but the fathers strong instinct for government had not been inherited by the son the nation homesick for monarchy was tiring of dissension and bickering and by the restoration of 1660 the son of charles i became charles ii of england  scarcely had the demonstrations of joy at the restoration subsided when london was visited by the devouring plague of 1665 all who could fled from the stricken city where thousands died in a day in 1666 came the great fire which swept from the tower to the temple but while it destroyed a vast deal of property it prevented by its violent purification a recurrence of the plague and made possible the rebuilding of the city with great sanitary and architectural improvements  charles possessed some of the virtues of the stuarts and most of their faults his arbitrary irresponsibility shook the confidence of the nation in his sincerity two parties the whigs and the tories came into being and party spirit and party strife ran high the question at issue was chiefly one of religion the rank and file of protestant england was determined against the revival of romanism which a continuation of the stuart line seemed to threaten charles was a protestant only from expediency and on his deathbed accepted the roman catholic faith his brother james duke of york the heir apparent was a professed romanist  such an outlook incited the whigs under the leadership of shaftesbury to support the claims of charles eldest illegitimate son the duke of monmouth who on the death of his father in 1685 landed in england but the promised uprising was scarcely more than a rabble of peasantry and was easily suppressed then came the vengeance of james as foolish as it was tyrannical judge jeffries and his bloody assizes sent scores of protestants to the block or to the gallows till england would endure no more william prince of orange who had married mary the eldest daughter of james was invited to accept the english crown he landed at torbay was joined by churchill the commander of the kings forces and on the precipitate flight of james mounted the throne of england this event stands in history as the protestant revolution of 1688  during williams reign which terminated in 1702 stuart uprisings were successfully suppressed english liberties were guaranteed by the famous bill of rights protestant succession was assured and liberal toleration was extended to the various dissenting sects  society had passed through quite as great variations as had politics during this halfcentury the roistering cavalier of the first charles with his flowing locks and plumed hat with his maypoles and morrice dances with his stage plays and bearbaitings with his carousals and gallantries had given way to the puritan roundhead it was a serious soberminded england in which the youth dryden found himself if the puritan differed from the cavalier in political principles they were even more diametrically opposed in mode of life an act of parliament closed the theaters in 1642 amusements of all kinds were frowned upon as frivolous and many were suppressed by law the old english feasts at michaelmas christmas twelfth night and candlemas were regarded as relics of popery and were condemned the puritan took his religion seriously so seriously that it overpowered him the energy and fervor of his religious life were illustrated in the work performed by cromwells chaplain john howe on any one of the countless fast days he began with his flock at nine in the morning prayed during a quarter of an hour for blessing upon the days work then read and explained a chapter for threequarters of an hour then prayed for an hour preached for an hour and prayed again for a half an hour then retired for a quarter of an hours refreshmentthe people singing all the while returned to his pulpit prayed for another hour preached for another hour and finished at four pm  at the restoration the pendulum swung back again from the strained morality of the puritans there was a sudden leap to the most extravagant license and the grossest immorality with the king and the court in the van the theaters were thrown wide open women for the first time went upon the stage and they acted in plays whose moral tone is so low that they cannot now be presented on the stage or read in the drawingroom of course they voiced the social conditions of the time marriage ties were lightly regarded no gallant but boasted his amours revelry ran riot drunkenness became a habit and gambling a craze the court scintillated with brilliant wits conscienceless libertines and scoffing atheists it was an age of debauchery and disbelief  the splendor of this life sometimes dazzles the lack of conveniences appalls the post left london once a week a journey to the country must be made in your own lumbering carriage or on the snailslow stagecoach over miserable roads beset with highwaymen the narrow illlighted streets even of london could not be traversed safely at night and ladies borne to routs and levees in their sedan chairs were lighted by linkboys and were carried by stalwart broadshouldered bearers who could wield well the staves in a street fight such were the conditions of life and society which dryden found in the last fifty years of the seventeenth century  strong as were the contrasts in politics and manners during drydens lifetime they were paralleled by contrasts in literature no less marked dryden was born in 1631 he died in 1700 in the year of his birth died john donne the father of the metaphysical bards or marinists in the year of his death was born james thomson who was to give the first real start to the romantic movement while between these two dates lies the period devoted to the development of french classicism in english literature  at drydens birth ben jonson was the only one of the great elizabethan dramatists still living and of the lesser stars in the same galaxy chapman massinger ford webster and heywood all died during his boyhood and youth while shirley the last of his line lingered till 1667 of the older writers in prose selden alone remained but as dryden grew to manhood he had at hand fresh from the printers the whole wealth of commonwealth prose still somewhat clumsy with latinism or tainted with euphuism but working steadily toward that simple strength and graceful fluency with which he was himself to mark the beginning of modern english prose  clarendon with his magnificently involved style began his famous history of the great rebellion in 1641 ten years later hobbes published the leviathan a sketch of an ideal commonwealth baxter with his saints everlasting rest sent a book of religious consolation into every household in 1642 dr thomas browne with the simplicity of a child and a quaintness that fascinates published his religio medici and in 1653 dear old simplehearted isaak walton told us in his compleat angler how to catch dress and cook fish thomas fuller born a score or more of years before dryden in the same town aldwinkle published in 1642 his holy and profane state a collection of brief and brisk character sketches which come nearer modern prose than anything of that time while for inspired thought and purity of diction the holy living 1650 and the holy dying 1651 of jeremy taylor a gifted young divine rank preëminent in the prose of the commonwealth  but without question the ablest prose of the period came from the pen of cromwells latin secretary of state john milton milton stands in his own time a peculiarly isolated figure we never in thought associate him with his contemporaries dryden had become the leading literary figure in london before milton wrote his great epic yet were it not for definite chronology we should scarcely realize that they worked in the same century while therefore no sketch of seventeenthcentury literature can exclude milton he must be taken by himself without relation to the development forms and spirit of his age and must be regarded rather as a lateborn elizabethan  when dryden was born milton at twentythree was just completing his seven years at cambridge and as the younger poet grew through boyhood the elder was enriching english verse with his juvenilia then came the twenty years of strife as secretary of the commonwealth he threw himself into controversial prose his iconoclast the divorce pamphlets the smectymnuus tracts and the areopagitica date from this period a strong partisan of the commonwealth he was in emphatic disfavor at the restoration blind and in hiding deserted by onetime friends out of sympathy with his age he fulfilled the promise of his youth he turned again to poetry and in paradise lost paradise regained and samson agonistes he has left us something so written that the world shall not willingly let it die  i have said that miltons poetry differed distinctly from the poetry of his age the verse that dryden was reading as a schoolboy was quite other than lallegro and lycidas in the closing years of the preceding century john donne had traveled in italy there the poet marino was developing fantastic eccentricities in verse donne under similar influences adopted similar methods  to seize upon the quaintest possible thought and then to express it in as quaint a manner as possible became the chief aim of english poets during the first threequarters of the seventeenth century donne had encountered trouble in obtaining his wife from her father finding one morning a flea that had feasted during the night on his wife and himself he was overcome by its poetic possibilities and wrote     this flea is you and i and this   our marriage bed and temple is   tho parents frown and you were met   and cloisterd in these living walls of jet   to strain after conceits to strive for quaintness of thought and expression was the striking characteristic of all the poets of the generation to whom dr johnson gave the title metaphysical and who are now known as the marinists there were quarles with his dutch emblems vaughan sandys crashaw and puresouled george herbert with his temple there were carew with the rapture wither and his shall i wasting in despair the two dashing cavaliers suckling and lovelace the latter the only man who ever received an ma for his personal beauty there was herrick the dispossessed devonshire rector with hesperides and noble numbers freer than were the others from the beautymarring conceits of the time there too were to be found the gallant lovemaker waller cowley the queens secretary during her exile and marvell miltons assistant secretary of state but these three men were to pledge allegiance to a new sovereignty in english verse  in the civil strife waller had at first sided with parliament had later engaged in a plot against it and after a years imprisonment was exiled to france at this time the academy organized to introduce form and method in the french language and literature held full sway malherbe was inculcating its principles corneille and molière were practicing its tenets in their plays and boileau was following its rules in his satires when waller and his associates came in contact with this influence the tendency was distinctly toward formality and conventionality surfeited with the eccentricities and farfetched conceits of the marinists the exiled englishmen welcomed the change they espoused the french principles and when at the restoration they returned to england with their king whose taste had been trained in the same school they began at once to formalize and conventionalize english poetry the writers of the past even the greatest writers of the past were regarded as men of genius but without art and english poetry was thenceforth in drydens own words to start with waller  under the newly adopted canons of french taste narrative and didactic verse or satire took first place blank verse was tabooed as too proselike so too were the enjambed rhymes a succession of rhymed pentameter couplets with the sense complete in each couplet was set forth as the proper vehicle for poetry and this unenjambed distich fettered english verse for threequarters of a century in the drama the characters must be noble the language dignified the metrical form must be the rhymed couplet and the unities of time place and action must be observed  such in brief were the principles of french classicism as applied to english poetry principles of which dryden was the first great exponent and which pope in the next generation carried to absolute perfection waller marvell and cowley all tried their pens in the new method cowley with least success and they were the poets in vogue when dryden himself first attracted attention denham quite caught the favor of the critics with his mild conventionalities the earl of roscommon delighted them with his rhymed essay on translated verse the brilliant court wits rochester dorset and sedley who were writing for pleasure and not for publication still clung to the frivolous lyric but the most read and worsttreated poet of the restoration was butler he published his hudibras a sharp satire on the extreme puritans in 1663 every one read the book laughed uproariously and left the author to starve in a garret of drydens contemporaries in prose there were sir william temple later the patron of swift john locke who contributed to philosophy his essay concerning the human understanding the two diarists evelyn and pepys and the critics rymer and langbaine there was isaac newton who expounded in his principia 1687 the laws of gravitation and there was the preaching tinker who confined in bedford jail gave to the world in 1678 one of its greatest allegories pilgrims progress  dryden was nearly thirty before the production of the drama was resumed in england parliament had closed the theaters in 1642 and that was an extinguisher of dramatic genius davenant had vainly tried to elude the law and finally succeeded in evading it by setting his siege of rhodes to music and producing the first english opera at the restoration when the theaters were reopened the dramas then produced reflected most vividly the looseness and immorality of the times their worst feature was that they possessed not wit enough to keep the mass of moral putrefaction sweet  davenant was prolific crowne wallowed in tragedy tate remodeled shakspere so did shadwell who was later to measure swords with dryden and receive for his rashness an unmerciful castigation but by all odds the strongest name in tragedy was thomas otway who smacks of true elizabethan genius in the orphan and venice preserved in comedy we receive the brilliant work of etheridge the vigor of wycherley and as the century drew near its close the dashing wit of congreve vanbrugh and farquhar this burst of brilliancy in which the restoration drama closes was the prelude to the augustan age of queen anne and the first georges the period wherein flourished that group of selfsatisfied exceptionally clever ultraclassical wits who added a peculiar zest and charm to our literature as dryden grew to old age these younger men were already beginning to make themselves heard though none had done great work in poetry there were prior gay and pope while in prose we find names that stand high in the roll of famethe storyteller defoe the bitter swift the rollicking dick steele and delightful addison  this is the background in politics society and letters on which the life of dryden was laid during the last half of the seventeenth century there were conditions in his environment which materially modified his life and affected his literary form and without a knowledge of these conditions no study of the man or his works can be effective or satisfactory dryden was preëminently a man of his times                                 life of dryden   john dryden was born at the vicarage of aldwinkle all saints in northamptonshire august 9 1631 his father erasmus dryden was the third son of sir erasmus dryden of cannons ashby the estate descended to drydens uncle john and is still in the family his mother was mary pickering both the drydens and pickerings were puritans and were ranged on the side of parliament in its struggle with charles i as a boy dryden received his elementary education at tichmarsh and went thence to westminster school where he studied under the famous dr busby here he first appeared in print with an elegiac poem on the death of a schoolfellow lord hastings it possesses the peculiarities of the extreme marinists the boy had died from smallpox and dryden writes   each little pimple had a tear in it to wail the fault its rising did commit   he entered trinity college cambridge may 18 1650 took his ba in 1654 and then though he received no fellowship lingered at the university for three years tradition tells us that he had no fondness for his alma mater and certainly his verse contains compliments only for oxford  his father had died in 1654 and had bequeathed him a small estate when in 1657 he finally left the university he attached himself to his uncle sir gilbert pickering a general of the commonwealth in 1658 he wrote heroic stanzas on cromwells death but shortly thereafter he went to london threw himself into the life of literary bohemia and at the restoration in 1660 wrote his astroea redux as enthusiastically as the veriest royalist of them all this sudden transformation of the eulogist of cromwell to the panegyrist of charles won for dryden in some quarters the name of a political turncoat but such criticism was unjust he was by birth and early training a puritan add to this a poets admiration for a truly great character and the lines on cromwell are explained but during his london life he rubbed elbows with the world early prejudices vanished his true nature asserted itself and it was john dryden himself not merely the son of his father who celebrated charles return  on december 1 1663 he married lady elizabeth howard eldest daughter of the earl of berkshire and the sister of a literary intimate tradition has pronounced the marriage an unhappy one but facts do not bear out tradition he nowhere referred other than affectionately to his wife and always displayed a fathers warm affection for his sons john charles and erasmus lady elizabeth outlived her husband and eventually died insane  during the great plague in london 1665 dryden fled with his wife to charleton he lived there for two years and during that time wrote three productions that illustrate the three departments of literature to which he devoted himself annus mirabilis a narrative and descriptive poem on the fire of 1666 and the sea fight with the dutch the essay on dramatic poesy his first attempt at literary criticism in prose and the maiden queen a drama in annus mirabilis we find the best work yet done by him marinist quaintness still clings here and there and he has temporarily deserted the classical distich for a quatrain stanza but here for the first time we taste the dryden of the satires and the fables his essay on dramatic poesy started modern prose hitherto english prose had suffered from long sentences from involved sentences and from clumsy latinisms or too bald vernacular dryden happily united simplicity with grace and gave us plain straightforward sentences musically arranged in wellordered periods this was the vehicle in which he introduced literary criticism and he continued it in prefaces to most of his plays and subsequent poems  at this same time he not only discussed the drama but indulged in its production and for a score of years from the early sixties he devoted himself almost exclusively to the stage it was the most popular and the most profitable mode of expression he began with a comedy the wild gallant in 1662 it was a poor play and was incontinently condemned he then developed a curious series of plays of which the indian emperor the conquest of grenada and aurengzebe are examples he professedly followed french methods observed the unities and used the rhymed couplet but they were not french they were a nondescript incubation by dryden himself and were called heroic dramas they were ridiculed in the duke of buckinghams farce the rehearsal but their popularity was scarcely impaired  in 1678 dryden showed a return to common sense and to blank verse in all for love and though it necessarily suffers from its comparison with the original shaksperes antony and cleopatra it nevertheless possesses enough dramatic power to make it his best play he had preceded this by rewriting miltons paradise lost as an opera in the state of innocence and he followed it in 1681 with perhaps his best comedy the spanish friar  dryden was now far the most prominent man of letters in london in 1670 he had been appointed poet laureate and historiographer royal with a salary of two hundred pounds and a butt of sack his connection with the stage had been a decided financial success and he was in receipt of an income of about seven hundred pounds which at modern values would approximate 15000 his house on gerard street soho backed upon leicesters gardens there he spent his days in writing but the evening found him at wills coffee house in this famous resort of the wits and writers of the day the literary dictator of his generation held his court seated in his particular armchair on the balcony in summer by the fire in winter he discoursed on topics current in the literary world pronounced his verdict of praise or condemnation and woe to the unfortunate upon whom the latter fell a week before christmas in 1679 as dryden was walking home from an evening of this sort he was waylaid by masked ruffians in rose alley and was beaten to unconsciousness the attack was supposed to have been incited by rochester who smarted under an anonymous satire mistakenly attributed to dryden  though wrongly accused of this particular satire it was not long before he did turn his attention to that department of verse it was the time of the restless dissent of the whigs from the succession of james and in 1681 dryden launched absalom and achitophel one of the most brilliant satires in our language against shaftesbury and his adherents who were inciting monmouth to revolt he found an admirable parallel in absaloms revolt from his father david and he sustained the comparison the scriptural names concealed living characters and shaftesbury masked as achitophel the evil counsellor and buckingham as zimri feeling ran high shaftesbury was arrested and tried but was acquitted and his friends struck off a medal in commemoration in 1682 therefore came drydens second satire the medal these two political satires called forth in the fevered state of the times a host of replies two of the most scurrilous from the pens of shadwell and settle of these two poor whigs the first was drawn and quartered in macflecnoe while the two were yoked for castigation in part ii of absalom and achitophel which appeared in 1682 dryden possessed preëminently the faculty for satire he did not devote himself exclusively to an abstract treatment nor like pope to bitter personalities he blends and combines the two methods most effectively every one of his brisk nervous couplets carries a sting every distich is a sound box on the ear  we reach now a most interesting period in drydens career and one that has provoked much controversy in 1681 he published a long argument in verse entitled religio laici the religion of a layman in which he states his religious faith and his adherence to the church of england when king james came to the throne in 1685 he made an immediate attempt to establish the roman catholic faith and now dryden too turned romanist and in 1687 supported his new faith in the long poetical allegory the hind and the panther of course his enemies cried turncoat and it certainly looked like it dryden was well into manhood before the religious instinct stirred in him and then once waking he naturally walked in the beaten track but these instincts though roused late possessed the poets impetuosity and it was merely a natural intensifying of the same impulse that had brought him into the church of england which carried him to a more pronounced religious manifestation and landed him in the church of rome his sincerity is certainly backed by his acts for when james had fled and the staunch protestants william and mary held the throne he absolutely refused to recant and sacrificed his positions and emoluments he was stripped of his royal offices and pensions and bitter humiliation the laurel torn from his brow was placed on the head of that scorned jangler in verse shadwell   deprived now of royal patronage and pensions dryden turned again to the stage his oldtime pursefiller and he produced two of his best plays don sebastian and amphitryon the rest of his life however was to be spent not with the drama but in translation and paraphrase since 1684 he had several times published miscellanies collections of verse in which had appeared fragments of translations with that indefatigable energy which characterized him he now devoted himself to sustained effort in 1693 he published a translation of juvenal and in the same year began his translation of virgil which was published in 1697 the work was sold by subscription and the poet was fairly well paid drydens translations are by no means exact but he caught the spirit of his poet and carried something of it into his own effective verse  dryden was not great in original work but he was particularly happy in adaptation and so it happened that his best play all for love was modeled on shaksperes antony and cleopatra and his best poem palamon and arcite was a paraphrase of the knights tale of chaucer contrary to the general taste of his age he had long felt and often expressed great admiration for the fourteenthcentury poet his work on ovid had first turned his thought to chaucer he tells us and by association he linked with him boccaccio as his life drew near its close he turned to those famous old storytellers and in the fables gave us paraphrases in verse of eight of their most delightful tales with translations from homer and ovid a verse letter to his kinsman john driden his second st cedlias ode entitled alexanders feast and an epitaph  the fables were published in 1700 they were his last work friends of the poet and they were legion busied themselves at the beginning of that year in the arrangement of an elaborate benefit performance for him at the dukes theater but dryden did not live to enjoy the compliment he suffered severely from gout a lack of proper treatment induced mortification which spread rapidly and in the early morning of the first of may 1700 he died  he had been the literary figurehead of his generation and the elaborate pomp of his funeral attested his great popularity his body lay in state for several days and then with a great procession was borne on the 13th of may to the poets corner in westminster abbey the last years of his life had been spent in fond study of the work of chaucer and so it happened that just three hundred years after the death of elder bard dryden was laid to rest by the side of his great master   palamon and arcite   the fables in which this poem appears were published in 1700 the word fable as here used by dryden holds its original meaning of story or tale besides the palamon and arcite he paraphrased from chaucer the cock and the fox the flower and the leaf the wife of baths tale the character of the good parson from boccaccio he gave us sigismonda and guiscardo theodore and honoria and cymon and iphigenia while he completed the volume with the first book of the iliad certain of ovids metamorphoses the epistle to john driden alexanders feast and an epitaph the fables were dedicated to the duke of ormond whose father and grandfather dryden had previously honored in a prose epistle full of the rather excessive compliment then in vogue palamon and arcite is itself preceded by a dedication in verse to the duchess of ormond in the graceful flattery of this inscription dryden excelled himself and he was easily grand master of the art in that age of superlative gallantry the duke acknowledged the compliment by a gift of five hundred pounds the preface to the volume is one of drydens best efforts in prose it is mainly concerned with critical comment on chaucer and boccaccio and though it lacks the accuracy of modern scholarship it is full of a keen appreciation of his great forerunners  the work of dryden in palamon and arcite may seem to us superfluous for a welleducated man in the nineteenth century is familiar with his chaucer in the original but in the sixteenth century our early poets were regarded as little better than barbarians and their language was quite unintelligible it was therefore a distinct addition to the literature of his age when he rescued from oblivion the knights tale the first of the canterbury tales and gave it to his world as palamon and arcite  here as in his translations dryden catches the spirit of his original and follows it but he does not track slavishly in its footprints in this particular poem he follows his leader more closely than in some of his other paraphrases and the three books in which he divides his palamon and arcite scarcely exceed in length the original knights tale the tendency toward diffuse expansion an excess of diluting epithets which became a feature of eighteenthcentury poetry dryden has sensibly shunned and has stuck close to the brisk narrative and pithy descriptions of chaucer if the subject in hand be concrete description as in the temple of mars dryden is at his best and surpasses his original but if the abstract enters as in the portraiture on the walls he expands and when he expands he weakens to illustrate   the smiler with the knif under the cloke   has lost force when dryden stretches it into five verses   next stood hypocrisy with holy leer soft smiling and demurely looking down but hid the dagger underneath the gown the assassinating wife the household fiend and far the blackest there the traitor friend   the anachronisms in the poem are chaucers when he put this story of greek love and jealousy and strife into the mouth of his knight he was living in the golden age of chivalry and he simply transferred its setting to this chivalrous story of ancient greece the arms the lists the combat the whole environment are those of the england of edward iii not the athens of theseus dryden has left this unchanged realizing the charm of its mediaeval simplicity as dryden gives it to us the poem is an example of narrative verse brisk in its movement dramatic in its action and interspersed with descriptive passages that stimulate the imagination and satisfy the sense  coming as it did in the last years of his life the poem found him with his vocabulary fully developed and his versification perfected and these are points eminently essential in narrative verse when dryden began his literary career he had but just left the university and his speech smacked somewhat of the pedantry of the classical scholar of the times then came the restoration with its worship of french phrase and its liberal importation his easygoing life as a bohemian in the early sixties strengthened his vernacular and his association with the wits at wills coffee house developed his literary english a happy blending of all these elements governed by his strong common sense gave him at maturity a vocabulary not only of great scope but of tremendous energy and vitality  at the time of the production of palamon and arcite dryden had by long practice become an absolute master of the verse he used as we have seen his early work was impregnated with the peculiarities of the marinists and even after the ascendency of french taste at the restoration he still dallied with the stanza and was not free from conceits but his work in the heroic drama and in satire had determined his verse form and developed his ability in its use in this poem as in the bulk of his work he employs the unenjambed pentameter distich that is a couplet with five accented syllables in each verse and with the sense terminating with the couplet drydens mastery of this couplet was marvelous he did not attain to the perfect polish of pope a score of years later but he possessed more vitality and to this strength must be added a fluent grace and a ready sequence which increased the beauty of the measure and gave to it a nervous energy of movement the great danger that attends the use of the distich is monotony but dryden avoided this by a constant variation of cadence he threw the natural pause now near the start now near the close and now in the midst of his verse and in this way developed a rhythm that never wearies the ear with monotonous recurrence he employed for this same purpose the hemistich or halfverse the triplet or three  consecutive verses with the same rhyme and the alexandrine with its six accents and its consequent wellrounded fullness  so much for palamon and arcite first put into english by the best storyteller in our literature it was retold at the close of the seventeenth century by the greatest poet of his generation one of whose chief claims to greatness lies in his marvelous ability for adaptation and paraphrase                                 drydens place in english literature   it remains to indicate briefly drydens position in english literature to the critics of his own time he was without question the greatest man of letters in his generation and so he undeniably was after the death of milton we are not ready to say with dr johnson that he found english of brick and left it of marble for there was much marble before dryden was dreamed of and his own work is not entirely devoid of brick but that dryden rendered to english services of inestimable value is not to be questioned for forty years the great aim of his life was as he tells us himself to improve the english language and english poetry and by constant and tireless effort in a mass of production of antipodal types he accomplished his object he enriched and extended our vocabulary he modulated our meters he developed new forms and he purified and invigorated style  there are a few poets in our literature who are better than dryden there are a great many who are worse but there has been none who worked more constantly and more conscientiously for its improvement mr saintsbury has admirably summarized the situation he is not our greatest poet far from it but there is one point in which the superlative may safely be applied to him considering what he started with what he accomplished and what advantages he left to his successors he must be pronounced without exception the greatest craftsman in english letters   references for

 to fill in future times his fathers place   and wear the garter of his mothers race  palamon and arcite or the knights tale  from chaucer  book i    in days of old there lived of mighty fame   a valiant prince and theseus was his name   a chief who more in feats of arms excelled   the rising nor the setting sun beheld   of athens he was lord much land he won   and added foreign countries to his crown   in scythia with the warrior queen he strove   whom first by force he conquered then by love   he brought in triumph back the beauteous dame   with whom her sister fair emilia came   with honour to his home let theseus ride   with love to friend and fortune for his guide   and his victorious army at his side   i pass their warlike pomp their proud array   their shouts their songs their welcome on the way   but were it not too long i would recite   the feats of amazons the fatal fight   betwixt the hardy queen and hero knight   the town besieged and how much blood it cost   the female army and the athenian host   the spousals of hippolyta the queen   what tilts and turneys at the feast were seen   the storm at their return the ladies fear   but these and other things i must forbear    the field is spacious i design to sow   with oxen far unfit to draw the plough   the remnant of my tale is of a length   to tire your patience and to waste my strength   and trivial accidents shall be forborn   that others may have time to take their turn   as was at first enjoined us by mine host   that he whose tale is best and pleases most   should win his supper at our common cost   and therefore where i left i will pursue   this ancient story whether false or true   in hope it may be mended with a new   the prince i mentioned full of high renown   in this array drew near the athenian town   when in his pomp and utmost of his pride   marching he chanced to cast his eye aside   and saw a quire of mourning dames who lay   by two and two across the common way   at his approach they raised a rueful cry   and beat their breasts and held their hands on high   creeping and crying till they seized at last   his coursers bridle and his feet embraced   tell me said theseus what and whence you are   and why this funeral pageant you prepare   is this the welcome of my worthy deeds   to meet my triumph in illomened weeds   or envy you my praise and would destroy   with grief my pleasures and pollute my joy   or are you injured and demand relief   name your request and i will ease your grief   the most in years of all the mourning train   began but swounded first away for pain   then scarce recovered spoke nor envy we   thy great renown nor grudge thy victory   tis thine o king the afflicted to redress   and fame has filled the world with thy success   we wretched women sue for that alone   which of thy goodness is refused to none   let fall some drops of pity on our grief   if what we beg be just and we deserve relief   for none of us who now thy grace implore   but held the rank of sovereign queen before   till thanks to giddy chance which never bears   that mortal bliss should last for length of years   she cast us headlong from our high estate   and here in hope of thy return we wait   and long have waited in the temple nigh   built to the gracious goddess clemency   but reverence thou the power whose name it bears   relieve the oppressed and wipe the widows tears   i wretched i have other fortune seen   the wife of capaneus and once a queen   at thebes he fell cursed be the fatal day   and all the rest thou seest in this array   to make their moan their lords in battle lost   before that town besieged by our confederate host   but creon old and impious who commands   the theban city and usurps the lands   denies the rites of funeral fires to those   whose breathless bodies yet he calls his foes   unburned unburied on a heap they lie   such is their fate and such his tyranny   no friend has leave to bear away the dead   but with their lifeless limbs his hounds are fed   at this she shrieked aloud the mournful train   echoed her grief and grovelling on the plain   with groans and hands upheld to move his mind   besought his pity to their helpless kind    the prince was touched his tears began to flow   and as his tender heart would break in two   he sighed and could not but their fate deplore   so wretched now so fortunate before   then lightly from his lofty steed he flew   and raising one by one the suppliant crew   to comfort each full solemnly he swore   that by the faith which knights to knighthood bore   and whateer else to chivalry belongs   he would not cease till he revenged their wrongs   that greece should see performed what he declared   and cruel creon find his just reward   he said no more but shunning all delay   rode on nor entered athens on his way   but left his sister and his queen behind   and waved his royal banner in the wind   where in an argent field the god of war   was drawn triumphant on his iron car   red was his sword and shield and whole attire   and all the godhead seemed to glow with fire   even the ground glittered where the standard flew   and the green grass was dyed to sanguine hue   high on his pointed lance his pennon bore   his cretan fight the conquered minotaur   the soldiers shout around with generous rage   and in that victory their own presage   he praised their ardour inly pleased to see   his host the flower of grecian chivalry   all day he marched and all the ensuing night   and saw the city with returning light   the process of the war i need not tell   how theseus conquered and how creon fell   or after how by storm the walls were won   or how the victor sacked and burned the town   how to the ladies he restored again   the bodies of their lords in battle slain   and with what ancient rites they were interred   all these to fitter time shall be deferred   i spare the widows tears their woful cries   and howling at their husbands obsequies   how theseus at these funerals did assist   and with what gifts the mourning dames dismissed    thus when the victor chief had creon slain   and conquered thebes he pitched upon the plain   his mighty camp and when the day returned   the country wasted and the hamlets burned   and left the pillagers to rapine bred   without control to strip and spoil the dead    there in a heap of slain among the rest   two youthful knights they found beneath a load oppressed   of slaughtered foes whom first to death they sent   the trophies of their strength a bloody monument   both fair and both of royal blood they seemed   whom kinsmen to the crown the heralds deemed   that day in equal arms they fought for fame   their swords their shields their surcoats were the same   close by each other laid they pressed the ground   their manly bosoms pierced with many a grisly wound   nor well alive nor wholly dead they were   but some faint signs of feeble life appear   the wandering breath was on the wing to part   weak was the pulse and hardly heaved the heart   these two were sisters sons and arcite one   much famed in fields with valiant palamon   from these their costly arms the spoilers rent   and softly both conveyed to theseus tent   whom known of creons line and cured with care   he to his city sent as prisoners of the war   hopeless of ransom and condemned to lie   in durance doomed a lingering death to die    this done he marched away with warlike sound   and to his athens turned with laurels crowned   where happy long he lived much loved and more renowned   but in a tower and never to be loosed   the woful captive kinsmen are enclosed    thus year by year they pass and day by day   till once twas on the morn of cheerful may   the young emilia fairer to be seen   than the fair lily on the flowery green   more fresh than may herself in blossoms new   for with the rosy colour strove her hue   waked as her custom was before the day   to do the observance due to sprightly may   for sprightly may commands our youth to keep   the vigils of her night and breaks their sluggard sleep   each gentle breast with kindly warmth she moves   inspires new flames revives extinguished loves   in this remembrance emily ere day   arose and dressed herself in rich array   fresh as the month and as the morning fair   adown her shoulders fell her length of hair   a ribband did the braided tresses bind   the rest was loose and wantoned in the wind   aurora had but newly chased the night   and purpled oer the sky with blushing light   when to the gardenwalk she took her way   to sport and trip along in cool of day   and offer maiden vows in honour of the may 190    at every turn she made a little stand   and thrust among the thorns her lily hand   to draw the rose and every rose she drew   she shook the stalk and brushed away the dew    then partycoloured flowers of white and red   she wove to make a garland for her head   this done she sung and carolled out so clear   that men and angels might rejoice to hear   even wondering philomel forgot to sing   and learned from her to welcome in the spring   the tower of which before was mention made   within whose keep the captive knights were laid   built of a large extent and strong withal   was one partition of the palace wall   the garden was enclosed within the square   where young emilia took the morning air    it happened palamon the prisoner knight   restless for woe arose before the light   and with his jailors leave desired to breathe   an air more wholesome than the damps beneath   this granted to the tower he took his way   cheered with the promise of a glorious day   then cast a languishing regard around   and saw with hateful eyes the temples crowned   with golden spires and all the hostile ground   he sighed and turned his eyes because he knew   twas but a larger jail he had in view   then looked below and from the castles height   beheld a nearer and more pleasing sight   the garden which before he had not seen   in springs new livery clad of white and green   fresh flowers in wide parterres and shady walks between   this viewed but not enjoyed with arms across   he stood reflecting on his countrys loss   himself an object of the public scorn   and often wished he never had been born   at last for so his destiny required   with walking giddy and with thinking tired    he through a little window cast his sight   though thick of bars that gave a scanty light   but even that glimmering served him to descry   the inevitable charms of emily    scarce had he seen but seized with sudden smart   stung to the quick he felt it at his heart   struck blind with overpowering light he stood   then started back amazed and cried aloud    young arcite heard and up he ran with haste   to help his friend and in his arms embraced   and asked him why he looked so deadly wan   and whence and how his change of cheer began   or who had done the offence but if said he   your grief alone is hard captivity   for love of heaven with patience undergo   a cureless ill since fate will have it so   so stood our horoscope in chains to lie   and saturn in the dungeon of the sky   or other baleful aspect ruled our birth   when all the friendly stars were under earth   whateer betides by destiny tis done   and better bear like men than vainly seek to shun   nor of my bonds said palamon again   nor of unhappy planets i complain   but when my mortal anguish caused my cry   the moment i was hurt through either eye   pierced with a random shaft i faint away   and perish with insensible decay   a glance of some new goddess gave the wound   whom like actaeon unaware i found   look how she walks along yon shady space   not juno moves with more majestic grace   and all the cyprian queen is in her face   if thou art venus for thy charms confess   that face was formed in heaven nor art thou less   disguised in habit undisguised in shape   o help us captives from our chains to scape   but if our doom be past in bonds to lie   for life and in a loathsome dungeon die   then be thy wrath appeased with our disgrace   and show compassion to the theban race   oppressed by tyrant powerwhile yet he spoke   arcite on emily had fixed his look   the fatal dart a ready passage found   and deep within his heart infixed the wound   so that if palamon were wounded sore   arcite was hurt as much as he or more   then from his inmost soul he sighed and said   the beauty i behold has struck me dead   unknowingly she strikes and kills by chance   poison is in her eyes and death in every glance   oh i must ask nor ask alone but move   her mind to mercy or must die for love    thus arcite and thus palamon replies   eager his tone and ardent were his eyes   speakest thou in earnest or in jesting vein   jesting said arcite suits but ill with pain   it suits far worse said palamon again   and bent his brows with men who honour weigh   their faith to break their friendship to betray   but worst with thee of noble lineage born   my kinsman and in arms my brother sworn   have we not plighted each our holy oath   that one should be the common good of both   one soul should both inspire and neither prove   his fellows hindrance in pursuit of love   to this before the gods we gave our hands   and nothing but our death can break the bands    this binds thee then to farther my design   as i am bound by vow to farther thine   nor canst nor darest thou traitor on the plain   appeach my honour or thy own maintain   since thou art of my council and the friend   whose faith i trust and on whose care depend   and wouldst thou court my ladys love which i   much rather than release would choose to die   but thou false arcite never shalt obtain   thy bad pretence i told thee first my pain   for first my love began ere thine was born   thou as my council and my brother sworn   art bound to assist my eldership of right   or justly to be deemed a perjured knight    thus palamon but arcite with disdain   in haughty language thus replied again   forsworn thyself the traitors odious name   i first return and then disprove thy claim   if love be passion and that passion nurst   with strong desires i loved the lady first   canst thou pretend desire whom zeal inflamed   to worship and a power celestial named   thine was devotion to the blest above   i saw the woman and desired her love   first owned my passion and to thee commend   the important secret as my chosen friend   suppose which yet i grant not thy desire   a moment elder than my rival fire   can chance of seeing first thy title prove   and knowst thou not no law is made for love   law is to things which to free choice relate   love is not in our choice but in our fate   laws are not positive loves power we see   is natures sanction and her first decree   each day we break the bond of human laws   for love and vindicate the common cause   laws for defence of civil rights are placed   love throws the fences down and makes a general waste   maids widows wives without distinction fall   the sweeping deluge love comes on and covers all   if then the laws of friendship i transgress   i keep the greater while i break the less   and both are mad alike since neither can possess   both hopeless to be ransomed never more   to see the sun but as he passes oer   like Æsops hounds contending for the bone   each pleaded right and would be lord alone   the fruitless fight continued all the day   a cur came by and snatched the prize away   as courtiers therefore justle for a grant   and when they break their friendship plead their want   so thou if fortune will thy suit advance   love on nor envy me my equal chance   for i must love and am resolved to try   my fate or failing in the adventure die    great was their strife which hourly was renewed   till each with mortal hate his rival viewed   now friends no more nor walking hand in hand   but when they met they made a surly stand   and glared like angry lions as they passed   and wished that every look might be their last    it chanced at length pirithous came to attend   this worthy theseus his familiar friend   their love in early infancy began   and rose as childhood ripened into man   companions of the war and loved so well   that when one died as ancient stories tell   his fellow to redeem him went to hell    but to pursue my tale to welcome home   his warlike brother is pirithous come   arcite of thebes was known in arms long since   and honoured by this young thessalian prince   theseus to gratify his friend and guest   who made our arcites freedom his request   restored to liberty the captive knight   but on these hard conditions i recite   that if hereafter arcite should be found   within the compass of athenian ground   by day or night or on whateer pretence   his head should pay the forfeit of the offence   to this pirithous for his friend agreed   and on his promise was the prisoner freed    unpleased and pensive hence he takes his way   at his own peril for his life must pay   who now but arcite mourns his bitter fate   finds his dear purchase and repents too late   what have i gained he said in prison pent   if i but change my bonds for banishment   and banished from her sight i suffer more   in freedom than i felt in bonds before   forced from her presence and condemned to live   unwelcome freedom and unthanked reprieve   heaven is not but where emily abides   and where shes absent all is hell besides   next to my day of birth was that accurst   which bound my friendship to pirithous first   had i not known that prince i still had been   in bondage and had still emilia seen   for though i never can her grace deserve   tis recompense enough to see and serve   o palamon my kinsman and my friend   how much more happy fates thy love attend i    thine is the adventure thine the victory   well has thy fortune turned the dice for thee   thou on that angels face mayest feed thy eyes   in prison no but blissful paradise   thou daily seest that sun of beauty shine   and lovest at least in loves extremest line   i mourn in absence loves eternal night   and who can tell but since thou hast her sight   and art a comely young and valiant knight   fortune a various power may cease to frown   and by some ways unknown thy wishes crown   but i the most forlorn of human kind   nor help can hope nor remedy can find   but doomed to drag my loathsome life in care   for my reward must end it in despair   fire water air and earth and force of fates   that governs all and heaven that all creates   nor art nor natures hand can ease my grief   nothing but death the wretchs last relief   then farewell youth and all the joys that dwell   with youth and life and life itself farewell   but why alas do mortal men in vain   of fortune fate or providence complain   god gives us what he knows our wants require   and better things than those which we desire   some pray for riches riches they obtain   but watched by robbers for their wealth are slain   some pray from prison to be freed and come   when guilty of their vows to fall at home   murdered by those they trusted with their life   a favoured servant or a bosom wife   such dearbought blessings happen every day   because we know not for what things to pray   like drunken sots about the streets we roam    well knows the sot he has a certain home   yet knows not how to find the uncertain place   and blunders on and staggers every pace   thus all seek happiness but few can find   for far the greater part of men are blind   this is my case who thought our utmost good   was in one word of freedom understood   the fatal blessing came from prison free   i starve abroad and lose the sight of emily    thus arcite but if arcite thus deplore   his sufferings palamon yet suffers more   for when he knew his rival freed and gone   he swells with wrath he makes outrageous moan   he frets he fumes he stares he stamps the ground   the hollow tower with clamours rings around   with briny tears he bathed his fettered feet   and dropped all oer with agony of sweat   alas he cried i wretch in prison pine   too happy rival while the fruit is thine   thou livest at large thou drawest thy native air   pleased with thy freedom proud of my despair   thou mayest since thou hast youth and courage joined   a sweet behaviour and a solid mind   assemble ours and all the theban race   to vindicate on athens thy disgrace   and after by some treaty made possess   fair emily the pledge of lasting peace   so thine shall be the beauteous prize while i   must languish in despair in prison die   thus all the advantage of the strife is thine   thy portion double joys and double sorrows mine    the rage of jealousy then fired his soul   and his face kindled like a burning coal   now cold despair succeeding in her stead   to livid paleness turns the glowing red   his blood scarce liquid creeps within his veins   like water which the freezing wind constrains   then thus he said eternal deities   who rule the world with absolute decrees   and write whatever time shall bring to pass   with pens of adamant on plates of brass   what is the race of human kind your care   beyond what all his fellowcreatures are   he with the rest is liable to pain   and like the sheep his brotherbeast is slain   cold hunger prisons ills without a cure   all these he must and guiltless oft endure   or does your justice power or prescience fail   when the good suffer and the bad prevail   what worse to wretched virtue could befal   if fate or giddy fortune governed all   nay worse than other beasts is our estate   them to pursue their pleasures you create   we bound by harder laws must curb our will   and your commands not our desires fulfil   then when the creature is unjustly slain   yet after death at least he feels no pain   but man in life surcharged with woe before   not freed when dead is doomed to suffer more   a serpent shoots his sting at unaware   an ambushed thief forelays a traveller   the man lies murdered while the thief and snake   one gains the thickets and one thrids the brake   this let divines decide but well i know   just or unjust i have my share of woe   through saturn seated in a luckless place   and junos wrath that persecutes my race   or mars and venus in a quartil move   my pangs of jealousy for arcites love    let palamon oppressed in bondage mourn   while to his exited rival we return   by this the sun declining from his height   the day had shortened to prolong the night   the lengthened night gave length of misery   both to the captive lover and the free   for palamon in endless prison mourns   and arcite forfeits life if he returns   the banished never hopes his love to see   nor hopes the captive lord his liberty   tis hard to say who suffers greater pains   one sees his love but cannot break his chains   one free and all his motions uncontrolled   beholds whateer he would but what he would behold   judge as you please for i will haste to tell   what fortune to the banished knight befel   when arcite was to thebes returned again   the loss of her he loved renewed his pain   what could be worse than never more to see   his life his soul his charming emily   he raved with all the madness of despair   he roared he beat his breast he tore his hair   dry sorrow in his stupid eyes appears   for wanting nourishment he wanted tears   his eyeballs in their hollow sockets sink   bereft of sleep he loathes his meat and drink   he withers at his heart and looks as wan   as the pale spectre of a murdered man   that pale turns yellow and his face receives   the faded hue of sapless boxen leaves   in solitary groves he makes his moan   walks early out and ever is alone   nor mixed in mirth in youthful pleasure shares   but sighs when songs and instruments he hears    his spirits are so low his voice is drowned   he hears as from afar or in a swound   like the deaf murmurs of a distant sound   uncombed his locks and squalid his attire   unlike the trim of love and gay desire   but full of museful mopings which presage   the loss of reason and conclude in rage    this when he had endured a year and more   now wholly changed from what he was before   it happened once that slumbering as he lay   he dreamt his dream began at break of day   that hermes oer his head in air appeared   and with soft words his drooping spirits cheered   his hat adorned with wings disclosed the god   and in his hand he bore the sleepcompelling rod   such as he seemed when at his sires command   on argus head he laid the snaky wand   arise he said to conquering athens go   there fate appoints an end of all thy woe   the fright awakened arcite with a start   against his bosom bounced his heaving heart   but soon he said with scarce recovered breath   and thither will i go to meet my death   sure to be slain but death is my desire   since in emilias sight i shall expire   by chance he spied a mirror while he spoke   and gazing there beheld his altered look   wondering he saw his features and his hue   so much were changed that scarce himself he knew   a sudden thought then starting in his mind   since i in arcite cannot arcite find   the world may search in vain with all their eyes   but never penetrate through this disguise   thanks to the change which grief and sickness give   in low estate i may securely live   and see unknown my mistress day by day   he said and clothed himself in coarse array   a labouring hind in show then forth he went   and to the athenian towers his journey bent   one squire attended in the same disguise   made conscious of his masters enterprise   arrived at athens soon he came to court   unknown unquestioned in that thick resort   proffering for hire his service at the gate   to drudge draw water and to run or wait    so fair befel him that for little gain   he served at first emilias chamberlain   and watchful all advantages to spy   was still at hand and in his masters eye   and as his bones were big and sinews strong   refused no toil that could to slaves belong   but from deep wells with engines water drew   and used his noble hands the wood to hew   he passed a year at least attending thus   on emily and called philostratus   but never was there man of his degree   so much esteemed so well beloved as he   so gentle of condition was he known   that through the court his courtesy was blown   all think him worthy of a greater place   and recommend him to the royal grace   that exercised within a higher sphere   his virtues more conspicuous might appear   thus by the general voice was arcite praised   and by great theseus to high favour raised   among his menial servants first enrolled   and largely entertained with sums of gold   besides what secretly from thebes was sent    of his own income and his annual rent   this well employed he purchased friends and fame   but cautiously concealed from whence it came   thus for three years he lived with large increase   in arms of honour and esteem in peace   to theseus person he was ever near   and theseus for his virtues held him dear   book ii     while arcite lives in bliss the story turns   where hopeless palamon in prison mourns   for six long years immured the captive knight   had dragged his chains and scarcely seen the light   lost liberty and love at once he bore   his prison pained him much his passion more   nor dares he hope his fetters to remove   nor ever wishes to be free from love   but when the sixth revolving year was run   and may within the twins received the sun   were it by chance or forceful destiny   which forms in causes first whateer shall be   assisted by a friend one moonless night   this palamon from prison took his flight   a pleasant beverage he prepared before   of wine and honey mixed with added store   of opium to his keeper this he brought   who swallowed unaware the sleepy draught   and snored secure till morn his senses bound   in slumber and in long oblivion drowned   short was the night and careful palamon   sought the next covert ere the rising sun   a thickspread forest near the city lay   to this with lengthened strides he took his way   for far he could not fly and feared the day    safe from pursuit he meant to shun the light   till the brown shadows of the friendly night   to thebes might favour his intended flight   when to his country come his next design   was all the theban race in arms to join   and war on theseus till he lost his life   or won the beauteous emily to wife   thus while his thoughts the lingering day beguile   to gentle arcite let us turn our style   who little dreamt how nigh he was to care   till treacherous fortune caught him in the snare   the morninglark the messenger of day   saluted in her song the morning gray   and soon the sun arose with beams so bright   that all the horizon laughed to see the joyous sight   he with his tepid rays the rose renews   and licks the dropping leaves and dries the dews   when arcite left his bed resolved to pay   observance to the month of merry may   forth on his fiery steed betimes he rode   that scarcely prints the turf on which he trod   at ease he seemed and prancing oer the plains   turned only to the grove his horses reins   the grove i named before and lighting there   a woodbind garland sought to crown his hair   then turned his face against the rising day   and raised his voice to welcome in the may   for thee sweet month the groves green liveries wear   if not the first the fairest of the year   for thee the graces lead the dancing hours   and natures ready pencil paints the flowers   when thy short reign is past the feverish sun   the sultry tropic fears and moves more slowly on   so may thy tender blossoms fear no blight   nor goats with venomed teeth thy tendrils bite   as thou shalt guide my wandering feet to find   the fragrant greens i seek my brows to bind   his vows addressed within the grove he strayed   till fate or fortune near the place conveyed   his steps where secret palamon was laid   full little thought of him the gentle knight   who flying death had there concealed his flight   in brakes and brambles hid and shunning mortal sight   and less he knew him for his hated foe   but feared him as a man he did not know   but as it has been said of ancient years   that fields are full of eyes and woods have ears   for this the wise are ever on their guard   for unforeseen they say is unprepared   uncautious arcite thought himself alone   and less than all suspected palamon   who listening heard him while he searched the grove   and loudly sung his roundelay of love   but on the sudden stopped and silent stood   as lovers often muse and change their mood   now high as heaven and then as low as hell   now up now down as buckets in a well   for venus like her day will change her cheer   and seldom shall we see a friday clear   thus arcite having sung with altered hue   sunk on the ground and from his bosom drew   a desperate sigh accusing heaven and fate   and angry junos unrelenting hate   cursed be the day when first i did appear   let it be blotted from the calendar   lest it pollute the month and poison all the year   still will the jealous queen pursue our race   cadmus is dead the theban city was   yet ceases not her hate for all who come   from cadmus are involved in cadmus doom   i suffer for my blood unjust decree   that punishes anothers crime on me   in mean estate i serve my mortal foe   the man who caused my countrys overthrow   this is not all for juno to my shame   has forced me to forsake my former name   arcite i was philostratus i am   that side of heaven is all my enemy   mars ruined thebes his mother ruined me   of all the royal race remains but one   besides myself the unhappy palamon   whom theseus holds in bonds and will not free   without a crime except his kin to me   yet these and all the rest i could endure   but loves a malady without a cure   fierce love has pierced me with his fiery dart   he fires within and hisses at my heart   your eyes fair emily my fate pursue   i suffer for the rest i die for you   of such a goddess no time leaves record   who burned the temple where she was adored   and let it burn i never will complain   pleased with my sufferings if you knew my pain   at this a sickly qualm his heart assailed   his ears ring inward and his senses failed   no word missed palamon of all he spoke   but soon to deadly pale he changed his look   he trembled every limb and felt a smart   as if cold steel had glided through his heart   nor longer stayed but starting from his place   discovered stood and showed his hostile face   false traitor arcite traitor to thy blood   bound by thy sacred oath to seek my good   now art thou found forsworn for emily   and darest attempt her love for whom i die   so hast thou cheated theseus with a wile   against thy vow returning to beguile   under a borrowed name as false to me   so false thou art to him who set thee free   but rest assured that either thou shalt die   or else renounce thy claim in emily   for though unarmed i am and freed by chance   am here without my sword or pointed lance   hope not base man unquestioned hence to go   for i am palamon thy mortal foe   arcite who heard his tale and knew the man   his sword unsheathed and fiercely thus began   now by the gods who govern heaven above   wert thou not weak with hunger mad with love   that word had been thy last or in this grove   this hand should force thee to renounce thy love   the surety which i gave thee i defy   fool not to know that love endures no tie   and jove but laughs at lovers perjury   know i will serve the fair in thy despite   but since thou art my kinsman and a knight   here have my faith tomorrow in this grove   our arms shall plead the titles of our love   and heaven so help my right as i alone   will come and keep the cause and quarrel both unknown   with arms of proof both for myself and thee   choose thou the best and leave the worst to me   and that at better ease thou mayest abide   bedding and clothes i will this night provide   and needful sustenance that thou mayest be   a conquest better won and worthy me    his promise palamon accepts but prayed   to keep it better than the first he made   thus fair they parted till the morrows dawn   for each had laid his plighted faith to pawn   oh love thou sternly dost thy power maintain   and wilt not bear a rival in thy reign   tyrants and thou all fellowship disdain   this was in arcite proved and palamon   both in despair yet each would love alone   arcite returned and as in honour tied   his foe with bedding and with food supplied   then ere the day two suits of armour sought   which borne before him on his steed he brought   both were of shining steel and wrought so pure   as might the strokes of two such arms endure   now at the time and in the appointed place   the challenger and challenged face to face   approach each other from afar they knew   and from afar their hatred changed their hue   so stands the thracian herdsman with his spear   full in the gap and hopes the hunted bear   and hears him rustling in the wood and sees   his course at distance by the bending trees   and thinks here comes my mortal enemy   and either he must fall in fight or i   this while he thinks he lifts aloft his dart   a generous chillness seizes every part   the veins pour back the blood and fortify the heart    thus pale they meet their eyes with fury burn   none greets for none the greeting will return   but in dumb surliness each armed with care   his foe professed as brother of the war   then both no moment lost at once advance   against each other armed with sword and lance   they lash they foin they pass they strive to bore   their corslets and the thinnest parts explore   thus two long hours in equal arms they stood   and wounded wound till both are bathed in blood   and not a foot of ground had either got   as if the world depended on the spot   fell arcite like an angry tiger fared   and like a lion palamon appeared   or as two boars whom love to battle draws   with rising bristles and with frothy jaws   their adverse breasts with tusks oblique they wound   with grunts and groans the forest rings around   so fought the knights and fighting must abide   till fate an umpire sends their difference to decide   the power that ministers to gods decrees   and executes on earth what heaven foresees   called providence or chance or fatal sway   comes with resistless force and finds or makes her way   nor kings nor nations nor united power   one moment can retard the appointed hour   and some one day some wondrous chance appears   which happened not in centuries of years   for sure whateer we mortals hate or love   or hope or fear depends on powers above   they move our appetites to good or ill   and by foresight necessitate the will   in theseus this appears whose youthful joy   was beasts of chase in forests to destroy   this gentle knight inspired by jolly may   forsook his easy couch at early day   and to the wood and wilds pursued his way   beside him rode hippolita the queen   and emily attired in lively green   with horns and hounds and all the tuneful cry   to hunt a royal hart within the covert nigh   and as he followed mars before so now   he serves the goddess of the silver bow   the way that theseus took was to the wood   where the two knights in cruel battle stood   the laund on which they fought the appointed place   in which the uncoupled hounds began the chase   thither forthright he rode to rouse the prey   that shaded by the fern in harbour lay   and thence dislodged was wont to leave the wood   for open fields and cross the crystal flood   approached and looking underneath the sun   he saw proud arcite and fierce palamon   in mortal battle doubling blow on blow   like lightning flamed their fauchions to and fro   and shot a dreadful gleam so strong they strook   there seemed less force required to fell an oak   he gazed with wonder on their equal might   looked eager on but knew not either knight   resolved to learn he spurred his fiery steed   with goring rowels to provoke his speed   the minute ended that began the race   so soon he was betwixt them on the place   and with his sword unsheathed on pain of life   commands both combatants to cease their strife   then with imperious tone pursues his threat   what are you why in arms together met   how dares your pride presume against my laws   as in a listed field to fight your cause   unasked the royal grant no marshal by   as knightly rites require nor judge to try   then palamon with scarce recovered breath   thus hasty spoke we both deserve the death   and both would die for look the world around   and pity soonest runs in gentle minds   then reasons with himself and first he finds   his passion cast a mist before his sense   and either made or magnified the offence   offence of what to whom who judged the cause   the prisoner freed himself by natures laws   born free he sought his right the man he freed   was perjured but his love excused the deed   thus pondering he looked under with his eyes   and saw the womens tears and heard their cries   which moved compassion more he shook his head   and softly sighing to himself he said    curse on the unpardoning prince whom tears can draw   to no remorse who rules by lions law   and deaf to prayers by no submission bowed   rends all alike the penitent and proud   at this with look serene he raised his head   reason resumed her place and passion fled   then thus aloud he spoke the power of love   in earth and seas and air and heaven above   rules unresisted with an awful nod   by daily miracles declared a god   he blinds the wise gives eyesight to the blind   and moulds and stamps anew the lovers mind   behold that arcite and this palamon   freed from my fetters and in safety gone   what hindered either in their native soil   at ease to reap the harvest of their toil   but love their lord did otherwise ordain   and brought them in their own despite again   to suffer death deserved for well they know   tis in my power and i their deadly foe   the proverb holds that to be wise and love   is hardly granted to the gods above   see how the madmen bleed behold the gains   with which their master love rewards their pains   for seven long years on duty every day   lo their obedience and their monarchs pay   yet as in duty bound they serve him on   and ask the fools they think it wisely done   nor ease nor wealth nor life it self regard   for tis their maxim love is loves reward   this is not all the fair for whom they strove   nor knew before nor could suspect their love   nor thought when she beheld the fight from far   her beauty was the occasion of the war   but sure a general doom on man is past   and all are fools and lovers first or last   this both by others and my self i know   for i have served their sovereign long ago   oft have been caught within the winding train   of female snares and felt the lovers pain   and learned how far the god can human hearts constrain   to this remembrance and the prayers of those   who for the offending warriors interpose   i give their forfeit lives on this accord   to do me homage as their sovereign lord   and as my vassals to their utmost might   assist my person and assert my right   this freely sworn the knights their grace obtained   then thus the king his secret thought explained   if wealth or honour or a royal race   or each or all may win a ladys grace   then either of you knights may well deserve   a princess born and such is she you serve   for emily is sister to the crown   and but too well to both her beauty known   but should you combat till you both were dead   two lovers cannot share a single bed   as therefore both are equal in degree   the lot of both be left to destiny   now hear the award and happy may it prove   to her and him who best deserves her love   depart from hence in peace and free as air   search the wide world and where you please repair   but on the day when this returning sun   to the same point through every sign has run   then each of you his hundred knights shall bring   in royal lists to fight before the king   and then the knight whom fate or happy chance   shall with his friends to victory advance   and grace his arms so far in equal fight   from out the bars to force his opposite   or kill or make him recreant on the plain   the prize of valour and of love shall gain   the vanquished party shall their claim release   and the long jars conclude in lasting peace   the charge be mine to adorn the chosen ground   the theatre of war for champions so renowned   and take the patrons place of either knight   with eyes impartial to behold the fight   and heaven of me so judge as i shall judge aright   if both are satisfied with this accord   swear by the laws of knighthood on my sword    who now but palamon exults with joy   and ravished arcite seems to touch the sky   the whole assembled troop was pleased as well   extolled the award and on their knees they fell   to bless the gracious king the knights with leave   departing from the place his last commands receive   on emily with equal ardour look   and from her eyes their inspiration took   from thence to thebes old walls pursue their way   each to provide his champions for the day    it might be deemed on our historians part   or too much negligence or want of art   if he forgot the vast magnificence   of royal theseus and his large expense   he first enclosed for lists a level ground   the whole circumference a mile around   the form was circular and all without   a trench was sunk to moat the place about   within an amphitheatre appeared   raised in degrees to sixty paces reared   that when a man was placed in one degree   height was allowed for him above to see    eastward was built a gate of marble white   the like adorned the western opposite   a nobler object than this fabric was   rome never saw nor of so vast a space   for rich with spoils of many a conquered land   all arts and artists theseus could command   who sold for hire or wrought for better fame   the masterpainters and the carvers came   so rose within the compass of the year   an ages work a glorious theatre   then oer its eastern gate was raised above   a temple sacred to the queen of love   an altar stood below on either hand   a priest with roses crowned who held a myrtle wand    the dome of mars was on the gate opposed   and on the north a turret was enclosed   within the wall of alabaster white   and crimson coral for the queen of night   who takes in sylvan sports her chaste delight    within those oratories might you see   rich carvings portraitures and imagery   where every figure to the life expressed   the godheads power to whom it was addressed   in venus temple on the sides were seen   the broken slumbers of enamoured men   prayers that even spoke and pity seemed to call   and issuing sighs that smoked along the wall   complaints and hot desires the lovers hell   and scalding tears that wore a channel where they fell   and all around were nuptial bonds the ties   of loves assurance and a train of lies   that made in lust conclude in perjuries   beauty and youth and wealth and luxury   and sprightly hope and shortenduring joy   and sorceries to raise the infernal powers   and sigils framed in planetary hours   expense and afterthought and idle care   and doubts of motley hue and dark despair   suspicions and fantastical surmise   and jealousy suffused with jaundice in her eyes   discolouring all she viewed in tawny dressed   downlooked and with a cuckow on her fist   opposed to her on the other side advance   the costly feast the carol and the dance   minstrels and music poetry and play   and balls by night and turnaments by day   all these were painted on the wall and more   with acts and monuments of times before   and others added by prophetic doom   and lovers yet unborn and loves to come   for there the idalian mount and citheron   the court of venus was in colours drawn   before the palace gate in careless dress   and loose array sat portress idleness   there by the fount narcissus pined alone   there samson was with wiser solomon   and all the mighty names by love undone   medeas charms were there circean feasts   with bowls that turned enamoured youths to beasts   here might be seen that beauty wealth and wit   and prowess to the power of love submit   the spreading snare for all mankind is laid   and lovers all betray and are betrayed   the goddess self some noble hand had wrought   smiling she seemed and full of pleasing thought   from ocean as she first began to rise   and smoothed the ruffled seas and cleared the skies   she trod the brine all bare below the breast   and the green waves but illconcealed the rest   a lute she held and on her head was seen   a wreath of roses red and myrtles green   her turtles fanned the buxom air above   and by his mother stood an infant love   with wings unfledged his eyes were banded oer   his hands a bow his back a quiver bore   supplied with arrows bright and keen a deadly store    but in the dome of mighty mars the red   with different figures all the sides were spread   this temple less in form with equal grace   was imitative of the first in thrace   for that cold region was the loved abode   and sovereign mansion of the warrior god   the landscape was a forest wide and bare   where neither beast nor human kind repair   the fowl that scent afar the borders fly   and shun the bitter blast and wheel about the sky   a cake of scurf lies baking on the ground   and prickly stubs instead of trees are found   or woods with knots and knares deformed and old   headless the most and hideous to behold   a rattling tempest through the branches went   that stripped them bare and one sole way they bent   heaven froze above severe the clouds congeal   and through the crystal vault appeared the standing hail   such was the face without a mountain stood   threatening from high and overlooked the wood   beneath the lowering brow and on a bent   the temple stood of mars armipotent   the frame of burnished steel that cast a glare   from far and seemed to thaw the freezing air   a straight long entry to the temple led   blind with high walls and horror over head   thence issued such a blast and hollow roar   as threatened from the hinge to heave the door   in through that door a northern light there shone   twas all it had for windows there were none   the gate was adamant eternal frame   which hewed by mars himself from indian quarries came   the labour of a god and all

looking down   but hid the dagger underneath the gown   the assassinating wife the household fiend   and far the blackest there the traitorfriend   on the other side there stood destruction bare   unpunished rapine and a waste of war   contest with sharpened knives in cloisters drawn   and all with blood bespread the holy lawn   loud menaces were heard and foul disgrace   and bawling infamy in language base   till sense was lost in sound and silence fled the place   the slayer of himself yet saw i there   the gore congealed was clotted in his hair   with eyes half closed and gaping mouth he lay   and grim as when he breathed his sullen soul away   in midst of all the dome misfortune sate   and gloomy discontent and fell debate   and madness laughing in his ireful mood   and armed

magnificence disposed   we leave the monarch pleased and haste to bring   the knights to combat and their arms to sing   book iii     the day approached when fortune should decide   the important enterprise and give the bride   for now the rivals round the world had sought   and each his number well appointed brought   the nations far and near contend in choice   and send the flower of war by public voice   that after or before were never known   such chiefs as each an army seemed alone   beside the champions all of high degree   who knighthood loved and deeds of chivalry   thronged to the lists and envied to behold   the names of others not their own enrolled   nor seems it strange for every noble knight   who loves the fair and is endued with might   in such a quarrel would be proud to fight   there breathes not scarce a man on british ground   an isle for love and arms of old renowned   but would have sold his life to purchase fame   to palamon or arcite sent his name   and had the land selected of the best   half had come hence and let the world provide the rest   a hundred knights with palamon there came   approved in fight and men of mighty name   their arms were several as their nations were   but furnished all alike with sword and spear    some wore coat armour imitating scale   and next their skins were stubborn shirts of mail   some wore a breastplate and a light juppon   their horses clothed with rich caparison   some for defence would leathern bucklers use   of folded hides and others shields of pruce   one hung a poleaxe at his saddlebow   and one a heavy mace to stun the foe   one for his legs and knees provided well   with jambeux armed and double plates of steel   this on his helmet wore a ladys glove   and that a sleeve embroidered by his love    with palamon above the rest in place   lycurgus came the surly king of thrace   black was his beard and manly was his face   the balls of his broad eyes rolled in his head   and glared betwixt a yellow and a red   he looked a lion with a gloomy stare   and oer his eyebrows hung his matted hair   bigboned and large of limbs with sinews strong   broadshouldered and his arms were round and long   four milkwhite bulls the thracian use of old   were yoked to draw his car of burnished gold   upright he stood and bore aloft his shield   conspicuous from afar and overlooked the field   his surcoat was a bearskin on his back   his hair hung long behind and glossy ravenblack   his ample forehead bore a coronet   with sparkling diamonds and with rubies set   ten brace and more of greyhounds snowy fair   and tall as stags ran loose and coursed around his chair   a match for pards in flight in grappling for the bear   with golden muzzles all their mouths were bound   and collars of the same their necks surround    thus through the fields lycurgus took his way   his hundred knights attend in pomp and proud array    to match this monarch with strong arcite came   emetrius king of inde a mighty name   on a bay courser goodly to behold   the trappings of his horse embossed with barbarous gold   not mars bestrode a steed with greater grace   his surcoat oer his arms was cloth of thrace   adorned with pearls all orient round and great   his saddle was of gold with emeralds set   his shoulders large a mantle did attire   with rubies thick and sparkling as the fire   his ambercoloured locks in ringlets run   with graceful negligence and shone against the sun   his nose was aquiline his eyes were blue   ruddy his lips and fresh and fair his hue   some sprinkled freckles on his face were seen   whose dusk set off the whiteness of the skin   his awful presence did the crowd surprise   nor durst the rash spectator meet his eyes   eyes that confessed him born for kingly sway   so fierce they flashed intolerable day   his age in natures youthful prime appeared   and just began to bloom his yellow beard   wheneer he spoke his voice was heard around   loud as a trumpet with a silver sound   a laurel wreathed his temples fresh and green   and myrtle sprigs the marks of love were mixed between   upon his fist he bore for his delight   an eagle well reclaimed and lily white    his hundred knights attend him to the war   all armed for battle save their heads were bare   words and devices blazed on every shield   and pleasing was the terror of the field   for kings and dukes and barons you might see   like sparkling stars though different in degree   all for the increase of arms and love of chivalry   before the king tame leopards led the way   and troops of lions innocently play   so bacchus through the conquered indies rode   and beasts in gambols frisked before their honest god    in this array the war of either side   through athens passed with military pride   at prime they entered on the sunday morn   rich tapestry spread the streets and flowers the posts adorn   the town was all a jubilee of feasts   so theseus willed in honour of his guests   himself with open arms the kings embraced   then all the rest in their degrees were graced   no harbinger was needful for the night   for every house was proud to lodge a knight    i pass the royal treat nor must relate   the gifts bestowed nor how the champions sate   who first who last or how the knights addressed   their vows or who was fairest at the feast   whose voice whose graceful dance did most surprise   soft amorous sighs and silent love of eyes   the rivals call my muse another way   to sing their vigils for the ensuing day   twas ebbing darkness past the noon of night   and phosphor on the confines of the light   promised the sun ere day began to spring   the tuneful lark already stretched her wing   and flickering on her nest made short essays to sing    when wakeful palamon preventing day   took to the royal lists his early way   to venus at her fane in her own house to pray   there falling on his knees before her shrine   he thus implored with prayers her power divine   creator venus genial power of love   the bliss of men below and gods above   beneath the sliding sun thou runst thy race   dost fairest shine and best become thy place   for thee the winds their eastern blasts forbear   thy month reveals the spring and opens all the year   thee goddess thee the storms of winter fly   earth smiles with flowers renewing laughs the sky   and birds to lays of love their tuneful notes apply   for thee the lion loathes the taste of blood   and roaring hunts his female through the wood   for thee the bulls rebellow through the groves   and tempt the stream and snuff their absent loves   tis thine whateer is pleasant good or fair   all nature is thy province life thy care   thou madest the world and dost the world repair   thou gladder of the mount of cytheron   increase of jove companion of the sun   if eer adonis touched thy tender heart   have pity goddess for thou knowest the smart   alas i have not words to tell my grief   to vent my sorrow would be some relief   light sufferings give us leisure to complain   we groan but cannot speak in greater pain   o goddess tell thyself what i would say   thou knowest it and i feel too much to pray   so grant my suit as i enforce my might   in love to be thy champion and thy knight   a servant to thy sex a slave to thee   a foe professed to barren chastity   nor ask i fame or honour of the field   nor choose i more to vanquish than to yield   in my divine emilia make me blest   let fate or partial chance dispose the rest   find thou the manner and the means prepare   possession more than conquest is my care   mars is the warriors god in him it lies   on whom he favours to confer the prize   with smiling aspect you serenely move   in your fifth orb and rule the realm of love   the fates but only spin the coarser clue   the finest of the wool is left for you   spare me but one small portion of the twine   and let the sisters cut below your line   the rest among the rubbish may they sweep   or add it to the yarn of some old misers heap   but if you this ambitious prayer deny   a wish i grant beyond mortality   then let me sink beneath proud arcites arms   and i once dead let him possess her charms    thus ended he then with observance due   the sacred incense on her altar threw   the curling smoke mounts heavy from the fires   at length it catches flame and in a blaze expires   at once the gracious goddess gave the sign   her statue shook and trembled all the shrine   pleased palamon the tardy omen took   for since the flames pursued the trailing smoke   he knew his boon was granted but the day   to distance driven and joy adjourned with long delay    now morn with rosy light had streaked the sky   up rose the sun and up rose emily   addressed her early steps to cynthias fane   in state attended by her maiden train   who bore the vests that holy rites require   incense and odorous gums and covered fire   the plenteous horns with pleasant mead they crown   nor wanted aught besides in honour of the moon   now while the temple smoked with hallowed steam   they wash the virgin in a living stream   the secret ceremonies i conceal   uncouth perhaps unlawful to reveal   but such they were as pagan use required   performed by women when the men retired   whose eyes profane their chaste mysterious rites   might turn to scandal or obscene delights   wellmeaners think no harm but for the rest   things sacred they pervert and silence is the best   her shining hair uncombed was loosely spread   a crown of mastless oak adorned her head   when to the shrine approached the spotless maid   had kindling fires on either altar laid   the rites were such as were observed of old   by statius in his theban story told   then kneeling with her hands across her breast   thus lowly she preferred her chaste request    o goddess haunter of the woodland green   to whom both heaven and earth and seas are seen   queen of the nether skies where half the year   thy silver beams descend and light the gloomy sphere   goddess of maids and conscious of our hearts   so keep me from the vengeance of thy darts   which niobes devoted issue felt   when hissing through the skies the feathered deaths   were dealt    as i desire to live a virgin life   nor know the name of mother or of wife   thy votress from my tender years i am   and love like thee the woods and sylvan game   like death thou knowest i loathe the nuptial state   and man the tyrant of our sex i hate   a lowly servant but a lofty mate   where love is duty on the female side   on theirs mere sensual gust and sought with surly pride   now by thy triple shape as thou art seen   in heaven earth hell and everywhere a queen   grant this my first desire let discord cease   and make betwixt the rivals lasting peace   quench their hot fire or far from me remove   the flame and turn it on some other love   or if my frowning stars have so decreed   that one must be rejected one succeed   make him my lord within whose faithful breast   is fixed my image and who loves me best   but oh even that avert i choose it not   but take it as the least unhappy lot   a maid i am and of thy virgin train   oh let me still that spotless name retain   frequent the forests thy chaste will obey   and only make the beasts of chase my prey    the flames ascend on either altar clear   while thus the blameless maid addressed her prayer   when lo the burning fire that shone so bright   flew off all sudden with extinguished light   and left one altar dark a little space   which turned selfkindled and renewed the blaze   that other victorflame a moment stood   then fell and lifeless left the extinguished wood   for ever lost the irrevocable light   forsook the blackening coals and sunk to night   at either end it whistled as it flew   and as the brands were green so dropped the dew   infected as it fell with sweat of sanguine hue    the maid from that ill omen turned her eyes   and with loud shrieks and clamours rent the skies   nor knew what signified the boding sign   but found the powers displeased and feared the wrath divine    then shook the sacred shrine and sudden light   sprung through the vaulted roof and made the temple bright   the power behold the power in glory shone   by her bent bow and her keen arrows known   the rest a huntress issuing from the wood   reclining on her cornel spear she stood   then gracious thus began dismiss thy fear   and heavens unchanged decrees attentive hear   more powerful gods have torn thee from my side   unwilling to resign and doomed a bride   the two contending knights are weighed above   one mars protects and one the queen of love   but which the man is in the thunderers breast   this he pronounced tis he who loves thee best   the fire that once extinct revived again   foreshows the love allotted to remain   farewell she said and vanished from the place   the sheaf of arrows shook and rattled in the case   aghast at this the royal virgin stood   disclaimed and now no more a sister of the wood   but to the parting goddess thus she prayed   propitious still be present to my aid   nor quite abandon your once favoured maid   then sighing she returned but smiled betwixt   with hopes and fears and joys with sorrows mixt    the next returning planetary hour   of mars who shared the heptarchy of power   his steps bold arcite to the temple bent   to adorn with pagan rites the power armipotent   then prostrate low before his altar lay   and raised his manly voice and thus began to pray   strong god of arms whose iron sceptre sways   the freezing north and hyperborean seas   and scythian colds and thracias wintry coast   where stand thy steeds and thou art honoured most   there most but everywhere thy power is known   the fortune of the fight is all thy own   terror is thine and wild amazement flung   from out thy chariot withers even the strong   and disarray and shameful rout ensue   and force is added to the fainting crew   acknowledged as thou art accept my prayer   if aught i have achieved deserve thy care   if to my utmost power with sword and shield   i dared the death unknowing how to yield   and falling in my rank still kept the field   then let my arms prevail by thee sustained   that emily by conquest may be gained   have pity on my pains nor those unknown   to mars which when a lover were his own   venus the public care of all above   thy stubborn heart has softened into love   now by her blandishments and powerful charms   when yielded she lay curling in thy arms   even by thy shame if shame it may be called   when vulcan had thee in his net enthralled   o envied ignominy sweet disgrace   when every god that saw thee wished thy place   by those dear pleasures aid my arms in fight   and make me conquer in my patrons right   for i am young a novice in the trade   the fool of love unpractised to persuade   and want the soothing arts that catch the fair   but caught my self lie struggling in the snare   and she i love or laughs at all my pain   or knows her worth too well and pays me with disdain   for sure i am unless i win in arms   to stand excluded from emilias charms   nor can my strength avail unless by thee   endued with force i gain the victory   then for the fire which warmed thy generous heart   pity thy subjects pains and equal smart   so be the morrows sweat and labour mine   the palm and honour of the conquest thine   then shall the war and stern debate and strife   immortal be the business of my life   and in thy fane the dusty spoils among   high on the burnished roof my banner shall be hung   ranked with my champions bucklers and below   with arms reversed the achievements of my foe   and while these limbs the vital spirit feeds   while day to night and night to day succeeds   thy smoking altar shall be fat with food   of incense and the grateful steam of blood   burntofferings morn and evening shall be thine   and fires eternal in thy temple shine   the bush of yellow beard this length of hair   which from my birth inviolate i bear   guiltless of steel and from the razor free   shall fall a plenteous crop reserved for thee   so may my arms with victory be blest   i ask no more let fate dispose the rest    the champion ceased there followed in the close   a hollow groan a murmuring wind arose   the rings of iron that on the doors were hung   sent out a jarring sound and harshly rung   the bolted gates blew open at the blast   the storm rushed in and arcite stood aghast   the flames were blown aside yet shone they bright   fanned by the wind and gave a ruffled light   then from the ground a scent began to rise   sweet smelling as accepted sacrifice   this omen pleased and as the flames aspire   with odorous incense arcite heaps the fire   nor wanted hymns to mars or heathen charms   at length the nodding statue clashed his arms   and with a sullen sound and feeble cry   half sunk and half pronounced the word of victory   for this with soul devout he thanked the god   and of success secure returned to his abode    these vows thus granted raised a strife above   betwixt the god of war and queen of love   she granting first had right of time to plead   but he had granted too nor would recede   jove was for venus but he feared his wife   and seemed unwilling to decide the strife   till saturn from his leaden throne arose   and found a way the difference to compose   though sparing of his grace to mischief bent   he seldom does a good with good intent   wayward but wise by long experience taught   to please both parties for ill ends he sought   for this advantage age from youth has won   as not to be outridden though outrun   by fortune he was now to venus trined   and with stern mars in capricorn was joined   of him disposing in his own abode   he soothed the goddess while he gulled the god   cease daughter to complain and stint the strife   thy palamon shall have his promised wife   and mars the lord of conquest in the fight   with palm and laurel shall adorn his knight   wide is my course nor turn i to my place   till length of time and move with tardy pace   man feels me when i press the etherial plains   my hand is heavy and the wound remains   mine is the shipwreck in a watery sign   and in an earthy the dark dungeon mine   cold shivering agues melancholy care   and bitter blasting winds and poisoned air   are mine and wilful death resulting from despair   the throttling quinsey tis my star appoints   and rheumatisms i send to rack the joints   when churls rebel against their native prince   i arm their hands and furnish the pretence   and housing in the lions hateful sign   bought senates and deserting troops are mine   mine is the privy poisoning i command   unkindly seasons and ungrateful land   by me kings palaces are pushed to ground   and miners crushed beneath their mines are found   twas i slew samson when the pillared hall   fell down and crushed the many with the fall   my looking is the sire of pestilence   that sweeps at once the people and the prince   now weep no more but trust thy grandsires art   mars shall be pleased and thou perform thy part   tis ill though different your complexions are   the family of heaven for men should war   the expedient pleased where neither lost his right   mars had the day and venus had the night   the management they left to chronos care   now turn we to the effect and sing the war    in athens all was pleasure mirth and play   all proper to the spring and sprightly may   which every soul inspired with such delight   twas justing all the day and love at night   heaven smiled and gladded was the heart of man   and venus had the world as when it first began   at length in sleep their bodies they compose   and dreamt the future fight and early rose    now scarce the dawning day began to spring   as at a signal given the streets with clamours ring   at once the crowd arose confused and high   even from the heaven was heard a shouting cry   for mars was early up and roused the sky   the gods came downward to behold the wars   sharpening their sights and leaning from their stars   the neighing of the generous horse was heard   for battle by the busy groom prepared   rustling of harness rattling of the shield   clattering of armour furbished for the field     crowds to the castle mounted up the street   battering the pavement with their coursers feet   the greedy sight might there devour the gold   of glittering arms too dazzling to behold   and polished steel that cast the view aside   and crested morions with their plumy pride   knights with a long retinue of their squires   in gaudy liveries march and quaint attires   one laced the helm another held the lance   a third the shining buckler did advance   the courser pawed the ground with restless feet   and snorting foamed and champed the golden bit   the smiths and armourers on palfreys ride   files in their hands and hammers at their side   and nails for loosened spears and thongs for shields provide   the yeomen guard the streets in seemly bands   and clowns come crowding on with cudgels in their hands    the trumpets next the gate in order placed   attend the sign to sound the martial blast   the palace yard is filled with floating tides   and the last comers bear the former to the sides   the throng is in the midst the common crew   shut out the hall admits the better few   in knots they stand or in a rank they walk   serious in aspect earnest in their talk   factious and favouring this or tother side   as their strong fancies and weak reason guide   their wagers back their wishes numbers hold   with the fair freckled king and beard of gold   so vigorous are his eyes such rays they cast   so prominent his eagles beak is placed   but most their looks on the black monarch bend   his rising muscles and his brawn commend   his doublebiting axe and beamy spear   each asking a gigantic force to rear   all spoke as partial favour moved the mind   and safe themselves at others cost divined    waked by the cries the athenian chief arose   the knightly forms of combat to dispose   and passing through the obsequious guards he sate   conspicuous on a throne sublime in state   there for the two contending knights he sent   armed capapie with reverence low they bent   he smiled on both and with superior look   alike their offered adoration took   the people press on every side to see   their awful prince and hear his high decree   then signing to their heralds with his hand   they gave his orders from their lofty stand   silence is thrice enjoined then thus aloud   the kingatarms bespeaks the knights and listening crowd   our sovereign lord has pondered in his mind   the means to spare the blood of gentle kind   and of his grace and inborn clemency   he modifies his first severe decree   the keener edge of battle to rebate   the troops for honour fighting not for hate   he wills not death should terminate their strife   and wounds if wounds ensue be short of life   but issues ere the fight his dread command   that slings afar and poniards hand to hand   be banished from the field that none shall dare   with shortened sword to stab in closer war   but in fair combat fight with manly strength   nor push with biting point but strike at length   the turney is allowed but one career   of the tough ash with the sharpgrinded spear   but knights unhorsed may rise from off the plain   and fight on foot their honour to regain   nor if at mischief taken on the ground   be slain but prisoners to the pillar bound   at either barrier placed nor captives made   be freed or armed anew the fight invade   the chief of either side bereft of life   or yielded to his foe concludes the strife   thus dooms the lord now valiant knights and young   fight each his fill with swords and maces long    the herald ends the vaulted firmament   with loud acclaims and vast applause is rent   heaven guard a prince so gracious and so good   so just and yet so provident of blood   this was the general cry the trumpets sound   and warlike symphony is heard around   the marching troops through athens take their way   the great earlmarshal orders their array   the fair from high the passing pomp behold   a rain of flowers is from the window rolled   the casements are with golden tissue spread   and horses hoofs for earth on silken tapestry tread   the king goes midmost and the rivals ride   in equal rank and close his either side   next after these there rode the royal wife   with emily the cause and the reward of strife   the following cavalcade by three and three   proceed by titles marshalled in degree   thus through the southern gate they take their way   and at the list arrived ere prime of day   there parting from the king the chiefs divide   and wheeling east and west before their many ride   the athenian monarch mounts his throne on high   and after him the queen and emily   next these the kindred of the crown are graced   with nearer seats and lords by ladies placed   scarce were they seated when with clamours loud   in rushed at once a rude promiscuous crowd   the guards and then each other overbare   and in a moment throng the spacious theatre   now changed the jarring noise to whispers low   as winds forsaking seas more softly blow   when at the western gate on which the car   is placed aloft that bears the god of war   proud arcite entering armed before his train   stops at the barrier and divides the plain   red was his banner and displayed abroad   the bloody colours of his patron god    at that self moment enters palamon   the gate of venus and the rising sun   waved by the wanton winds his banner flies   all maiden white and shares the peoples eyes   from east to west look all the world around   two troops so matched were never to be found   such bodies built for strength of equal age   in stature sized so proud an equipage   the nicest eye could no distinction make   where lay the advantage or what side to take    thus ranged the herald for the last proclaims   a silence while they answered to their names   for so the king decreed to shun with care   the fraud of musters false the common bane of war   the tale was just and then the gates were closed   and chief to chief and troop to troop opposed   the heralds last retired and loudly cried   the fortune of the field be fairly tried    at this the challenger with fierce defy   his trumpet sounds the challenged makes reply   with clangour rings the field resounds the vaulted sky   their vizors closed their lances in the rest   or at the helmet pointed or the crest   they vanish from the barrier speed the race   and spurring see decrease the middle space   a cloud of smoke envelopes either host   and all at once the combatants are lost   darkling they join adverse and shock unseen   coursers with coursers justling men with men   as labouring in eclipse a while they stay   till the next blast of wind restores the day   they look anew the beauteous form of fight   is changed and war appears a grisly sight   two troops in fair array one moment showed   the next a field with fallen bodies strowed   not half the number in their seats are found   but men and steeds lie grovelling on the ground   the points of spears are stuck within the shield   the steeds without their riders scour the field   the knights unhorsed on foot renew the fight   the glittering fauchions cast a gleaming light   hauberks and helms are hewed with many a wound   out spins the streaming blood and dyes the ground   the mighty maces with such haste descend   they break the bones and make the solid armour bend   this thrusts amid the throng with furious force   down goes at once the horseman and the horse   that courser stumbles on the fallen steed   and floundering throws the rider oer his head   one rolls along a football to his foes   one with a broken truncheon deals his blows   this halting this disabled with his wound   in triumph led is to the pillar bound   where by the kings award he must abide   there goes a captive led on tother side   by fits they cease and leaning on the lance   take breath a while and to new fight advance    full oft the rivals met and neither spared   his utmost force and each forgot to ward   the head of this was to the saddle bent   the other backward to the crupper sent   both were by turns unhorsed the jealous blows   fall thick and heavy when on foot they close   so deep their fauchions bite that every stroke   pierced to the quick and equal wounds they gave and took   borne far asunder by the tides of men   like adamant and steel they met agen    so when a tiger sucks the bullocks blood   a famished lion issuing from the wood   roars lordly fierce and challenges the food   each claims possession neither will obey   but both their paws are fastened on the prey   they bite they tear and while in vain they strive   the swains come armed between and both to distance drive   at length as fate foredoomed and all things tend   by course of time to their appointed end   so when the sun to west was far declined   and both afresh in mortal battle joined   the strong emetrius came in arcites aid   and palamon with odds was overlaid   for turning short he struck with all his might   full on the helmet of the unwary knight   deep was the wound he staggered with the blow   and turned him to his unexpected foe   whom with such force he struck he felled him down   and cleft the circle of his golden crown   but arcites men who now prevailed in fight   twice ten at once surround the single knight   oerpowered at length they force him to the ground   unyielded as he was and to the pillar bound   and king lycurgus while he fought in vain   his friend to free was tumbled on the plain    who now laments but palamon compelled   no more to try the fortune of the field   and worse than death to view with hateful eyes   his rivals conquest and renounce the prize    the royal judge on his tribunal placed   who had beheld the fight from first to last   bade cease the war pronouncing from on high   arcite of thebes had won the beauteous emily   the sound of trumpets to the voice replied   and round the royal lists the heralds cried   arcite of thebes has won the beauteous bride    the people rend the skies with vast applause   all own the chief when fortune owns the cause   arcite is owned even by the gods above   and conquering mars insults the queen of love   so laughed he when the rightful titan failed   and joves usurping arms in heaven prevailed   laughed all the powers who favour tyranny   and all the standing army of the sky   but venus with

joy with unexpected sorrow palled   the victor knight had laid his helm aside   part for his ease the greater part for pride   bareheaded popularly low he bowed   and paid the salutations of the crowd   then spurring at full speed ran headlong on   where theseus sat on his imperial throne   furious he drove and upward cast his eye   where next the queen was placed his emily   then passing to the saddlebow he bent   a sweet regard the gracious virgin lent   for women to the brave an easy prey   still follow fortune where she leads the way   just then from earth sprung out a flashing fire   by pluto sent at saturns bad desire   the startling steed was seized with sudden fright   and bounding oer the pummel cast the knight   forward he flew and pitching on his head   he quivered with his feet and lay for dead    black was his countenance in a little space   for all the blood was gathered in his face   help was at hand they reared him from the ground   and from his cumbrous arms his limbs unbound   then lanced a vein and watched returning breath   it came but clogged with symptoms of his death   the saddlebow the noble parts had prest   all bruised and mortified his manly breast   him still entranced and in a litter laid   they bore from field and to his bed conveyed   at length he waked and with a feeble cry   the word he first pronounced was emily    mean time the king though inwardly he mourned   in pomp triumphant to the town returned   attended by the chiefs who fought the field   now friendly mixed and in one troop compelled   composed his looks to counterfeited cheer   and bade them not for arcites life to fear   but that which gladded all the warrior train   though most were sorely wounded none were slain   the surgeons soon despoiled them of their arms   and some with salves they cure and some with charms   foment the bruises and the pains assuage   and heal their inward hurts with sovereign draughts of sage   the king in person visits all around   comforts the sick congratulates the sound   honours the princely chiefs rewards the rest   and holds for thrice three days a royal feast   none was disgraced for falling is no shame   and cowardice alone is loss of fame   the venturous knight is from the saddle thrown   but tis the fault of fortune not his own   if crowds and palms the conquering side adorn   the victor under better stars was born    the brave man seeks not popular applause   nor overpowered with arms deserts his canse   unshamed though foiled he does the best he can   force is of brutes but honour is of man    thus theseus smiled on all with equal grace   and each was set according to his place   with ease were reconciled the differing parts   for envy never dwells in noble hearts   at length they took their leave the time expired   well pleased and to their several homes retired    mean while the health of arcite still impairs   from bad proceeds to worse and mocks the leechs cares   swoln is his breast his inward pains increase   all means are used and all without success   the clottered blood lies heavy on his heart   corrupts and there remains in spite of art   nor breathing veins nor cupping will prevail   all outward remedies and inward fail   the mould of natures fabric is destroyed   her vessels discomposed her virtue void   the bellows of his lungs begins to swell   all out of frame is every secret cell   nor can the good receive nor bad expel   those breathing organs thus within opprest   with venom soon distend the sinews of his breast   nought profits him to save abandoned life   nor vomits upward aid nor downward laxative   the midmost region battered and destroyed   when nature cannot work the effect of art is void   for physic can but mend our crazy state   patch an old building not a new create   arcite is doomed to die in all his pride   must leave his youth and yield his beauteous bride   gained hardly against right and unenjoyed    when twas declared all hope of life was past   conscience that of all physic works the last   caused him to send for emily in haste   with her at his desire came palamon   then on his pillow raised he thus begun   no language can express the smallest part   of what i feel and suffer in my heart   for you whom best i love and value most   but to your service i bequeath my ghost   which from this mortal body when untied   unseen unheard shall hover at your side   nor fright you waking nor your sleep offend   but wait officious and your steps attend   how i have loved excuse my faltering tongue   my spirits feeble and my pains are strong   this i may say i only grieve to die   because i lose my charming emily   to die when heaven had put you in my power   fate could not choose a more malicious hour   what greater curse could envious fortune give   than just to die when i began to live   vain men how vanishing a bliss we crave   now warm in love now withering in the grave   never o never more to see the sun   still dark in a damp vault and still alone   this fate is common but i lose my breath   near bliss and yet not blessed before my death   farewell but take me dying in your arms   tis all i can enjoy of all your charms   this hand i cannot but in death resign   ah could i live but while i live tis mine   i feel my end approach and thus embraced   am pleased to die but hear me speak my last   ah my sweet foe for you and you alone   i broke my faith with injured palamon   but love the sense of right and wrong confounds   strong love and proud ambition have no bounds   and much i doubt should heaven my life prolong   i should return to justify my wrong   for while my former flames remain within   repentance is but want of power to sin   with mortal hatred i pursued his life   nor he nor you were guilty of the strife   nor i but as i loved yet all combined   your beauty and my impotence of mind   and his concurrent flame that blew my fire   for still our kindred souls had one desire   he had a moments right in point of time   had i seen first then his had been the crime   fate made it mine and justified his right   nor holds this earth a more deserving knight   for virtue valour and for noble blood   truth honour all that is comprised in good   so help me heaven in all the world is none   so worthy to be loved as palamon   he loves you too with such a holy fire   as will not cannot but with life expire   our vowed affections both have often tried   nor any love but yours could ours divide   then by my loves inviolable band   by my long suffering and my short command   if eer you plight your vows when i am gone   have pity on the faithful palamon   this was his last for death came on amain   and exercised below his iron reign   then upward to the seat of life he goes   sense fled before him what he touched he froze   yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw   though less and less of emily he saw   so speechless for a little space he lay   then grasped the hand he held and sighed his soul away    but whither went his soul let such relate   who search the secrets of the future state   divines can say but what themselves believe   strong proofs they have but not demonstrative   for were all plain then all sides must agree   and faith itself be lost in certainty   to live uprightly then is sure the best   to save ourselves and not to damn the rest   the soul of arcite went where heathens go   who better live than we though less they know    in palamon a manly grief appears   silent he wept ashamed to show his tears   emilia shrieked but once and then opprest   with sorrow sunk upon her lovers breast   till theseus in his arms conveyed with care   far from so sad a sight the swooning fair   twere loss of time her sorrow to relate   ill bears the sex a youthful lovers fate   when just approaching to the nuptial state   but like a lowhung cloud it rains so fast   that all at once it falls and cannot last   the face of things is changed and athens now   that laughed so late becomes the scene of woe   matrons and maids both sexes every state   with tears lament the knights untimely fate   not greater grief in falling troy was seen   for hectors death but hector was not then   old men with dust deformed their hoary hair   the women beat their breasts their cheeks they tear   why wouldst thou go with one consent they cry   when thou hadst gold enough and emily   theseus himself who should have cheered the grief   of others wanted now the same relief   old Ægeus only could revive his son   who various changes of the world had known   and strange vicissitudes of human fate   still altering never in a steady state   good after ill and after pain delight   alternate like the scenes of day and night   since every man who lives is born to die   and none can boast sincere felicity   with equal mind what happens let us bear   nor joy nor grieve too much for things beyond our care   like pilgrims to the appointed place we tend   the worlds an inn and death the journeys end   even kings but play and when their part is done   some other worse or better mount the throne   with words like these the crowd was satisfied   and so they would have been had theseus died   but he their king was labouring in his mind   a fitting place for funeral pomps to find   which were in honour of the dead designed   and after long debate at last he found   as love itself had marked the spot of ground   that grove for ever green that conscious laund   where he with palamon fought hand to hand   that where he fed his amorous desires   with soft complaints and felt his hottest fires   there other flames might waste his earthly part   and burn his limbs where love had burned his heart    this once resolved the peasants were enjoined   serewood and firs and doddered oaks to find   with sounding axes to the grove they go   fell split and lay the fuel in a row   vulcanian food a bier is next prepared   on which the lifeless body

spread   a sword keenedged within his right he held   the warlike emblem of the conquered field   bare was his manly visage on the bier   menaced his countenance even in death severe   then to the palacehall they bore the knight   to lie in solemn state a public sight   groans cries and bowlings fill the crowded place   and unaffected sorrow sat on every face   sad palamon above the rest appears   in sable garments dewed with gushing tears   his auburn locks on either shoulder flowed   which to the funeral of his friend he vowed   but emily as chief was next his side   a virginwidow and a mourning bride   and that the princely obsequies might be   performed according to his high degree   the steed that bore him living to the fight   was trapped with polished steel all shining bright   and covered with the atchievements of the knight   the riders rode abreast and one his shield   his lance of cornelwood another held   the third his bow and glorious to behold   the costly quiver all of burnished gold   the noblest of the grecians next appear   and weeping on their shoulders bore the bier   with sober pace they marched and often stayed   and through the masterstreet the corps conveyed   the houses to their tops with black were spread   and even the pavements were with mourning hid   the right side of the pall old Ægeus kept   and on the left the royal theseus wept   each bore a golden bowl of work divine   with honey filled and milk and mixed with ruddy wine   then palamon the kinsman of the slain   and after him appeared the illustrious train   to grace the pomp came emily the bright   with covered fire the funeral pile to light   with high devotion was the service made   and all the rites of pagan honour paid   so lofty was the pile a parthian bow   with vigour drawn must send the shaft below   the bottom was full twenty fathom broad   with crackling straw beneath in due proportion strowed   the fabric seemed a wood of rising green   with sulphur and bitumen cast between   to feed the flames the trees were unctuous fir   and mountainash the mother of the spear   the mourneryew and builderoak were there   the beech the swimming alder and the plane   hard box and linden of a softer grain   and laurels which the gods for conquering chiefs ordain   how they were ranked shall rest untold by me   with nameless nymphs that lived in every tree   nor how the dryads and the woodland train   disherited ran howling oer the plain   nor how the birds to foreign seats repaired   or beasts that bolted out and saw the forests bared   nor how the ground now cleared with ghastly fright   beheld the sudden sun a stranger to the light    the straw as first i said was laid below   of chips and serewood was the second row   the third of greens and timber newly felled   the fourth high stage the fragrant odours held   and pearls and precious stones and rich array   in midst of which embalmed the body lay   the service sung the maid with mourning eyes   the stubble fired the smouldering flames arise   this office done she sunk upon the ground   but what she spoke recovered from her swound   i want the wit in moving words to dress   but by themselves the tender sex may guess   while the devouring fire was burning fast   rich jewels in the flame the wealthy cast   and some their shields and some their lances threw   and gave the warriors ghost a warriors due   full bowls of wine of honey milk and blood   were poured upon the pile of burning wood   and hissing flames receive and hungry lick the food   then thrice the mounted squadrons ride around   the fire and arcites name they thrice resound   hail and farewell they shouted thrice amain   thrice facing to the left and thrice they turned again   still as they turned they beat their clattering shields   the women mix their cries and clamour fills the fields   the warlike wakes continued all the night   and funeral games were played at new returning light   who naked wrestled best besmeared with oil   or who with gauntlets gave or took the foil   i will not tell you nor would you attend   but briefly haste to my long storys end    i pass the rest the year was fully mourned   and palamon long since to thebes returned   when by the grecians general consent   at athens theseus held his parliament   among the laws that passed it was decreed   that conquered thebes from bondage should be freed   reserving homage to the athenian throne   to which the sovereign summoned palamon   unknowing of the cause he took his way   mournful in mind and still in black array    the monarch mounts the throne and placed on high   commands into the court the beauteous emily   so called she came the senate rose and paid   becoming reverence to the royal maid   and first soft whispers through the assembly went   with silent wonder then they watched the event   all hushed the king arose with awful grace   deep thought was in his breast and counsel in his face   at length he sighed and having first prepared   the attentive audience thus his will declared    the cause and spring of motion from above   hung down on earth the golden chain of love   great was the effect and high was his intent   when peace among the jarring seeds he sent   fire flood and earth and air by this were bound   and love the common link the new creation crowned   the chain still holds for though the forms decay   eternal matter never wears away   the same first mover certain bounds has placed   how long those perishable forms shall last   nor can they last beyond the time assigned   by that allseeing and allmaking mind   shorten their hours they may for will is free   but never pass the appointed destiny   so men oppressed when weary of their breath   throw off the burden and suborn their death   then since those forms begin and have their end   on some unaltered cause they sure depend   parts of the whole are we but god the whole   who gives us life and animating soul   for nature cannot from a part derive   that being which the whole can only give   he perfect stable but imperfect we   subject to change and different in degree   plants beasts and man and as our organs are   we more or less of his perfection share   but by a long descent the etherial fire   corrupts and forms the mortal part expire   as he withdraws his virtue so they pass   and the same matter makes another mass   this law the omniscient power was pleased to give   that every kind should by succession live   that individuals die his will ordains   the propagated species still remains   the monarch oak the patriarch of the trees   shoots rising up and spreads by slow degrees   three centuries he grows and three he stays   supreme in state and in three more decays   so wears the paving pebble in the street   and towns and towers their fatal periods meet   so rivers rapid once now naked lie   forsaken of their springs and leave their channels dry   so man at first a drop dilates with heat   then formed the little heart begins to beat   secret he feeds unknowing in the cell   at length for hatching ripe he breaks the shell   and struggles into breath and cries for aid   then helpless in his mothers lap is laid   he creeps he walks and issuing into man   grudges their life from whence his own began   reckless of laws affects to rule alone   anxious to reign and restless on the throne   first vegetive then feels and reasons last   rich of three souls and lives all three to waste   some thus but thousands more in flower of age   for few arrive to run the latter stage   sunk in the first in battle some are slain   and others whelmed beneath the stormy main   what makes all this but jupiter the king   at whose command we perish and we spring   then tis our best since thus ordained to die   to make a virtue of necessity   take what he gives since to rebel is vain   the bad grows better which we well sustain   and could we choose the time and choose aright   tis best to die our honour at the height   when we have done our ancestors no shame   but served our friends and well secured our fame   then should we wish our happy life to close   and leave no more for fortune to dispose   so should we make our death a glad relief   from future shame from sickness and from grief   enjoying while we live the present hour   and dying in our excellence and flower   then round our deathbed every friend should run   and joy us of our conquest early won   while the malicious world with envious tears   should grudge our happy end and wish it theirs   since then our arcite is with honour dead   why should we mourn that he so soon is freed   or call untimely what the gods decreed   with grief as just a friend may be deplored   from a foul prison to free air restored   ought he to thank his kinsman or his wife   could tears recall him into wretched life   their sorrow hurts themselves on him is lost   and worse than both offends his happy ghost   what then remains but after past annoy   to take the good vicissitude of joy   to thank the gracious gods for what they give   possess our souls and while we live to live   ordain we then two sorrows to combine   and in one point the extremes of grief to join   that thence resulting joy may be renewed   as jarring notes in harmony conclude   then i propose that palamon shall be   in marriage joined with beauteous emily   for which already i have gained the assent   of my free people in full parliament   long love to her has borne the faithful knight   and well deserved had fortune done him right   tis time to mend her fault since emily   by arcites death from former vows is free   if you fair sister ratify the accord   and take him for your husband and your lord   tis no dishonour to confer your grace   on one descended from a royal race   and were he less yet years of service past   from grateful souls exact reward at last   pity is heavens and yours nor can she find   a throne so soft as in a womans mind    he said she blushed and as oerawed by might   seemed to give theseus what she gave the knight   then turning to the theban thus he said    small arguments are needful to persuade   your temper to comply with my command    and speaking thus he gave emilias hand   smiled venus to behold her own true knight   obtain the conquest though he lost the fight   and blessed with nuptial bliss the sweet laborious night   eros and anteros on either side   one fired the bridegroom and one warmed the bride   and longattending hymen from above    showered on the bed the whole idalian grove   all of a tenor was their afterlife   no day discoloured with domestic strife   no jealousy but mutual truth believed   secure repose and kindness undeceived   thus heaven beyond the compass of his thought   sent him the blessing he so dearly bought    so may the queen of love long duty bless   and all true lovers find the same success  notes  dedication   her grace the duchess of
