71888815	the man who kept his money in a box  by anthony trollope     i first saw the man who kept his money in a box in the midst of the ravine of the via mala  i interchanged a few words with him or with his wife at the hospice at the top of the splugen and i became acquainted with him in the courtyard of conradis hotel at chiavenna it was however afterwards at bellaggio on the lake of como that that acquaintance ripened into intimacy  a good many years have rolled by since then and i believe this little episode in his life may be told without pain to the feelings of any one  his name was  let us for the present say that his name was greene how he learned that my name was robinson i do not know but i remember well that he addressed me by my name at chiavenna  to go back however for a moment to the via malai had been staying for a few days at the golden eagle at tusiswhich bythebye i hold to be the best small inn in all switzerland and its hostess to be or to have been certainly the prettiest landladyand on the day of my departure southwards i had walked on into the via mala so that the diligence might pick me up in the gorge  this pass i regard as one of the grandest spots to which my wandering steps have ever carried me and though i had already lingered about it for many hours i now walked thither again to take my last farewell of its dark towering rocks its narrow causeway and roaring river trusting to my friend the landlady to see that my luggage was duly packed upon the diligence  i need hardly say that my friend did not betray her trust  as one goes out from switzerland towards italy the road through the via mala ascends somewhat steeply and passengers by the diligence may walk from the inn at tusis into the gorge and make their way through the greater part of the ravine before the vehicle will overtake them this however mr greene with his wife and daughter had omitted to do  when the diligence passed me in the defile the horses trotting for a few yards over some level portion of the road i saw a mans nose pressed close against the glass of the coupe window  i saw more of his nose than of any other part of his face but yet i could perceive that his neck was twisted and his eye upturned and that he was making a painful effort to look upwards to the summit of the rocks from his position inside the carriage  there was such a roar of wind and waters at the spot that it was not practicable to speak to him but i beckoned with my finger and then pointed to the road indicating that he should have walked  he understood me though i did not at the moment understand his answering gesture  it was subsequently when i knew somewhat of his habits that he explained to me that on pointing to his open mouth he had intended to signify that he would be afraid of sore throat in exposing himself to the air of that damp and narrow passage  i got up into the conductors covered seat at the back of the diligence and in this position encountered the drifting snow of the splugen  i think it is coldest of all the passes  near the top of the pass the diligence stops for awhile and it is here if i remember that the austrian officials demand the travellers passports  at least in those days they did so  these officials have now retreated behind the quadrilateresoon as we hope to make a further retreatand the district belongs to the kingdom of united italy  there is a place of refreshment or hospice here into which we all went for a few moments and i then saw that my friend with the weak throat was accompanied by two ladies  you should not have missed the via mala i said to him as he stood warming his toes at the huge covered stove  we miss everything said the elder of the two ladies who however was very much younger than the gentleman and not very much older than her companion  i saw it beautifully mamma said the younger one whereupon mamma gave her head a toss and made up her mind as i thought to take some little vengeance before long upon her stepdaughter  i observed that miss greene always called her stepmother mamma on the first approach of any stranger so that the nature of the connection between them might be understood  and i observed also that the elder lady always gave her head a toss when she was so addressed  we dont mean to enjoy ourselves till we get down to the lake of como said mr greene  as i looked at him cowering over the stove and saw how oppressed he was with great coats and warm wrappings for his throat i quite agreed with him that he had not begun to enjoy himself as yet  then we all got into our places again and i saw no more of the greenes till we were standing huddled together in the large courtyard of conradis hotel at chiavenna  chiavenna is the first italian town which the tourist reaches by this route and i know no town in the north of italy which is so closely surrounded by beautiful scenery  the traveller as he falls down to it from the splugen road is bewildered by the loveliness of the valleys that is to say if he so arranges that he can see them without pressing his nose against the glass of a coach window  and then from the town itself there are walks of two three and four hours which i think are unsurpassed for wild and sometimes startling beauties  one gets into little valleys green as emeralds and surrounded on all sides by grey broken rocks in which italian rasselases might have lived in perfect bliss and then again one comes upon distant views up the river courses bounded far away by the spurs of the alps which are perfectto which the fancy can add no additional charm conradis hotel also is by no means bad or was not in those days for my part i am inclined to think that italian hotels have received a worse name than they deserve and i must profess that looking merely to creature comforts i would much sooner stay a week at the golden key at chiavenna than with mine host of the kings head in the thriving commercial town of muddleboro on the borders of yorkshire and lancashire  i am always rather keen about my room in travelling and having secured a chamber looking out upon the mountains had returned to the courtyard to collect my baggage before mr greene had succeeded in realising his position or understanding that he had to take upon himself the duties of settling his family for the night in the hotel by which he was surrounded  when i descended he was stripping off the outermost of three great coats and four waiters around him were beseeching him to tell them what accommodation he would require  mr greene was giving sundry very urgent instructions to the conductor respecting his boxes but as these were given in english i was not surprised to find that they were not accurately followed  the man however was much too courteous to say in any language that he did not understand every word that was said to him  miss greene was standing apart doing nothing  as she was only eighteen years of age it was of course her business to do nothing and a very pretty little girl she was by no means ignorant of her own beauty and possessed of quite sufficient wit to enable her to make the most of it  mr greene was very leisurely in his proceedings and the four waiters were almost reduced to despair  i want two bedrooms a dressingroom and some dinner he said at last speaking very slowly and in his own vernacular  i could not in the least assist him by translating it into italian for i did not speak a word of the language myself but i suggested that the man would understand french  the waiter however had understood english waiters do understand all languages with a facility that is marvellous and this one now suggested that mrs greene should follow him upstairs  mrs greene however would not move till she had seen that her boxes were all right and as mrs greene was also a pretty woman i found myself bound to apply myself to her assistance  oh thank you said she  the people are so stupid that one can really do nothing with them  and as for mr greene he is of no use at all  you see that box the smaller one  i have four hundred pounds worth of jewellery in that and therefore i am obliged to look after it  indeed said i rather startled at this amount of confidence on rather a short acquaintance  in that case i do not wonder at your being careful  but is it not rather rash perhaps  i know what you are going to say  well perhaps it is rash  but when you are going to foreign courts what are you to do  if you have got those sort of things you must wear them  as i was not myself possessed of anything of that sort and had no intention of going to any foreign court i could not argue the matter with her  but i assisted her in getting together an enormous pile of luggage among which there were seven large boxes covered with canvas such as ladies not uncommonly carry with them when travelling  that one which she represented as being smaller than the others and as holding jewellery might be about a yard long by a foot and a half deep  being ignorant in those matters i should have thought it sufficient to carry all a ladys wardrobe for twelve months  when the boxes were collected together she sat down upon the jewelcase and looked up into my face  she was a pretty woman perhaps thirty years of age with long light yellow hair which she allowed to escape from her bonnet knowing perhaps that it was not unbecoming to her when thus dishevelled  her skin was very delicate and her complexion good  indeed her face would have been altogether prepossessing had there not been a want of gentleness in her eyes  her hands too were soft and small and on the whole she may be said to have been possessed of a strong battery of feminine attractions  she also well knew how to use them  whisper she said to me with a peculiar but very proper aspiration on the hwhhisper and both by the aspiration and the use of the word i knew at once from what island she had come  mr greene keeps all his money in this box also so i never let it go out of my sight for a moment  but whatever you do dont tell him that i told you so  i laid my hand on my heart and made a solemn asseveration that i would not divulge her secret  i need not however have troubled myself much on that head for as i walked up stairs keeping my eye upon the precious trunk mr greene addressed me  you are an englishman mr robinson said he  i acknowledged that i was  i am another  my wife however is irish  my daughterby a former marriageis english also  you see that box there  oh yes said i i see it  i began to be so fascinated by the box that i could not keep my eyes off it  i dont know whether or no it is prudent but i keep all my money there my money for travelling i mean  if i were you then i answered i would not say anything about it to any one  oh no of course not said he i should not think of mentioning it  but those brigands in italy always take away what you have about your person but they dont meddle with the heavy luggage  bills of exchange or circular notes i suggested  ah yes and if you cant identify yourself or happen to have a headache you cant get them changed  i asked an old friend of mine who has been connected with the bank of england for the last fifty years and he assured me that there was nothing like sovereigns  but you never get the value for them  well not quite  one loses a franc or a franc and a half  but still theres the certainty and thats the great matter  an english sovereign will go anywhere and he spoke these words with considerable triumph  undoubtedly if you consent to lose a shilling on each sovereign  at any rate i have got three hundred and fifty in that box he said  i have them done up in rolls of twentyfive pounds each  i again recommended him to keep this arrangement of his as private as possiblea piece of counsel which i confess seemed to me to be much neededand then i went away to my own room having first accepted an invitation from mrs greene to join their party at dinner  do said she we have been so dull and it will be so pleasant  i did not require to be much pressed to join myself to a party in which there was so pretty a girl as miss greene and so attractive a woman as mrs greene  i therefore accepted the invitation readily and went away to make my toilet  as i did so i passed the door of mr greenes room and saw the long file of boxes being borne into the centre of it  i spent a pleasant evening with however one or two slight drawbacks  as to old greene himself he was all that was amiable but then he was nervous full of cares and somewhat apt to be a bore  he wanted information on a thousand points and did not seem to understand that a young man might prefer the conversation of his daughter to his own  not that he showed any solicitude to prevent conversation on the part of his daughter  i should have been perfectly at liberty to talk to either of the ladies had he not wished to engross all my attention to himself  he also had found it dull to be alone with his wife and daughter for the last six weeks  he was a small spare man probably over fifty years of age who gave me to understand that he had lived in london all his life and had made his own fortune in the city  what he had done in the city to make his fortune he did not say  had i come across him there i should no doubt have found him to be a sharp man of business quite competent to teach me many a useful lesson of which i was as ignorant as an infant  had he caught me on the exchange or at lloyds or in the big room of the bank of england i should have been compelled to ask him everything  now in this little town under the alps he was as much lost as i should have been in lombard street and was ready enough to look to me for information  i was by no means chary in giving him my counsel and imparting to him my ideas on things in general in that part of the worldonly i should have preferred to be allowed to make myself civil to his daughter  in the course of conversation it was mentioned by him that they intended to stay a few days at bellaggio which as all the world knows is a central spot on the lake of como and a favourite resting place for travellers  there are three lakes which all meet here and to all of which we give the name of como  they are properly called the lakes of como colico and lecco and bellaggio is the spot at which their waters join each other  i had half made up my mind to sleep there one night on my road into italy and now on hearing their purpose i declared that such was my intention  how very pleasant said mrs greene  it will be quite delightful to have some one to show us how to settle ourselves for really  my dear im sure you cant say that you ever have much trouble  and who does then mr greene  i am sure sophonisba does not do much to help me  you wont let me said sophonisba whose name i had not before heard  her papa had called her sophy in the yard of the inn sophonisba greene  sophonisba robinson did not sound so badly in my ears and i confess that i had tried the names together  her papa had mentioned to me that he had no other child and had mentioned also that he had made his fortune  and then there was a little family contest as to the amount of travelling labour which fell to the lot of each of the party during which i retired to one of the windows of the big front room in which we were sitting  and how much of this labour there is incidental to a tourists pursuits  and how often these little contests do arise upon a journey  who has ever travelled and not known them  i had taken up such a position at the window as might i thought have removed me out of hearing but nevertheless from time to time a word would catch my ear about that precious box  i have never taken my eyes off it since i left england said mrs greene speaking quick and with a considerable brogue superinduced by her energy  where would it have been at basle if i had not been looking after it  quite safe said sophonisba those large things always are safe  are they miss thats all you know about it  i suppose your bonnetbox was quite safe when i found it on the platform atati forget the name of the place  freidrichshafen said sophonisba with almost an unnecessary amount of teutonic skill in her pronunciation  well mamma you have told me of that at least twenty times  soon after that the ladies took them to their own rooms weary with the travelling of two days and a night and mr greene went fast asleep in the very comfortless chair in which he was seated  at four oclock on the next morning we started on our journey   early to bed and early to rise is the way to be healthy and wealthy and wise   we all know that lesson and many of us believe in it but if the lesson be true the italians ought to be the healthiest and wealthiest and wisest of all men and women  three or four oclock seems to them quite a natural hour for commencing the days work  why we should have started from chiavenna at four oclock in order that we might be kept waiting for the boat an hour and a half on the little quay at colico i dont know but such was our destiny  there we remained an hour and a half mrs greene sitting pertinaciously on the one important box  she had designated it as being smaller than the others and as all the seven were now ranged in a row i had an opportunity of comparing them  it was something smallerperhaps an inch less high and an inch and a half shorter  she was a sharp woman and observed my scrutiny  i always know it she said in a loud whisper by this little hole in the canvas and she put her finger on a slight rent on one of the ends  as for greene if one of those italian brigands were to walk off with it on his shoulders before his eyes he wouldnt be the wiser  how helpless you men are mr robinson  it is well for us that we have women to look after us  but you have got no one to look after youor perhaps you have left her behind  no indeed  im all alone in the world as yet  but its not my own fault  i have asked half a dozen  now mr robinson  and in this way the time passed on the quay at colico till the boat came and took us away  i should have preferred to pass my time in making myself agreeable to the younger lady but the younger lady stood aloof turning up her nose as i thought at her mamma  i will not attempt to describe the scenery about colico  the little town itself is one of the vilest places under the sun having no accommodation for travellers and being excessively unhealthy but there is very little either north or south of the alpsand perhaps i may add very little elsewhereto beat the beauty of the mountains which cluster round the head of the lake  when we had sat upon those boxes that hour and a half we were taken on board the steamer which had been lying off a little way from the shore and then we commenced our journey  of course there was a good deal of exertion and care necessary in getting the packages off from the shore on to the boat and i observed that any one with half an eye in his head might have seen that the mental anxiety expended on that one box which was marked by the small hole in the canvas far exceeded that which was extended to all the other six boxes  they deserve that it should be stolen i said to myself for being such fools  and then we went down to breakfast in the cabin  i suppose it must be safe said mrs greene to me ignoring the fact that the cabin waiter understood english although she had just ordered some veal cutlets in that language  as safe as a church i replied not wishing to give much apparent importance to the subject  they cant carry it off here said mr greene  but he was innocent of any attempt at a joke and was looking at me with all his eyes  they might throw it overboard said sophonisba  i at once made up my mind that she could not be a goodnatured girl  the moment that breakfast was over mrs greene returned again upstairs and i found her seated on one of the benches near the funnel from which she could keep her eyes fixed upon the box  when one is obliged to carry about ones jewels with one one must be careful mr robinson she said to me apologetically  but i was becoming tired of the box and the funnel was hot and unpleasant therefore i left her  i had made up my mind that sophonisba was illnatured but nevertheless she was pretty and i now went through some little manoeuvres with the object of getting into conversation with her this i soon did and was surprised by her frankness  how tired you must be of mamma and her box she said to me  to this i made some answer declaring that i was rather interested than otherwise in the safety of the precious trunk  it makes me sick said sophonisba to hear her go on in that way to a perfect stranger  i heard what she said about her jewellery  it is natural she should be anxious i said seeing that it contains so much that is valuable  why did she bring them said sophonisba  she managed to live very well without jewels till papa married her about a year since and now she cant travel about for a month without lugging them with her everywhere  i should be so glad if some one would steal them  but all mr greenes money is there also  i dont want papa to be bothered but i declare i wish the box might be lost for a day or so  she is such a fool dont you think so mr robinson  at this time it was just fourteen hours since i first had made their acquaintance in the yard of conradis hotel and of those fourteen hours more than half had been passed in bed  i must confess that i looked upon sophonisba as being almost more indiscreet than her motherinlaw  nevertheless she was not stupid and i continued my conversation with her the greatest part of the way down the lake towards bellaggio  these steamers which run up and down the lake of como and the lago maggiore put out their passengers at the towns on the banks of the water by means of small rowingboats and the persons who are about to disembark generally have their own articles ready to their hands when their turn comes for leaving the steamer  as we came near to bellaggio i looked up my own portmanteau and pointing to the beautiful woodcovered hill that stands at the fork of the waters told my friend greene that he was near his destination  i am very glad to hear it said he complacently but he did not at the moment busy himself about the boxes  then the small boat ran up alongside the steamer and the passengers for como and milan crowded up the side  we have to go in that boat i said to greene  nonsense he exclaimed  oh but we have  what put our boxes into that boat said mrs greene  oh dear here boatman there are seven of these boxes all in white like this and she pointed to the one that had the hole in the canvas make haste  and there are two bags and my dressing case and mr greenes portmanteau  mr greene where is your portmanteau  the boatman whom she addressed no doubt did not understand a word of english but nevertheless he knew what she meant and being well accustomed to the work got all the luggage together in an incredibly small number of moments  if you will get down into the boat i said i will see that the luggage follows you before i leave the deck  i wont stir she said till i see that box lifted down  take care youll let it fall into the lake  i know you will  i wish they would sophonisba whispered into my ear  mr greene said nothing but i could see that his eyes were as anxiously fixed on what was going on as were those of his wife  at last however the three greens were in the boat as also were all the packages  then i followed them my portmanteau having gone down before me and we pushed off for bellaggio  up to this period most of the attendants around us had understood a word or two of english but now it would be well if we could find some one to whose ears french would not be unfamiliar  as regarded mr greene and his wife they i found must give up all conversation as they knew nothing of any language but their own  sophonisba could make herself understood in french and was quite at home as she assured me in german  and then the boat was beached on the shore at bellaggio and we all had to go again to work with the object of getting ourselves lodged at the hotel which overlooks the water  i had learned before that the greenes were quite free from any trouble in this respect for their rooms had been taken for them before they left england  trusting to this mrs greene gave herself no inconsiderable airs the moment her foot was on the shore and ordered the people about as though she were the lady paramount of bellaggio italians however are used to this from travellers of a certain description  they never resent such conduct but simply put it down in the bill with the other articles  mrs greenes words on this occasion were innocent enough seeing that they were english but had i been that head waiter who came down to the beach with his nice black shiny hair and his napkin under his arm i should have thought her manner very insolent  indeed as it was i did think so and was inclined to be angry with her  she was to remain for some time at bellaggio and therefore it behoved her as she thought to assume the character of the grand lady at once  hitherto she had been willing enough to do the work but now she began to order about mr greene and sophonisba and as it appeared to me to order me about also  i did not quite enjoy this so leaving her still among her luggage and satellites i walked up to the hotel to see about my own bedroom  i had some seltzer water stood at the window for three or four minutes and then walked up and down the room  but still the greenes were not there  as i had put in at bellaggio solely with the object of seeing something more of sophonisba it would not do for me to quarrel with them or to allow them so to settle themselves in their private sittingroom that i should be excluded  therefore i returned again to the road by which they must come up and met the procession near the house  mrs greene was leading it with great majesty the waiter with the shiny hair walking by her side to point out to her the way  then came all the luggageeach porter carrying a white canvascovered box that which was so valuable no doubt was carried next to mrs greene so that she might at a moments notice put her eye upon the wellknown valuable rent  i confess that i did not observe the hole as the train passed by me nor did i count the number of the boxes  seven boxes all alike are very many and then they were followed by three other men with the inferior articlesmr greenes portmanteau the carpetbag e c  at the tail of the line i found mr greene and behind him sophonisba  all your fatigues will be over now i said to the gentleman thinking it well not to be too particular in my attentions to his daughter  he was panting beneath a terrible great coat having forgotten that the shores of an italian lake are not so cold as the summits of the alps and did not answer me  im sure i hope so said sophonisba  and i shall advise papa not to go any farther unless he can persuade mrs greene to send her jewels home sophy my dear he said for heavens sake let us have a little peace since we are here  from all which i gathered that mr green had not been fortunate in his second matrimonial adventure  we then made our way slowly up to the hotel having been altogether distanced by the porters and when we reached the house we found that the different packages were already being carried away through the house some this way and some that  mrs green the meanwhile was talking loudly at the door of her own sittingroom  mr greene she said as soon as she saw her heavily oppressed spousefor the noonday sun was upmr greene where are you  here my dear and mr greene threw himself panting into the corner of a sofa  a little seltzer water and brandy i suggested  mr greenes inmost heart leaped at the hint and nothing that his remonstrant wife could say would induce him to move until he had enjoyed the delicious draught  in the mean time the box with the hole in the canvas had been lost  yes when we came to look into matters to count the packages and to find out where we were the box with the hole in the canvas was not there  or at any rate mrs greene said it was not there  i worked hard to look it up and even went into sophonisbas bedroom in my search  in sophonisbas bedroom there was but one canvascovered box  that is my own said she and it is all that i have except this bag  where on earth can it be said i sitting down on the trunk in question  at the moment i almost thought that she had been instrumental in hiding it  how am i to know she answered and i fancied that even she was dismayed  what a fool that woman is  the box must be in the house i said  do find it for papas sake theres a good fellow  he will be so wretched without his money  i heard him say that he had only two pounds in his purse  oh i can let him have money to go on with i answered grandly  and then i went off to prove that i was a good fellow and searched throughout the house  two white boxes had by order been left downstairs as they would not be needed and these two were in a large cupboard of the hall which was used expressly for stowing away luggage  and then there were three in mrs greenes bedroom which had been taken there as containing the wardrobe which she would require while remaining at bellaggio  i searched every one of these myself to see if i could find the hole in the canvas  but the hole in the canvas was not there  and let me count as i would i could make out only six  now there certainly had been seven on board the steamer though i could not swear that i had seen the seven put into the small boat  mr greene said the lady standing in the middle of her remaining treasures all of which were now open you are worth nothing when travelling  were you not behind  but mr greenes mind was full and he did not answer  it has been stolen before your very eyes she continued  nonsense mamma said sophonisba  if ever it came out of the steamer it certainly came into the house  i saw it out of the steamer said mrs greene and it certainly is not in the house  mr robinson may i trouble you to send for the policeat once if you please sir  i had been at bellaggio twice before but nevertheless i was ignorant of their system of police  and then again i did not know what was the italian for the word  i will speak to the landlord i said  if you will have the goodness to send for the police at once i will be obliged to you  and as she thus reiterated her command she stamped with her foot upon the floor  there are no police at bellaggio said sophonisba  what on earth shall i do for money to go on with said mr greene looking piteously up to the ceiling and shaking both his hands  and now the whole house was in an uproar including not only the landlord his wife and daughters and all the servants but also every other visitor at the hotel  mrs greene was not a lady who hid either her glories or her griefs under a bushel and though she spoke only in english she soon made her protestations sufficiently audible  she protested loudly that she had been robbed and that she had been robbed since she left the steamer  the box had come on shore of that she was quite certain  if the landlord had any regard either for his own character or for that of his house he would ascertain before an hour was over where it was and who had been the thief  she would give him an hour  and then she sat herself down but in two minutes she was up again vociferating her wrongs as loudly as ever  all this was filtered through me and sophonisba to the waiter in french and from the waiter to the landlord but the ladys gestures required no translation to make them intelligible and the state of her mind on the matter was i believe perfectly well understood  mr greene i really did pity  his feelings of dismay seemed to be quite as deep but his sorrow and solicitude were repressed into more decorum  what am i to do for money he said  i have not a shilling to go on with  and he still looked up at the ceiling  you must send to england said sophonisba  it will take a month he replied  mr robinson will let you have what you want at present added sophonisba  now i certainly had said so and had meant it at the time  but my whole travelling store did not exceed forty or fifty pounds with which i was going on to venice and then back to england through the tyrol  waiting a month for mr greenes money from england might be even more inconvenient to me than to him  then it occurred to me that the wants of the greene family would be numerous and expensive and that my small stock would go but a little way among so many  and what also if there had been no money and no jewels in that accursed box  i confess that at the moment such an idea did strike my mind  one hears of sharpers on every side committing depredations by means of most singular intrigues and contrivances might it not be possible that the whole batch of greenes belonged to this order of society  it was a base idea i own but i confess that i entertained it for a moment  i retired to my own room for a while that i might think over all the circumstances  there certainly had been seven boxes and one had had a hole in the canvas  all the seven had certainly been on board the steamer  to so much i felt that i might safely swear  i had not counted the seven into the small boat but on leaving the larger vessel i had looked about the deck to see that none of the greene trappings were forgotten  if left on the steamer it had been so left through an intent on the part of some one there employed  it was quite possible that the contents of the box had been ascertained through the imprudence of mrs greene and that it had been conveyed away so that it might be rifled at como  as to mrs greenes assertion that all the boxes had been put into the small boat i thought nothing of it  the people at bellaggio could not have known which box to steal nor had there been time to concoct the plan in carrying the boxes up to the hotel  i came at last to this conclusion that the missing trunk had either been purloined and carried on to comoin which case it would be necessary to lose no time in going after it or that it had been put out of sight in some uncommonly clever way by the greenes themselves as an excuse for borrowing as much money as they could raise and living without payment of their bills  with reference to the latter hypothesis i declared to myself that greene did not look like a swindler but as to mrs greene  i confess that i did not feel so confident in regard to her  charity begins at home so i proceeded to make myself comfortable in my room feeling almost certain that i should not be able to leave bellaggio on the following morning  i had opened my portmanteau when i first arrived leaving it open on the floor as is my wont  some people are always being robbed and are always locking up everything while others wander safe over the world and never lock up anything for myself i never turn a key anywhere and no one ever purloins from me even a handkerchief  cantabit vacuus and i am always sufficiently vacuus  perhaps it is that i have not a handkerchief worth the stealing  it is your heavyladen suspicious maladroit greenes that the thieves attack  i now found out that the accommodating boots who already knew my ways had taken my travelling gear into a dark recess which was intended to do for a dressingroom and had there spread my portmanteau open upon some table or stool in the corner  it was a convenient arrangement and there i left it during the whole period of my sojourn  mrs greene had given the landlord an hour to find the box and during that time the landlord the landlady their three daughters and all the servants in the house certainly did exert themselves to the utmost  half a dozen times they came to my door but i was luxuriating in a washingtub making up for that fouroclock start from chiavenna  i assured them however that the box was not there and so the search passed by  at the end of the hour i went back to the greenes according to promise having resolved that some one must be sent on to como to look after the missing article  there was no necessity to knock at their sittingroom door for it was wide open  i walked in and found mrs greene still engaged in attacking the landlord while all the porters who had carried the luggage up to the house were standing round  her voice was loud above the others but luckily for them all she was speaking english  the landlord i saw was becoming sulky  he spoke in italian and we none of us understood him but i gathered that he was declining to do anything further  the box he was certain had never come out of the steamer  the boots stood by interpreting into french and acting as second interpreter i put it into english  mr greene who was seated on the sofa groaned audibly but said nothing  sophonisba who was sitting by him beat upon the floor with both her feet  do you hear mr greene said she turning to him  do you mean to allow that vast amount of property to be lost without an effort  are you prepared to replace my jewels  her jewels said sophonisba looking up into my face  papa had to pay the bill for every stitch she had when he married her  these last words were so spoken as to be audible only by me but her first exclamation was loud enough  were they people for whom it would be worth my while to delay my journey and put myself to serious inconvenience with reference to money  a few minutes afterwards i found myself with greene on the terrace before the house  what ought i to do said he  go to como said i and look after your box  i will remain here and go on board the return steamer  it may perhaps be there  but i cant speak a word of italian said he  take the boots said i  but i cant speak a word of french  and then it ended in my undertaking to go to como  i swear that the thought struck me that i might as well take my portmanteau with me and cut and run when i got there  the greenes were nothing to me  i did not however do this  i made the poor man a promise and i kept it  i took merely a dressingbag for i knew that i must sleep at como and thus resolving to disarrange all my plans i started  i was in the midst of beautiful scenery but i found it quite impossible to draw any enjoyment from itfrom that or from anything around me my whole mind was given up to anathemas against this odious box as to which i had undoubtedly heavy cause of complaint  what was the box to me  i went to como by the afternoon steamer and spent a long dreary evening down on the steamboat quays searching everywhere and searching in vain  the boat by which we had left colico had gone back to colico but the people swore that nothing had been left on board it  it was just possible that such a box might have gone on to milan with the luggage of other passengers  i slept at como and on the following morning i went on to milan there was no trace of the box to be found in that city  i went round to every hotel and travelling office but could hear nothing of it parties had gone to venice and florence and bologna and any of them might have taken the box  no one however remembered it and i returned back to como and thence to bellaggio reaching the latter place at nine in the evening disappointed weary and cross  has monsieur found the accursed trunk said the bellaggio boots meeting me on the quay  in the name of the no  has it not turned up here  monsieur said the boots we shall all be mad soon  the poor master he is mad already  and then i went up to the house  my jewels shouted mrs greene rushing to me with her arms stretched out as soon as she heard my step in the corridor  i am sure that she would have embraced me had i found the box  i had not however earned any such reward  i can hear nothing of the box either at como or milan i said  then what on earth am i to do for my money said mr greene  i had had neither dinner nor supper but the elder greenes did not care for that  mr greene sat silent in despair and mrs greene stormed about the room in her anger  i am afraid you are very tired said sophonisba  i am tired and hungry and thirsty said i  i was beginning to get angry and to think myself ill used  and that idea as to a family of swindlers became strong again  greene had borrowed ten napoleons from me before i started for como and i had spent above four in my fruitless journey to that place and milan  i was beginning to fear that my whole purpose as to venice and the tyrol would be destroyed and i had promised to meet friends at innspruck whowho were very much preferable to the greenes  as events turned out i did meet them  had i failed in this the present mrs robinson would not have been sitting opposite to me  i went to my room and dressed myself and then sophonisba presided over the teatable for me  what are we to do she asked me in a confidential whisper  wait for money from england  but they will think we are all sharpers she said and upon my word i do not wonder at it from the way in which that woman goes on  she then leaned forward resting her elbow on the table and her face on her hand and told me a long history of all their family discomforts her papa was a very good sort of man only he had been made a fool of by that intriguing woman who had been left without a sixpence with which to bless herself  and now they had nothing but quarrels and misery  papa did not always got the worst of itpapa could rouse himself sometimes only now he was beaten down and cowed by the loss of his money  this whispering confidence was very nice in its way seeing that sophonisba was a pretty girl but the whole matter seemed to be full of suspicion  if they did not want to take you in in one way they did in another said the present mrs robinson when i told the story to her at innspruck  i beg that it may be understood that at the time of my meeting the greenes i was not engaged to the present mrs robinson and was open to make any matrimonial engagement that might have been pleasing to me  on the next morning after breakfast we held a council of war  i had been informed that mr greene had made a fortune and was justified in presuming him to be a rich man  it seemed to me therefore that his course was easy  let him wait at bellaggio for more money and when he returned home let him buy mrs greene more jewels  a poor man always presumes that a rich man is indifferent about his money  but in truth a rich man never is indifferent about his money and poor greene looked very blank at my proposition  do you mean to say that its gone for ever he asked  ill not leave the country without knowing more about it said mrs greene  it certainly is very odd said sophonisba  even sophonisba seemed to think that i was too offhand  it will be a month before i can get money and my bill here will be something tremendous said greene  i wouldnt pay them a farthing till i got my box said mrs greene  thats nonsense said sophonisba  and so it was  hold your tongue miss said the stepmother  indeed i shall not hold my tongue said the stepdaughter  poor greene  he had lost more than his box within the last twelve months for as i had learned in that whispered conversation over the tea table with sophonisba this was in reality her papas marriage trip  another day was now gone and we all went to bed  had i not been very foolish i should have had myself called at five in the morning and have gone away by the early boat leaving my ten napoleons behind me but unfortunately sophonisba had exacted a promise from me that i would not do this and thus all chance of spending a day or two in venice was lost to me  moreover i was thoroughly fatigued and almost glad of any excuse which would allow me to lie in bed on the following morning  i did lie in bed till nine oclock and then found the greenes at breakfast  let us go and look at the serbelloni gardens said i as soon as the silent meal was over or take a boat over to the sommariva villa  i should like it so much said sophonisba  we will do nothing of the kind till i have found my property said mrs greene  mr robinson what arrangement did you make yesterday with the police at como  the police at como i said  i did not go to the police  not go to the police  and do you mean to say that i am to be robbed of my jewels and no efforts made for redress  is there no such thing as a constable in this wretched country  mr greene i do insist upon it that you at once go to the nearest british consul  i suppose i had better write home for money said he  and do you mean to say that you havent written yet said i probably with some acrimony in my voice  you neednt scold papa said sophonisba  i dont know what i am to do said mr greene and he began walking up and down the room but still he did not call for pen and ink and i began again to feel that he was a swindler  was it possible that a man of business who had made his fortune in london should allow his wife to keep all her jewels in a box and carry about his own money in the same  i dont see why you need be so very unhappy papa said sophonisba mr robinson im sure will let you have whatever money you may want at present  this was pleasant  and will mr robinson return me my jewels which were lost i must say in a great measure through his carelessness said mrs greene this was pleasanter  upon my word mrs greene i must deny that said i jumping up what on earth could i have done more than i did do  i have been to milan and nearly fagged myself to death  why didnt you bring a policeman back with you  you would tell everybody on board the boat what there was in it said i  i told nobody but you she answered  i suppose you mean to imply that ive taken the box i rejoined  so that on this the third or fourth day of our acquaintance we did not go on together quite pleasantly  but what annoyed me perhaps the most was the confidence with which it seemed to be mr greenes intention to lean upon my resources  he certainly had not written home yet and had taken my ten napoleons as one friend may take a few shillings from another when he finds that he has left his own silver on his dressingtable  what could he have wanted of ten napoleons  he had alleged the necessity of paying the porters but the few francs he had had in his pocket would have been enough for that  and now sophonisba was ever and again prompt in her assurances that he need not annoy himself about money because i was at his right hand  i went upstairs into my own room and counting all my treasures found that thirtysix pounds and some odd silver was the extent of my wealth  with that i had to go at any rate as far as innspruck and from thence back to london  it was quite impossible that i should make myself responsible for the greenes bill at bellaggio  we dined early and after dinner according to a promise made in the morning sophonisba ascended with me into the serbelloni gardens and walked round the terraces on that beautiful hill which commands the view of the three lakes  when we started i confess that i would sooner have gone alone for i was sick of the greenes in my very soul we had had a terrible day  the landlord had been sent for so often that he refused to show himself again  the landladythough italians of that class are always courteoushad been so driven that she snapped her fingers in mrs greenes face  the three girls would not show themselves  the waiters kept out of the way as much as possible and the boots in confidence abused them to me behind their back monsieur said the boots do you think there ever was such a box  perhaps not said i and yet i knew that i had seen it  i would therefore have preferred to walk without sophonisba but that now was impossible  so i determined that i would utilise the occasion by telling her of my present purpose  i had resolved to start on the following day and it was now necessary to make my friends understand that it was not in my power to extend to them any further pecuniary assistance  sophonisba when we were on the hill seemed to have forgotten the box and to be willing that i should forget it also  but this was impossible  when therefore she told me how sweet it was to escape from that terrible woman and leaned on my arm with all the freedom of old acquaintance i was obliged to cut short the pleasure of the moment  i hope your father has written that letter said i  he means to write it from milan  we know you want to get on so we purpose to leave here the day after tomorrow  oh said i thinking of the bill immediately and remembering that mrs greene had insisted on having champagne for dinner  and if anything more is to be done about the nasty box it may be done there continued sophonisba  but i must go tomorrow said i at 5 am  nonsense said sophonisba  go tomorrow when ii mean weare going on the next day  and i might as well explain said i gently dropping the hand that was on my arm that i findi find it will be impossible for meto to  to what  to advance mr greene any more money just at present  then sophonisbas arm dropped all at once and she exclaimed oh mr robinson  after all there was a certain hard good sense about miss greene which would have protected her from my evil thoughts had i known all the truth  i found out afterwards that she was a considerable heiress and in spite of the opinion expressed by the present mrs robinson when miss walker i do not for a moment think she would have accepted me had i offered to her  you are quite right not to embarrass yourself she said when i explained to her my immediate circumstances but why did you make papa an offer which you cannot perform  he must remain here now till he hears from england  had you explained it all at first the ten napoleons would have carried us to milan  this was all true and yet i thought it hard upon me  it was evident to me now that sophonisba was prepared to join her stepmother in thinking that i had illtreated them and i had not much doubt that i should find mr greene to be of the same opinion there was very little more said between us during the walk and when we reached the hotel at seven or halfpast seven oclock i merely remarked that i would go in and wish her father and mother goodbye i suppose you will drink tea with us said sophonisba and to this i assented  i went into my own room and put all my things into my portmanteau for according to the custom which is invariable in italy when an early start is premeditated the boots was imperative in his demand that the luggage should be ready over night  i then went to the greenes sittingroom and found that the whole party was now aware of my intentions  so you are going to desert us said mrs greene  i must go on upon my journey i pleaded in a weak apologetic voice  go on upon your journey sir said mrs greene  i would not for a moment have you put yourself to inconvenience on our account  and yet i had already lost fourteen napoleons and given up all prospect of going to venice  mr robinson is certainly right not to break his engagement with miss walker said sophonisba  now i had said not a word about an engagement with miss walker having only mentioned incidentally that she would be one of the party at innspruck  but continued she i think he should not have misled us  and in this way we enjoyed our evening meal  i was just about to shake hands with them all previous to my final departure from their presence when the boots came into the room  ill leave the portmanteau till tomorrow morning said he  all right said i  because said he there will be such a crowd of things in the hall the big trunk i will take away now  big trunkwhat big trunk  the trunk with your rug over it on which your portmanteau stood  i looked round at mr mrs and miss greene and saw that they were all looking at me  i looked round at them and as their eyes met mine i felt that i turned as red as fire  i immediately jumped up and rushed away to my own room hearing as i went that all their steps were following me  i rushed to the inner recess pulled down the portmanteau which still remained in its old place tore away my own carpet rug which covered the support beneath it and there sawa white canvascovered box with a hole in the canvas on the side next to me  it is my box said mrs greene pushing me away as she hurried up and put her finger within the rent  it certainly does look like it said mr greene peering over his wifes shoulder  theres no doubt about the box said sophonisba  not the least in life said i trying to assume an indifferent look  mon dieu said the boots  corpo di baccho exclaimed the landlord who had now joined the party  ohhhh screamed mrs greene and then she threw herself hack on to my bed and shrieked hysterically  there was no doubt whatsoever about the fact  there was the lost box and there it had been during all those tedious hours of unavailing search  while i was suffering all that fatigue in milan spending my precious zwanzigers in driving about from one hotel to another the box had been safe standing in my own room at bellaggio hidden by my own rug  and now that it was found everybody looked at me as though it were all my fault  mrs greenes eyes when she had done being hysterical were terrible and sophonisba looked at me as though i were a convicted thief   who put the box here i said turning fiercely upon the boots  i did said the boots by monsieurs express order  by my order i exclaimed  certainly said the boots  corpo di baccho said the landlord and he also looked at me as though i were a thief  in the mean time the landlady and the three daughters had clustered round mrs greene administering to her all manner of italian consolation  the box and the money and the jewels were after all a reality and much incivility can be forgiven to a lady who has really lost her jewels and has really found them again  there and then there arose a hurlyburly among us as to the manner in which the odious trunk found its way into my room  had anybody been just enough to consider the matter coolly it must have been quite clear that i could not have ordered it there  when i entered the hotel the boxes were already being lugged about and i had spoken a word to no one concerning them  that traitorous boots had done it no doubt without malice prepense but he had done it and now that the greenes were once more known as moneyed people he turned upon me and told me to my face that i had desired that box to be taken to my own room as part of my own luggage  my dear said mr greene turning to his wife you should never mention the contents of your luggage to any one  i never will again said mrs greene with a mock repentant air but i really thought  one never can be sure of sharpers said mr greene  thats true said mrs greene  after all it may have been accidental said sophonisba on hearing which goodnatured surmise both papa and mamma greene shook their suspicious heads  i was resolved to say nothing then  it was all but impossible that they should really think that i had intended to steal their box nor if they did think so would it have become me to vindicate myself before the landlord and all his servants  i stood by therefore in silence while two of the men raised the trunk and joined the procession which followed it as it was carried out of my room into that of the legitimate owner  everybody in the house was there by that time and mrs greene enjoying the triumph by no means grudged them the entrance into her sittingroom  she had felt that she was suspected and now she was determined that the world of bellaggio should know how much she was above suspicion  the box was put down upon two chairs the supporters who had borne it retiring a pace each mrs greene then advanced proudly with the selected key and mr greene stood by at her right shoulder ready to receive his portion of the hidden treasure  sophonisba was now indifferent and threw herself on the sofa while i walked up and down the room thoughtfullymeditating what words i should say when i took my last farewell of the greenes  but as i walked i could see what occurred mrs greene opened the box and displayed to view the ample folds of a huge yellow woollen dressingdown  i could fancy that she would not willingly have exhibited this article of her toilet had she not felt that its existence would speedily be merged in the presence of the glories which were to follow  this had merely been the padding at the top of the box  under that lay a long papiermache case and in that were all her treasures  ah they are safe she said opening the lid and looking upon her tawdry pearls and carbuncles  mr greene in the mean time well knowing the passage for his hand had dived down to the very bottom of the box and seized hold of a small canvas bag  it is here said he dragging it up and as far as i can tell as yet the knot has not been untied  whereupon he sat himself down by sophonisba and employing her to assist him in holding them began to count his rolls  they are all right said he and he wiped the perspiration from his brow  i had not yet made up my mind in what manner i might best utter my last words among them so as to maintain the dignity of my character and now i was standing over against mr greene with my arms folded on my breast  i had on my face a frown of displeasure which i am able to assume upon occasions but i had not yet determined what words i would use  after all perhaps it might be as well that i should leave them without any last words  greene my dear said the lady pay the gentleman his ten napoleons  oh yes certainly whereupon mr greene undid one of the rolls and extracted eight sovereigns  i believe that will make it right sir said he handing them to me  i took the gold slipped it with an indifferent air into my waistcoat pocket and then refolded my arms across my breast  papa said sophonisba in a very audible whisper mr robinson went for you to como  indeed i believe he says he went to milan  do not let that be mentioned said i  by all means pay him his expenses said mrs greene i would not owe him anything for worlds  he should be paid said sophonisba  oh certainly said mr greene  and he at once extracted another sovereign and tendered it to me in the face of the assembled multitude  this was too much  mr greene said i i intended to be of service to you when i went to milan and you are very welcome to the benefit of my intentions  the expense of that journey whatever may be its amount is my own affair  and i remained standing with my closed arms  we will be under no obligation to him said mrs greene and i shall insist on his taking the money  the servant will put it on his dressingtable said sophonisba  and she handed the sovereign to the boots giving him instructions  keep it yourself antonio i said  whereupon the man chucked it to the ceiling with his thumb caught it as it fell and with a well satisfied air dropped it into the recesses of his pocket  the air of the greenes was also well satisfied for they felt that they had paid me in full for all my services  and now with many obsequious bows and assurances of deep respect the landlord and his family withdrew from the room  was there anything else they could do for mrs greene  mrs greene was all affability she had shown her jewels to the girls and allowed them to express their admiration in pretty italian superlatives  there was nothing else she wanted tonight  she was very happy and liked bellaggio she would stay yet a week and would make herself quite happy  and though none of them understood a word that the other said each understood that things were now rosecoloured and so with scrapings bows and grinning smiles the landlord and all his myrmidons withdrew  mr greene was still counting his money sovereign by sovereign and i was still standing with my folded arms upon my bosom  i believe i may now go said i  good night said mrs greene  adieu said sophonisba  i have the pleasure of wishing you goodbye said mr greene  and then i walked out of the room  after all what was the use of saying anything  and what could i say that would have done me any service  if they were capable of thinking me a thiefwhich they certainly didnothing that i could say would remove the impression nor as i thought was it suitable that i should defend myself from such an imputation  what were the greenes to me  so i walked slowly out of the room and never again saw one of the family from that day to this  as i stood upon the beach the next morning while my portmanteau was being handed into the boat i gave the boots five zwanzigers  i was determined to show him that i did not condescend to feel anger against him  he took the money looked into my face and then whispered to me why did you not give me a word of notice beforehand he said and winked his eye  he was evidently a thief and took me to be anotherbut what did it matter  i went thence to milan in which city i had no heart to look at anything thence to verona and so over the pass of the brenner to innspruck  when i once found myself near to my dear friends the walkers i was again a happy man and i may safely declare that though a portion of my journey was so troublesome and unfortunate i look back upon that tour as the happiest and the luckiest epoch of my life
