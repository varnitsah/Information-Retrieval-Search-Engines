and mrs aleshine     the casting away of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine  part i  illustration   i was on my way from san francisco to yokohama when in a very desultory and gradual manner i became acquainted with mrs lecks and mrs aleshine the steamer on which i was making a moderately rapid passage toward the land of the legended fan and the lacquered box carried a fair complement of passengers most of whom were americans and among these my attention was attracted from the very first day of the voyage to two middleaged women who appeared to me very unlike the ordinary traveler or tourist at first sight they might have been taken for farmers wives who for some unusual reason had determined to make a voyage across the pacific but on closer observation one would have been more apt to suppose that they belonged to the families of prosperous tradesmen in some little country town where besides the arts of rural housewifery there would be opportunities of becoming acquainted in some degree with the ways and manners of the outside world they were not of that order of persons who generally take firstclass passages on steamships but the stateroom occupied by mrs lecks and mrs aleshine was one of the best in the vessel and although they kept very much to themselves and showed no desire for the company or notice of the other passengers they evidently considered themselves quite as good as any one else and with as much right to voyage to any part of the world in any manner or style which pleased them  mrs lecks was a rather tall woman largeboned and muscular and her wellbrowned countenance gave indications of that conviction of superiority which gradually grows up in the minds of those who for a long time have had absolute control of the destinies of a state or the multifarious affairs of a country household mrs aleshine was somewhat younger than her friend somewhat shorter and a great deal fatter she had the same air of reliance upon her individual worth that characterized mrs lecks but there was a certain geniality about her which indicated that she would have a good deal of forbearance for those who never had had the opportunity or the ability of becoming the thoroughly good housewife which she was herself  these two worthy dames spent the greater part of their time on deck where they always sat together in a place at the stern of the vessel which was well sheltered from wind and weather as they sat thus they were generally employed in knitting although this occupation did not prevent them from keeping up what seemed to me as i passed them in my walks about the deck a continuous conversation from a question which mrs lecks once asked me about a distant sail our acquaintance began there was no one on board for whose society i particularly cared and as there was something quaint and odd about these countrywomen on the ocean which interested me i was glad to vary my solitary promenades by an occasional chat with them they were not at all backward in giving me information about themselves they were both widows and mrs aleshine was going out to japan to visit a son who had a position there in a mercantile house mrs lecks had no children and was accompanying her friend because as she said she would not allow mrs aleshine to make such a voyage as that by herself and because being quite able to do so she did not know why she should not see the world as well as other people  these two friends were not educated women they made frequent mistakes in their grammar and a good deal of middle states provincialism showed itself in their pronunciation and expressions but although they brought many of their rural ideas to sea with them they possessed a large share of that common sense which is available anywhere and they frequently made use of it in a manner which was very amusing to me i think also that they found in me a quarry of information concerning nautical matters foreign countries and my own affairs the working of which helped to make us very good ship friends  our steamer touched at the sandwich islands and it was a little more than two days after we left honolulu that about nine oclock in the evening we had the misfortune to come into collision with an easternbound vessel the fault was entirely due to the other ship the lookout on which although the night was rather dark and foggy could easily have seen our lights in time to avoid collision if he had not been asleep or absent from his post be this as it may this vessel which appeared to be a small steamer struck us with great force near our bows and then backing disappeared into the fog and we never saw or heard of her again the general opinion was that she was injured very much more than we were and that she probably sank not very long after the accident for when the fog cleared away about an hour afterward nothing could be seen of her lights  as it usually happens on occasions of accidents at sea the damage to our vessel was at first reported to be slight but it was soon discovered that our injuries were serious and indeed disastrous the hull of our steamer had been badly shattered on the port bow and the water came in at a most alarming rate for nearly two hours the crew and many of the passengers worked at the pumps and everything possible was done to stop the enormous leak but all labor to save the vessel was found to be utterly unavailing and a little before midnight the captain announced that it was impossible to keep the steamer afloat and that we must all take to the boats the night was now clear the stars were bright and as there was but little wind the sea was comparatively smooth with all these advantages the captain assured us that there was no reason to apprehend danger and he thought that by noon of the following day we could easily make a small inhabited island where we could be sheltered and cared for until we should be taken off by some passing vessel  there was plenty of time for all necessary preparations and these were made with much order and subordination some of the ladies among the cabin passengers were greatly frightened and inclined to be hysterical there were pale faces also among the gentlemen but everybody obeyed the captains orders and all prepared themselves for the transfer to the boats the first officer came among us and told each of us what boats we were to take and where we were to place ourselves on deck i was assigned to a large boat which was to be principally occupied by steerage passengers and as i came up from my stateroom where i had gone to secure my money and some portable valuables i met on the companionway mrs lecks and mrs aleshine who expressed considerable dissatisfaction when they found that i was not going in the boat with them they however hurried below and i went on deck where in about ten minutes i was joined by mrs lecks who apparently had been looking for me she told me she had something very particular to say to me and conducted me toward the stern of the vessel where behind one of the deckhouses we found mrs aleshine  illustration do you see that boat there  look here said mrs lecks leading me to the rail and pointing downward do you see that boat there it has been let down and there is nobody in it the boat on the other side has just gone off full to the brim i never saw so many people crowded into a boat the other ones will be just as packed i expect i dont see why we shouldnt take this empty boat now weve got a chance instead of squeezin ourselves into those crowded ones if any of the other people come afterward why we shall have our choice of seats and thats considerable of a pint i should say in a time like this  thats so said mrs aleshine and me and mrs lecks would a got right in when we saw the boat was empty if we hadnt been afraid to be there without any man for it might have floated off and neither of us dont know nothin about rowin and then mrs lecks she thought of you supposin a young man who knew so much about the sea would know how to row  oh yes said i but i cannot imagine why this boat should have been left empty i see a keg of water in it and the oars and some tin cans and so i suppose it has been made ready for somebody will you wait here a minute until i run forward and see how things are going on there  amidships and forward i saw that there was some confusion among the people who were not yet in their boats and i found that there was to be rather more crowding than at first was expected people who had supposed that they were to go in a certain boat found there no place and were hurrying to other boats it now became plain to me that no time should be lost in getting into the small boat which mrs lecks had pointed out and which was probably reserved for some favored persons as the officers were keeping the people forward and amidships the other sternboat having already departed but as i acknowledged no reason why any one should be regarded with more favor than myself and the two women who were waiting for me i slipped quietly aft and joined mrs lecks and mrs aleshine  we must get in as soon as we can said i in a low voice for this boat may be discovered and then there will be a rush for it i suspect it may have been reserved for the captain and some of the officers but we have as much right in it as they  and more too replied mrs lecks for we had nothin to do with the steerin and smashin  but how are we goin to get down there said mrs aleshine theres no steps  that is true said i i shouldnt wonder if this boat is to be taken forward when the others are filled we must scramble down as well as we can by the tackle at the bow and stern ill get in first and keep her close to the ships side  thats goin to be a scratchy business said mrs lecks and im of the opinion we ought to wait till the ship has sunk a little more so well be nearer to the boat  it wont do to wait said i or we shall not get in it at all  and goodness gracious exclaimed mrs aleshine i cant stand here and feel the ship sinkin coldblooded under me till weve got where we can make an easy jump  very well then said mrs lecks we wont wait but the first thing to be done is for each one of us to put on one of these lifepreservers two of them i brought from mrs aleshines and my cabin and the other one i got next door where the people had gone off and left it on the floor i thought if anythin happened on the way to the island these would give us a chance to look about us but it seems to me well need em more gettin down them ropes than anywhere else i did intend puttin on two myself to make up for mrs aleshines fat but you must wear one of em sir now that you are goin to join the party  as i knew that two lifepreservers would not be needed by mrs lecks and would greatly inconvenience her i accepted the one offered me but declined to put it on until it should be necessary as it would interfere with my movements  very well said mrs lecks if you think you are safe in gettin down without it but mrs aleshine and me will put ours on before we begin sailorscramblin we know how to do it for we tried em on soon after we started from san francisco and now barbry aleshine are you sure youve got everythin you want for itll be no use thinkin about anythin youve forgot after the ship has sunk out of sight  theres nothin else i can think of said mrs aleshine at least nothin i can carry and so i suppose we may as well begin for your talk of the ship sinkin under our feet gives me a sort o feelin like an oyster creepin up and down my back  mrs lecks looked over the side at the boat into which i had already descended ill go first barbry aleshine said she and show you how  the sea was quiet and the steamer had already sunk so much that mrs leckss voice sounded frightfully near me although she spoke in a low tone  watch me said she to her companion im goin to do just as he did and you must follow in the same way  so saying she stepped on a bench by the rail then with one foot on the rail itself she seized the ropes which hung from one of the davits to the bow of the boat she looked down for a moment and then she drew back  its no use she said we must wait until she sinks more and i can get in easier  this remark made me feel nervous i did not know at what moment there might be a rush for this boat nor when indeed the steamer might go down the boat amidships on our side had rowed away some minutes before and through the darkness i could distinguish another boat near the bows pushing off it would be too late now for us to try to get into any other boat and i did not feel that there was time enough for me to take this one to a place where the two women could more easily descend to her standing upright i urged them not to delay  you see said i i can reach you as soon as you swing yourself off the ropes and ill help you down  if youre sure you can keep us from comin down too sudden well try it said mrs lecks but id as soon be drowned as to get to an island with a broken leg and as to mrs aleshine if she was to slip shed go slam through that boat to the bottom of the sea now then be ready im comin down  so saying she swung herself off and she was then so near me that i was able to seize her and make the rest of her descent comparatively easy mrs aleshine proved to be a more difficult subject even after i had a firm grasp of her capacious waist she refused to let go the ropes for fear that she might drop into the ocean instead of the boat but the reproaches of mrs lecks and the downward weight of myself made her loosen her nervous grip and although we came very near going overboard together i safely placed her on one of the thwarts  illustration  i now unhooked the tackle from the stern but before casting off at the bow i hesitated for i did not wish to desert any of those who might be expecting to embark in this boat but i could hear no approaching footsteps and from my position close to the side of the steamer i could see nothing therefore i cast off and taking the oars i pushed away and rowed to a little distance where i could get whatever view was possible of the deck of the steamer seeing no forms moving about i called out and receiving no answer i shouted again at the top of my voice i waited for nearly a minute and hearing nothing and seeing nothing i became convinced that no one was left on the vessel  they are all gone said i and we will pull after them as fast as we can  and i began to row toward the bow of the steamer in the direction which the other boats had taken  its a good thing you can row said mrs lecks settling herself comfortably in the sternsheets for what mrs aleshine and me would ha done with them oars i am sure i dont know  id never have got into this boat said mrs aleshine if mr craig hadnt been here  no indeed replied her friend youd ha gone to the bottom hangin for dear life to them ropes  when i had rounded the bow of the steamer which appeared to me to be rapidly settling in the water i perceived at no great distance several lights which of course belonged to the other boats and i rowed as hard as i could hoping to catch up with them or at least to keep sufficiently near it might be my duty to take off some of the people who had crowded into the other boats probably supposing that this one had been loaded and gone how such a mistake could have taken place i could not divine and it was not my business to do so quite certain that no one was left on the sinking steamer all i had to do was to row after the other boats and to overtake them as soon as possible i thought it would not take me very long to do this but after rowing for half an hour mrs aleshine remarked that the lights seemed as far off if not farther than when we first started after them turning i saw that this was the case and was greatly surprised with only two passengers i ought soon to have come up with those heavily laden boats but after i had thought over it a little i considered that as each of them was probably pulled by half a dozen stout sailors it was not so very strange that they should make as good or better headway than i did  it was not very long after this that mrs lecks said that she thought that the lights on the other boats must be going out and that this most probably was due to the fact that the sailors had forgotten to fill their lanterns before they started that sort of thing often happens she said when people leave a place in a hurry  but when i turned around and peered over the dark waters it was quite plain to me that it was not want of oil but increased distance which made those lights so dim i could now perceive but three of them and as the surface was agitated only by a gentle swell i could not suppose that any of them were hidden from our view by waves we were being left behind that was certain and all i could do was to row on as long and as well as i could in the direction which the other boats had taken i had been used to rowing and thought i pulled a good oar and i certainly did not expect to be left behind in this way  i dont believe this boat has been emptied out since the last rain said mrs aleshine for my feet are wet though i didnt notice it before  at this i shipped my oars and began to examine the boat the bottom was covered with a movable floor of slats and as i put my hand down i could feel the water welling up between the slats the flooring was in sections and lifting the one beneath me i felt under it and put my hand into six or eight inches of water  the exact state of the case was now as plain to me as if it had been posted up on a bulletinboard this boat had been found to be unseaworthy and its use had been forbidden all the people having been crowded into the others this had caused confusion at the last moment and of course we were supposed to be on some one of the other boats  and now here was i in the middle of the pacific ocean in a leaky boat with two middleaged women  anythin the matter with the floor asked mrs lecks  i let the section fall back into its place and looked aft by the starlight i could see that my two companions had each fixed upon me a steadfast gaze they evidently felt that something was the matter and wanted to know what it was i did not hesitate for a moment to inform them they appeared to me to be women whom it would be neither advisable nor possible to deceive in a case like this  this boat has a leak in it i said there is a lot of water in her already and that is the reason we have got along so slowly  and that is why said mrs aleshine it was left empty we ought to have known better than to expect to have a whole boat just for three of us it would have been much more sensible i think if we had tried to squeeze into one of the others  now barbry aleshine said mrs lecks dont you begin findin fault with good fortune when it comes to you here weve got a comfortable boat with room enough to set easy and stretch out if we want to if the water is comin in what weve got to do is to get it out again just as fast as we can whats the best way to do that mr craig  illustration we will pull after them  we must bail her out and lose no time about it said i if i can find the leak i may be able to stop it  i now looked about for something to bail with and the two women aided actively in the search i found one leather scoop in the bow but as it was well that we should all go to work i took two tin cans that had been put in by some one who had begun to provision the boat and proceeded to cut the tops from them with my jackknife  dont lose whats in em said mrs lecks that is if its anythin wed be likely to want to eat if its tomatoes pour it into the sea for nobody ought to eat tomatoes put up in tins  i hastily passed the cans to mrs lecks and i saw her empty the contents of one into the sea and those of the other on a newspaper which she took from her pocket and placed in the stern  i pulled up the movable floor and threw it overboard and then began to bail  i thought said mrs aleshine that they always had pumps for leaks  now barbry aleshine said mrs lecks just gether yourself up on one of them seats and go to work the less talkin we do and the more scoopin the better itll be for us  i soon perceived that it would have been difficult to find two more valuable assistants in the bailing of a boat than mrs lecks and mrs aleshine they were evidently used to work and were able to accommodate themselves to the unusual circumstances in which they were placed we threw out the water very rapidly and every little while i stopped bailing and felt about to see if i could discover where it came in as these attempts met with no success i gave them up after a time and set about bailing with new vigor believing that if we could get the boat nearly dry i should surely be able to find the leak  but after working half an hour more i found that the job would be a long one and if we all worked at once we would all be tired out at once and that might be disastrous therefore i proposed that we should take turns in resting and mrs aleshine was ordered to stop work for a time after this mrs lecks took a rest and when she went to work i stopped bailing and began again to search for the leak  for about two hours we worked in this way and then i concluded it was useless to continue any longer this vain exertion with three of us bailing we were able to keep the water at the level we first found it but with only two at work it slightly gained upon us so that now there was more water in the boat than when we first discovered it the boat was an iron one and the leak in it i could neither find nor remedy it had probably been caused by the warping of the metal under a hot sun an accident which i am told frequently occurs to iron boats the little craft which would have been a lifeboat had its airboxes remained intact was now probably leaking from stem to stern and in searching for the leak without the protection of the flooring my weight had doubtless assisted in opening the seams for it was quite plain that the water was now coming in more rapidly than it did at first we were very tired and even mrs lecks who had all along counseled us to keep at work and not to waste one breath in talking now admitted that it was of no use to try to get the water out of that boat  it had been some hours since i had used the oars but whether we had drifted or remained where we were when i stopped rowing of course i could not know but this mattered very little our boat was slowly sinking beneath us and it could make no difference whether we went down in one spot or an other i sat and racked my brain to think what could be done in this fearful emergency to bail any longer was useless labor and what else was there that we could do  when will it be time asked mrs lecks for us to put on the lifepreservers when the water gets nearly to the seats  i answered that we should not wait any longer than that but in my own mind i could not see any advantage in putting them on at all why should we wish to lengthen our lives by a few hours of helpless floating upon the ocean  very good said mrs lecks ill keep a watch on the water one of them cans was filled with lobster which would be more than likely to disagree with us and ive throwed it out but the other had baked beans in it and the best thing we can do is to eat some of these right away they are mighty nourishin and will keep up strength as well as anythin and then as you said theres a keg of water in the boat we can all take a drink of that and itll make us feel like new creturs youll have to take the beans in your hands for weve got no spoons nor forks  mrs lecks and mrs aleshine were each curled up out of reach of the water the first in the stern and the other on the aft thwart the day was now beginning to break and we could see about us very distinctly before reaching out her hands to receive her beans mrs aleshine washed them in the water in the boat remarking at the same time that she might as well make use of it since it was there having then wiped her hands on some part of her apparel they were filled with beans from the newspaper held by mrs lecks and these were passed over to me i was very hungry and when i had finished my beans i agreed with my companions that although they would have been a great deal better if heated up with butter pepper and salt they were very comforting as they were one of the empty cans was now passed to me and after having been asked by mrs lecks to rinse it out very carefully we all satisfied our taste from the water in the keg  cold baked beans and lukewarm water aint exactly company vittles said mrs aleshine but theres many a poor wretch would be glad to get em  i could not imagine any poor wretch who would be glad of the food together with the attending circumstances but i did not say so  the water is just one finger from the bottom of the seat said mrs lecks who had been stooping over to measure and its time to put on the lifepreservers  very good said mrs aleshine hand me mine  each of us now buckled on a lifepreserver and as i did so i stood up upon a thwart and looked about me it was quite light now and i could see for a long distance over the surface of the ocean which was gently rolling in wide smooth swells as we rose upon the summit of one of these i saw a dark spot upon the water just on the edge of our near horizon is that the steamer i thought and has she not yet sunk  at this there came to me a glimmering of courageous hope if the steamer had remained afloat so long it was probable that on account of watertight compartments or for some other reason her sinking had reached its limit and that if we could get back to her we might be saved but alas how were we to get back to her this boat would sink long long before i could row that distance  however i soon proclaimed the news to my companions whereupon mrs aleshine prepared to stand upon a thwart and see for herself but mrs lecks restrained her  dont make things worse barbry aleshine said she by tumblin overboard if weve got to go into the water let us do it decently and in order if thats the ship mr craig dont you suppose we can float ourselves to it in some way  i replied that by the help of a lifepreserver a person who could swim might reach the ship  but neither of us can swim said mrs lecks for weve lived where the water was never moren a foot deep except in time of freshets when theres no swimmin for man or beast but if we see you swim perhaps we can follow after a fashion at any rate we must do the best we can and thats all there is to be done  the water now remarked mrs aleshine is so near to the bottom of my seat that ive got to stand up tumble overboard or no  all right remarked mrs lecks wed better all stand up and let the boat sink under us that will save our jumpin overboard or rollin out any which way which might be awkward  goodness gracious me exclaimed mrs aleshine you set the oysters creepin over me again first you talk of the ship sinkin under us and now its the boat goin to the bottom under our feet before any sinkin s to be done id ruther get out  now barbry aleshine said mrs lecks stand up straight and dont talk so much itll be a great deal better to be let down gradual than to flop into the water all of a bunch  very well said mrs aleshine it may be best to get used to it by degrees but i must say i wish i was home  as for me i would have much preferred to jump overboard at once instead of waiting in this coldblooded manner but as my companions had so far preserved their presence of mind i did not wish to do anything which might throw them into a panic i believed there would be no danger from the suction caused by the sinking of a small boat like this and if we took care not to entangle ourselves with it in any way we might as well follow mrs leckss advice as not so we all stood up mrs lecks in the stern i in the bow and mrs aleshine on a thwart between us the last did not appear to have quite room enough for a steady footing but as she remarked it did not matter very much as the footing broad or narrow would not be there very long  i am used to swimming and have never hesitated to take a plunge into river or ocean but i must admit that it was very trying to my nerves to stand up this way and wait for a boat to sink beneath me how the two women were affected i do not know they said nothing but their faces indicated that something disagreeable was about to happen and that the less that was said about it the better  the boat had now sunk so much that the water was around mrs aleshines feet her standingplace being rather lower than ours i made myself certain that there were no ropes nor any other means of entanglement near my companions or myself and then i waited there seemed to be a good deal of buoyancy in the bow and stern of the boat and it was a frightfully long time in sinking the suspense became so utterly unendurable that i was tempted to put one foot on the edge of the boat and by tipping it put an end to this nerverack but i refrained for i probably would throw the women off their balance when they might fall against some part of the boat and do themselves a hurt i had just relinquished this intention when two little waves seemed to rise one on each side of mrs aleshine and gently flowing over the side of the boat they flooded her feet with water  hold your breaths i shouted and now i experienced a sensation which must have been very like that which comes to a condemned criminal at the first indication of the pulling of the drop then there was a horrible sinking a gurgle and a swash and the ocean over which i had been gazing appeared to rise up and envelop me  illustration stand up straight and dont talk so much  in a moment however my head was out of the water and looking hastily about me i saw close by the heads and shoulders of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine the latter was vigorously winking her eyes and blowing from her mouth some seawater that had got into it but as soon as her eyes fell upon me she exclaimed that was ever so much more suddint than i thought it was goin to be  illustration vigorously winking and blowing  are you both all right  i suppose i am said mrs aleshine but i never thought that a person with a lifepreserver on would go clean under the water  but since youve come up again you ought to be satisfied said mrs lecks and now she added turning her face toward me which way ought we to try to swim and have we got everythin we want to take with us  what we havent got we cant get remarked mrs aleshine and as for swimmin i expect im goin to make a poor hand at it  i had a hope which was not quite strong enough to be a belief that supported by their lifepreservers the two women might paddle themselves along and that by giving them in turn a helping hand i might eventually get them to the steamer there was a strong probability that i would not succeed but i did not care to think of that  i now swam in front of my companions and endeavored to instruct them in the best method of propelling themselves with their arms and their hands if they succeeded in this i thought i would give them some further lessons in striking out with their feet after watching me attentively mrs lecks did manage to move herself slowly through the smooth water but poor mrs aleshine could do nothing but splash  if there was anythin to take hold of she said to me i might get along but i cant get any grip on the water though you seem to do it well enough look there she added in a higher voice isnt that an oar floatin over there if you can get that for me i believe i can row myself much better than i can swim  this seemed an odd idea but i swam over to the floating oar and brought it her i was about to show her how she could best use it but she declined my advice  if i do it at all she said i must do it in my own way and taking the oar in her strong hands she began to ply it on the water very much in the way in which she would handle a broom at first she dipped the blade too deeply but correcting this error she soon began to paddle herself along at a slow but steady rate  capital i cried you do that admirably  anybody whos swept as many rooms as i have she said ought to be able to handle anythin that can be used like a broom  isnt there another oar cried mrs lecks who had now been left a little distance behind us if there is i want one  looking about me i soon discovered another floating oar and brought it to mrs lecks who after holding it in various positions so as to get the hang of it as she said soon began to use it with as much skill as that shown by her friend if either of them had been obliged to use an oar in the ordinary way i fear they would have had a bad time of it but considering the implement in the light of a broom its use immediately became familiar to them and they got on remarkably well  illustration they got on remarkably well  i now took a position a little in advance of my companions and as i swam slowly they were easily able to keep up with me mrs aleshine being so stout floated much higher out of the water than either mrs lecks or i and this permitted her to use her oar with a great deal of freedom sometimes she would give such a vigorous brush to the water that she would turn herself almost entirely around but after a little practice she learned to avoid undue efforts of this kind  i was not positively sure that we were going in the right direction for my position did not allow me to see very far over the water but i remembered that when i was standing up in the boat and made my discovery the sun was just about to rise in front of me while the dark spot on the ocean lay to my left judging therefore from the present position of the sun which was not very high i concluded that we were moving toward the north and therefore in the right direction how far off the steamer might be i had no idea for i was not accustomed to judging distances at sea but i believed that if we were careful of our strength and if the ocean continued as smooth as it now was we might eventually reach the vessel provided she were yet afloat  after you are fairly in the water said mrs aleshine as she swept along although without the velocity which that phrase usually implies it isnt half so bad as i thought it would be for one thing it dont feel a bit salt although i must say it tasted horribly that way when i first went into it  you didnt expect to find picklebrine did you said mrs lecks though if it was i suppose we could float on it settin  and as to bein cold said mrs aleshine the part of me thats in is actually more comfortable than that which is out  theres one thing i would have been afraid of said mrs lecks if we hadnt made preparations for it and thats sharks  preparations i exclaimed how in the world did you prepare for sharks  easy enough said mrs lecks when we went down into our room to get ready to go away in the boats we both put on black stockins ive read that sharks never bite colored people although if they see a white man in the water theyll snap him up as quick as lightnin and black stockins was the nearest we could come to it you see i thought as like as not wed have some sort of an upset before we got through  its a great comfort remarked mrs aleshine and im very glad you thought of it mrs lecks after this i shall make it a rule black stockins for sharks  i suppose in your case said mrs lecks addressing me dark trousers will do as well  to which i answered that i sincerely hoped they would  another thing im thankful for said mrs aleshine is that i thought to put on a flannel skeert  and whats the good of it said mrs lecks when its soppin wet  flannels flannel replied her friend whether its wet or dry and if youd had the rheumatism as much as i have youd know it  to this mrs lecks replied with a sniff and asked me how soon i thought we would get sight of the ship for if we were going the wrong way and had to turn round and go back it would certainly be very provoking  i should have been happy indeed to be able to give a satisfactory answer to this question every time that we rose upon a swell i threw a rapid glance around the whole circle of the horizon and at last not a quarter of an hour after mrs leckss question i was rejoiced to see almost in the direction in which i supposed it ought to be the dark spot which i had before discovered i shouted the glad news and as we rose again my companions strained their eyes in the direction to which i pointed they both saw it and were greatly satisfied  now then said mrs aleshine it seems as if there was somethin to work for and she began to sweep her oar with great vigor  if you want to tire yourself out before you get there barbry aleshine said mrs lecks youd better go on in that way now what i advise is that we stop rowin altogether and have somethin to eat for im sure we need it to keep up our strength  eat i cried what are you going to eat do you expect to catch fish  and eat em raw said mrs lecks i should think not but do you suppose mr craig that mrs aleshine and me would go off and leave that ship without takin somethin to eat by the way lets all gether here in a bunch and see what sort of a meal we can make and now barbry aleshine if you lay your oar down there on the water i recommend you to tie it to one of your bonnetstrings or itll be floatin away and you wont get it again  as she said this mrs lecks put her right hand down into the water and fumbled about apparently in search of a pocket i could not but smile as i thought of the condition of food when for an hour or more it had been a couple of feet under the surface of the ocean but my ideas on the subject were entirely changed when i saw mrs lecks hold up in the air two german sausages and shake the briny drops from their smooth and glittering surfaces  illustration theres nothin like sausages for shipwreck  theres nothin she said like sausages for shipwreck and that kind o thing theyre very sustainin and bein covered with a tight skin water cant get at em no matter how you carry em i wouldnt bring these out in the boat because havin the beans we might as well eat them have you a knife about you mr craig  i produced a dripping jackknife and after the open blade had been waved in the air to dry it a little mrs lecks proceeded to divide one of the sausages handing the other to me to hold meanwhile  now dont go eatin sausages without bread if you dont want em to give you dyspepsy said mrs aleshine who was tugging at a submarine pocket  im very much afraid your bread is all soaked said mrs lecks  to which her friend replied that that remained to be seen and forthwith produced with a splash a glass preservejar with a metal top  i saw this nearly empty as i looked into the ships pantry and i stuffed into it all the soft biscuits it would hold there was some sort of jam left at the bottom so that the one who gets the last biscuit will have somethin of a little spread on it and now mrs lecks she continued triumphantly as she unscrewed the top that rubber ring has kept em as dry as chips im mighty glad of it for i had trouble enough gettin this jar into my pocket and gettin it out too for that matter  floating thus with our hands and shoulders above the water we made a very good meal from the sausages and soft biscuit  barbry aleshine said mrs lecks as her friend proceeded to cut the second sausage dont you lay that knife down when youve done with it as if t was an oar for if you do itll sink as like as not about six miles ive read that the ocean is as deep as that in some places  goodness gracious me exclaimed mrs aleshine i hope we are not over one of them deep spots  theres no knowin said mrs lecks but if its more comfortin to think its shallerer well make up our minds that way now then she continued well finish off this meal with a little somethin to drink im not given to takin spirits but i never travel without a little whisky ready mixed with water to take if it should be needed  so saying she produced from one of her pockets a whiskyflask tightly corked and of its contents we each took a sip mrs aleshine remarking that leaving out being chilled or colicky we were never likely to need it more than now  thus refreshed and strengthened mrs lecks and mrs aleshine took up their oars while i swam slightly in advance as before when with occasional intermissions of rest and a good deal of desultory conversation we had swept and swam for about an hour mrs lecks suddenly exclaimed i can see that thing ever so much plainer now and i dont believe its a ship at all to me it looks like bushes  youre mighty longsighted without your specs said mrs aleshine and im not sure but what youre right  for ten minutes or more i had been puzzling over the shape of the dark spot which was now nearly all the time in sight its peculiar form had filled me with a dreadful fear that it was the steamer bottom upward although i knew enough about nautical matters to have no good reason to suppose that this could be the case i am not farsighted but when mrs lecks suggested bushes i gazed at the distant object with totally different ideas and soon began to believe that it was not a ship either right side up or wrong side up but that it might be an island this belief i proclaimed to my companions and for some time we all worked with increased energy in the desire to get near enough to make ourselves certain in regard to this point  as true as im standin here said mrs lecks who although she could not read without spectacles had remarkably good sight at long range them is trees and bushes that i see before me though they do seem to be growin right out of the water  theres an island under them you may be sure of that i cried isnt this ever so much better than a sinking ship  im not so sure about that said mrs aleshine im used to the ship and as long as it didnt sink id prefer it theres plenty to eat on board of it and good beds to sleep on which is more than can be expected on a little bushy place like that ahead of us but then the ship might sink all of a suddint beds vittles and all  do you suppose that is the island the other boats went to asked mrs lecks  this question i had already asked of myself i had been told that the island to which the captain intended to take his boats lay about thirty miles south of the point where we left the steamer now i knew very well that we had not come thirty miles and had reason to believe moreover that the greater part of the progress we had made had been toward the north it was not at all probable that the position of this island was unknown to our captain and it must therefore have been considered by him as an unsuitable place for the landing of his passengers there might be many reasons for this unsuitableness the island might be totally barren and desolate it might be the abode of unpleasant natives and more important than anything else it was in all probability a spot where steamers never touched  but whatever its disadvantages i was most wildly desirous to reach it more so i believe than either of my companions i do not mean that they were not sensible of their danger and desirous to be freed from it but they were women who had probably had a rough time of it during a great part of their lives and on emerging from their little circle of rural experiences accepted with equanimity and almost as a matter of course the rough times which come to people in the great outside world  i do not believe i said in answer to mrs lecks that that is the island to which the captain would have taken us but whatever it is it is dry land and we must get there as soon as we can  thats true said mrs aleshine for id like to have ground nearer to my feet than six miles and if we dont find anything to eat and any place to sleep when we get there its no more than can be said of the place where we are now  youre too particular barbry aleshine said mrs lecks about your comforts if you find the ground too hard to sleep on when you get there you can put on your lifepreserver and go to bed in the water  very good said mrs aleshine and if these islands are made of coral as ive heard they are and if theyre as full of small pints as some coral ive got at home youll be glad to take a berth by me mrs lecks  i counseled my companions to follow me as rapidly as possible and we all pushed vigorously forward when we had approached near enough to the island to see what sort of place it really was we perceived that it was a lowlying spot apparently covered with verdure and surrounded as far as we could see as we rose on the swells by a rocky reef against which a tolerably high surf was running  i knew enough of the formation of these coral islands to suppose that within this reef was a lagoon of smooth water into which there were openings through the rocky barrier it was necessary to try to find one of these for it would be difficult and perhaps dangerous to attempt to land through the surf  before us we could see a continuous line of whitecapped breakers and so i led my little party to the right hoping that we would soon see signs of an opening in the reef  we swam and paddled however for a long time and still the surf rolled menacingly on the rocks before us we were now as close to the island as we could approach with safety and i determined to circumnavigate it if necessary before i would attempt with these two women to land upon that jagged reef at last we perceived at no great distance before us a spot where there seemed to be no breakers and when we reached it we found to our unutterable delight that here was smooth water flowing through a wide opening in the reef the rocks were piled up quite high and the reef at this point at least was a wide one but as we neared the opening we found that it narrowed very soon and made a turn to the left so that from the outside we could not see into the lagoon  i swam into this smooth water followed closely by mrs lecks and mrs aleshine who however soon became unable to use their oars owing to the proximity of the rocks dropping these useful implements they managed to paddle after me with their hands and they were as much astonished as i was when just after making the slight turn we found stretched across the narrow passage a great iron bar about eight or ten inches above the water a little farther on and two or three feet above the water another iron bar extended from one rocky wall to the other without uttering a word i examined the lower bar and found one end of it fastened by means of a huge padlock to a great staple driven into the rock the lock was securely wrapped in what appeared to be tarred canvas a staple through an eyehole in the bar secured the other end of it to the rocks  these bars were put here i exclaimed to keep out boats whether at high or low water you see they can only be thrown out of the way by taking off the padlocks  they wont keep us out said mrs lecks for we can duck under i suppose whoever put em here didnt expect anybody to arrive on lifepreservers  illustration     part ii  illustration   adopting mrs leckss suggestion i ducked my head under the bar and passed to the other side of it mrs lecks with but little trouble followed my example but mrs aleshine who by reason of her stoutness floated so much higher out of the water than her friend and i found it impossible to get herself under the bar in whatever manner she made the attempt her head or her shoulders were sure to bump and arrest her progress  now barbry aleshine said mrs lecks who had been watching her if you ever want to get out of this salt water youve got to make up your mind to take some of it into your mouth and into your eyes that is if you dont keep em shut get yourself as close to that bar as you can and ill come and put you under so saying mrs lecks returned to the other side of the bar and having made mrs aleshine bow down her head and close her eyes and mouth she placed both hands upon her companions broad shoulders and threw as much weight as possible upon them mrs aleshine almost disappeared beneath the water but she came up sputtering and blinking on the other side of the bar where she was quickly joined by mrs lecks  merciful me exclaimed mrs aleshine wiping her wet face with her still wetter sleeve i never supposed the heathens would be up to such tricks as makin us do that  i had waited to give any assistance that might be required and while doing so had discovered another bar under the water which proved that entrance at almost any stage of the tide had been guarded against warning my companions not to strike their feet against this submerged bar we paddled and pushed ourselves around the turn in the rocky passage and emerged into the open lagoon  this smooth stretch of water which separated the island from its encircling reef was here about a hundred feet wide and the first thing that arrested our attention as we gazed across it was a little wharf or landingstage erected upon the narrow beach of the island almost opposite to us  as sure as i stand here exclaimed mrs lecks who never seemed to forget her upright position somebody lives in this place  and it isnt a stickery coral island either cried mrs aleshine for that sands as smooth as any i ever saw  whoever does live here resumed mrs lecks has got to take us in whether they like it or not and the sooner we get over there the better  mrs aleshine now regretted the loss of her oar and suggested that some one of us who could get under bars easily should go back after it but mrs lecks would listen to no such proposition  let the oars go she said we wont want em again for ill never leave this place if i have to scoop myself out to sea with an oar  i told the two women that i could easily tow them across this narrow piece of water and instructing mrs lecks to take hold of the tail of my coat while mrs aleshine grasped her companions dress i began to swim slowly toward the beach towing my companions behind me  goodnessful gracious me suddenly exclaimed mrs aleshine with a great bounce and a splash look at the fishes  the water in the lagoon was so clear that it was almost transparent and beneath us and around us we could see fish some large and some small swimming about as if they were floating in the air while down below the white sandy bottom seemed to sparkle in the sunlight  now dont jerk my skeert off on account of the fishes said mrs lecks i expect there was just as many outside though we couldnt see em but i must say that this water looks as if it had been boiled and filtered  if any inhabitant of the island had then been standing on the wharf he would have beheld on the surface of the lagoon the peculiar spectacle of a mans head surmounted by a wet and misshapen straw hat and followed by two other heads each wearing a dripping and bedraggled bonnet while beneath among the ripples of the clear water would have been seen the figures belonging to these three heads each dressed in the clothes ordinarily worn on land  as i swam i could see before me on the island nothing but a mass of lowgrowing tropical vegetation behind which rose some palms and other trees i made for the little wharf from which steps came down into the water and as soon as we reached it we all clambered rapidly up and stood dripping upon the narrow platform stamping our feet and shaking our clothes  do you see that house said mrs lecks thats where they live and i wonder which way we must go to get there  from this somewhat elevated position i could plainly see over the tops of the bushes and low trees the upper part of the roof of a house when i found the bars across the passage in the reef i had easily come to the conclusion that the inhabitants of this island were not savages and now since i had seen the wharf and the roof of this house i felt quite convinced that we had reached the abode of civilized beings they might be pirates or some other sort of sea miscreants but they were certainly not savages or cannibals  leaving the wharf we soon found a broad path through the bushes and in a few moments reached a wide open space in which stood a handsome modernbuilt house it was constructed after the fashion of tropical houses belonging to europeans with jalousied porches and shaded balconies the grounds about it were neatly laid out and behind it was a walled inclosure probably a garden  upon my word exclaimed mrs aleshine id like to be less drippin before i make a call on genteel folks  genteel folks exclaimed mrs lecks indignantly if youre too proud to go in as you are barbry aleshine you can go set in the sun till youre dry as for me im goin to ask for the lady of the house and if she dont like me she can lump me so long as she gives me somethin to eat and a dry bed to get into  i was too much amazed to speak but my companions took everything as a matter of course they had expected to see strange things in the outer world and they were not surprised when they saw them my mind was not capable of understanding the existence of an establishment like this on a little island in midocean but it was useless for me to attempt to reason on this apparent phenomenon and indeed there was no time for it for mrs lecks walked boldly up to the front door and plied the knocker stepping back immediately so that she might not drip too much water on the porch  when they come she said well ask em to let us in the back way so that we shant slop up their floors any more than we can help  we waited for a couple of minutes and then i as the member of the party who dripped the least went up on the porch and knocked again  its my belief theyre not at home said mrs lecks after we had waited some time longer but perhaps well find some of the servants in and she led the way to the back part of the house  as we passed the side of the mansion i noticed that all the windowshutters were closed and my growing belief that the place was deserted became a conviction after we had knocked several times at a door at the back of the building without receiving any answer  well theyre all gone out thats certain said mrs lecks  yes and they barred up the entrance to the island when they left i added  i wonder if theres another house in the neighborhood asked mrs aleshine  i dont believe said i that the neighborhood is very thickly settled but if you will wait here a few minutes i will run around this wall and see what there is beyond i may find the huts of some natives or workpeople  i followed a path by the side of the garden wall but when i reached the end of the inclosure i could see nothing before me but jungle and forest with paths running in several directions i followed one of these and very soon came out upon an open beach with the reef lying beyond it from the form of the beach and the reef and from the appearance of things generally i began to think that this was probably a very small island and that the house we had seen was the only one on it i returned and reported this belief to my companions  illustration mrs lecks walked boldly up to the front door and plied the knocker  now that mrs aleshine had no fear of appearing in an untidy condition before genteel folks her manner changed very much if the family has gone into the country said she or whatever else theyve done i want to get into this house as soon as i can i expect we can find something to eat at any rate we can get ourselves dry and lay down somewhere to rest for not a wink has one of us slept since night before last  i should think said mrs lecks addressing me that if you could manage to climb up to them secondstory windows you might find one of them that you could get in and then come down and open the door for us everybody is likely to forget to fasten some of the windows on the upper floors i know it isnt right to force our way into other peoples houses but theres nothin else to be done and theres no need of our talkin about it  i agreed with her perfectly and taking off my coat and shoes i climbed up one of the columns of the veranda and got upon its roof this extended nearly the whole length of two sides of the house i walked along it and tried all the shutters and i soon came to one in which some of the movable slats had been broken thrusting my hand and arm through the aperture thus formed i unhooked the shutters and opened them the sash was fastened down by one of the ordinary contrivances used for such purposes but with the blade of my jackknife i easily pushed the bolt aside raised the sash and entered i found myself in a small hall at the head of a flight of stairs down these i hurried and groping my way through the semidarkness of the lower story i reached a side door this was fastened by two bolts and a bar and i quickly had it open  stepping outside i called mrs lecks and mrs aleshine  well said the latter im sure ill be glad to get in and as weve squeezed most of the water out of our clothes we wont make so much of a mess after all  we now entered and i opened one of the shutters  lets go right into the kitchen said mrs lecks and make a fire thats the first thing to do  illustration i climbed up one of the columns  but mrs lecks soon discovered that this mansion was very different from a country dwelling in one of our middle states externally and as far as i had been able to observe its internal arrangements it resembled the houses built by english residents which i had seen in the west indies it was a dwelling in which modern ideas in regard to construction and furnishing adapted themselves to the requirements of a tropical climate apparently there was no kitchen there were no stairs leading to a lower floor and the darkened rooms into which my companions peered were certainly not used for culinary purposes  in the meantime i had gone out of the door by which we had entered and soon discovered on the other side of the house a small building with a chimney to it which i felt sure must be the kitchen the door and shutters were fastened but before making any attempt to open them i returned to announce my discovery  door locked is it said mrs aleshine just wait a minute  she then disappeared but in a very short time came out carrying a bunch of large keys  its always the way said she as the two followed me round the back of the house when people shut up a house and leave it to put all the doorkeys in the back corner of some drawer in the hall and to take only the frontdoor key with them so you see i knew just where to go for these  its a poor hen said mrs lecks that begins to cackle when shes goin to her nest the wise ones wait till theyre comin away now well see if one of them keys fit  greatly to the triumph of mrs aleshine the second or third key i tried unlocked the door entering we found ourselves in a goodsized kitchen with a great fireplace at one end of it a door opened from the room into a shed where there was a pile of dry twigs and firewood  lets have a fire as quick as we can said mrs lecks for since i went into that shetup house ive been chilled to the bones  thats so said mrs aleshine and now i know how a fish keeps comfortable in the water and how dreadfully wet and flabby it must feel when its taken out  i brought in a quantity of wood and kindling and finding matches in a tin box on the wall i went to work to make a fire and was soon rewarded by a crackling blaze turning around i was amazed at the actions of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine i had expected to see them standing shivering behind me waiting for the fire to be made but instead of that they were moving rapidly here and there saying not a word but going as straight to cupboard closet and pantry as the hound follows the track of the hare from a wild chaos of uncongenial surroundings these two women had dropped into a sphere in which they were perfectly at home the kitchen was not altogether like those to which they had been accustomed but it was a wellappointed one and their instincts and practice made them quickly understand where they would find what they wanted i gazed on them with delight while one filled a kettle from a little pump in the corner which brought water from a cistern and the other appeared from the pantry carrying a teacaddy and a tin biscuitbox  now then said mrs lecks hanging the kettle on a crane over the fire and drawing up a chair by the time weve got a little dried off the kettle will bile and well have some hot tea and then the best thing to do is to go to bed  well take time to have a bite first said mrs aleshine for i was never so near famished in my life i brought out a box nearly full of biscuits and theres sardines in this mr craig which you can easy open with your knife  i piled on more wood and we gathered close around the genial heat the sunshine was hot outside but that did not prevent the fire from being most comforting and refreshing to us  as soon as the kettle began to simmer up jumped mrs aleshine a sugarbowl and some cups were placed upon a table and in a short time we were cheered and invigorated by hot tea biscuits and sardines  this isnt much of a meal said mrs aleshine apologetically but theres no time to cook nothin and the sooner we get off our wet things and find some beds the better  if i can once get into bed said mrs lecks all i ask is that the family will not come back till i have had a good long nap after that they can do what they please  we now went back to the house and ascended the main stairway which led up to a large central hall  we wont go into the front rooms said mrs lecks for we dont want to make no more disturbance than we can help but if we can find the smallest kind of rooms in the back with beds in em it is all we can ask  the first chamber we entered was a goodsized one neatly furnished containing a bedstead with uncovered mattress and pillows opening a closet door mrs lecks exclaimed this is a mans room mr craig and youd better take it look at the trousers and coats theres no bedclothes in here but ill see if i cant find some  in a few minutes she returned bearing blankets sheets and a pillowcase with mrs aleshine on one side of the bedstead and mrs lecks on the other the sheets and blankets were laid with surprising deftness and rapidity and in a few moments i saw before me a most inviting bed  while mrs aleshine held a pillow in her teeth as she pulled on the pillowcase with both hands mrs lecks looked around the room with the air of an attentive hostess i guess youll be comfortable mr craig she said and i advise you to sleep just as long as you can well take the room on the other side of the hall but im first goin down to see if the kitchen fire is safe and to fasten the doors  illustration i guess youll be comfortable mr craig  i offered to relieve her of this trouble but she promptly declined my services when its rowin or swimmin you can do it mr craig but when its lockin up and lookin to fires ill attend to that myself  my watch had stopped but i suppose it was the middle of the afternoon when i went to bed and i slept steadily until some hours after sunrise the next morning when i was awakened by a loud knock at the door  its time to get up said the voice of mrs lecks and if your clothes are not entirely dry youd better see if there isnt somethin in that closet you can put on after a while ill make a big fire in the kitchen and dry all our things  i found my clothes were still very damp and after investigating the contents of the closet and bureau i was able to supply myself with linen and a light summer suit which fitted me fairly well i even found socks and a pair of slippers  when i entered the kitchen i first opened wide my eyes with delight and then i burst out laughing before me was a table covered with a white cloth with plates cups and everything necessary upon it at one end was a steaming teapot and at the other a dish of some kind of hot meat and mrs aleshine was just taking a pan of newly baked biscuits from a small iron oven  i dont wonder you laugh said mrs lecks but our clothes was still wet and we had to take just what we could find im not in the habit of goin about in a white muslin wrapper with blueribbon trimmins and as for mrs aleshine i did think wed never find anything that she could get into but there must be one stout woman in the family for that yeller frock with black buttons fits her well enough though i must say its a good deal short  i never thought said mrs aleshine as she sat down at the teapot that the heathens had so many conveniences specially bakinpowders and dutch ovens for my part i always supposed that they used their altars for bakin when they wasnt offerin up victims on em  have you got it into your head barbry aleshine said mrs lecks looking up from the dish of potted beef she was serving that this house belongs to common heathen i expect that most of the savages who live on these desert islands has been converted by the missionaries but theyd have to take em from genesis to revelations a good many times before theyd get em to the pint of havin forcepumps in their kitchens and springmattresses on their beds as far as ive seen this house it looks as if the family had always been christians and probably either catholics or episcopalians  on account of the cross on the mantelpiece in our room i suppose said mrs aleshine but whether theyre given to idols or prayerbooks i know theyve got a mighty nice house and considerin the distance from stores theres a good deal more in that pantry than youd expect to find in any house i know of when the family is away  it is my opinion said i that this house belongs to some rich man probably an american or european merchant who lives on one of the large islands not far away and who uses this as a sort of summer residence  i thought it was always summer in this part of the world said mrs lecks  so it is in effect i replied but there are some seasons when it is very unpleasant to remain in one of those towns which are found on the larger islands and so the owner of this house may come up here sometimes for fresh sea air  or its just as like said mrs aleshine that he lives somewhere up in the iceberg regions and comes here to spend his winters it would do just as well but whichever way it is i cant help thinkin its careless not to leave somebody in the house to take care of it why for all the family would know about it tramps might break in and stay as long as they like  thats just whats happenin now said mrs lecks and for my part i aint goin to find no fault i dont suppose the people would have been so hardhearted as to turn us away from their doors but ive seen enough of folks in this world not to be too sure about that  illustration that yeller frock  how do you suppose said mrs aleshine addressing me that the family gets here and goes back do they keep a private steamboat  of course they have a private vessel of some kind i answered probably a yacht it is quite certain that ordinary steamers never touch here  if thats the case said mrs lecks all we can do is to wait here till they come and get them to send us away in their ship but whether theyve just gone or are just acomin back depends i suppose on whether they live in a freezin or a burnin country and if they dont like our bein here when they come back theres one thing they can make up their minds to and that is that im never goin to leave this place on a lifepreserver  nor me nuther said mrs aleshine finishing with much complacency her third cup of tea  when breakfast was over mrs lecks pushed back her chair but did not immediately rise with an expression of severe thought upon her face she gazed steadfastly before her for a minute and then she addressed mrs aleshine who had begun to gather together the cups and the plates now barbry aleshine said she dont you begin to clear off the table nor touch a single thing to wash it up till weve been over this house i want to do it now before mr craig goes out to prospect around and see what else is on the island which i suppose hell be wantin to do  i replied that i had that intention but i was quite willing to go over the house first  its come to me said mrs lecks speaking very gravely that its no use for us to talk of the family bein here or bein there till weve gone over this house if we find that they have as far as we know gone away in good health and spirits thats all well enough but if anythings happened in this house i dont want to be here with whats happenedat least without knowin it and when we do go over the house i want a man to go with us  if youd talked that way last night mrs lecks exclaimed mrs aleshine id never slept till after sunup and then got up and gone huntin round among them frocks and petticoats to find somethin that would fit me with the quiet pulse i did have mrs lecks  to this remark mrs lecks made no reply but rising she led the way out of the kitchen and into the house  the rooms on the first floor were very well furnished there was a large parlor and back of it a study or library while on the other side of the hall was a diningroom and an apartment probably used as a family room we found nothing in these which would indicate that anything untoward had happened in them then we went upstairs i leading the way mrs lecks following and mrs aleshine in the rear we first entered one of the front chambers which was quite dark but mrs lecks unfastened and threw open a shutter then with a rigid countenance and determined mien she examined every part of the room looked into every closet and even under the bed it was quite plain that it was in one of the chambers that she expected to find what had happened if anything had happened  the room on the other side of the hall was very like the one we first examined except that it had two beds in it we next visited the chamber recently occupied by my two companions which was now undergoing the process of airing  we neednt stop here remarked mrs aleshine  but mrs lecks instantly replied indeed we will stop im going to look under the bed  merciful me exclaimed mrs aleshine putting her hand on her friends shoulder supposin you should find somethin and we sleepin here last night it curdles me to think of it  its my duty said mrs lecks severely and i shall do it  and do it she did rising from the task with a sigh of relief  my room was subjected to the same scrutiny as the others and then we visited some smaller rooms at the extreme back of the house which we had not before noticed a garret or loft was reached by a steep stairway in one of these rooms and into its dusky gloom i ventured by myself  now dont come down mr craig said mrs lecks till youre sure theres nothin there of all places in the house that cockloft after all is the most likely  i had none of the fears which seemed to actuate the two women but i had a very unpleasant time of it groping about in the darkness and heat and as the place was only partly floored running the continual risk of crashing down through the lath and plaster i made myself quite sure however that nothing had happened in that loft unless some one had suffocated there and had dried up and become the dust which i raised at every step  now then said mrs lecks when i descended as there is no cellar well go wash up the breakfast things and if you want to take a walk to see if theres any genuwine heathens or anybody else alivin in this island were not afraid to be left alone  for the whole of the rest of the morning i wandered about the island i investigated the paths that i had before noticed and found that each of them led after a moderate walk to some wide and pleasant part of the beach at one of these points i found a rustic bench and stuffed in between two of the slats which formed the seat i found a book it had been sadly wet and discolored by rain and dried and curled up by the wind and sun i pulled it out and found it to be a novel in french on one of the flyleaves was written emily reasoning from the dilapidated appearance of this book i began to believe that the family must have left this place some time ago and that therefore their return might be expected at a proportionately early period on second thoughts however i considered that the state of this book was of little value as testimony a few hours of storm wind and sun might have inflicted all the damage it had sustained the two women would be better able to judge by the state of the house and the condition of the provisions how long the family had been away  i then started out on a walk along the beach and in little more than an hour i had gone entirely around the island nowhere did i see any sign of habitation or occupation except at the house which had given us shelter nor any opening through the surrounding reef except the barred passageway through which we had come  when i returned to the house i found that mrs lecks and mrs aleshine had been hard at work all the morning they had so to speak gone regularly and systematically to housekeeping and had already divided the labors of the establishment between them mrs aleshine who prided herself on her skill in culinary matters was to take charge of the cooking while mrs lecks assumed the care of the various rooms and the general management of the household this arrangement was explained to me at length and when i remarked that all this seemed to indicate that they expected to remain here for a long time mrs lecks replied  in my part of the country i could tell pretty close by the dust on the tables and on the top of the pianner how long a family had been out of a house but dust in pennsylvany and dust on a sea island where theres no wagons nor carriages is quite different this house has been left in very good order and though the windows wants washin and the floors and stairs brushinwhich will be easy considerin that none of em has carpetsand everything in the house a reglar cleanin up and airin it may be that the family hasnt been gone away very long and so it may be a good while before they come back again mrs aleshine and me has talked it over and weve made up our minds that the right thing to do is just to go along and attend to things as if we was agoin to stay here for a month or two and it may be even longer than that before the people come back and i dont think theyll have anything to complain of when they find their house in applepie order their windows washed their floors clean and not a speck of dust anywhere  for my part said mrs aleshine i dont see what theyve got to find fault with anyway i look on this as part of the passage to be sure we aint movin a bit on our way to japan but thats not my fault nor yet yours mrs lecks nor yours mr craig we paid our passage to go to japan and if the ship was steered wrong and got sunk we hadnt anything to do with it we didnt want to come here but here we are and id like to know whos got any right to find fault with us  illustration mrs aleshine had been hard at work all the morning  and bein here said mrs lecks well take care of the things  as far as im concerned added mrs aleshine if this island was movin on to japan id a great deal rather be on it than on that ship where to my way of thinkin they didnt know much more about housekeepin than they did about steerin  i think your plans and arrangements are very good i said but how about the provisions are there enough to hold out for any time  theres pretty nigh a barrel of flour said mrs aleshine a good deal of tea and coffee and sugar and lots of things in tins and jars theres a kind of cellar outside where they keep things cool and theres more than half a keg of butter down there its too strong to use but i can take that butter and wash it out and work it over and salt it and make it just as good butter as any we got on board the ship  but said i you have given me nothing to do i shall not be content to stand about idle and see you do all the work  theres nothin in the house said mrs lecks which you need put your hand to but if you choose to go out into that garden and see if theres anything can be done in it or got out of itthat is if you know anything about garden workim sure wed be very glad of any fresh vegetables we could get  i replied that i had been accustomed to garden work in an amateur way and would be glad to do anything that was possible in that direction  i never seed into that garden said mrs aleshine but of all the foolish things that ever came under my eye the buildin a wall around a garden when a picket fence would do just as well is the foolishest  i explained that in these countries it was the fashion to use walls instead of fences  if its the fashion said mrs aleshine i suppose theres no use sayin anything agin it but if the fashion should happen to change theyd find it a good deal easier to take down a barbedwire fence than a stone wall  this conversation took place in the large lower hall which mrs lecks had been putting to rights and where mrs aleshine had just entered from the kitchen mrs lecks now sat down upon a chair and dustcloth in hand she thus addressed me  theres another thing mr craig that me and mrs aleshine has been talkin about we havent made up our minds about it because we didnt think it was fair and right to do that before speakin to you and hearin what you had to say on one side or another of it mrs aleshine and me has had to bow our heads to afflictions and to walk sometimes in roads we didnt want to but weve remembered the ways in which we was brought up and have kept in them as far as weve been able when our husbands died leavin mrs aleshine with a son and me without any which perhaps is just as well for theres no knowin how he might have turned out  thats so interrupted mrs aleshine for he might have gone as a clerk to roosher and then you and me would a had to travel different ways  and when our husbands died continued mrs lecks they left us enough and plenty to live on and we wasnt the women to forget them and their ways of thinkin any more than wed forget the ways of our fathers and mothers before us  thats so said mrs aleshine fervently  and now mr craig continued mrs lecks we dont know how youve been brought up nor anything about you in fact except that youve been as kind to us as if you was some sort of kin and that we never would have thought of comin here without you and so me and mrs aleshine has agreed to leave this whole matter to you and to do just as you say when us two started out on this long journey we didnt expect to find it what you call the path of roses and dear only knows we havent found it so  thats true ejaculated mrs aleshine  and what weve had to put up with continued mrs lecks we have put up with so mr craig whether you say dinner in the middle of the day at twelve as weve always been used to or at six oclock in the afternoon as they had it on board that shipand how people ever come to turn their meals hind part foremost in that way i cant saywe are goin to do it if youve been brought up to six oclock you wont hear no complainin from us think what we may  i was on the point of laughing aloud at the conclusion of this speech but a glance at the serious faces of the two women who with so much earnest solicitude awaited my reply stopped me and i hastened to assure them that dinner in the middle of the day would be entirely in accordance with my every wish  good exclaimed mrs aleshine her eyes sparkling amid the plumpness of her face while an expression of calm relief passed over the features of mrs lecks  and now ill be off and get us somethin to eat in less than no time said mrs aleshine we didnt know whether to make it lunch or dinner till we had seen you so you cant expect much today but tomorrow well begin and have everything straight and comfortable im goin to get up early in the mornin and bake a batch of bread and you neednt be afraid mr craig but what ill have you a bit of hot meat every night for your supper  in the afternoon we all visited the garden which although a good deal overgrown with luxuriant weeds showed marks of fair cultivation some of the beds had been cleared out and left to the weeds and we found some garden truck as my companions called it with which we were not familiar but there were tomatovines loaded with fruit plenty of beans of various kinds and a large patch of potatoes many of which had been dug  from the lower end of the garden mrs aleshine gave a shout of delight we went to her and found her standing before a long asparagus bed  well she exclaimed if theres anything that settles it firm in my mind that these people is christians its this bed of grass i dont believe there ever was heathens that growed grass  i thought that was all settled when we found the bakinpowders said mrs lecks  but this clinches it answered her companion i cant tell from a sparrowgrass bed what church they belong to but theyre no idolaters  the next morning i delivered to the genial mrs aleshine a large basket full of fresh vegetables and we had a most excellent dinner somewhat to my surprise the table was not set in the kitchen but in the diningroom  me and mrs aleshine have made up our minds said mrs lecks in explanation that its not the proper thing for you to be eatin in the kitchen nor for us neither heres tablecloths and good glass and china and spoons and forks which although theyre not solid silver are plated good enough for anybody neither you nor us is servants and a kitchen is no place for us  thats so said mrs aleshine we paid our money for firstclass passages and it was understood that wed have everything as good as anybody  which i dont see as that has anything to do with it barbry aleshine said mrs lecks for the steamship people dont generally throw in desert islands as part of the accommodation  we didnt ask for the island retorted mrs aleshine and if theyd steered the ship right we shouldnt have wanted it  when we had finished our dinner mrs lecks pushed back her chair and sat for a few moments in thought as was her wont before saying anything of importance  theres another thing said she that ive been thinkin about though i havent spoke of it yet even to mrs aleshine we havent no right to come here and eat up the victuals and use the things of the people that own this house without payin for em of course were not goin to sleep on the bare ground and starve to death while theres beds and food close to our hands but if we use em and take it we ought to pay the people that the place belongs tothat is if weve got the money to do it withand mrs aleshine and me has got the money when we went down into our cabin to get ready to leave the ship the first thing we did was to put our purses in our pockets and weve both got drafts wrapped up in oil silk and sewed inside our frockbodies and if you didnt think to bring your money along with you mr craig we can lend you all you need  i thanked her for her offer but stated that i had brought with me all my money  now continued mrs lecks its my opinion that we ought to pay our board regular every week i dont know what is commonly charged in a place like this but i know you can get very good board where i come from for six dollars a week  illustration theres another thing said she that ive been thinkin about  that is for two in a room said mrs aleshine but havin a room to himself would make it more for mr craig  it aint his fault said mrs lecks somewhat severely that he aint got a brother or some friend to take part of the room and pay part of the expense but anyway the room isnt a large one and i dont think he ought to pay much more for having a room to himself seven dollars is quite enough  but then youve got to consider said mrs aleshine that we do the cookin and housework and that ought to be counted  i was comin to that said mrs lecks now if me and mrs aleshine was to go out to service which you may be sure we wouldnt do unless circumstances was very different from what they are now  thats true earnestly ejaculated mrs aleshine  but if we was to do it continued mrs lecks we wouldnt go into anybodys family for less than two dollars a week now ive always heard that wages is low in this part of the world and the work isnt heavy for two of us so considering the family isnt here to make their own bargain i think wed better put our wages at that so thatll make four dollars a week for each of us two to pay  but how about mr craig said mrs aleshine he oughtnt to work in that garden for nothin  fifty cents a day said mrs lecks is as little as any man would work for and then it oughtnt to take all his time that will make three dollars to take out of mr craigs board and leave it four dollars a week the same as ours  i declared myself perfectly satisfied with these arrangements but mrs aleshine did not seem to be altogether convinced that they were just  when a woman goes out to service said she she gets her board and is paid wages besides and its the same for gardeners  then i suppose barbry aleshine said mrs lecks that we ought to charge these people with our wages and make em pay it when they come back  this remark apparently disposed of mrs aleshines objections and her friend continued theres a jar on the mantelpiece there of the kind the east indy ginger comes in its got nothin in it now but some brown paper in which fishhooks is wrapped we came here on a wednesday and so every tuesday night well each put four dollars in that jar under the fishhook paper then if by night or by day the family comes back and makes a fuss about our bein here all we have to say is the board moneys in the gingerjar and our consciences is free  mrs leckss plan was adopted as a very just and proper one and at the expiration of the week we each deposited four dollars in the gingerjar  while occupying this house i do not think that any of us endeavored to pry into the private concerns of the family who owned it although we each had a very natural curiosity to know something about said family opportunities of acquiring such knowledge however were exceedingly scarce even if we had been willing to look into such receptacles the several desks and secretaries that the house contained were all locked and nowhere could mrs lecks or mrs aleshine find an old letter or piece of wrappingpaper with an address on it i explained to my companions that letters and packages were not likely to come to a place like this but they kept a sharp lookout for anything of the kind asserting that there could be no possible harm in reading the names of the people whose house they were in  in some of the books in the library which were english and french in about equal proportions with a few volumes in german i found written on the blank pages the names emily and lucille and across the titlepages of some french histories was inscribed in a mans hand a dusante we discussed these names but could not make up our minds whether the family were french or english for instance there was no reason why an englishwoman might not be called lucille and even such a surname as dusante was not uncommon either among english or americans the labels on the boxes and tins of provisions showed that most of them came from san francisco but this was likely to be the case no matter what the nationality of the family  the question of the relationship of the three persons of whose existence we had discovered traces was a very interesting one to mrs lecks and mrs aleshine  i cant make up my mind said the latter whether emily is the mother of lucille or her daughter or whether they are both children of mr dusante or whether hes married to lucille and emily is his sisterinlaw or whether shes his sister and not hers or whether hes the uncle and theyre his nieces or whether emily is an old lady and mr dusante and lucille are both her children or whether they are two maiden ladies and mr dusante is their brother or whether mr dusante is only a friend of the family and boards here because no two women ought to live in such a lonely place without a man in the house  well said mrs lecks whether mr dusante comes back with two nieces or a wife and daughter or mrs dusante and a motherinlaw or a pair of sisters all weve got to say is the board moneys in the gingerjar and let em do their worst  in my capacity as gardener i do not think i earned the wages which my companions had allotted to me for i merely gathered and brought in such fruits and vegetables as i found in proper condition for use in other ways however i made my services valuable to our little family in a closet in my chamber i found guns and ammunition and frequently i was able to bring in a few birds some of these were pronounced by mrs aleshine unsuitable for the table but others she cooked with much skill and they were found to be very good eating  not far from the little wharf which has been mentioned there stood concealed by a mass of lowgrowing palms a boathouse in which was a little skiff hung up near the roof this i let down and launched and found great pleasure in rowing it about the lagoon there was fishingtackle in the boathouse which i used with success the lagoon abounding in fish offerings of this kind were much more acceptable to mrs aleshine than birds  theres some kinds of fishes thats better than others said she but as a genral rule a fish is a fish and if you catch em you can eat em but its a very different thing with birds when youve never seen em before how are you goin to tell but what theyre some kin to an owl a pigeonhawk or a crow and if i once get it into my head that theres any of that kind of family blood in em they disagree with me just the same as if there really was  one afternoon as i was returning in the boat from the point on the other side of the island where i had found the rustic seat and emilys book i was surprised to see mrs lecks and mrs aleshine standing on the end of the little wharf this was an unusual thing for them to do as they were very industrious women and seldom had an idle moment and it seemed to be one of their greatest pleasures to discuss the work they were going to do when they had finished that on which they were then engaged i was curious therefore to know why they should be standing thus idly on the wharf and pulled toward them as rapidly as possible  illustration mrs lecks and mrs aleshine standing on the end of the little wharf  when i had rowed near enough to hear them mrs aleshine remarked with cheerful placidity  the dusantes are comin  the tide was quite low and i could not see over the reef but in a few moments i had grounded the skiff and had sprung upon the wharf out on the ocean about a mile away i saw a boat apparently a large one approaching the island  now then barbry aleshine said mrs lecks youll soon see whether its his two nieces or his daughters wife and sisterinlaw or whatever of them other relationships which youve got so pat  yes said mrs aleshine but whats more well find out if hes goin to be satisfied with the board money weve put in the gingerjar  illustration     part iii  illustration   when the boat which we saw approaching the island had come near enough for us to distinguish its occupants we found that it contained five persons three sat in the stern and two were rowing of those in the stern we soon made out one to be a woman and after putting our eyesight to its very best efforts we were obliged to admit that there was only one female on board  now thats disappintin said mrs aleshine for ive wondered and wondered which i should like best emily or lucille and now that only one of em has come of course i cant tell  the boat came on almost directly toward the passageway in the reef and it was not long before the two women had been able to decide that mr dusante was an elderly man and that the lady was moderately young and in all probability his daughter  it may be said mrs aleshine that the mother whether she was emily or whether she was lucille has died and for that reason they are comin back sooner than they expected  well i hope youre wrong there barbry aleshine said mrs lecks for theyll see lots of things here that will freshen up their affliction and that wont make em any too lively people to be with  on the other hand said mrs aleshine it may be that emily or else lucille has got married and has gone away with her husband to travel and by the time shes got a little baby shell come here to live on account of the sea air for the child and thatll make the house pleasant mrs lecks  id like to know how long you expect to live here said mrs lecks regarding her friend with some severity  thats not for me to say replied mrs aleshine knowin nothin about it but this i will say that i hope they have brought along with them some indigo blue for i nearly used up all there was the last time i washed  during this dialogue i had been thinking that it was a very strange thing for the owners of this place to visit their island in such a fashion why should they be in an open boat and where did they come from wherever they might live it was not at all probable that they would choose to be rowed from that point to this from the general character and appointments of the house in which we had found a refuge it was quite plain that its owners were people in good circumstances who were in the habit of attending to their domestic affairs in a very orderly and proper way it was to be presumed that it was their custom to come here in a suitable vessel and to bring with them the stores needed during their intended stay now there could be little or nothing in that boat and on the whole i did not believe it contained the owners of this island  it would not do however to assume anything of the kind there might have been a disaster in fact i know nothing about it but it was my immediate duty to go and meet these people at the passage for if they were unable to unlock the bars their boat could not enter and i must ferry them across the lagoon without communicating my doubts to my companions i hurried into the skiff and pulled as far as possible into the passage through the reef the bars of which there were more than i at first supposed were so arranged that it was impossible for a boat to go in or out at any stage of the tide  i had been there but a few minutes when the boat from without came slowly in between the rocks and almost as soon as i saw it its progress was suddenly stopped by a sunken bar  hello cried several men at once  hello cried i in return have you the key to these bars  a stout man with a red beard stood up in the stern key said he what key  then you do not belong here said i who are you  at this the gentleman who was sitting by the lady arose to his feet he was a man past middle age rather tall and slim and when he stood up the slight rolling of the boat made him stagger and he came near falling  youd better sit down sir said the man with the red beard who i saw was a sailor you can talk better that way  the gentleman now seated himself and thus addressed me  i am sir the reverend mr enderton lately missionary to nanfouchong china and this is my daughter miss enderton we are returning to the united states by way of the sandwich islands and took passage in a sailingvessel for honolulu about two weeks ago this vessel in some way which i do not understand became disabled  rotten foremst interrupted the man with the red beard which give way in a gale strained and leaky besides  i did not know the mast was rotten said the gentleman but since the occasion of our first really serviceable wind she has been making very unsatisfactory progress and more than that the whole force of seamen was employed night and day in endeavoring to keep the water out of the tea thereby causing such a thumping and pounding that sleep was out of the question add to this the fact that our meals became very irregular and were sometimes entirely overlooked  prog was gettin mighty short interpolated the redbearded man  you can easily discern sir continued the gentleman that it was impossible for myself and my daughter to remain longer on that vessel on which we were the only passengers i therefore requested the captain to put us ashore at the nearest land and after more than a week of delay and demur he consented to do so  couldnt do it said the man till there was land nigh enough  the captain informed me continued the gentleman that this island was inhabited and that i could here find shelter and repose until a vessel could be sent from honolulu to take me off he furnished me with this boat and three seamen one of whom pointing to the redbearded man is a coxswain we have been rowing ever since early this morning with but a very moderate quantity of food and much discomfort now sir you have heard my story and i ask you as one man to another if you still intend to bar your watergates against us  i did not bar the gates i said and i would gladly unlock them if i could i belong to a shipwrecked party who took refuge here some two weeks ago  and how did you get in hastily inquired the redbearded coxswain  our boat sunk when we were within sight of the island and we came here on lifepreservers and so got under the bars  the two men who had been rowing now turned suddenly and looked at me they both had black beards and they both exclaimed at the same moment by george  i wont stop here to tell any more of our story said i the great point now is to get you all ashore and have you cared for  thats so said the coxswain and the two sailors murmured aye aye sir  the bar which stopped the progress of the larger boat was just under the surface of the water while another a foot above the water kept my skiff about six feet distant from the other boat there was some loose flooring in the bottom of the coxswains boat and he ordered two of the boards taken out and with them a bridge was made one end resting on the bow of the larger boat and the other on the iron bar by my skiff  now said the coxswain let the lady go first  the elderly gentleman arose as if he would prefer to take the lead but his daughter who had not yet spoken a word was passed forward by the coxswain steadied over the bridge by one of the sailors and assisted by me into the skiff then her father came aboard and i rowed with them to the wharf  mrs lecks and mrs aleshine came forward most cordially to meet them  mr dusante i suppose said mrs lecks while mrs aleshine hurriedly whispered in my ear is it lucille or emily  as quickly as possible i explained the situation for a few moments mrs lecks and mrs aleshine stood speechless nothing which had happened to them the wreck of the steamer the sinking of the boat or our experience with lifepreservers affected them so much as this disappointment in regard to the problem of the dusante family travel by sea was all novel and strange to them and they had expected all sorts of things to which they were not accustomed but they had never imagined that fate would be so hard upon them as to snatch away the solution of this mystery just as they were about to put their hands upon it but in spite of this sudden blow the two good women quickly recovered themselves and with hearty and kindly words hurried the missionary and his daughter to the house while i went to bring over the men  i found the three sailors busy in securing their boat so that it would not be injured by the rocks during the rising and falling of the tide when they had finished this job they had to do a good deal of scrambling before they reached my skiff  we thought at first sir said the coxswain as i rowed them across the lagoon that it was all gammon about your not livin here and havin no keys to them bars but weve come to the pinion that if youd been able to unlock em youd have done it sooner than take all this trouble  i now related my story more fully and the men were greatly astonished when they heard that my companions in this adventure were two women upon my asking the coxswain why he had come to this island he replied that his captain had heard that people lived on it although he knew nothing about them and that as it would be almost impossible to get his brig here with the wind that was then prevailing and as he did not wish to go out of his course anyway he made up his mind that he would rather lose the services of three men than keep that missionary on board a day longer  you see sir said the coxswain as we went ashore the parson wouldnt never take it into account that we were short of prog and leakin like sam hill and because things were uncomfortable he growled up and he growled down till he was wuss for the spirits of the men than the salt water comin in or the hardtack givin out and there was danger if he wasnt got rid of that hed be pitched overboard and left to take his chances for a whale and then by sendin us along that give the crew three halfrations a day extry and thatll count for a good deal in the fix theyre in  when i reached the house i took the men into the kitchen where mrs aleshine already had the table spread there were bread and cold meat while the teakettle steamed by the fire in a very short time three happy mariners sat round that table while mrs aleshine with beaming face attended to their wants and plied them with innumerable questions they had not finished eating when mrs lecks entered the kitchen  i put that minister and his daughter in the two front bedrooms said she to me after hospitably greeting the three men which me and mrs aleshine had run and got ready for the dusantes as soon as you went in your boat to meet em the young lady was mighty nigh worn out and glad enough of the tea and things and to get into bed but the gentleman he wanted a softboiled egg and when i told him i hadnt come across no henhouse yet on this island he looked at me as if he didnt half believe me and thought i was keepin the eggs to sell  which it would be ridiculous to do said mrs aleshine in the middle of an ocean like this  if he lets you off with softbiled eggs maam said the coxswain very respectfully i think you may bless your stars  aye aye sir said the two sailors with black beards  miss ruth enderton and her father did not make their appearance until the next morning at breakfasttime i found the young lady a very pleasant person she was rather slight in figure inclined to be pretty and was what might be called a warmcolored blonde her disposition was quite sociable and she almost immediately stepped into the favor of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine  mr enderton however was a person of another sort he was a prim and somewhat formal man and appeared to be entirely selfengrossed with very vague notions in regard to his surroundings he was not by any means an illtempered man being rather inclined to be placid than otherwise but he gave so little attention to circumstances and events that he did not appear to understand why he should be incommoded by the happenings of life i have no doubt that he made existence on board the disabled brig a hundred times more unsatisfactory than it would otherwise have been with his present condition he seemed very well satisfied and it was quite plain that he looked upon mrs lecks mrs aleshine and myself as the proprietors of the establishment having forgotten or paid no attention to my statement in regard to our coming here  as soon as she thought it fit and properand this moment arrived in the course of the first forenoonmrs lecks spoke to mr enderton on the subject of the board which should be paid to the dusantes she stated the arrangements we had made in the matter and then told him that as he and his daughter had the best accommodations in the house each occupying a large handsome room she thought that he should pay fifteen dollars a week for the two  now if your daughter she continued can do anything about the house which will be of real help though for the life of me i dont see what she can find to do with me and mrs aleshine here somethin might be took off on account of her services but of course you sir cant do nothin unless you was to preach on sundays and not knowin what denomination the dusantes belong to it wouldnt be fair to take their money to pay for the preachin of doctrines which perhaps they dont believe in  illustration mr enderton was a person of another sort  this financial proposal aroused mr endertons opposition when i came here madam he said i did not expect to pay any board whatever and i think moreover that your rates are exorbitant in nanfouchong if i remember rightly the best of board did not cost more than two or three dollars a week  i dont want to say anything sir said mrs lecks which might look disrespectful but as long as ive got a conscience inside of me im not goin to stay here and see the dusantes lose money by chinese cheapness  i dont know anything about the dusantes said mr enderton but i am not going to pay fifteen dollars a week for board for myself and daughter  the discussion lasted for some time with considerable warmth on each side and was at last ended by mr enderton agreeing to pay board at the same rate as the two women and myself and each week to deposit in the gingerjar eight dollars for himself and daughter  you may not care to remember sir said mrs lecks with cold severity that mr craig and me and mrs aleshine puts in services besides although to be sure they dont go into the jar  i only remember said mr enderton that i am paying an unjustifiable price as it is  mrs lecks and mrs aleshine however were not at all of this opinion and they agreed that if it should be in their power they would see to it that the dusantes lost nothing by this closefisted missionary  after dinnerand i may remark that the newcomers were not consulted in regard to the hours for mealsmrs lecks had an interview with the coxswain on the subject of board for himself and his two companions this affair however was very quickly settled for the three mariners had among them only one dollar and fortythree cents and this the coxswain explained they would like to keep for tobacco it was therefore settled that as the three sailors could pay no money as much work as possible should be got out of them and to this plan they agreed heartily and cheerfully  theres only one thing well ask maam said the coxswain to mrs lecks and that is that we be put in a different mess from the parson weve now eat two meals with the passengers and me and my mates is agreed that thats about as much as we can go  after this therefore the three men had their meals in the kitchen where they were generally joined by mrs aleshine who much delighted in their company but she made it a point sometimes to sit down with us in the diningroom merely to show that she had as much right there as anybody  as to the work for them sailormen said mrs aleshine i dont see what theyre goin to do of course they dont know nothin about gardenin and it seems to me that the best thing to be done is to put em to fishin  mrs lecks considered this a good suggestion and accordingly the coxswain and his companions were told that thereafter they would be expected to fish for eight hours a day sundays excepted this plan however did not work very well during the first two days the sailors caught so many fish that although the fishermen themselves had excellent appetites for such food it was found utterly impossible to consume what they brought in consequently it was ordered that thereafter they should catch only as many fish as should be needed and then make themselves useful by assisting mrs aleshine and mrs lecks in any manner they might direct  i found it quite easy to become acquainted with miss ruth enderton as she was very much inclined to conversation its ever so long she said since ive had anybody to talk to  she had left the united states when she was quite a little girl and had since seen nothing of her native land she was consequently full of questions about america although quite willing to talk of her life in china society at least such kind as she had ever cared for had been extremely scarce in the little missionary station at which she had lived so long and now coming from a wearisome sojourn on a disabled sailingvessel with no company but the crew and a preoccupied father she naturally was delighted to get among people she could talk to with mrs lecks mrs aleshine and myself she soon became very friendly and showed herself to be a most lively and interesting young person  i did all that i could to make miss ruths time pass agreeably i rowed with her on the lagoon taught her to fish and showed her all the pleasant points on the island which could be easily reached by walking mr enderton gave us very little of his company for having discovered that there was a library in the house he passed most of his time in that room  you have made a very fair selection of books sir he remarked to me but it may readily be conceived from the character of the works that your tastes are neither ecclesiastic nor scientific  several times i explained to him the ownership of the library and the house but he immediately forgot what i had said or paid no attention to it when he paid his board at the end of the week he handed the money to mrs lecks and although before his eyes she put it into the gingerjar beneath the paper of fishhooks i know very well that he considered he was paying it to her for her own use and behoof he was comfortably lodged he had all that he neededand very nearly all that he wantedto eat and i do not know that i ever saw a man more contented with his lot  illustration i did all that i could to make miss ruths time pass agreeably  as for the coxswain and the two sailors they had a very pleasant time of it but mrs lecks and mrs aleshine would not think of such a thing as allowing them to eat in idleness the bread of the dusantes after they had been with us a few days mrs lecks told me that she thought she could show the coxswain and his mates how to dig and gather the gardenstuff which was daily needed  to be sure said she that work goes agin part of your board but fishin and bringin in firewood dont take up quarter of the time of them sailors and so that the garden work is done i dont suppose it matters to the dusantes who does it and thatll give you more time to make things pleasant for miss ruth for as far as i can see there isnt a thing for her to do even if she knows how to do it  the three mariners were more than willing to do anything desired by mrs lecks or mrs aleshine to whom they looked up with great admiration and respect the latter was their favorite not only because she was with them a great deal during their meals and at other times but because of her genial nature and easy sociability the men were always trying to lighten her labors and to do something that would please her  one of them climbed to the top of what she called a palmleaffan tree and brought therefrom some broad leaves which he cut and trimmed and sewed in true nautical fashion until he made some fans which were heavy and clumsy but as he said they would stand half a gale of wind if she chose to raise it the coxswain caught or trapped two seabirds and having clipped their wings he spent days in endeavoring to tame them hoping to induce them as far as the power in them lay to take the place of the barnyard fowls whose absence mrs aleshine continually deplored every evening the two blackbearded sailors would dance hornpipes for her much to her diversion and delight  ive often heard she remarked that in these hot cocoanut countries the tricks of the monkeys was enough to keep everybody on a steady laugh but im sure sailormen is a great deal better when you get tired of their pranks and their tomfooleries you can tell em to stop which with monkeys you cant  it was about ten days after the arrival of the missionarys party that as i was going to get ready the boat in which miss ruth and myself generally rowed in the cool of the evening i saw mrs lecks and mrs aleshine sitting on the beach in the shade of some lowgrowing trees they were evidently waiting for me and as soon as i appeared mrs lecks beckoned to me whereupon i joined them  sit down said mrs lecks theres somethin i want to talk to you about mrs aleshine and me have made up our minds that you ought to be hurried up a little about poppin the question to miss ruth  this remark astounded me popping the question i exclaimed  yes continued mrs lecks and me and mrs aleshine know very well that you havent done it yet for both of us havin been through that sort of thing ourselves we know the signs of it after it has happened  and we wouldnt say nothin to hurry you added mrs aleshine if it wasnt that the groceries especially the flour is agettin low weve been talkin to them sailormen and theyre pretty well agreed that theres no use now in expectin their captain to send for em for if he was agoin to do it at all hed a done it before this and perhaps he never got nowhere himself in which case he couldnt and they say the best thing we can all do when the victuals has nearly give out provided the dusantes dont come back in time is to take whats left and all get into their big boat and row away to that island which i dont know just how far it is that the captain of our ship was goin to there we can stay pretty comfortable till a ship comes along and takes us off  but what has all that to do i asked with miss ruth and me  do cried mrs lecks it has everythin to do when its all settled and fixed between you and miss ruth therell be nothin to hinder us from gettin ready to start when we please  but my dear friends i said with much earnestness i have not the slightest idea of proposing to miss enderton  thats just what i said to mrs aleshine said mrs lecks and thats the reason we let our irons cool and come out here to talk to you its just like a young man to keep puttin off that sort of thing but this cant be put off  thats so cried mrs aleshine and ill just let you see how the matter stands there is housekeepers who allows a pint of flour a day to each person but this is for farmhands and people who works hard and eats hearty and ive found that three quarters of a pint will do very well if the dough is kneaded conscientious and made up light so that itll rise well when its put into the oven now ive measured all the flour thats left and me and mrs lecks weve calculated that allowin three quarters of a pint of flour a day to each one of us theres just eight days more that we can stay herethat is if the dusantes dont come back before that time which of course cant be counted on so you can see for yourself mr craig theres no time to be lost even considerin that she hasnt to make up anything to be married in  illustration they were evidently waiting for me  no said mrs lecks just for us and three sailors that wouldnt be needed  i looked from one to the other in dumb astonishment mrs lecks gave me no time to say anything  in common cases said she this might all be put off till we got somewhere but it wont do now here you are with everythin in your own hands but just get away from here and theres an end of that shes as pretty a girl as youll see in a month of sundays and if she leaves here without your gettin her theres no knowing wholl snap her up when weve got to that island you may see her once a week but maybe you wont she may go away in one ship and you in another and there may be somebody right therea missionary for all i knowwholl have her before you have a chance to put in a word  and thats not the worst of it said mrs aleshine supposin them dusantes come back before we go theres no knowin what that mr dusante is he may be a brother of emily and lucille and what sort of a chance would you have then id like to know with miss ruth right here in his own house and he ownin the rowboat and everythin or it may be hes a widower and thatll be a mighty sight worse i can tell you  no matter whether theyre widowers or never been married said mrs lecks therell be plenty thatll want her as soon as they see her and if it isnt for the girls own pretty face itll be for her fathers money  her fathers money i exclaimed what are you talking of  theres no good tellin me anything about that said mrs lecks very decidedly there never was a man as closefisted as mr enderton who hadnt money  and you know as well as we do said mrs aleshine that in them countries where hes been the heathens worship idols of silver and idols of gold and when them heathens is converted dont you suppose the missionaries get any of that i expect that mr enderton has converted thousands of heathens  at this suggestion i laughed outright but mrs lecks reproved me  now mr craig said she this is no laughin matter what me and mrs aleshine is sayin is for your good and for the good of miss ruth along with you i havent much opinion of her father but his money is as good as anybody elses and though they had to leave their trunks on board their ship what little they brought with them shows that theyve been used to havin the best there is mrs aleshine and me has set up till late into the night talkin over this thing and we are both of one mind that you two need never expect to have the same chance again that youve got now the very fact that the old gentleman is a preacher and can marry you on the spot ought to make you tremble when you think of the risks you are runnin by puttin it off  ive got to go into the house now to see about supper said mrs aleshine rising and i hope youll remember mr craig when your bread is on your plate and miss ruth is sittin opposite to you that three quarters of a pint of flour a day is about as little as anybody can live on and that time is flyin  mrs lecks now also rose but i detained the two for a moment  i hope you have not said anything to miss enderton on this subject i said  no replied mrs aleshine we havent we are both agreed that as youre the one thats to do whats to be done you are the one thats to be spoke to and havin been through it ourselves we understand well enough that the more a woman dont know nothin about it the more likely she is to be ketched if she wants to be  the two women left me in an amused but also somewhat annoyed state of mind i had no intention whatever of proposing to miss ruth enderton she was a charming girl very bright and lively and withal i had reason to believe very sensible but it was not yet a fortnight since i first saw her and no thought of marrying her had entered into my head had mrs lecks and mrs aleshine or more important than all had miss enderton any reason to believe that i was acting the part of a lover  the latter portion of this question was almost immediately answered to my satisfaction by the appearance of miss ruth who came skipping down to me and calling out to me in that free and hearty manner with which a woman addresses a friend or near acquaintance but never a suspected lover she betrayed no more notion of the lecks and aleshine scheme than on the day i first met her  but as i was rowing her over the lagoon i felt a certain constraint which i had not known before there was no ground whatever for the wild imaginings of the two women but the fact that they had imagined interfered very much with the careless freedom with which i had previously talked to miss ruth i do not think however that she noticed any change in me for she chatted and laughed and showed as she had done from the first the rare delight which she took in this novel island life  when we returned to the house we were met by mrs aleshine i am goin to give you two your supper she said on that table there under the tree we all had ours a little earlier than common as the sailormen seemed hungry and i took your fathers to him in the librry where i expect hes asittin yet holdin a book in one hand and stirrin his tea with the other till hes stirred out nearly every drop on the floor which however wont matter at all for in the mornin ill rub up that floor till its as bright as new  this plan delighted miss ruth but i saw in it the beginning of the workings of a deeplaid scheme i was just about to sit down when mrs aleshine said to me in a low voice as she left us  remember that the first three quarters of a pint apiece begins now  dont you think that mrs lecks and mrs aleshine are perfectly charming said miss ruth as she poured out the tea they always seem to be trying to think of some kind thing to do for other people  i agreed entirely with miss endertons remark but i could not help thinking of the surprise she would feel if she knew of the kind thing that these two women were trying to do for her  have you taken any steps yet asked mrs lecks of me the next day on my replying that i had taken no steps of the kind to which i supposed she alluded she walked away with a very grave and serious face  a few hours later mrs aleshine came to me theres another reason for hurryin up said she them sailormen seems able to do without most anything in this world except tobacco and mrs lecks has been sellin it to em out of a big box she found in a closet upstairs at five cents a teacupfulwhich i think is awful cheap but she says prices in islands is always lowand wrapping the money up in a paper with cash paid by sailormen for tobacco written on it and puttin it into the gingerjar with the board money but their dollar and fortythree cents is nearly gone and mrs lecks she says that not a whiff of mr dusantes tobacco shall they have if they cant pay for it and when they have nothin to smoke theyll be wantin to leave this island just as quick as they can without waitin for the flour to give out  here was another pressure brought to bear upon me not only the waning flour but the rapidly disappearing tobacco money was used as a weapon to urge me forward to the lovemaking which mrs lecks and mrs aleshine had set their hearts upon  i was in no hurry to leave the island and hoped very much that when we did go we should depart in some craft more comfortable than a ships boat in order therefore to prevent any undue desire to leave on the part of the sailors i gave them money enough to buy a good many teacups full of tobacco by this act i think i wounded the feelings of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine although i had no idea that such would be the effect of my little gift they said nothing to me on the subject but their looks and manners indicated that they thought i had not been acting honorably for two days they had very little to say to me and then mrs aleshine came to me to make what i suppose was their supreme effort  mrs lecks and me is agoin to try she saidand as she spoke she looked at me with a very sad expression and a watery appearance about the eyesto stretch out the time for you a little longer we are goin to make them sailormen eat more fish and as for me and her well go pretty much without bread and make it up as well as we can on other things you and miss ruth and the parson can each have your three quarters of a pint of flour a day just the same as ever and what we save ought to give you three or four days longer  this speech moved me deeply i could not allow these two kindhearted women to half starve themselves in order that i might have more time to woo and i spoke very earnestly on the subject to mrs aleshine urging her to give up the fanciful plans which she and mrs lecks had concocted  let us drop this idea of lovemaking i said which is the wildest kind of vagary and all live happily together as we did before if the provisions give out before the dusantes come back i suppose we shall have to leave in the boat but until that time comes let us enjoy life here as much as we can and be the good friends that we used to be  i might as well have talked to one of the palmtrees which waved over us  as i said before remarked mrs aleshine what is saved from mrs leckss and mine and the three sailormens three quarters of a pint apiece ought to give you four days more and she went into the house  all this time the reverend mr enderton had sat and read in the library or meditatively had walked the beach with a book in his hand while the three mariners had caught fish performed their other work and lain in the shade smoking their pipes in peace miss ruth and i had taken our daily rows and walks and had enjoyed our usual hours of pleasant converse and all the members of the little colony seemed happy and contented except mrs lecks and mrs aleshine these two went gravely and sadly about their work and the latter asked no more for the hornpipes and the seasongs of her sailormen  but for some unaccountable reason mr endertons condition of tranquil abstraction did not continue he began to be fretful and discontented he found fault with his food and his accommodations and instead of spending the greater part of the day in the library as had been his wont he took to wandering about the island generally with two or three books under his arm sometimes sitting down in one place and sometimes in another and then rising suddenly to go grumbling into the house  one afternoon as miss ruth and i were in the skiff in the lagoon we saw mr enderton approaching us walking on the beach as soon as he was near enough for us to hear him he shouted to his daughter  ruth come out of that boat if you want to take the air i should think you might as well walk with me as to go rowing round withwith anybody  this rude and heartless speech made my blood boil while my companion turned pale with mortification the man had never made the slightest objection to our friendly intercourse and this unexpected attack was entirely indefensible  please put me ashore said miss ruth and without a word for i could not trust myself to speak i landed her and petulantly complaining that she never gave him one moment of her society her father led her away  illustration smoking their pipes in peace  an hour later my soul still in a state of turmoil but with the violence of its tossings somewhat abated i entered one of the paths which led through the woods after a few turns i reached a point where i could see for quite a long distance to the other end of the path which opened out upon the beach there i perceived mr enderton sitting upon the little bench on which i had found emilys book his back was toward me and he seemed to be busily reading about midway between him and myself i saw miss ruth slowly walking toward me her eyes were fixed upon the ground and she had not seen me  stepping to one side i awaited her approach when she came near i accosted her  miss ruth said i has your father been talking to you of me  she looked up quickly evidently surprised at my being there yes she said he has told me that it is notsuitable that i should be with you as much as i have been since we came here  there was something in this remark that roused again the turmoil which had begun to subside within me there was so much that was unjust and tyrannical andwhat perhaps touched me still deeperthere was such a want of consideration and respect in this behavior of mr endertons that it brought to the front some very incongruous emotions i had been superciliously pushed aside and i found i was angry something was about to be torn from me and i found i loved it  ruth said i stepping up close to her do you like to be with me as you have been  if miss ruth had not spent such a large portion of her life in the outoftheworld village of nanfouchong if she had not lived among those simplehearted missionaries where it was never necessary to conceal her emotions or her sentiments if it had not been that she never had had emotions or sentiments that it was necessary to conceal i do not believe that when she answered me she would have raised her eyes to me with a look in them of a deepblue sky seen through a sort of indiansummer mist and that gazing thus she would have said  of course i like it  then let us make it suitable i said taking both her hands in mine  there was another look in which the skies shone clear and bright and then in a moment it was all done  about five minutes after this i said to her ruth shall we go to your father  certainly she answered and together we walked along the thickly shaded path  the missionary still sat with his back toward us and being so intent upon his book i found that by keeping my eyes upon him it was perfectly safe to walk with my arm around ruth until we had nearly reached him then i took her hand in mine and we stepped in front of him  father said ruth mr craig and i are going to be married  there was something very plump about this remark and mr enderton immediately raised his eyes from his book and fixed them first upon his daughter and then upon me then he let them drop and through the narrow space between us he gazed out over the sea  well father said ruth a little impatiently what do you think of it  mr enderton leaned forward and picked up a leaf from the ground this he placed between the open pages of his book and closed it  it seems to me he said that on many accounts the arrangement you propose may be an excellent one yes he added more decidedly i think it will do very well indeed i shall not be at all surprised if we are obliged to remain on this island for a considerable time and for my part i have no desire to leave it at present and when you shall place yourself ruth in a position in which you will direct the domestic economies of the establishment i hope that you will see to it that things generally are made more compatible with comfort and gentility and as regards the table i may add with palatability  illustration it was perfectly safe  ruth and i looked at each other and then together we promised that as far as in us lay we would try to make the life of mr enderton a happy one not only while we were on the island but ever afterward  we were promising a great deal but at that moment we felt very grateful  then he stood up shook us both by the hands and we left him to his book  when ruth and i came walking out of the woods and approached the house mrs aleshine was standing outside not far from the kitchen when she saw us she gazed steadily at us for a few moments a strange expression coming over her face then she threw up both her hands and without a word she turned and rushed indoors  we had not reached the house before mrs lecks and mrs aleshine came hurrying out together running up to us with a haste and an excitement i had never seen in either of them first one and then the other took ruth into her arms and kissed her with much earnestness then they turned upon me and shook my hands with hearty vigor expressing more by their looks and actions than their words a triumphant approbation of what i had done  the minute i laid eyes on you said mrs aleshine i knowed it was all right there wasnt no need of askin questions  i now became fearful lest in the exuberance of their satisfaction these good women might reveal to ruth the plans they had laid for our matrimonial future and the reluctance i had shown in entering into them my countenance must have expressed my apprehensions for mrs aleshine her ruddy face glowing with warmth both mental and physical gave me a little wink and drew me to one side  you neednt suppose that weve ever said anything to miss ruth or that were goin to its a great deal better to let her think you did it all yourself  i felt like resenting this imputation upon the independence of my lovemaking but at this happy moment i did not want to enter into a discussion and therefore merely smiled  im so glad i dont know how to tell it continued mrs aleshine as mrs lecks and ruth walked toward the house  i was about to follow but my companion detained me  have you spoke to the parson she asked  oh yes said i and he seems perfectly satisfied i am rather surprised at this because of late he has been in such a remarkably bad humor  thats so said mrs aleshine theres no gettin round the fact that hes been a good deal crosser than two sticks you see mr craig that mrs lecks and me we made up our minds that it wasnt fair to the dusantes to let that rich missionary go on payin nothin but four dollars a week apiece for him and his daughter and if we couldnt get no more out of him one way wed do it another it was fair enough that if he didnt pay more he ought to get less and so we gave him more fish and not so much bread the same as we did the sailormen and we weakened his tea and sent him just so much sugar and no more and as for openin boxes of sardines for him which there was no reason why they shouldnt be left here for the dusantes i just wouldnt do it though he said hed got all the fresh fish he wanted when he was in china and then we agreed that it was high time that that librry should be cleaned up and we went to work at it not mindin what he said for its no use tellin me that four dollars a week will pay for a front room and good board and the use of a librry all day and as there wasnt no need of both of us cleanin one room mrs lecks she went into the parlor where hed took his books and begun there and then again we shut down on mr dusantes dressinggown there was no sense includin the use of that in his four dollars a week so we brushed it up and camphored it and put it away we just wanted to let him know that if he undertook to be skinflinty hed better try it on somebody else besides us we could see that he was a good deal upset for if ever a man liked to have things quiet and comfortable around him and everything his own way that man is that missionary but we didnt care if we did prod him up a little mrs lecks and me we both agreed that it would do him good why hed got into such a way of shettin himself up in himself that he didnt even see that his daughter was goin about with a young man and fixin her affections on him more and more every day when he never had no idea as could be proved by witnesses of marryin her  illustration i knowed it was all right  mrs aleshine said i looking at her very steadfastly i believe after all that you and mrs lecks had your own way in regard to hurrying up this matter  yes said she with happy complacency i shouldnt wonder if we had stirrin up the parson was our last chance and it wasnt much trouble to do it  mrs lecks whose manner toward me for the last few days had been characterized by cold severity now resumed her former friendly demeanor although she was not willing to let the affair pass over without some words of reproach  i must say mr craig she remarked the next morning that i was gettin pretty well outdone with you i was beginnin to think that a young man that couldnt see and wouldnt see what was good for him didnt deserve to have it and if miss ruths father had just come down with a heavy foot and put an end to the whole business im not sure id been sorry for you but its all right at last and bygones is bygones and now what weve got to do is to get ready for the weddin  the wedding i exclaimed  mrs lecks regarded me with an expression in which there was something of virtuous indignation and something of pity mr craig said she if there ever was anybody that wanted a guardeen its you now just let me tell you this that mr enderton aint to be trusted no further than you can see him and not so fur neither if it can be helped hes willin for you to have miss ruth now because hes pretty much made up his mind that were goin to stay here and as he considers you the master of this island of course he thinks itll be for his good for his daughter to be mistress of it for one thing he wouldnt expect to pay no board then but just let him get away from this island and just let him set his eyes on some smoothfaced young fellow thatll agree to take him into the concern and keep him for nothin on books and tea hell just throw you over without winkin and miss ruth is not the girl to marry you against his will if he opens the bible and piles texts on her which he is capable of doin if in any way you two should get separated when you leave here theres no knowin when youd ever see each other again for where hell take her nobody can tell hes more willin to set down and stay where he finds himself comfortable than anybody ive met yet  of course i said im ready to be married at any moment but i dont believe miss ruth and her father would consent to anything so speedy  dont you get into the way said mrs lecks of beforehand believin this or that it dont pay just you go to her father and talk to him about it and if you and him agree itll be easy enough to make her see the sense of it you attend to them and ill see that everythin is got ready and youd better fix the day for tomorrow for we cant stay here much longer and theres a lot of housecleanin and bakin and cookin to be done before we go  i took this advice and broached the subject to mr enderton  well sir said he laying down his book your proposition is decidedly odd i may say very odd indeed but it is perhaps after all no odder than many things i have seen among the various denominational sects i have noticed occurrences quite as odd quite as odd sir for my part i have no desire to object to an early celebration of the matrimonial rites i may say indeed that i am of the opinion that a certain amount of celerity in this matter will conduce to the comfort of all concerned it has been a very unsatisfactory thing to me to see my daughter occupying a subordinate position in our little family where she has not even the power to turn household affairs into the channels of my comfort tomorrow i think will do very well indeed even if it should rain i see no reason why the ceremony should be postponed  the proposition of a wedding on the morrow was not received by ruth with favor she was unprepared for such precipitancy but she finally yielded to arguments not so much to mine i fear as to those offered by mrs lecks and mrs aleshine  for the rest of that day the three mariners were kept very busy bringing in green things to deck the parlor and doing every imaginable kind of work necessary to a wedding which mrs aleshine was willing to give into their hands as for herself and her good friend they put themselves upon their mettle as providers of festivals they made cakes pies and i never knew half so well as the three sailors how many other kinds of good things besides all this they assisted ruth to array herself in some degree in a manner becoming a bride some light and pretty adornments of dress were borrowed from emily or lucille they knew not which and after having been done up and fluted and crimped by mrs lecks were incorporated by ruth into her costume with so much taste that on the wedding morning she appeared to me to be dressed more charmingly than any bride i had ever seen  the three sailors had done their own washing and ironing and appeared in cleanly garb and with hair and beards well wet and brushed mrs lecks and mrs aleshine put on their best bibs and tuckers and mr enderton assumed his most clerical air as he stood behind a table in the parlor and married ruth and me  this said mr enderton as we were seated at the weddingfeast is a most creditable display of attractive viands but i may say my dear ruth that i think i perceived the influence of the happy event of today even before it took place i have lately had a better appetite for my food and have experienced a greater enjoyment of my surroundings  i should think so murmured mrs aleshine in my ear for wed no sooner knowed that you two were to make a match of it than we put an extry spoonful of tea into his pot and stopped scrubbin the librry  for the next two days all was bustle and work on the island mrs lecks and mrs aleshine would not consent to depart without leaving everything in the best possible order so that the dusantes might not be dissatisfied with the condition of their house when they returned it was in fact the evident desire of the two women to gratify their pride in their housewifely abilities by leaving everything better than they found it  mr enderton was much surprised at these preparations for immediate departure he was very well satisfied with his life on the island and had prepared his mind for an indefinite continuance of it with the position of that annoying and obdurate mrs lecks filled by a compliant and affectionate daughter he had no reasonable cause for complaint for the whole subject of the exhaustion of our supply of provisions and the necessity of an openboat trip to an inhabited island had been fully discussed before him but he was so entirely engrossed in the consideration of his own wellbeing that this discussion of our plans had made no impression upon him he now became convinced that a conspiracy had been entered into against him and fell into an unpleasant humor this however produced very little effect upon any of us for we were all too busy to notice his whims but his sudden change of disposition made me understand how correct were the opinions of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine concerning him if i had left that island with my marriage with ruth depending upon mr endertons coöperation my prospects of future happiness would have been at the mercy of his caprices  illustration they assisted ruth to array herself  very early on a beautiful morning ruth and i started out on our wedding journey in the longboat mr enderton was made as comfortable as possible in the stern with ruth near him mrs lecks and mrs aleshine sat facing each other each with a brownpaper package by her side containing the lifepreserver on which she had arrived these were to be ever cherished as memorials of a wonderful experience the three sailors and i took turns at the oars the sea was smooth and there was every reason to believe that we should arrive at our destination before the end of the day mrs aleshine had supplied us with an abundance of provisions and with the exception of mr enderton who had not been permitted to take away any of the dusante books we were a contented party  as long as the flour held out remarked mrs aleshine id never been willin to leave that island till the dusantes came back and we could have took emily or lucille whichever it was that kept house and showed her everythin and told her just what we had done but when they do come back she added and read that letter which mr craig wrote and left for them and find out all that happened in their countryplace while they was away and how two of us was made happy for life and how two more of us meanin mrs lecks and me have give up goin to japan intendin instid of that writin to my son to come home to america and settle down in the country he ought to live inwhy then if them dusantes aint satisfied its no use for anybody to ever try to satisfy em  i should think not said mrs lecks with the weddincards on the parlor table not a speck of dust in any corner and the board money in the gingerjar  illustration     part iv  illustration   when the little party consisting of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine mr enderton my newly made wife and myself with the redbearded coxswain and the two sailormen bade farewell to that island in the pacific where so many happy hours had been passed where such pleasant friendships had been formed and where i had met my ruth and made her my wife we rowed away with a bright sky over our heads a pleasant wind behind us and a smooth sea beneath us the longboat was comfortable and well appointed and there was even room enough in it for mr enderton to stretch himself out and take a noonday nap we gave him every advantage of this kind for we had found by experience that our party was happiest when my fatherinlaw was best contented  early in the forenoon the coxswain rigged a small sail in the bow of the boat and with this aid to our steady and systematic work at the oars we reached just before nightfall the large island whither we were bound and to which by means of the coxswains pocketcompass we had steered a direct course our arrival on this island which was inhabited by some white traders and a moderate population of natives occasioned great surprise for when the boats containing the crew and passengers of our unfortunate steamer had reached the island it was found that mrs lecks mrs aleshine and myself were missing there were many suppositions as to our fate some persons thought we had been afraid to leave the steamer and having secreted ourselves on board had gone down with her others conjectured that in the darkness we had fallen overboard either from the steamer or from one of the boats and there was even a surmise that we might have embarked in the leaky small boatin which we really did leave the steamerand so had been lost at any rate we had disappeared and our loss was a good deal talked about and in a manner mourned in less than a week after their arrival the people from the steamer had been taken on board a sailingvessel and carried westward to their destination  we however were not so fortunate for we remained on this island for more than a month during this time but one ship touched there and she was western bound and of no use to us for we had determined to return to america mrs lecks and mrs aleshine had given up their journey to japan and were anxious to reach once more their country homes while my dear ruth and i were filled with a desire to found a home on some pleasant portion of the atlantic seaboard what mr enderton intended to do we did not know he was on his way to the united states when he left the leaking ship on which he and his daughter were passengers and his intentions regarding his journey did not appear to have been altered by his mishaps  by the westernbound vessel however mrs aleshine sent a letter to her son  our life on this island was monotonous and to the majority of the party uninteresting but as it was the scene of our honeymoon mrs craig and i will always look back to it with the most pleasurable recollections we were comfortably lodged in a house belonging to one of the traders and although mrs lecks and mrs aleshine had no household duties to occupy their time they managed to supply themselves with knittingmaterials from the stores on the island and filled up their hours of waiting with chatty industry the pipes of our sailor friends were always well filled while the sands of the island were warm and pleasant for their backs and it was only mr enderton who showed any signs of impatient repining at our enforced stay he growled he grumbled and he inveighed against the criminal neglect of steamship companies and the owners of sailingcraft in not making it compulsory in every one of their vessels to stop on every voyage at this island where at any time intelligent and important personages might be stranded  at last however we were taken off by a threemasted schooner bound for san francisco at which city we arrived in due time and in good health and condition  we did not remain long in this city but soon started on our way across the continent leaving behind us our three sailor companions who intended to ship from this port as soon as an advantageous opportunity offered itself these men heard no news of their vessel although they felt quite sure that she had reached honolulu where she had probably been condemned and the crew scattered as some baggage belonging to my wife and my fatherinlaw had been left on board this vessel i had hopes that mr enderton would remain in san francisco and order it forwarded to him there or that he would even take a trip to honolulu to attend to the matter personally but in this i was disappointed he seemed to take very little interest in his missing trunks and wished only to press on to the east i wrote to honolulu desiring the necessary steps to be taken to forward the baggage in case it had arrived there and soon afterward our party of five started eastward  it was now autumn but although we desired to reach the end of our journey before winter set in we felt that we had time enough to visit some of the natural wonders of the california country before taking up our direct course to the east therefore in spite of some petulant remonstrances on the part of mr enderton we made several trips to points of interest  from the last of these excursions we set out in a stagecoach of which we were the only occupants toward a point on the railroad where we expected to take a train on the way we stopped to change horses at a small stagestation at the foot of a range of mountains and when i descended from the coach i found the driver and some of the men at the station discussing the subject of our route it appeared that there were two roads one of which gradually ascended the mountain for several miles and then descended to the level of the railroad by the side of which it ran until it reached the station where we wished to take the train the other road pursued its way along a valley or notch in the mountain for a considerable distance and then by a short but somewhat steep ascending grade joined the upper road  it was growing quite cold and the sky and the wind indicated that bad weather might be expected and as the upper road was considered the better one at such a time our driver concluded to take it six horses instead of four were now attached to our stage and as two of these animals were young and unruly and promised to be unusually difficult to drive in the ordinary way our driver concluded to ride one of the wheelhorses postilion fashion and to put a boy on one of the leaders mr enderton was very much afraid of horses and objected strongly to the young animals in our new team but there were no others to take their places and his protests were disregarded  my wife and i occupied a back seat having been ordered to take this comfortable position by mrs lecks and mrs aleshine who had constituted themselves a board of instruction and admonition to mrs craig and incidentally to myself they fancied that my wifes health was not vigorous and that she needed coddling and if she had had two mothers she could not have been more tenderly cared for than by these good women they sat upon the middle seat with their faces toward the horses while mr enderton had the front seat all to himself he was however so nervous and fidgety continually twisting himself about endeavoring to get a view of the horses or of the bad places on the road that mrs lecks and mrs aleshine found that a position facing him and in close juxtaposition was entirely too uncomfortable and consequently the back of their seat being adjustable they turned themselves about and faced us  the ascent of the mountain was slow and tedious and it was late in the afternoon when we reached the highest point in our route from which the road descended for some eight miles to the level of the railroad now our pace became rapid and mr enderton grew wildly excited he threw open the window and shouted to the driver to go more slowly but mrs lecks seized him by the coat and jerked him back on his seat before he could get any answer to his appeals  if you want your daughter to ketch her death o cold youll keep that window open as she said this she leaned back and pulled the window down with her own strong right arm i guess the driver knows what he is about she continued this not bein the first time hes gone over the road  am i to understand madam said mr enderton that i am not to speak to my driver when i wish him to know my will  to this question mrs lecks made no answer but sat up very straight and stiff with her back square upon the speaker for some time she and mr enderton had been out and she made no effort to conceal the fact  mr endertons condition now became pitiable for our rapid speed and the bumping over rough places in the road seemed almost to deprive him of his wits notwithstanding my assurance that stagecoaches were generally driven at a rapid rate down long inclines in a short time however we reached a level spot in the road and the team was drawn up and stopped mr enderton popped out in a moment and i also got down to have a talk with the driver  illustration the ascent of the mountain was slow and tedious  these hosses wont do much at holdin back he said and it worries em less to let em go ahead with the wheels locked you neednt be afraid if nothin breaks were all right  mr enderton seemed endeavoring to satisfy himself that everything about the runninggear of the coach was in a safe condition he examined the wheels the axles and the whiffletrees much to the amusement of the driver who remarked to me that the old chap probably knew as much now as he did before i was rather surprised that my fatherinlaw subjected the driver to no further condemnation on the contrary he said nothing except that for the rest of this downhill drive he should take his place on the drivers unoccupied seat nobody offered any objection to this and up he climbed  when we started again ruth seemed disturbed that her father should be in such an exposed position but i assured her that he would be perfectly safe and would be much better satisfied at being able to see for himself what was going on  we now began to go downhill again at a rate as rapid as before our speed however was not equal sometimes it would slacken a little where the road was heavy or more upon a level and then we would go jolting and rattling over some long downward stretch after a particularly unpleasant descent of this kind the coach seemed suddenly to change its direction and with a twist and an uplifting of one side it bumped heavily against something and stopped i heard a great shout outside and from a window which now commanded a view of the road i saw our team of six horses with the drivers pulling and tugging at the two they rode madly running away at the top of their speed  ruth who had been thrown by the shock into the arms of mrs aleshine was dreadfully frightened and screamed for her father i had been pitched forward upon mrs lecks but i quickly recovered myself and as soon as i found that none of the occupants of the coach had been hurt i opened the door and sprang out  in the middle of the road stood mr enderton entirely uninjured with a jubilant expression on his face and in one hand a large closed umbrella  what has happened i exclaimed hurrying around to the front of the coach where i saw that the pole had been broken off about the middle of its length  nothing has happened sir replied mr enderton you cannot speak of a wise and discreet act determinately performed as a thing which has happened we have been saved sir from being dashed to pieces behind that wild and unmanageable team of horses and i will add that we have been saved by my forethought and prompt action  illustration what has happened i exclaimed  i turned and looked at him in astonishment what do you mean i said what could you have had to do with this accident  allow me to repeat said mr enderton that it was not an accident the moment that we began to go downhill i perceived that we were in a position of the greatest danger the driver was reckless the boy incompetent and the horses unmanageable as my remonstrances and counsels had no effect upon the man and as you seemed to have no desire to join me in efforts to restrain him to a more prudent rate of speed i determined to take the affair into my own hands i knew that the first thing to be done was to rid ourselves of those horses so long as we were connected with them disaster was imminent i knew exactly what ought to be done the horses must be detached from the coach i had read sir of inventions especially intended to detach runaway horses from a vehicle to all intents and purposes our horses were runaways or would have become so in a very short time i now made it my object to free ourselves from those horses  what i exclaimed you freed us  yes sir he answered i did i got out at our first stop and thoroughly examined the carriage attachments i found that the movable bar to which the whiffletrees were attached was connected to the vehicle by two straps and a bolt the latter having a ring at the top and an iron nut at the bottom while you and that reckless driver were talking together and paying no attention to me the only person in the party who thoroughly comprehended our danger i unbuckled those straps and with my strong nervous fingers without the aid of implements i unscrewed the nut from the bolt then sir i took my seat on the outside of the coach and felt that i held our safety in my own hands for a time i allowed our vehicle to proceed but when we approached this long slope which stretches before us and our horses showed signs of increasing impetuosity i leaned forward hooked the handle of my umbrella in the ring of the bolt and with a mighty effort jerked it out i admit to you sir that i had overlooked the fact that the horses were also attached to the end of the pole but i have often noticed that when we are discreet in judgment and prompt in action we are also fortunate thus was i fortunate the hindermost horses suddenly released rushed upon those in front of them and in a manner jumbled up the whole team which seemed to throw the animals into such terror that they dashed to one side and snapped off the pole after which they went madly tearing down the road entirely beyond the control of the two riders our coach turned and ran into the side of the road with but a moderate concussion and as i looked at those flying steeds with their riders vainly endeavoring to restrain them i could not sir keep down an emotion of pride that i had been instrumental in freeing myself my daughter and my traveling companions from their dangerous proximity  the speaker ceased a smile of conscious merit upon his face for the moment i could not say a word to him i was so angry but had i been able to say or do anything to indicate the wild indignation that filled my brain i should have had no opportunity for mrs lecks stepped up to me and took me by the arm her face was very stern and her expression gave one the idea of the rigidity of bessemer steel  ive heard what has been said she remarked and i wish to talk to this man your wife is over there with mrs aleshine will you please take a walk with her along the road you may stay away for a quarter of an hour  madam said mr enderton i do not wish to talk to you  i didnt ask you whether you did or not said mrs lecks mr craig will you please get your wife away as quick and as far as you can  i took the hint and with ruth on my arm walked rapidly down the road she was very glad to go for she had been much frightened and wanted to be alone with me to have me explain to her what had occurred mrs lecks imagining from the expression of his countenance that mr enderton had in some way been at the bottom of the trouble and fearing that she should not be able to restrain her indignation when she found how he had done it had ordered mrs aleshine to keep ruth away from her father this action had increased the poor girls anxiety and she was glad enough to have me take her away and tell her all about our accident  i did tell her all that had happened speaking as mildly as i could of mr endertons conduct poor ruth burst into tears  i do wish she exclaimed that father would travel by himself he is so nervous and so easily frightened that i am sure he would be happier when he could attend to his safety in his own way and i know too that we should be happier without him  i agreed most heartily with these sentiments although i did not deem it necessary to say so and ruth now asked me what i supposed would become of us  if nothing happens to the driver and the boy i replied i suppose they will go on until they get to the station to which we were bound and there they will procure a pole if such a thing can be found or perhaps get another coach and come back for us it would be useless for them to return to our coach in its present condition  and how soon do you think they will come back she said  not for some hours i replied the driver told me there were no houses between the place where we last stopped and the railroadstation and i am sure he will not turn back until he reaches a place where he can get either a new pole or another vehicle  ruth and i walked to a turn at the bottom of the long hill down which our runaway steeds had sped at this point we had an extended view of the road as it wound along the mountainside but we could see no signs of our horses nor of any living thing i did not in fact expect to see our team for it would be foolish in the driver to come back until he was prepared to do something for us and even if he had succeeded in controlling the runaway beasts the quicker he got down the mountain the better  by the time we had returned we had taken quite a long walk but we were glad of it for the exercise tranquilized us both on our way back we noticed that a road which seemed to come up from below us joined the one we were on a short distance from the place where our accident occurred this probably was the lower road which had been spoken of when we changed horses  we found mr enderton standing by himself his face was of the hue of woodashes his expression haggard he reminded me of a man who had fallen from a considerable height and who had been frightened and stupefied by the shock i comprehended the situation without difficulty and felt quite sure that had he had the choice he would have much preferred a thrashing to the plain talk he had heard from mrs lecks  what is the matter father exclaimed ruth were you hurt  mr enderton looked in a dazed way at his daughter and it was some moments before he appeared to have heard what she said then he answered abruptly hurt oh no i am not hurt in the least i was just thinking of something i shall walk on to the village or town whichever it is to which that man was taking us it cannot be more than seven or eight miles away if that the road is downhill and i can easily reach the place before nightfall i will then personally attend to your rescue and will see that a vehicle is immediately sent to you there is no trusting these ignorant drivers no he continued deprecatingly raising his hand do not attempt to dissuade me your safety and that of others is always my first care exertion is nothing  without further words and paying no attention to the remonstrances of his daughter he strode off down the road  i was very glad to see him go at any time his presence was undesirable to me and under the present circumstances it would be more objectionable than ever he was a good walker and there was no doubt he would easily reach the station where he might possibly be of some use to us  mrs lecks was sitting on a stone by the roadside her face was still stern and rigid but there was an expression of satisfaction upon it which had not been there when i left her ruth went to the coach to get a shawl and i said to mrs lecks  i suppose you had your talk with mr enderton  illustration mrs lecks was sitting on a stone  talk she replied i should say so if ever a man understands what people think of him and knows what he is from his crown to his feet inside and outside soul body bones and skin and what he may expect in this world and the next he knows it i didnt keep to what he has done for us this day i went back to the first moment when he began to growl at payin his honest board on the island and i didnt let him off for a single sin that he has committed since and now i feel that ive done my duty as far as he is concerned and havin got through with that its time we were lookin about to see what we can do for ourselves  it was indeed time for the day was drawing toward its close for a moment i had thought we would give mr enderton a good start and then follow him down the mountain to the station but a little reflection showed me that this plan would not answer ruth was not strong enough to walk so far and although mrs aleshine had plenty of vigor she was too plump to attempt such a tramp besides the sky was so heavily overcast that it was not safe to leave the shelter of the coach  as might have been expected mrs lecks and mrs aleshine took immediate charge of the personal comfort of the party and the first thing they did was to make preparations for a meal fortunately we had plenty of provisions mrs aleshine had had charge of what she called our lunchbasketswhich were indeed much more like marketbaskets than anything elseand having small faith in the resources of roadside taverns and great faith in the unlimited capabilities of mr enderton in the matter of consuming food on a journey she had provided bounteously and even extravagantly  one side of the road was bordered by a forest and on the ground was an abundance of dead wood i gathered a quantity of this and made a fire which was very grateful to us for the air was growing colder and colder when we had eaten a substantial supper and had thoroughly warmed ourselves at the fire we got into the coach to sit there and wait until relief should come we sat for a long timeall night in fact we were not uncomfortable for we each had a corner of the coach and we were plentifully provided with wraps and rugs  contrary to their usual habit mrs lecks and mrs aleshine did not talk much when subjected to the annoyances of an ordinary accident even if it should have been the result of carelessness their disposition would have prompted them to take events as they came and to make the best of whatever might happen to them but this case was entirely different we were stranded and abandoned on the road on the side of a lonely desolate mountain on a cold bleak night and all this was the result of what they considered the deliberate and fiendish act of a man who was afraid of horses and who cared for no one in the world but himself their minds were in such a condition that if they said anything they must vituperate and they were so kindly disposed toward my wife and had such a tender regard for her feelings that they would not in her presence vituperate her father so they said very little and nestling into their corners were soon asleep  after a time ruth followed their example and though i was very anxiously watching out of the window for an approaching light and listening for the sound of wheels i too fell into a doze it must have been ten or eleven oclock when i was awakened by some delicate but cold touches on my face the nature of which when i first opened my eyes i could not comprehend but i soon understood what these cold touches meant the window in the door of the coach on my side had been slightly lowered from the top to give us air and through the narrow aperture the cold particles had come floating in i looked through the window the night was not very dark for although the sky was overcast the moon was in its second quarter and i could plainly see that it was snowing and that the ground was already white  this discovery sent a chill into my soul for i was not unfamiliar with snows in mountain regions and knew well what this might mean to us but there was nothing that we could now do and it would be useless and foolish to awaken my companions and distress them with this new disaster besides i thought our situation might not be so very bad after all it was not yet winter and the snowfall might prove to be but a light one i gently closed the window and made my body comfortable in its corner but my mind continued very uncomfortable for i do not know how long  when i awoke i found that there had been a heavy fall of snow in the night and that the flakes were still coming down thick and fast when ruth first looked out upon the scene she was startled and dismayed she was not accustomed to storms of this kind and the snow frightened her upon mrs lecks and mrs aleshine the sight of the storm produced an entirely different effect here was a difficulty a discomfort a hardship but it came in a natural way and not by the hand of a dastardly coward of a man with naturalhappening difficulties they were accustomed to combat without fear or repining they knew all about snow and were not frightened by this storm the difficulties which it presented to their minds actually raised their spirits and from the grim and quiet beings of the last evening they became the same cheerful dauntless ready women that i had known before  upon my word exclaimed mrs aleshine as she clapped her face to a window of the coach if this isnt a reglar oldfashioned snowstorm ive shoveled my own way through many a one like it to git to the barn to do my milkin afore the menfolks had begun makin paths and i feel jus like as though i could do it agin  now barbry aleshine said mrs lecks if youre thinkin of shovelin your way from this place to where your cows is youd better step right out and get at it and i really do think that if you felt they were sufferin for want of milkin youd make a start  i dont say answered mrs aleshine with an illuminating grin that if the case was that way i mightnt have the hankerin though not the capableness but i dont know that theres any place to shovel our way to jus now  mrs lecks and i thought differently across the road under the great trees the ground was comparatively free from snow and in some places owing to the heavy evergreen foliage it was entirely bare it was very desirable that we should get to one of these spots and build a fire for though we had been well wrapped up we all felt numbed and cold in the boot at the back of the coach i knew that there was an ax and i thought i might possibly find there a shovel i opened the coach door and saw that the snow was already above the lower step by standing on the spokes of the back wheel i could easily get at the boot and i soon pulled out the ax but found no shovel but this did not deter me i made my way to the front wheel and climbed up to the drivers box where i knocked off one of the thin planks of the footboard and this with the ax i shaped into a rude shovel with a handle rather too wide but serviceable with this i went vigorously to work and soon had made a pathway across the road here i chopped off some low dead branches picked up others and soon had a crackling fire around which my three companions gathered with delight  a strong wind was now blowing and the snow began to form into heavy drifts the fire was very cheery and pleasant but the wind was cutting and we soon returned to the shelter of the coach where we had our breakfast this was not altogether a cold meal for mrs aleshine had provided a little teakettle and with some snowwater which i brought in boiling from the fire in the woods we had all the hot and comforting tea we wanted  we passed the morning waiting and looking out and wondering what sort of conveyance would be sent for us it was generally agreed that nothing on wheels could now be got over the road and that we must be taken away in a sleigh  i like sleighridin said mrs aleshine if youre well wrapped up with good hosses and a hot brick for your feet but i must say i dont know but what im goin to be a little skeery goin down these long hills if we git fairly slidin hosses sleigh and all together theres no knowin where well fetch up  illustration i soon had a crackling fire  theres one comfort barbry remarked mrs lecks and that is that when we do fetch up itll be at the bottom of the hills and not at the top and as the bottom is what we want to get to we oughtnt to complain  that depends a good deal whether we come down hind part foremost or fore part front but nobodys complainin so fur specially as the sleigh isnt here  i joined in the outlooking and the conjectures but i could not keep up the cheerful courage which animated my companions for not only were the two elder women bright and cheery but ruth seemed to be animated and encouraged by their example and showed herself as brave and contented as either of them she was convinced that her father must have reached the railroadstation before it began to snow and therefore she was troubled by no fears for his safety but my mind was filled with many fears  the snow was still coming down thick and fast and the wind was piling it into great drifts one of which was forming between the coach and a low embankment on that side of the road near which it stood  about every halfhour i took my shovel and cleared out the path across the road from the other side of the coach to the woods several times after doing this i made my way among the trees where the snow did not impede my progress to points from which i had a view some distance down the mountain and i could plainly see that there were several places where the road was blocked up by huge snowdrifts it would be a slow laborious and difficult undertaking for any reliefparty to come to us from the station and who was there at that place to come this was the question which most troubled me the settlement at the station was probably a very small one and that there should be found at that place a sleigh or a sled with enough men to form a party sufficiently strong to open a road up the mountainside was scarcely to be expected men and vehicles might be obtained at some point farther along the railroad but action of this kind would require time and it was not unlikely that the railroad itself was blocked up with snow i could form no idea satisfactory to myself of any plan by which relief could come to us that day even the advent of a messenger on horseback was not to be expected such an adventurer would be lost in the storm and among the drifts on the morrow relief might come but i did not like to think too much about the morrow and of any of my thoughts and fears i said nothing to my companions  at intervals after i had freshly cleared out the pathway the three women well bundled up ran across the road to the fire under the trees this was the only way in which they could keep themselves warm for the coach although it protected us from the storm was a very cold place to sit in but the wind and the snow which frequently drove in under the trees made it impossible to stay very long by the fire and the frequent passages to and from the coach were attended with much exposure and wetting of feet i therefore determined that some better way must be devised for keeping ourselves warm and shortly after our noonday meal i thought of a plan and immediately set to work to carry it out  the drift between the coach and the embankment had now risen higher than the top of the vehicle against one side of which it was tightly packed i dug a path around the back of the coach and then began to tunnel into the huge bank of snow in about an hour i had made an excavation nearly high enough for me to stand in and close to the stage door on that side and i cleared away the snow so that this door could open into the cavern i had formed at the end opposite the entrance of my cave i worked a hole upward until i reached the outer air this hole was about a foot in diameter and for some time the light unpacked snow from above kept falling and filling it up but i managed by packing and beating the sides with my shovel to get the whole into a condition in which it would retain the form of a rude chimney  now i hurried to bring wood and twigs and having made a hearth of green sticks which i cut with my ax i built a fire in this snowy fireplace mrs lecks mrs aleshine and ruth had been watching my proceedings with great interest and when the fire began to burn and the smoke to go out of my chimney the coach door was opened and the genial heat gradually pervaded the vehicle  upon my word exclaimed mrs aleshine if that isnt one of the brightest ideas i ever heard of a fire in the middle of a snowbank with a man there attendin to it an a chimney t isnt every day that you can see a thing like that  i should hope not remarked mrs lecks for if the snow drifted this way every day id be ready to give up the seein business out and out but i think mr craig you ought to pass that shovel in to us so that we can dig you out when the fire begins to melt your little house and it all caves in on you  you can have the shovel said i but i dont believe this snowbank will cave in on me of course the heat will melt the snow but i think it will dissolve gradually so that the caving in if there is any wont be of much account and then we shall have a big open space here in which we can keep up our fire  oh dear exclaimed ruth you talk as if you expected to stay here ever so long and we certainly cant do that we should starve to death for one thing  dont be afraid of that said mrs aleshine theres plenty of victuals to last till the people come for us when i pack baskets for travelin or picnickin i dont do no scrimpin an weve got to keep up a fire you know for it wouldnt be pleasant for those men when theyve cut a way up the mountain to git at us to find us all froze stiff  mrs lecks smiled youre awful tender of the feelins of other people barbry she said and a heart as warm as yourn ought to keep from freezin  which it has done so far said mrs aleshine complacently  as i had expected the water soon began to drip from the top and the sides of my cavern and the chimney rapidly enlarged its dimensions i made a passage for the melted snow to run off into a hollow back of the coach and as i kept up a good strong fire the drops of water and occasional pieces of snow which fell into it were not able to extinguish it the cavern enlarged rapidly and in a little more than an hour the roof became so thin that while i was outside collecting wood it fell in and extinguished the fire this accident however interrupted my operations but for a short time i cleared away the snow at the bottom of the excavation and rebuilt my fire on the bare ground the high snow walls on three sides of it protected it from the wind so that there was no danger of the flames being blown against the stagecoach while the large open space above allowed a free vent for the smoke  about the middle of the afternoon to the great delight of us all it stopped snowing and when i had freshly shoveled out the path across the road my companions gladly embraced the opportunity of walking over to the comparatively protected ground under the trees and giving themselves a little exercise during their absence i was busily engaged in arranging the fire when i heard a low crunching sound on one side of me and turning my head i saw in the wall of my excavation opposite to the stagecoach and at a distance of four or five feet from the ground an irregular hole in the snow about a foot in diameter from which protruded the head of a man this head was wrapped with the exception of the face in a brown woolen comforter the features were those of a man of about fifty a little sallow and thin without beard whiskers or mustache although the cheeks and chin were darkened with a recent growth  the astounding apparition of this head projecting itself from the snow wall of my cabin utterly paralyzed me so that i neither moved nor spoke but remained crouching by the fire my eyes fixed upon the head it smiled a little and then spoke  could you lend me a small iron pot it said  i rose to my feet almost ready to run away was this a dream or was it possible that there was a race of beings who inhabited snowbanks  the face smiled again very pleasantly do not be frightened it said i saw you were startled and spoke first of a familiar pot in order to reassure you  who in the name of heaven are you i gasped  i am only a traveler sir said the head who has met with an accident similar i imagine to that which has befallen you but i cannot further converse with you in this position lying thus on my breast in a tunnel of snow will injuriously chill me could you conveniently lend me an iron pot  illustration could you lend me a small iron pot  i was now convinced that this was an ordinary human being and my courage and senses returned to me but my astonishment remained boundless before we talk of pots i said i must know who you are and how you got into that snowbank  i do not believe said my visitor that i can get down head foremost to your level i will therefore retire to my place of refuge and perhaps we can communicate with each other through this aperture  can i get through to your place of refuge i asked  certainly was the answer you are young and active and the descent will not be so deep on my side but i will first retire and will then project toward you this sheepskin rug which if kept under you as you move forward will protect your breast and arms from direct contact with the snow  it was difficult to scramble up into the hole but i succeeded in doing it and found awaiting me the sheepskin rug which by the aid of an umbrella the man had pushed toward me for my use i was in a horizontal tunnel barely large enough for the passage of my body and about six feet in length when i had worked my way through this and had put my head out of the other end i looked into a small wooden shed into which light entered only through a pane of glass set in a rude door opposite to me i immediately perceived that the whole place was filled with the odor of spirituous liquors the man stood awaiting me and by his assistance i descended to the floor as i did so i heard something which sounded like a titter and looking around i saw in a corner a bundle of clothes and travelingrugs near the top of which appeared a pair of eyes turning again i could discern in another corner a second bundle similar to but somewhat larger than the other  these ladies are traveling with me said the man who was now wrapping about him a large cloak and who appeared to be of a tall though rather slender figure his manner and voice were those of a gentleman extremely courteous and considerate as i am sure you are curiousand this i regard as quite natural sirto know why we are here i will at once proceed to inform you we started yesterday in a carriage for the railwaystation which is i believe some miles beyond this point there were two roads from the last place at which we stopped and we chose the one which ran along a valley and which we supposed would be the pleasanter of the two we there engaged a pair of horses which did not prove very serviceable animals and at a point about a hundred yards from where we now are one of them gave out entirely the driver declared that the only thing to be done was to turn loose the disabled horse which would be certain in time to find his way back to his stable and for him to proceed on the other animal to the station to which we were going where he would procure some fresh horses and return as speedily as possible to this plan we were obliged to consent as there was no alternative he told us that if we did not care to remain in the carriage there was a shed by the side of the road a little farther on which was erected for the accommodation of men who are sometimes here in charge of relays of horses after assuring us that he would not be absent more than three hours he rode away and we have not seen him since  soon after he left us i came to this shed and finding it tight and comparatively comfortable i concluded it would give us relief from our somewhat cramped position in the carriage and so conducted the ladies here as night drew on it became very cold and i determined to make a fire a proceeding which of course would have been impossible in a vehicle fortunately i had with me at the back of the carriage a case of california brandy by the aid of a stone i knocked the top off this case and brought hither several of the bottles i found in the shed an old tin pan which i filled with the straw coverings of the bottles and on this i poured brandy which being ignited produced a fire without smoke but which as we gathered around it gave out considerable heat  as the speaker thus referred to his fuel i understood the reason of the strong odor of spirits which filled the shed and i experienced a certain relief in my mind  the gentleman continued at first i attributed the delay of the drivers return to those ordinary hindrances which so frequently occur in rural and outoftheway places but after a time i could not imagine any reasonable cause for his delay as it began to grow dark i brought here our provisionbaskets and we partook of a slight repast i then made the ladies as comfortable as possible and awaited with much anxiety the return of the driver  after a time it began to snow and feeling that the storm might interrupt communication with the carriage i brought hither making many trips for the purpose the rest of the brandy our wraps and rugs and the cushions of the carriage i did not believe that we should be left here all night but thought it prudent to take all precautions and to prepare for remaining in a place where we could have a fire the morning showed me that i had acted wisely as you know sir i found the road in each direction completely blocked up by snow and i have since been unable to visit the carriage  have you not all suffered from cold i inquired have you food enough  i will not say replied the gentleman that in addition to our anxiety we have not suffered somewhat from cold but for the greater part of this day i have adopted a plan which has resulted in considerable comfort to my companions i have wrapped them up very closely and warmly and they hold in each hand a hardboiled egg i thought it better to keep these for purposes of warmth than to eat them about every halfhour i reboil the eggs in a little traveling teapot which we have they retain their warmth for a considerable period and this warmth in a moderate degree is communicated through the hands to the entire person  as he said this a low laugh again burst forth from the bundle in one corner of the room and i could not help smiling at this odd way of keeping warm i looked toward the jocose bundle and remarked that the eggs must be pretty hard by this time  these ladies said the gentleman are not accustomed to the cold atmosphere of this region and i have therefore forbidden them to talk hoping thus to prevent injury from the inhalation of frosty air so far we have not suffered and we still have some food left about noon i noticed smoke floating over this shed and i forced open the door and made my way for some little distance outside hoping to discover whence it came i then heard voices on the other side of the enormous snowdrift behind us but i could see no possible way of getting over the drift feeling that i must without fail open communication with any human beings who might be near us i attempted to shout but the cold had so affected my voice that i could not do so i thereupon set my wits to work at the back of this shed is a small window closed by a wooden shutter i opened this shutter and found outside a wall of snow packed closely against it the snow was not very hard and i believed that it would not be difficult to tunnel a way through it to the place where the voices seemed to be i immediately set to work for i feared that if we were obliged to remain here another night without assistance we should be compelled tomorrow morning to eat those four hardboiled eggs which the ladies are holding and which very shortly i must boil again  how did you manage to cut through the snow i asked had you a shovel  oh no replied the other i used the tin pan i found it answered very well as a scoop each time that i filled it i threw the contents out of our door  it must have been slow and difficult work i said  indeed it was he replied the labor was arduous and occupied me several hours but when i saw a respectable man at a fire and a stagecoach near by i felt rewarded for all my trouble may i ask you sir how you came to be thus snowbound  i then briefly related the circumstances of our mishap and had scarcely finished when a shrill sound came through the tunnel into the shed it was the voice of mrs aleshine  hello she screamed are you in there an you dont mean to tell me there are other people in that hole  feeling quite certain that my wife and her companions were in a state of mental agitation on the other side of the drift i called back that i would be with them in a moment and then explained to the gentleman why i could not remain with him longer but before i go i said is there anything i can do for you do you really want an iron pot  the food that remains to us he answered is fragmentary and rather distasteful to the ladies and i thought if i could make a little stew of it it might prove more acceptable to them but do not let me detain you another instant from your friends and i advise you to go through that tunnel feet foremost for you might otherwise experience difficulties in getting out at the other end  i accepted his suggestion and by his assistance and the help of the rough windowframe i got into the hole feet first and soon ejected myself into the midst of my alarmed companions when they heard where i had been and what i had seen they were naturally astounded  another party deserted at this very point exclaimed ruth who was both excitable and imaginative this looks like a conspiracy are we to be robbed and murdered  at these words mrs aleshine sprang toward me mr craig she exclaimed if its robbers dont lose a minute never let em get ahead of you pull out your pistol and fire through the hole  gracious me barbry aleshine said mrs lecks you dont suppose the robbers is them poor unfortunates on the other side of the drift and i must say mrs craig that if there was any such thing as a conspiracy your father must have been in it for it was him who landed us just here but of course none of us supposes nothin of that kind and the first thing weve got to think of is what we can do for them poor people  they seem to have some food left but not much i said and i fear they must be suffering from cold  couldnt we poke some wood to them through this hole said mrs aleshine whose combative feelings had changed to the deepest compassion i should think they must be nearly froze with nothin to warm em but hardbiled eggs  i explained that there was no place in their shed where they could build a fire and proposed that we should give them some hot tea and some of our provisions  thats so said mrs aleshine just shout in to them that if theyll shove them eggs through the hole ill bile em fur em as often as they want em  ive just got to say this ejaculated mrs lecks as she and mrs aleshine were busily placing a portion of our now very much reduced stock of provisions in the smallest of our baskets this is the first time in my life that i ever heard of people warmin themselves up with hens eggs and spirits excep when mixed up into eggnog and that they resisted that temptation and contented themselves with plain honest heat though very little of it shows what kind of people they must be and now do you suppose we could slide this basket in without upsettin the little kittle  illustration we were about to send him a basket  i called to the gentleman that we were about to send him a basket and then by the aid of an umbrella i gently pushed it through the snow tunnel to a point where he could reach it hearty thanks came back to us through the hole and when the basket and kettle were returned we prepared our own evening meal  for the life of me said mrs lecks as she sipped a cup of tea i cant imagine if there was a shed so near us why we didnt know it  that has been puzzling me i replied but the other road on which the shed is built is probably lower than this one so that the upper part of the shed could not have projected far above the embankment between the two roads and if there were weeds and dead grasses on the bank as there probably were they would have prevented us from noticing the top of a weatherworn shed  especially said mrs lecks as we wasnt lookin for sheds and as far as i know we wasnt lookin for anything on that side of the coach for all my eyes was busy starin about on the side we got in and out of and down the road  which mine was too added mrs aleshine an after it begun to snow we couldnt see nothin anyhow particlarly when everything was all covered up  well added mrs lecks in conclusion as we didnt see the shed its a comfort to think there was reasons for it and that we are not born fools  it was now growing dark and but few further communications took place through the little tunnel  before we get ready to go to sleep said mrs aleshine for havin no candles i guess we wont sit up late hadnt we better rig up some kind of a little sled to put in that hole with strings at both ends so that we kin send in mustardplasters and peppermint to them poor people if they happen to be sick in the night  this little project was not considered necessary and after receiving assurances from the gentleman on the other side that he would be able to keep his party warm until morning we bade each other good night and after having replenished the fire i got into the stage where my companions had already established themselves in their corners i slept very little while i frequently went out to attend to the fire and my mind was racked by the most serious apprehensions our food was nearly gone and if relief did not come to us very soon i could see nothing but a slow death before us and so far as i could imagine there was no more reason to expect succor on the following day than there had been on the one just passed where were the men to be found who could cut a road to us through those miles of snowdrifts  very little was said during the night by my companions but i am sure that they felt the seriousness of our situation and that their slumbers were broken and unrefreshing if there had been anything to do mrs lecks and mrs aleshine would have been cheered up by the prospect of doing it but we all felt that there was nothing we could do  illustration     part v  illustration   after a second night spent in the stagecoach on that lonely and desolate mountain road where we were now snowbound i arose early in the morning and went into the forest to collect some fuel and while thus engaged i made the discovery that the snow was covered with a hard crust which would bear my weight after the storm had ceased the day before the sun had shone brightly and the temperature had moderated very much so that the surface of the snow had slightly thawed during the night it became cold again and this surface froze into a hard coating of ice when i found i could walk where i pleased my spirits rose and i immediately set out to view the situation the aspect of the road gave me no encouragement the snowfall had been a heavy one but had it not been for the high wind which accompanied it it would have thrown but moderate difficulties in the way of our rescue reaching a point which commanded a considerable view along the side of the mountain i could see that in many places the road was completely lost to sight on account of the great snowdrifts piled up on it i then walked to the point where the two roads met and crossing over i climbed a slight rise in the ground which had cut off my view in this direction and found myself in a position from which i could look directly down the side of the mountain below the road  here the mountainside which i had supposed to be very steep and rugged descended in a long and gradual slope to the plains below and for the greater part of the distance was covered by a smooth shining surface of frozen snow unbroken by rock or tree this snowy slope apparently extended for a mile or more and then i could see that it gradually blended itself into the greenishbrown turf of the lower country down in the valley there still were leaves upon the trees and there were patches of verdure over the land the storm which had piled its snows up here had given them rain down there and had freshened everything it was like looking down into another climate and on another land i saw a little smoke coming up behind a patch of trees it must be that there was a house there could it be possible that we were within a mile or two of a human habitation yet what comfort was there in that thought the people in that house could not get to us nor we to them nor could they have heard of our situation for the point where our road reached the lower country was miles farther on  as i stood thus and gazed it seemed to me that i could make a run and slide down the mountainside into green fields into safety into life i remembered those savage warriors who looking from the summits of the alps upon the fertile plains of italy seated themselves upon their shields and slid down to conquest and rich spoils  an idea came into my mind and i gave it glad welcome there was no time to be lost the sun was not yet high but it was mounting in a clear sky and should its rays become warm enough to melt the crust on which i stood our last chance of escape would be gone to plow our way to any place through deep soft snow would be impossible i hurried back to our coach and found three very grave women standing around the fire they were looking at a small quantity of food at the bottom of a large basket  thats every crumb there is left said mrs aleshine to me and when we pass in some to them unfortunates on the other side of the driftwhich of course were bound to dowell have what i call a skimpy meal and thats not the worst of it until somebody gets up to us it will be our last meal  i took my poor ruth by the hand for she was looking very pale and troubled and i said my dear friends nobody can get up to this place for a long long time and before help could possibly reach us we should all be dead but do not be frightened it is not necessary to wait for any one to come to us the snow is now covered with a crust which will bear our weight i have thought of a way in which we can slide down the mountainside which from a spot where i have been standing this morning is no steeper than some coastinghills though very much longer in a few minutes we can pass from this region of snow where death from cold and starvation must soon overtake us to a grassy valley where there is no snow and where we shall be within walking distance of a house in which people are living  ruth grasped my arm will it be safe she exclaimed  i think so i answered i see no reason why we should meet with any accident at any rate it is much safer than remaining here for another hour for if the crust melts our last chance is gone  mr craig said mrs lecks me and mrs aleshine is no hands at coastin downhill havin given up that sort of thing since we was little girls with short frocks and it didnt make no matter anyway but you know more about these things than we do and if you say we can get out of this dreadful place by slidin downhill were ready to follow if youll just go ahead we followed you through the ocean with nothin between our feet and the bottom but miles o water and nobody knows what sorts of dreadful fish and when you say its the right way to save our lives were ready to follow you again and as for you mrs ruth dont you be frightened i dont know what were goin to slide on but whatever it is even if its our own selves me and mrs aleshine will take you between us and if anything is run against well get the bumps and not you  i was delighted to see how rapidly my proposition was accepted and we made a hasty breakfast first sending in some of our food to the other party the gentleman reported through the hole of communication that they were all fairly well but a good deal stiffened by cold and want of exercise he inquired in a very anxious voice if i had discovered any signs of approaching relief to this i replied that i had devised a plan by which we could get ourselves out of our present dangerous situation and that in a very short time i would come round to the door of his shedfor i could now walk on the crusted snowand tell him about it he answered that these words cheered his heart and that he would do everything possible to coöperate with me  i now went to work vigorously i took the cushions from the coach four of them all together and carried them to the brink of the slope down which i purposed to make our descent i also conveyed thither a long coil of rawhide rope which i had previously discovered in the boot of the coach i then hurried along the other road which as has been said before lay at a somewhat lower level than the one we were on and when i reached the shed i found the door had been opened and the gentleman with his tin pan had scooped away a good deal of the snow about it so as to admit of a moderately easy passage in and out he met me outside and grasped my hand  sir if you have a plan to propose he said state it quickly we are in a position of great danger those two ladies inside the shed cannot much longer endure this exposure and i presume that the ladies in your partyalthough their voices which i occasionally hear do not seem to indicate itmust be in a like condition  i replied that so far my companions had borne up very well and without further waste of words proceeded to unfold my plan of escape  when he had heard it the gentleman put on a very serious expression it seems hazardous he said but it may be the only way out of our danger will you show me the point from which you took your observations  yes said i but we must be in haste the sun is getting up in the sky and this crust may soon begin to melt it is not yet really winter you know  we stepped quickly to the spot where i had carried the cushions the gentleman stood and silently gazed first at the blockedup roadway then at the long smooth slope of the mountainside directly beneath us and then at the verdure of the plain below which had grown greener under the increasing brightness of the day sir said he turning to me there is nothing to be done but to adopt your plan or to remain here and die we will accompany you in the descent and i place myself under your orders  the first thing said i is to bring here your carriage cushions and help me to arrange them  when he had brought the three cushions from the shed the gentleman and i proceeded to place them with the others on the snow so that the whole formed a sort of wide and nearly square mattress then with the rawhide rope we bound them together in a rough but secure network of cordage in this part of the work i found my companion very apt and skilful  when this rude mattress was completed i requested the gentleman to bring his ladies to the place while i went for mine  what are we to pack up to take with us said mrs aleshine when i reached our coach  we take nothing at all said i but the money in our pockets and our rugs and wraps everything else must be left in the coach to be brought down to us when the roads shall be cleared out  with our rugs and shawls on our arms we left the coach and as we were crossing the other road we saw the gentleman and his companions approaching these ladies were very much wrapped up but one of them seemed to step along lightly and without difficulty while the other moved slowly and was at times assisted by the gentleman  a breeze had sprung up which filled the air with fine frozen particles blown from the uncrusted beds of snow along the edge of the forest and i counseled ruth to cover up her mouth and breathe as little of this snow powder as possible  if im to go coastin at all said mrs aleshine id as lief do it with strangers as friends and a little liefer for that matter if theres any bones to be broken but i must say that id like to make the acquaintance of them ladies afore i git on to the sled whichat that moment catching sight of the mattressyou dont mean to say that thats it  barbry aleshine said mrs lecks from underneath her great woolen comforter if you want to get your lungs friz youd better go on talkin manners is manners but they can wait till we get to the bottom of the hill  notwithstanding this admonition i noticed that as soon as the two parties met both mrs lecks and mrs aleshine advanced and shook hands with the ladies who had been their neighbors under such peculiar circumstances and that mrs lecks herself expressed a muffled hope that they might all get down safely  i now pushed the mattress which was to serve as our sled as close as was prudent to the edge of the descent and requested the party to seat themselves upon it without hesitation mrs lecks and mrs aleshine sat down taking ruth between them as they had promised to do my young wife was very nervous but the cool demeanor of her companions and my evident belief in the practicability of the plan gave her courage and she quietly took her seat the younger of the two strange ladies stepped lightly on the cushions and before seating herself stood up for a good look at the farextending bed of snow over which we were to take our way the prospect did not appear to deter her and she sat down promptly and with an air that seemed to say that she anticipated a certain enjoyment from the adventure the elder lady however exhibited very different emotions she shrank back from the cushions toward which the gentleman was conducting her and turned her face away from the declivity her companion assured her that it was absolutely necessary that we should descend from the mountain in this way for there was no other and asserting his belief that our slide would be a perfectly safe one he gently drew her to the mattress and induced her to sit down  i now noticed for the first time that the gentleman carried under one arm and covered by his long cloak a large package of some sort and i immediately said to him it will be very imprudent for us to attempt to carry any of our property except what we can put in our pockets or wrap around us everything else should be left here either in your carriage or our coach and i have no fear that anything will be lost but even if our luggage were in danger of being molested we cannot afford to consider it under circumstances such as these  my dear sir said the gentleman speaking very gravely i appreciate the hazards of our position as keenly as yourself our valises and all the light luggage which we had with us in our carriage i have left there and shall not give them another thought but with the parcel i hold under this arm i cannot part and if i go down the mountainside on these cushions it must go with me if you refuse in such a case to allow me to be one of your party i must remain behind and endeavor to find a board or something else on which i can make the descent of the mountain  he spoke courteously but with an air of decision which showed me that it would be of no use to argue with him besides there was no time for parleying and if this gentleman chose to take his chances with but one arm at liberty it was no longer my affair i therefore desired him to sit down and i arranged the company so that they sat back to back their feet drawn up to the edge of the mattress i then took the place which had been reserved for me as steersman and having tied several shawls together end to end i passed them around the whole of us under our arms thus binding us all firmly together i felt that one of our greatest dangers would be that one or more of the party might slip from the mattress during the descent  when all was ready i asked the gentleman who with the elder lady sat near me at the back of the mattress to assist in giving us a start by pushing outward with his heels while i thrust the handle of my wooden shovel into the crust and thus pushed the mattress forward the starting was a little difficult but in a minute or two we had pushed the mattress partly over the brink and then after a few more efforts we began to slide downward  the motion at first slow suddenly became quite rapid and i heard behind me a cry or exclamation from whom i knew not but i felt quite sure it did not come from any of my party i hoped to be able to make some use of my shovel in the guidance of our unwieldy raft or mattresssled but i soon found this impossible and down we went over the smooth hardfrozen slope with nothing to direct our course but the varying undulations of the mountainside every moment we seemed to go faster and faster and soon we began to revolve so that sometimes i was in front and sometimes behind once when passing over a very smooth sheet of snow we fairly spun around so that in every direction feet were flying out from a common center and heels grating on the frozen crust but there were no more cries or exclamations each one of us grasped the cordage which held the cushions together and the rapidity of the motion forced us almost to hold our breath  down the smooth white slope we sped as a bird skims through the air it seemed to me as if we passed over miles and miles of snow sometimes my face was turned down the mountain where the snowsurface seemed to stretch out illimitably and then it was turned upward toward the apparently illimitable slopes over which we had passed  illustration we began to slide downward  presently my position now being in front of the little group that glanced along its glittering way i saw at some distance below me a long rise or terrace which ran along the mountainside for a considerable distance and which cut off our view of everything below us as we approached this hillock the descent became much more gradual and our progress slower and at last i began to fear that our acquired velocity would not be sufficient to carry us up the side of this elevation and so enable us to continue our descent i therefore called to everybody in the rear to kick out vigorously and with my shovel i endeavored to assist our progress as we approached the summit of the elevation we moved slower and slower i became very anxious for should we slide backward we might find it difficult or impossible to get ourselves and the mattress up this little hill but the gentleman and myself worked valiantly and as for mrs lecks and mrs aleshine they kicked their heels through the frozen crust with such energy that we moved sidewise almost as much as upward but in a moment the anxious suspense was over and we rested on the ridge of the long hillock with the mountainside stretching down to the plain which lay not very far below us  i should have been glad to remain here a few minutes to regain breath and give some consideration to the rest of our descent but as some of those behind continued to push the mattress slid over the edge of the terrace and down again we went our progress now was not so rapid but it was very much more unpleasant the snow was thinner there was little or no crust upon it and we very soon reached a wide extent of exposed turf over which we slid but not without a good deal of bumping against stones and protuberances then there was another sheet of snow which quickened our downward impetus and after that the snow was seen only in occasional patches and our progress continued over a long slope of short partly dried grass which was very slippery and over which we passed with considerable quickness  i wished now to bring our uncouth sled to a stop and to endeavor to make the rest of the descent on foot but although i stuck out my heels and tried to thrust the handle of my shovel into the ground it was of no use on we went and the inequalities of the surface gave an irregularity of motion which was uncomfortable and alarming we turned to this side and that we bounced and bumped and the rawhide ropes which must have been greatly frayed and cut by the snowcrust now gave way in several places and i knew that the mattress would soon separate into its original cushions if indeed they still could be called cushions fearing increased danger should we now continue bound together in a bunch i jerked apart the shawlknot under my arms and the next moment it seemed to me there was a general dissolution of our connection with each other fortunately we were now near the bottom of the slope for while some of us stuck fast to the cushions others rolled over or slid independent of any projection while i being thrown forward on my feet actually ran downhill i had just succeeded in stopping myself when down upon me came the rest of the company all prostrate in some position or other  now from an unwieldy mass of shawls came a cry  oh albert dusante where are you lucille lucille  instantly sprang to one foot good mrs aleshine her other foot being entangled in a mass of shawls which dragged behind her her bonnet was split open and mashed down over her eyes in her left hand she waved a piece of yellow flannel which in her last mad descent she had torn from some part of the person of mrs lecks and in the other a bunch of stout dead weeds which she had seized and pulled up by the roots as she had passed them her dress was ripped open down her rotund back and the earth from the weed roots had bespattered her face from the midst of this dilapidation her round eyes sparkled with excitement hopping on one foot the shawls and a part of a cushion dragging behind her she shouted  the dusantes they are the dusantes  then pitching forward on her knees before the two strange ladies who had now tumbled into each others arms she cried  oh which is emily and which is lucille  i had rushed toward ruth who had clung to a cushion and was now sitting upon it when mrs lecks who was close beside her arose to her feet and stood upright one foot was thrust through her own bonnet and her clothes gave evidence of the frenzy and power of mrs aleshines grasp but her mien was dignified and her aspect stately  barbry aleshine she exclaimed if them dusantes has dropped down from heaven at your very feet cant you give em a minute to feel their ribs and see if their legs and arms is broken  the younger lady now turned her head toward mrs aleshine i am lucille she said  in a moment the good womans arms were around her neck i always liked you the best of the two she whispered into the ear of the astonished young lady  having found that ruth was unhurt i ran to the assistance of the others the gentleman had just arisen from a cushion upon which lying flat on his back he had slid over the grass still holding under one arm the package from which he had refused to part i helped him to raise the elder lady to her feet she had been a good deal shaken and much frightened but although a little bruised she had received no important injury  illustration oh which is emily and which is lucille  i went to fill a leather pocketcup from a brook nearby and when i returned i found the gentleman standing confronted by mrs lecks mrs aleshine and ruth while his own companions were regarding the group with eager interest  yes he was saying my name is dusante but why do you ask at this moment why do you show such excited concern on the subject  why exclaimed mrs lecks i will tell you why sir my name is mrs lecks and this is mrs aleshine and if you are the mr dusante with the house on the desert island this is the mrs craig who was married in that very house and the gentleman here with the water is mr craig who wrote you the letter which i hope you got and if that isnt reason enough for our wanting to know if you are mr dusante id like to be told what more there could be  its them of course its them cried mrs aleshine i had a feelin while we were scootin downhill that they was near and dear to us though exactly why and how i didnt know and shes told me shes lucille and of course the other must be emily though what relations  am i to understand interrupted the gentleman looking with earnest animation from one to the other of us that these are the good people who inhabited my house on the island  the very ones cried mrs aleshine and what relation are you to emily and lucille to her  the gentleman stepped backward and laid down the package which he had held under his arm and advancing toward me with outstretched hands and with tears starting to his eyes he exclaimed  and this man then to whom i owe so much is mr craig  owe me i said it is to you that we owe our very lives and our escape from death in midocean  do not speak of it he said shaking his head with a sorrowful expression on his face you owe me nothing i would to heaven it were not so but we will not talk of that now and this is mrs craig he continued taking ruth by the hand the fair lady whose nuptials were celebrated in my house and mrs lecks and mrs aleshine as he spoke he shook hands with each how i have longed to meet you i have thought of you every day since i returned to my island and discovered that you had beeni wish i could saymy guests and where is the reverend gentleman and the three mariners i hope that nothing has befallen them  alasfor three of them at least ejaculated mrs aleshine they have left us but they are all right and now sir if you could tell us what relation you are to emily and what lucille  barbry cried mrs lecks making a dash toward her friend cant you give the man a minute to breathe dont you see hes so dumflustered that he hardly knows who he is himself if them two women was to sink down dead with hunger and hard slidin right afore your very eyes while you was askin what relation they was to each other and to him it would no moren serve you right wed better be seem if anythin s the matter with em and what we can do for em  at this moment the younger of mr dusantes ladies quickly stepped forward oh mrs craig mrs lecks and mrs aleshine she exclaimed im just dying to know all about you  and which contrariwise cried mrs aleshine is the same with us exactly  and of all places in the world continued the young lady that we should meet here  no one could have been more desirous than i was to know all about these dusantes and to discuss the strange manner of our meeting but i saw that ruth was looking very pale and faint and that the elder dusante lady had sat down again upon the ground as though obliged to do so by sheer exhaustion and i therefore hailed with a double delight the interruption of further explanations by the appearance of two men on horseback who came galloping toward us  they belonged to the house which i had noticed from the road above and one of them had seen our swift descent down the mountainside at first he had thought the black object he saw sliding over the snowslopes was a rock or a mass of underbrush but his keen eye soon told him that it was a group of human beings and summoning a companion he had set out for the foot of the mountain as soon as horses could be caught and saddled  the men were much surprised when they heard the details of our adventure but as it was quite plain that some members of our party needed immediate nourishment and attention the questions and explanations were made very short the men dismounted from their horses and the elder dusante lady was placed upon one of them one man leading the animal and the other supporting the lady ruth mounted the other horse and i walked by her to assist her in keeping her seat but she held fast to the high pommel of the saddle and got on very well mr dusante took his younger companion on one arm and his package under the other while mrs lecks having relieved her foot from the encircling bonnet and mrs aleshine now free from the entangling shawls followed in the rear the men offered to come back with the horses for them if they would wait but the two women declared that they were quite able to walk and intended to do no waiting and they trudged vigorously after us the sun was now high and the air down here was quite different from that of the mountainside being pleasant and almost warm the men said that the snows above would probably soon melt as it was much too early in the season for snow to lie long on these lower sides of the mountains  our way lay over an almost level plain for about a mile a portion of it was somewhat rough so that when we reached the low house to which we were bound we were all very glad indeed to get there the house belonged to the two men who owned a small ranch here one of them was married and his wife immediately set herself to work to attend to our needs her home was small its rooms few and her larder very plain in quality but everything she had was placed at our disposal her own bed was given to the elder dusante lady who took immediate possession of it and after a quickly prepared but plentiful meal of fried pork cornbread and coffee the rest of us stretched ourselves out to rest wherever we could find a place before lying down however i had at ruths earnest solicitation engaged one of the men to ride to the railroadstation to inquire about mr enderton and to inform him of our safety by taking a route which ran parallel with the mountainchain but at some distance from it the station the man said could be reached without encountering snow  none of us had had proper rest during the past two nights and we slept soundly until dark when we were aroused to partake of supper all of us except the elder dusante lady who preferred to remain in bed gathered around the table after supper a large fire principally of brushwood was built upon the hearth and with the bright blaze two candles and a lamp the low room appeared light and cheery we drew up about the firefor the night was coolon whatever chairs stools or boxes we could find and no sooner had we all seated ourselves than mrs aleshine exclaimed  now mr dusante it aint in the power of mortal man nor woman neitheran if put the other way it might be strongerto wait any longer before knowin what relation lucille is to emily an you to them an all about that house of yours on the island if id blown up into bits this day through holdin in my wantin to know i shouldnt have wondered an if it hadnt been for hard sleep i dont believe i could have held in nohow  illustration we drew up about the fire  thats my mind exactly said mrs lecks and though i know theres a time for all things and dont believe in crowdin questions on playedout people i do think mr dusante that if i could have caught up with you when we was comin over here id have asked you to speak out on these pints but youre a longlegged walker which mrs aleshine is not and it wouldnt have done to leave her behind  which she wouldnt a been said mrs aleshine long legs or short  ruth and i added our entreaties that mr dusante should tell his story and the good ranchman and his wife said that if there was anything to be done in the storytelling line they were in for it strong and quitting their work of clearing away supper things they brought an old hair trunk from another room and sat down just behind mrs lecks  the younger dusante lady who having been divested of her wraps her veil and the woolen shawl that had been tied over her head had proved to be a very pretty girl with black eyes here declared that it had been her intention at the first opportunity to get us to tell our story but as we had asked first she supposed we ought to be satisfied first  i do not wish my good friends said mr dusante to delay for a moment longer than necessary your very pardonable curiosity concerning me and my family and i must say at the same time that although your letter sir gave me a very clear account of your visit to my island there are many things which naturally could not be contained within the limits of a letter and about which i am most anxious to make inquiries but these i will reserve until my own narration is finished  my name is albert dusante it may interest you to know that my father was a frenchman and my mother an american lady from new england i was born in france but have lived very little in that country and for a great part of my life have been a merchant in honolulu for the past few years however i have been enabled to free myself in a great degree from the trammels of business and to devote myself to the pursuits of a man of leisure i have never married and this young lady is my sister  then what relation began mrs aleshine is she to  at this moment the hand of mrs lecks falling heavily into the lap of the speaker stopped this question and mr dusante proceeded  our parents died when lucille was an infant and we have no near blood relations  at this the faces of both mrs aleshine and mrs lecks assumed expressions as if they had each just received a letter superscribed in an unknown hand and were wondering who it could possibly be from  the lady who is now resting in the adjoining room continued mr dusante is a dear friend who has been adopted by me as a mother  upon my word burst from mrs lecks and mrs aleshine in as much unison of time and tone as if the words had been a response in a church service while miss lucille leaned back against the wall near which she sat and laughed gleefully mr dusante however continued his statements with the same quiet gravity with which he had begun  this lady was a dear friend of my mother although younger than she i adopted her as a mother to my little orphan sister and consequently placed her in the same maternal relation to myself doing this with much earnest satisfaction for i hoped to be able to return as a son something of the tender care and affection which she would bestow on lucille as a daughter  and she is emily cried mrs aleshine  she adopted our name answered the speaker and she is mrs emily dusante  and she is your adopted mother said mrs aleshine  adopted mother ejaculated mrs lecks  yes answered mr dusante  and that is the only relation she is to you two said mrs lecks  and you to her added mrs aleshine  most assuredly answered mr dusante  here mrs lecks leaned back in her chair folded her hands in her lap and ejaculated well well and then allowed her face to assume a rigid intention of having nothing more to say at the present moment  one thing is certain remarked mrs aleshine in a tone which indicated that she did not care who heard her i always liked lucille the best  at this ruth and i exchanged smiles with miss lucille and mr dusante proceeded  i do not wish to occupy too much of your time with our personal affairs and will therefore state that the island on which you found refuge and where i wish most heartily i had been present to act as host was bought by me as a retreat from the annoyances of business and the exactions of society i built there a good house  which it truly was said mrs aleshine with fixtures in it for water and letting it off which i never saw in a house so far out of town  i furnished it suitably said mr dusante we had books and music and for several years we passed vacations there which were both enjoyable and profitable but of late my sister has found the place lonely and we have traveled a good deal making intermittent and often short visits to the island  as i never cared to leave any one on that lonely spot during our absences from it i arranged a gateway of bars across the only opening in the reef with the intention of preventing marauding visits from fishingboats or other small craft which might be passing that way as the island was out of the ordinary track of vessels i did not imagine that my bars would ever prove an obstacle to unfortunate castaways who might seek a refuge there  which they didnt remarked mrs aleshine for under we bobbed  i never exactly understood said mr dusante and i hope to have it explained to me in due time how you passed my bars without removing them and i have had a sore weight upon my conscience since i discovered that shipwrecked persons fleeing to my house from the perils of the sea should have found those inhospitable bars in their way  which is a weight you might as well cast off and be done with it said mrs lecks her deepset notions on the rights of property obliging her to speak for if a man hasnt a right to lock up his house when he goes away and leaves it i dont know what rights anybody has about anything me or mrs aleshine or anybody else here who has a house might just as well go off travelin or to town visitin and leave our front door unlocked and the yard gate swingin on its hinges because we was afraid that some tramp or other body with no house or home might come along and not be able to get in and make himself comfortable your business sir when you left that house and all your belongins on that island was to leave everything tight and safe and the business of people sailin in ships was to go on their proper way and not be runnin into each other and if these last mentioned didnt see fit to do that and so got into trouble they should have gone to some island where there were people to attend to em just as the tramps should go to the poorhouse and this is what we would have donenot meanin the poorhouseif we hadnt been so over longheaded as to get into a leaky boat which i wish it understood is sayin nothin against mr craig  thats true said mrs aleshine for nobody has got a right to complain that a fellowbein locks his own door after him but it does seem to me sir that in such scattered neighborhoods as your island is in it might be a good thing to leave something to eat an drinkperhaps in a bottle or in a tin pailat the outside of your bars for them as might come along shipwrecked an not be able to get inside on account of bein obliged to come in a boat an not as we did an so when they found theyd have to go on they might have somethin to keep up their strength till they got to another house  now barbry aleshine said mrs lecks when you start off on a journey to japan or any other place an leave mincepies and buttered toast astickin on the pints of your pickets for tramps that might come along and need em you can do that kind of talkin but as that time hasnt come lets hear the rest of mr dusantes story  when i first visited my island this year continued the narrator we made but a short stay as we were all desirous of taking a somewhat extended seavoyage in my steamyacht we visited several places of interest and when we returned just six weeks ago today  just one week lackin a day exclaimed mrs lecks after we left that spot  if id a knowed said mrs aleshine rising to her feet that youd be back so soon id a made them sailormen live on fish id a eat gardentruck myself and id be bound id a made the flour hold out for six days more for the rest of em if id a had to work my fingers to the skin and bone to do it then she sat down solemnly  when we returned continued mr dusante i was pleased to find my bars intact and when these were unlocked and the boat from our yacht went through with ourselves and our servants it was very agreeable to notice the good order which seemed to prevail everywhere as we passed from the wharf to the house not even fallen boughs or weeds were seen to indicate that we had been away from the place for more than two months when we entered the house my mother and sister immediately ascended to their chambers and when the windows had been opened i heard them from above calling to each other and remarking upon the freshness and cleanliness of the rooms i went to my library and when i had thrown open the window i was struck with the somewhat peculiar air of order which seemed to obtain in the room the books stood upon their shelves with a remarkable regularity and the chairs and other furniture were arranged with a precision which impressed me as unusual in a moment sir i saw your letter upon the table addressed to me greatly astonished i opened and read it  when i had finished it my amazement was great indeed but obeying an instant impulse i stepped into the diningroom which a servant had opened and took the gingerjar from the mantelpiece when i lifted from it the little brownpaper parcel and beneath it saw the money which had been mentioned in the letter you may imagine the condition of my mind i did not take out the money nor count it but covering it again with the paper parcel which i believed contained fishhooks and with the jar in my hands i returned to the library where i sat down to ponder upon these most astounding revelations while so doing my mother and sister hastily entered the room lucille declared in an excited manner that she believed that the brownies or some other fairies had been there while we were away and had kept the house in order the whole place was actually cleaner she said than when we left it she had taken down a thin dress from her closet and it looked as if it had just come from the hand of a laundress with the ruffles ironed smoother and more evenly than they had ever been since it was first stitched together albert said my mother her face pale there has been somebody in this house then she went on to say that the windows which were left unwashed because we went away in somewhat of a hurry were as bright and clean as if the maids had just been rubbing them the floors and furniture were cleaner and freer from dust than they had ever been before and the whole house looked as if we had just left it yesterday in fact she said it is unnaturally clean  during this part of mr dusantes story mrs lecks and mrs aleshine sat very quiet with an air of sedate humility upon their faces but i could see by the proud light in their eyes that they felt their superiority to ordinary women although they were properly resolved not to show such feeling  at that moment continued mr dusante a servant came hurrying into the room and informed us that the flour was all gone and that there was scarcely anything in the pantries to eat at this my mother and my sister who knew that an abundance of provisions had been left in the house looked at each other aghast but before they could express their consternation in words i addressed them my dear mother said i and lucille there truly has been some one in this house by this letter i am informed that for several weeks eight persons have lived here under this roof a marriage has been solemnized and the happy couple have gone forth from our doors these persons have eaten our food they have made use of our property and this has been their temporary home but they are good people honest and truehearted for they have left the house in better order than they found it and more than the price of all they have consumed is in that gingerjar and thereupon i read them your letter sir  i cannot undertake to describe the wonder and absorbing interest with which this letter filled our minds all needful stores were brought ashore from the yacht which lay outside the reef and we began our usual life on the island but none of the occupations or recreations in which we formerly employed our time now possessed any attractions for us our minds were filled with thoughts of the persons who had been so strangely living in our house and our conversation was mainly made up of surmises as to what sort of people they were whether or not we should ever see them and similar suppositions  yes indeed exclaimed miss lucille i thought of you by day and by night and pictured you all in various ways but never as you really are sometimes i used to think that the boat in which you went away had been sunk in a storm in which you were all drowned and that perhaps your ghosts would come back and live in our house and sleep in our beds and clean our windows and wash and iron our clothes and do all sorts of things in the night  goodnessful gracious me cried mrs aleshine dont talk that way the idea of bein a cold ghost goin about in the dark is worse than slidin down a snowmountain even if you had to do it on the bare of your back  barbry said mrs lecks severely  the idea is jus as chillin replied her undaunted friend  two things connected with this matter continued mr dusante weighed heavily on my mind one of these i have already mentionedthe cruel inhospitality of the barred entrance  i had refrained from adding to the interruptions to mr dusantes narrative but i now felt impelled to assure the gentleman on behalf of myself and wife that we shared the opinions of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine and felt that he could in no way be blamed for thus protecting his private property  you are very good said mr dusante but i will say here that there are now no bars to that entrance i have left some people on the island who will take care of my property and succor any unfortunate castaways who may arrive there the other matter to which i alluded was however the heavier load which oppressed me this was the money in the gingerjar i could not endure to reflect that i had been paid actual money for the hospitality i would have been so glad to offer to you poor shipwrecked people every sentiment of my being rebelled against such a thing i was grieved i was ashamed at last i determined i would bear no longer the ignominy of this brand of inhospitality and that with the gingerjar in my hand i would search over the world if necessary for the persons who in my absence had paid board to me and return to them the jar with its contents uncounted and untouched your letter informed me of the island to which you were bound and if i did not find you there i could discover to what port you had taken your departure there i could make further inquiries and so follow you when i proposed this plan to my family they agreed to it instantly for their interest in the matter was almost as great as mine and in a day or two we started on our quest  i easily traced you to san francisco and found the hotel at which you had stopped here i obtained fresh news of you and learned that you had started east and that the destination of the party was believed to be philadelphia i had hoped that i should meet with you before you left california but supposing that by that time you had reached your destination or were at least far on your way i yielded to the solicitations of my sister and made some excursions in california intending then to follow you to philadelphia and there to advertise for mr craig if he could not otherwise be found however by the rarest and most fortunate of chances we have met thus early and for this i can never be too devoutly thankful  nor we said i earnestly for our greatly desired acquaintance with you and your family could not have begun too soon  now said mr dusante i will perform the duty for which my journey was undertaken and i assure you it is a great pleasure to me to be able so soon to carry out this cherished purpose  he then took up from the floor by his side the package which he had so safely guarded during his swift and perilous descent of the mountainside and which he had since kept close by him placing this upon his knee he removed the light shawl in which it had been rolled and then several pieces of wrappingpaper revealing to our eyes the familiar fat little gingerjar which had stood on the mantelpiece of the diningroom in the house on the island and in which we had deposited our board money  it would be simply impossible for me said mr dusante to consent to retain in my possession money paid for the aid which i involuntarily rendered to shipwrecked people had i been present on the island that aid would have been most heartily and freely given and the fact of my absence makes no difference whatever in regard to my feelings on the subject of your paying for the food and shelter you found at my house having understood from mr craigs letter that it was mrs lecks who superintended the collection and depositing of the money i now return to you madam this jar with its contents  and which said mrs lecks sitting up very rigidly with her hands clasped behind her i dont take if it had been a day and a night or even two nights and over a sunday it wouldnt have mattered but when me and mrs aleshineand the rest of the party can speak for themselvesstays for weeks and weeks without leave or license in a mans house we pay our boardof course deductin services good night  illustration revealing the familiar fat little gingerjar  with that she arose and walked very erect into the adjoining room  it was all very well mr dusante said mrs aleshine for you to try to carry out what you thought was right but we have our ideas as to what our duty is an you have your ideas as to what your duty is an consciences is even  having said this she followed her friend  mr dusante looked surprised and troubled and he turned toward me my dear sir said i those two good women are very sensitive in regard to right and justice and i think it will be well not to press this subject upon them as for my wife and me neither of us would consent to touch money which was placed in that jar by mrs lecks with the expectation that no one but you or one of your family would take it out  very well sir said mr dusante replacing the wrappingpaper around the jar i will drop the subject for the present but you will allow me to say sir that i also am very sensitive in regard to right and justice  early the next morning the man who had been sent to the railroadstation came back bringing news that a fourhorse wagon would shortly be sent for us and also bearing a letter from mr enderton to ruth in this that gentleman informed his daughter that he was quite well but that he had suffered anxiety on account of her probable hardships in the abandoned stagecoach he had hoped however that the snow which had precluded his return with assistance had fallen lightly in the elevated position in which she had been left and he had trusted also that mr craig had bethought himself to build a fire somewhere near the coach where his daughter might be warmed and that the provisions of which he knew an ample quantity had been packed for the trip had been properly heated for her and given to her at suitable intervals this anxiety he said had added very much to his own mental disquietude occasioned by the violent vituperations and unjust demands of the driver of the stagecoach who had seen fit to attack him with all manner of abuse and might even have resorted to personal violence had it not been for the interference of bystanders and the locking of his room door he was now however much relieved by the departure of this driver and by the news that his daughter had reached a place of safety which of course he had supposed she would do her detention having occurred on an ordinary route of travel  while waiting for the arrival of the wagon the adventures of mrs lecks mrs aleshine and myself as well as those of ruth and her father from the time the one party left america and the other china were related at length to the dusantes who showed a deep interest in every detail and asked many questions  mrs dusante whose nervous equilibrium had been fully restored by her nights rest and who although feeling a little stiff and bruised now declared herself quite well proved to be a very pleasant lady of fiftyfive or thereabouts she was of a quiet disposition but her speech and manner showed that in former years at least she had been a woman of society and i soon found out that she was much interested in the study of character this interest was principally shown in the direction of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine whom she evidently looked upon as most remarkable women if any of her sentiments were those of admiration however they were not returned in kind mrs lecks and mrs aleshine had but a small opinion of her  theres motherinlaws and stepmothers and real mothers and grandmothers and sometimes greatgrandmothers livin said mrs lecks to me apart but though mr dusante may be a wellmeanin manand i dont doubt he isand wishin i havent the least reason to disbelieve to do his whole duty by his fellowmen still i must say bein brought up as i was he hasnt any right to make a new kind of mother to be sure a man can adopt children but that isnt goin backward like this is which is agin natral law and gospel  i expect said mrs aleshine who was with us that them french has got fashions that we dont know about and thankful we ought to be that we dont i never had no patience with french heels an french arsenicgreen beans an now if theres to be adoptin of mothers in this country the next thing will be gullotynes  i dont see said i why you look upon the dusantes as french people they are just as much american as french  well said mrs lecks its not for me and mrs aleshine to set ourselves up to judge other people in our part of the country we dont adopt mothers but if they do it in france or the sandwich islands or down east i dont know that we ought to have anything to say  he might as well have adopted a father at the same time said mrs aleshine although to be sure he would a had to been particular to take one that was acquainted with mrs dusante and not had em strangers to each other though parents to him  if i was you barbry aleshine said mrs lecks id adopt some sort of rag to the top of my head to serve for a bonnet for here comes the wagon and i suppose now well be off  we took leave of the kindhearted ranch people who looked upon us as a godsend into their lonely life and disposed ourselves as comfortably as we could in the large wagon our journey of seven or eight miles to the railroadstation was slow and over ways that were rough mrs dusante was a delicate woman and not used to hardship whereas mrs lecks and mrs aleshine were exceedingly vigorous and tough the consequence of this difference was that the kindly hearts of the latter prompted them to do everything they could to prevent mrs dusante feeling the bumps and jolts and to give her such advantages of wraps and position as would help her to bear better the fatigues of the journey  in doing this these good women gradually forgot the adopted mother and came to think only of the very pleasant lady who needed their attentions and who took such a lively and agreeable interest in their family histories their homes their manner of living and everything that pertained to them and before we reached the end of our trip these three were talking together like old friends ruth and miss lucille had also struck up a warm acquaintance while i found mr dusante a very entertaining manof sedate and careful speech ingenious ideas and of a very courteous disposition  when we arrived at the railroadstation we were met by mr enderton who showed a moderate degree of pleasure at seeing us and an immoderate amount of annoyance exhibited principally to me in being obliged to give up to the women of our party the large room he had occupied in the only lodginghouse in the little settlement  illustration ruth and miss lucille struck up a warm acquaintance  when i informed him that the strangers with us were the dusantes on whose island we had been staying he at first listened vaguely he had always looked upon the dusante family as a sort of fable used by mrs lecks to countenance her exactions of money from the unfortunate sojourners on the island but when i told him what mr dusante had done and related how he had brought the board money with him and had offered to pay it back to us an eager interest was aroused in him  i do not wonder he exclaimed that the consciencestricken man wishes to give the money back but that any one should refuse what actually belongs to him or her is beyond my comprehension one thing is certaini shall receive my portion fifteen dollars a week for my daughter and myself that woman charged me and i will have it back  my dear sir i said your board was reduced to the same sum as that paid by the rest of usfour dollars a week each  i call to mind no reduction said mr enderton i remember distinctly the exorbitant sum charged me for board on a desert island it made a deep impression upon me  i do not care to talk any further on this subject i said you must settle it with mrs lecks  mr enderton gave a great sniff and walked away with dignity i could not but laugh as i imagined his condition two minutes after he had stated his opinions on this subject to mrs lecks  when mr dusante had started from san francisco on his search for us he had sent his heavy baggage ahead of him to ogden city where he purposed to make his first stop he supposed that we might possibly here diverge from our homewardbound route in order to visit the mormon metropolis and if we had done so he did not wish to pass us it was therefore now agreed that we should all go to ogden city and there await the arrival of our effects left in the snowedup vehicles on the mountainside we made arrangements with the stationmaster that these should be forwarded to us as soon as the stagecoach and the carriage could be brought down all the baggage of my party was on the coach and it consisted only of a few valises bought in san francisco and a package containing two lifepreservers which mrs lecks and mrs aleshine said they would take home with them if they took nothing else  on the morning after our arrival at ogden city mr dusante took me aside sir he said i wish to confide to you my intentions regarding the jar containing the money left by your party in my house and i trust you will do nothing to thwart them when your baggage arrives you with your party will doubtless continue your eastern way and we shall return to san francisco but the jar with its contents shall be left behind to be delivered to mrs lecks if you will take charge of the jar and hand it to her sir i shall be obliged greatly  i promised mr dusante that i would not interfere with his intentions but asserted that i could on no account take charge of the jar the possession of that piece of pottery with its contents was now a matter of dispute between him and mrs lecks and must be settled by them  very well then sir he said i shall arrange to depart before you and your company and i shall leave the jar suitably packed in the care of the clerk of this hotel with directions to hand it to mrs lecks after i am gone thus there will be nothing for her to do but to receive it  some one now came into the smokingroom where we were sitting and no more was said on this subject mr dusantes statement of his intention very much amused me for mrs lecks had previously taken me into her confidence in regard to her intentions in this matter mr dusante she had said hasnt dropped a word more about the money in that gingerjar but i know just as well as he does what hes goin to do about it when the time comes to go hes goin to slip off quietly leavin that jar behind him thinkin then ill be obliged to take it there bein nobody to give it back to but hell find me just as sharp as he is ive got the street and number of his business place in honolulu from his sisteraskin about it in an offhand way as if it didnt mean anythingan if that jar is left for me ill pack it in a box money and all and ill express it to mr dusante and when he gets to honolulu hell find it there and then hell know that two can play at that sort of game  knowing mr dusante and knowing mrs lecks i pictured to myself a box containing a gingerjar and covered with numerous halfobliterated addresses traveling backward and forward between the sandwich islands and pennsylvania during the lifetime of the contestants and probably if testamentary desires should be regarded during a great part of the lifetime of their heirs that the wear and tear of the box might make it necessary to inclose it in a keg and that eventually the keg might have to be placed in a barrel and that after a time in a hogshead seemed to me as likely as any other contingencies which might befall this peregrinating gingerjar  we spent three days in ogden city and then the weather having moderated very much and the snow on the mountains having melted sufficiently to allow the vehicles to be brought down our effects were forwarded to us and my party and that of mr dusante prepared to proceed on our different ways an eastwardbound train left that evening an hour after we received our baggage but we did not care to depart upon such short notice and so determined to remain until the next day  in the evening mr dusante came to me to say that he was very glad to find that the westward train would leave ogden city early in the morning so that he and his family would start on their journey some hours before we should leave this suits my plans exactly he said i have left the gingerjar securely wrapped and addressed to mrs lecks with the clerk of the hotel who will deliver it tomorrow immediately after my departure all our preparations are made and we purpose this evening to bid farewell to you and our other kind friends from whom i assure you we are most deeply grieved to part  i had just replied that we also regretted extremely the necessity for this separation when a boy brought me a letter i opened it and found it was from mr enderton it read as follows       dear sir i have determined not to wait here until tomorrow      but to proceed eastward by this evenings train i desire to      spend a day in chicago and as you and the others will probably      not wish to stop there i shall by this means attain my      object without detaining you my sudden resolution will not      give me time to see you all before i start but i have taken a      hurried leave of my daughter and this letter will explain      my departure to the rest       i will also mention that i have thought it proper as the      natural head of our party both by age and position to settle      the amicable dispute in regard to the reception and disposition      of the money paid under an excusable misapprehension for our      board and lodging upon a desert island i discovered that the      receptacle of this money had been left in the custody of the      clerk addressed to mrs lecks who has not only already      refused to receive it and would probably do so again but who      is in my opinion in no wise entitled to hold possess or      dispose of it i therefore without making any disturbance      whatever have taken charge of the package and shall convey it      with me to chicago when you arrive there i will apportion the      contents among us according to our several claims this i      regard as a very sensible and prudent solution of the little      difficulty which has confronted us in regard to the disposition      of this money yours hurriedly                                                     david j enderton       ps i shall stop at brandigers hotel where i shall await      you  illustration     part vi  illustration   mr endertons letter astonished and angered me but in spite of my indignation i could not help smiling at the unexpected way in which he had put a stop to the probable perpetual peregrinations of the gingerjar i handed the letter to mr dusante and when he had read it his face flushed and i could see that he was very angry although he kept his temper under excellent control  sir he said presently this shall not be allowed that jar with its contents is my property until mrs lecks has consented to receive it it is of my own option that i return it at all and i have decided to return it to mrs lecks any one interfering with my intentions steps entirely beyond the line of just and warrantable procedure sir i shall not go westward tomorrow morning but with my family will accompany you to chicago where i shall require mr enderton to return to me my property which i shall then dispose of as i see fit you must excuse me sir if anything i have said regarding this gentleman with whom you are connected has wounded your sensibilities  oh dont think of that i exclaimed pitch into enderton as much as you please and you may be sure that i shall not object when i took the daughter to wife i did not marry the father but of course for my wifes sake i hope this matter will not be made the subject of public comment  you need have no fear of that said mr dusante and you will allow me to remark that mr endertons wife must have been a most charming lady  why do you think so i asked  i judge so he answered with a bow from my acquaintance with mrs craig  i now went immediately to ruth who i found knew nothing of what had occurred except that her father had gone on to chicago in advance of our party and had had time only to bid her a hasty goodby i made no remarks on this haste which would not allow mr enderton to take leave of us but which gave him time to write a letter of some length and as ruth knew nothing of this letter i determined not to mention it to her her fathers sudden departure surprised her but little for she told me that he always liked to get to places before the rest of the party with whom he might be journeying  even when we go to church she said he always walks ahead of the rest of us i dont understand why he likes to do so but this is one of his habits  when i informed mrs lecks and mrs aleshine of what had happened they fairly blazed  i dont know what mr dusante calls it exclaimed mrs lecks but i know what i call it  yes indeed cried mrs aleshine her round eyes sparkling with excitement if that isnt exhonesty then he aint no exmissionary i pity the heathen he converted  ill convert him said mrs lecks if ever i lay eyes on him walkin away with a package with my name on it he might as well take my gold spectacles or my tortoiseshell comb i suppose theres no such thing as ketchin up with him but ill telegraph after him an ill let him know that if he dares to open a package of mine ill put the law on him  thats so said mrs aleshine you kin send telegraphs all along the line to one station an another for conductors to give to him in the cars an directed to mr enderton a tall man with graymixed hair an a stolen bundle thats the way they did in our place when abram marlys wife fell into the cistern an hed jus took the cars to the city an they telegraphed to him at five different stations to know where hed left the ladder  which aint a bad idea said mrs lecks though his name will be enough on it without no description an ill do that this minute an find out about the stations from the clerk  you must be very careful i said about anything of that kind for the telegrams will be read at the stations and mr enderton might be brought into trouble in a way which we all should regret but a despatch may be worded so that he and no one else would understand it  very well said mrs lecks an lets get at it but i must say that he dont deserve bein saved no trouble for im as sure as that im a livin woman that he never saved nobody else no trouble sence the first minute he was born  the following despatch was concocted and sent on to bridger to be delivered to mr enderton on the train       the package you know of has been stolen you will recognize the      thief if he leaves it at chicago hotel let him go if he      opens it clap him in jail                                                           mrs lecks  i think that will make him keep his fingers off it said mrs lecks an if mr dusante chooses to send somethin of the same kind to some other station it wont do no harm an if that enderton gets so skeered that he keeps out of sight and hearin of all of us itll be the best thing thats happened yet an i want you to understan mr craig that nothin s goin to be said or done to make your wife feel bad an theres no need of her hearin about whats been done or whats goin to be done but ill say for her that though of course mr enderton is her father and she looks up to him as such shes a mighty deal livelier and gayerhearted when hes away than when hes with her an as for the rest of us theres no use sayin anything about our resignedness to the loss of his company  i should say so said mrs aleshine for if there ever was a man who thought of himself ninetynine times before he thought of anybody else once an then as like as not to forgit that once hes the man an its not by no means that im down on missionaries for its many a box ive made up for em an never begrudged neither money nor trouble an will do it agin many times i hope but he oughtnt to be called one havin given it upunless they gave him up which theres no knowin which it wasfor if theres anything which shows the good in a man its his bein willin to give up the comforts of a christian land an go an convert heathens though bein willin to give up the heathens an go for the comforts shows him quite different besides as like as not chargin double an only half convertin  mr dusante was fully determined to go on with us until he had recovered possession of the gingerjar his courteous feelings toward mrs craig and myself prevented his saying much about mr enderton but i had good reason to believe that his opinions in regard to my fatherinlaw were not very different from those of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine ever since mr enderton had shown his petulant selfishness when obliged to give up his room at the railroadstation for the use of the women of his party mr dusante had looked upon him coldly and the two had had but little to say to each other  we were all very glad that our pleasant party was not to be broken up and although there was no resignation at the absence of the gingerjar we started on our journey the next day in a pleasanter mood for the absence of mr enderton before we left mr dusante sent a telegram to kearney junction to be delivered to mr enderton when he arrived there what this message was i do not know but i imagine its tone was decided  our journey to chicago was a pleasant one we had now all become very well acquainted with each other and there was no discordant element in the combined party some of us were a little apprehensive of trouble or annoyance at least awaiting us in chicago but we did not speak of it and while ruth knew nothing of her fathers misbehavior it might have been supposed that the rest had forgotten it  at chicago we went at once to brandigers hotel and there we found instead of mr enderton a letter from him to ruth it read as follows       my dear daughter i have determined not to wait here as      originally intended but to go on by myself i am sorry not to      meet you here but it will not be long before we are together      again and you know i do not like to travel with a party its      various members always incommode me in one way or another i      had proposed to go to philadelphia and wait for you there but      have since concluded to stop at meadowville a village in the      interior of pennsylvania where as they have informed me the      two women mrs lecks and mrs aleshine reside i wish to see      the party all together before i take final leave of them and i      suppose the two women will not consent to go any farther than      the country town in which they live inclosed is a note to your      husband relating to business matters i hope that he will take      the best of care of you during the rest of the journey and      thus very much oblige                                           your affectionate father  this was my note       mr craig sir i should have supposed that you would have been      able to prevent the insolent messages which have been      telegraphed to me from some members of your party but it is      my lot to be disappointed in those in whom i trust i shall      make no answer to these messages but will say to you that i am      not to be browbeaten in my intention to divide among its      rightful claimants the money now in my possession it is not      that i care for the comparatively paltry sum that will fall to      myself and my daughter but it is the principle of the matter      for which i am contending it was due to me that the amount      should have been returned to me and to no other that i might      make the proper division i therefore rest upon my principles      and my rights and desiring to avoid needless altercations      shall proceed to meadowville where when the rest of my party      arrive i shall justly apportion the money i suppose the man      dusante will not be foolish enough to protract his useless      journey farther than chicago it is your duty to make him see      the impropriety of so doing yours etc                                                     d j enderton  ruths letter was shown to all the party and mine in private to mr dusante mrs lecks and mrs aleshine when the first moments of astonishment were over mrs lecks exclaimed  well after all i dont know that im so very sorry that the old sneak has done this for now were rid of him for the rest of the trip and im pretty certain from the way he writes that he hasnt dipped into that jar yet weve skeered him from doin that  but the impidence of him said mrs aleshine think of his goin to the very town where we live an gittin there fust hell be settin on that tavern porch with every loafer in the place about him an tellin em the whole story of what happened to us from beginnin to end till by the time we git there itll be all over the place an as stale as last weeks bread  the man dusante quietly remarked that individual will not abandon the purpose of his journey he left his island to place in the hands of mrs lecks on behalf of her party the gingerjar with the money inclosed he will therefore go on with you to meadowville and will there make formal demand and if necessary legal requisition for the possession of that jar and that money after which he will proceed to carry out his original intentions  illustration the impidence of him  we all expressed our pleasure at having him with his ladies as companions for the remainder of our journey and mrs lecks immediately offered them the hospitalities of her house for as long a time as they might wish to stay with her  the weather there she said is often splendid till past thanksgivin day an nobody could be welcomer than you  id have asked you myself said mrs aleshine if mrs lecks hadnt done itwhich of course she would bein alivebut im goin to have mr craig an his wife an as our houses is near well see each other all the time an if mr enderton chooses to stay awhile at the tavern he can come over to see his daughter whenever he likes ill go as fur as that though no further can i go im not the one to turn anybody from my door be he heathen or jus as bad or wuss but tea once or perhaps twice is all that i can find it in my heart to offer that man after what hes done  as the dusantes and ruth expressed a desire to see something of chicago where they had never been before we remained in this city for two days feeling that as mr enderton would await our coming there was no necessity for haste  early in the afternoon of the second day i went into the parlor of the hotel where i expected to find our party prepared for a sightseeing excursion but i found the room tenanted only by mrs aleshine who was sitting with her bonnet and wraps on ready to start forth i had said but a few words to her when mrs lecks entered without bonnet or shawl and with her knitting in her hand she took a seat in a large easychair put on her spectacles and proceeded to knit  mrs lecks exclaimed her friend in surprise dont you intend goin out this afternoon  no said mrs lecks ive seen all i want to see an im goin to stay in the house an keep quiet  isnt mr dusante goin out this afternoon asked mrs aleshine  mrs lecks laid her knitting in her lap then she took off her spectacles folded them and placed them beside the ball of yarn and turning her chair around she faced her friend barbry aleshine said she speaking very deliberately has any such a thing got into your mind as that im settin my cap at mr dusante  i dont say you have an i dont say you havent answered mrs aleshine her fat hands folded on her knees and her round face shining from under her new bonnet with an expression of hearty good will but this i will sayan i dont care who hears itthat if you was to set your cap at mr dusante there neednt nobody say anythin agin it so long as you are content he isnt what id choose for you if i had the choosin for id git one with an american name an no islands but thats neither here nor there for youre a grown woman an can do your own choosin an whether theres any choosin to be done is your own business too for its full eleven years sence youve been done with widder fixins an if mr lecks was to rise up out of his grave this minute he couldnt put his hand on his heart an say that you hadnt done your full duty by him both before an after he was laid away an so if you did want to do choosin an made up your mind to set your cap at mr dusante theres no word to be said both of you is ripeaged an qualified to know your own minds an both of you is well off enough to all intents an purposes to settle down together if so inclined an as to his sister i dont expect she will be on his hands for long an if you can put up with an adopted motherinlaw thats your business not mine though i allus did say mrs lecks that if youd been piscopalian youd been lowchurch  is that all said mrs lecks  yes replied the other its all i have to say jus now though more might come to me if i gave my mind to it  well then said mrs lecks ive somethin to say on this pint and im very glad mr craig is here to hear it if i had a feelin in the direction of mr dusante that he was a man though not exactly what i might wish havin somethin of foreign manners with ties in the sandwich islands which i shouldnt have had so if id had the orderin of it who was still a christian gentlemanas showed by his acts not his wordsa lovin brother an a kind an attentive son by his own adoption and who would make me a good husband for the rest of our two lives then id go and id set my cap at himnot bold nor flauntin nor unbecomin to a woman of my age but just so much settin of it at him that if he had any feelins in my direction and thought although it was rather late in life for him to make a change that if he was goin to do it hed rather make that change with a woman who had age enough and experience enough in downs as well as ups and in married life as well as single to make him feel that as he got her so hed always find her then i say all hed have to do would be to come to me an say what he thought an id say what i thought an the thing would be settled an nobody in this world need have one word to say except to wish us joy an then go along and attend to their own business  but now i say to you barbry aleshine an just the same to you mr craig that i havent got no such feelins in the direction of mr dusante an i dont intend to set my cap at him an if he wore such a thing and set it at me id say to him kind though firm that he could put it straight again as far as i was concerned an that if he chose to set it at any other woman if the nearest an dearest friend i have on earth id do what i could to make their married lives as happy as they could be under the circumstances and no matter what happened i wouldnt say one word though i might think what i pleased an now you have it all straight and plain if i wanted to set caps id set em and if i didnt want to set em i wouldnt i dont want to and i dont  and putting on her spectacles she resumed her knitting  mrs aleshine turned upon her friend a beaming face  mrs lecks she said your words has lifted a load from off my mind it wouldnt ha broke me down an you wouldnt never have knowed i carried it but its gone an im mighty glad of it an as for me an my capan when you spoke of nearest and dearest friends you couldnt mean nobody but meyou neednt be afraid no matter what i was nor what he was nor what i thought of him nor what he thought of me i couldnt never say to my son when he comes to his mothers arms all the way from japan george heres a frenchman who i give to you for a father  here i burst out laughing but mrs lecks gravely remarked now i hope this business of capsettin is settled an done with  which it is said mrs aleshine as she rose to meet the rest of our party as they entered the room  for several days i could not look upon the dignified and almost courtly mr dusante without laughing internally and wondering what he would think if he knew how without the slightest provocation on his side a matrimonial connection with him had been discussed by these good women and how the matter had been finally settled i think he would have considered this the most surprising incident in the whole series of his adventures  on our journey from chicago to the little country town in the interior of pennsylvania we made a few stops at points of interest for the sake of ruth and the dusante ladies mrs lecks and mrs aleshine generously consenting to these delays although i knew they felt impatient to reach their homes they were now on most social terms with mrs dusante and the three chatted together like old friends  i asked her if we might call her emily said mrs aleshine in confidence to me an she said yes an were goin to do it ive all along wanted to because it seemed to come natral considerin we knowed em as emily and lucille before we set eyes on em but as long as i had that load on my mind about mrs lecks and mr dusante i couldnt emily his adopted mother my feelins wouldnt ha stood it but now its all right an though emily isnt the woman i expected her to be lucille is the very picter of what i thought she was and as for emily i never knowed a nicermannered lady an more willin to learn from people thats had experience than she is  we arrived at meadowville early in the afternoon and when our party alighted from the train we were surprised not to see mr enderton on the platform of the little station instead of him there stood three persons whose appearance amazed and delighted us they were the redbearded coxswain and the two sailormen all in neat new clothes and with their hands raised in maritime salute  there was a cry of joy mrs aleshine dropped her bag and umbrella and rushed toward them with outstretched hands in a moment mrs lecks ruth and myself joined the group and greeted warmly our nautical companions of the island  the dusante party when they were made acquainted with the mariners were almost as much delighted as we were and mr dusante expressed in cordial words his pleasure in meeting the other members of the party to whom his island had given refuge  i am so glad to see you said mrs aleshine that i dont know my bonnet from my shoes but how in the name of all thats wonderful did you get here  t aint much of a story said the coxswain an this is just the whole of it when you left us at frisco we felt pretty downsome an the more that way because we couldnt find no vessel that we cared to ship on an then there come to town the agent of the house that owned our brig and we was paid off for our last vyage then when we had fitted ourselves out with new togs we began to think different about this shippin on board a merchantvessel an gettin cussed at an livin on hardtack an salt prog an jus as like as not the ship springin a leak an all hands pumpin night an day an goin to davy jones after all an after talkin this all over we was struck hard on the weatherbow with a feelin that it was a blamed sight betterbeggin your pardon maamto dig gardenbeds in nice soft dirt an plant peas an ketch fish an all that kind of shore work an eatin them good things you used to cook for us mrs aleshine and dancin hornpipes for ye and tamin birds when our watch was off wasnt that so jim an bill  aye aye sir said the blackbearded sailormen  then says i now look here mates dont lets go and lark away all this money but take it an make a land trip to where mrs aleshine liveswhich port i had the name of on a piece of paper which you gave me maam  and here mrs aleshine nodded vigorously not being willing to interrupt this entrancing story  an if shes got another garden an wants it dug in an things planted an fish caught an any other kind of shore work done why were the men for her an well sign the papers for as long a vyage as she likes and stick by her in fair weather or foul bein good for day work an night work an allus ready to fall in when she passes the word aint that so jim an bill  aye aye sir returned the sailormen with sonorous earnestness  upon my word cried mrs aleshine tears of joy running down her cheeks them papers shall be signed if i have to work night an day to find somethin for you to do ive got a man takin keer of my place now but many a time have i said to myself that if i had anybody i could trust to do the work right id buy them two fields of squire ramseys an go into the onion business an now you sailormen has come like three sea angels an if it suits you well go into the onion business on sheers  that suits us tiptop maam said the coxswain an well plant inyans for ye on the shears on the stocks or in the drydock it dont make no difrence to us where you have em just pass the word  well well said mrs lecks i dont know how thats goin to work but we wont talk about it now an so you came straight on to this place  that did we maam said the coxswain an when we got here we found the parson but none of you folks that took us aback a little at fust but he said he didnt live here an you was comin pretty soon an so we took lodgins at the tavern an for three days weve been down here to meet every train expectin you might be on it  our baggage had been put on the platform the train had moved on and we had stood engrossed in the coxswains narrative but now i thought it necessary to make a move there was but one small vehicle to hire at the station this would hold but two persons and in it i placed mrs dusante and ruth the first being not accustomed to walking and the latter very anxious to meet her father i ordered the man to drive them to the inn where we would stay until mrs lecks and mrs aleshine should get their houses properly aired and ready for our reception  mrs craig will be glad to get to the tavern and see her father said mrs aleshine i expect he forgot all about its bein time for the train to come  bless you maam exclaimed the coxswain is she gone to the tavern the parsons not there  where is he then asked mrs aleshine  hes at your house maam replied the coxswain  an what in the name of common sense is he doin at my house exclaimed mrs aleshine her eyes sparkling with amazement and indignation  well maam for one thing said the coxswain hes had the front door painted  what cried mrs lecks and mrs aleshine in one breath  yes continued the coxswain the parson said he hated to see men hangin around doin nothin an then he looked about an said the paint was all wore off the front door an we might as well go to work an paint that an he sent jim to a shop to git the paint an brushes  an have em charged to me cried mrs aleshine  yes maam continued the coxswain an jim an bill holystoned all the old paint off the door an i painted it havin done lots of that sort of thing on shipboard an i think its a pretty good job maamred at top and bottom an white in the middle like a steamers smokestack  mrs lecks and mrs aleshine looked at each other an he told you to do that said mrs lecks  yes maam answered the coxswain the parson said he never liked to be nowhere without doin what good he could an there was some other paintin he talked of havin done but we aint got at it yet i sposed he was actin under your orders an i hope i havent done no wrong maam  youre not a bit to blame said mrs aleshine but ill look into this thing no fear about that an how did he come to go to my house an how did he get in id like to know  all i know about that said the coxswain is what the gal thats livin there told me which she did along of askin us if we was comin to live there too an if she should rig up beds for us somewhere in the toploft but we told her no not havin no orders an payin our own way at the tavern she said said she that the parson come there an lowed he was a friend of mrs aleshines an travelin with her an that if she was at home she wouldnt let him stay at no tavern an that knowin her wishes hed come right there an spected to be took care of till she come she said she felt uncertain about it but she tuck him in till she could think it over an then we come an certified that he was the parson whod been along with mrs aleshine an the rest of us arter that she thought it was all right an beggin your pardon if we was wrong so did jim an bill an me maam  now exclaimed mrs aleshine if that isnt exactly like elizabeth grootenheimer to think of elizabeth grootenheimer thinkin the grootenheimers always was the dumbest family in the township an elizabeth grootenheimer is the dumbest of em all i did say to myself when i went away now elizabeth grootenheimer is so stone dumb that shell jus stay here an do the little i tell her to do an hasnt sense enough to get into no mischief an now look at her  illustration  she waved her hand in the direction of the invisible elizabeth grootenheimer  mrs lecks had said very little during this startling communication but her face had assumed a stern and determined expression now she spoke  i guess weve heard about enough an wed better be steppin along an see what else mr enderton an elizabeth grootenheimer is doin  the homes of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine were not far from each other and were situated about midway between the station and the village inn and in the direction of these our party now started mrs aleshine contrary to her custom took the lead and walked away with strides of unusual length mrs lecks was close behind her followed by the two dusantes and myself while the three mariners who insisted upon carrying all the handbaggage brought up the rear we stepped quickly for we were all much interested in what might happen next and very soon we reached mrs aleshines house it was a goodsized and pleasantlooking dwelling painted white with green shutters and with a long covered piazza at the front between the road and the house was a neat yard with grass and flowerbeds and from the gate of the picketfence in front of the yard a brickpaved path led up to the house  our approach had been perceived for on the piazza in front of the gaily painted door stood mr enderton erect and with a bland and benignant smile upon his face one hand was stretched out as if in welcome and with the other he gracefully held the gingerjar now divested of its wrappings  at this sight mrs lecks and mrs aleshine made a simultaneous dash at the gate but it was locked the two women stamped their feet in fury  put down that jar shouted mrs lecks  elizabeth grootenheimer elizabeth grootenheimer screamed mrs aleshine come here and open this gate  break it down said mrs lecks turning to the sailors  dont you do it exclaimed mrs aleshine throwing herself in front of it dont you break my gate elizabeth grootenheimer  my friends said mr enderton in clear distinct tones be calm i have the key of that gate in my pocket i locked it because i feared that on your first arrival you would hurry up to the house in a promiscuous way and give heed to irrelevant matters i wished to address you in a body and in a position where your attention would not be diverted from me i hold here my friends the receptacle containing the money which under a misapprehension was paid for our board while on a desert island this money i have taken care of and have carefully guarded for the benefit of us all unfortunately objections have arisen to this guardianship which were forwarded to me by telegraph but i have not heeded them if you cannot see for yourselves the propriety of my assumption of this trust i will not now undertake to enlighten you but i hope there is no necessity for this for having had time to give the matter your fullest attention i doubt not that you entirely agree with me i will merely add for i see you are impatient that the sum which will fall to the share of each of us is comparatively insignificant and in itself not worth striving for but what i have done has been for the sake of principle for the sake of principle i have insisted that this money should be received by its rightful owners for the sake of principle i assumed the custody of it and for the sake of principle i shall now empty the contents of this jarwhich by me has not been examined or touchedupon the floor of this piazza and i shall then proceed to divide said contents into five suitable portionsthe three mariners as i understand having paid no board the gate can then be opened and each one can come forward and take the portion which belongs to him or to her the portion of my daughter whom i saw pass here in a carriage going doubtless to the inn will be taken charge of by myself  you man shrieked mrs lecks shaking her fist over the fence if you as much as lift that paper of fishhooks from out the top of that gingerjar ill  here she was interrupted by the loud clear voice of mr dusante who called out sir i require you to put down that jar which is my property  ill let you know said mrs lecks that other people have principles  but what more she said was drowned by the voice of mrs aleshine who screamed for elizabeth grootenheimer and who was now so much excited that she was actually trying to break open her own gate  i called out to mr enderton not to make trouble by disturbing the contents of the jar and even miss lucille who was intensely amused at the scene could be heard joining her voice to the general clamor  but the threats and demands of our united party had no effect upon mr enderton he stood up serene and bland fully appreciating the advantage of having the key of the gates padlock in his pocket and the gingerjar in his hand  illustration you man shrieked mrs lecks  i will now proceed said he but at that moment his attention was attracted by the three mariners who had clambered over the pointed pales of the fence and who now appeared on the piazza bill to the right hand of mr enderton jim to the left and the redbearded coxswain at his back they all seemed to speak at once though what they said we could not hear nothing but a few hoarse mutterings coming down to us  but in consequence of what bill said mr enderton handed him the key of the gate and in consequence of what jim said mr enderton delivered to him the gingerjar and in consequence of what the coxswain said he and mr enderton walked off the piazza and the two proceeded to a distant corner of the yard where they stood out of the way as it were while the gate was opened bill bungled a little but the padlock was soon removed and we all hurried through the gate and up to the piazza where jim still stood the gingerjar held reverently in his hands  the coxswain now left mr enderton and that gentleman proceeded to the open gate through which he passed into the road and then turned and in a loud and severe tone addressed mrs aleshine  i leave your inhospitable house and go to join my daughter at the inn where i request you to send my valise and umbrella as soon as possible  mrs aleshines indignation at this invasion of her home and this trampling on her right to open her own gate had entirely driven away her accustomed geniality and in angry tones she cried  jus you stop at that paintshop when you git to the village an pay for the paint you had charged to me an when youve done that you can send for your things  come now barbry said mrs lecks dont let your feelins run away with you you ought to be thankful that hes let you off so easy an that hes gone  im all that said mrs aleshine an on second thoughts every whipstitch of his bag and baggage shall be trundled after him as soon as i kin git it away  we all now stood upon the piazza and mrs aleshine in calmer tones but with her face still flushed from her recent excitement turned to us and said now isnt this a pretty comin home my front gate fastened in my very face my front door painted red and white the inside of the house as like as not turned upside down by that man jus as much as the outside an where in the world id like to know is elizabeth grootenheimer  now dont you be too hard on her said mrs lecks after havin been away from her so long i havent a doubt shes feedin the pigs and you know very well she never would leave them as long as she felt they needed her you neednt mind if your house is upset for none of us is comin in havin only intended to see you to your door which i must say is a pretty blazin one  and now mrs lecks said mr dusante taking as he spoke the gingerjar from the hand of jim i think this is a suitable opportunity for me to accomplish the object for which my present journey was undertaken and to return to you the contents of this jar  which said mrs lecks in a very decided tone i dont take now no moren i did before  mr dusante looked surprised and troubled after all the dangers and adventures through which that gingerjar had gone i believe that he expected mrs lecks would at last relent and consent to accept it from him  now look here said mrs aleshine dont let us have any more fuss about the gingerjar or anything else lets put off talkin about that till were all settled and fixed it wont do for you to take the jar to the tavern with you mr dusante for like as not mr enderton will git hold of it agin an i know mrs lecks wont let it come into her house so if you like you may jus leave it here for the present and you may make up your minds nobodyll touch it while im about an about i intend to be  this arrangement was gladly agreed upon and the jar being delivered to mrs aleshine we took our leave of her  mrs lecks found no difficulty in entering her gate where she was duly welcomed by a man and his wife she had left in charge while the dusantes and myself walked on to the inn or hotel as its sign imported about which the greater part of the little town clustered the three mariners remained behind to await further orders from mrs aleshine  by the afternoon of the next day the abodes of those two most energetic and capable housewives mrs lecks and mrs aleshine were fully prepared for the reception of their visitors and the dusante family were ensconced beneath the roof of the one while my wife and i were most warmly welcomed at the gaily adorned door of the other  mr enderton remained at the inn where he found very comfortable quarters an arrangement satisfactory to all parties  in mrs aleshines dwelling where from the very first lucille took her position as a most constant visitor being equally welcomed by ruth and the mistress of the house all was satisfaction and high good humor the ceaseless activity and cheerful spirits of our hostess seemed to animate us all at mrs leckss home the case was different there i could plainly see there was a certain uneasiness amounting almost to stiffness between mrs lecks and mr dusante the latter had not accomplished the purpose for which he had made this long journey and though if things had turned out as he wished he would have been very glad to be the guest of mrs lecks still under the present circumstances the situation did not suit him mrs lecks too possessed an unsettled mind she did not know when mr dusante would again endeavor to force back upon her the board money in the gingerjar and in this state of uneasy expectancy she was not at her best  hes not satisfied said she to me on the morning after the dusantes had come to her he wants to do somethin or else to go away i wish that gingerjar had dropped into the bottom of the sea while he was bringin it or else had smashed itself into a thousand bits while he was slidin down the mountain and the money had melted itself into the snow sposin at the end of the week he was to come to me and offer to pay me board for himself and his family sayin that was no more than id done to him of course the two cases are not a bit alike for we went to his house strangers without leave or license while he comes to mine as a friend bein fully invited and pressed but i dont suppose i could make him see it in that light and it worries me  i was convinced that something ought to be done to end this unpleasant state of affairs and i took my wife and miss lucille into council on the subject after we had deliberated a little while an idea came to ruth  in my opinion said she the best thing we can do with that board money is to give it to those three sailors they are poor and will be glad to get it mr dusante and mrs lecks ought to be fully satisfied for the one doesnt keep it and the other doesnt take it back and im sure that this plan will please all the rest of us  this proposition was agreed to by the council and i was appointed to go immediately and lay it before the parties interested  mr dusante gave his ready consent to this proposal it is not what i intended to do said he but it amounts to almost the same thing the money is in fact restored to its owners and they agree to make a certain disposition of it i am satisfied  mrs lecks hesitated a little all right said she he takes the money and gives it to who he chooses ive nothin to say against it  of course no opposition to the plan was to be expected from anybody else except mr enderton but when i mentioned it to him i found to my surprise that he was not unwilling to agree to it half closing the book he had been reading he said what i have done was on behalf of principle i did not believe and do not believe that upon an entirely deserted island money should be paid for board i paid it under protest and i do not withdraw that protest according to all the laws of justice and hospitality the man who owned that island should not retain that money and mrs lecks had no right to insist upon such retention but if it is proposed to give the sum total to three mariners who paid no board and to whom the gift is an absolute charity i am content to be sure they interfered with me at a moment when i was about to make a suitable settlement of the matter but i have no doubt they were told to do so and i must admit that while they carried out their orders with a certain firmness characteristic of persons accustomed to unreasoning obedience they treated me with entire respect if equal respect had been shown to me at the beginning of these disputes it would have been much better for all concerned  and opening his book he recommenced his reading  that afternoon all of us except mr enderton assembled on mrs aleshines piazza to witness the presentation of the board money the three sailors who had been informed of the nature of the proceedings stood in line on the second step of the piazza clad in their best toggery and with their new tarpaulin hats in their hands mrs aleshine went into the house and soon reappeared carrying the gingerjar which she presented to mr dusante that gentleman took it and stood holding it for a moment as if he were about to speak but even if he had intended to say anything he had no further opportunity for mrs lecks now stepped forward and addressed him  mr dusante said she from what i have seen of you myself and heard tell of you from others i believe you are a man who tries to do his duty as he sees it with a single heart and no turnin from one side to the other you made up your mind that youd travel over the whole world if it had to be done with that gingerjar and the board money inside of it till youd found the people whod been livin in your house and then that youd give back that jar jus as youd found it to the person who took upon herself the overseein of the reglar payin of the money and the puttin of it therein with that purpose in your mind you carried that jar over the ocean you wandered with it up and down california and holdin it tight fast in your arms you slid down the slipperiest mountain that was ever made yet i believe and if it had been your only infant child you couldnt have held it firmer nor regarded it more careful through ups and downs and thicks and smooths you carried that jar or followed it and for the sake of doin what youd set your mind on you came all the way to this place to which if it hadnt been for that one idea it isnt likely youd ever dreamed of comin now mr dusante weve all agreed on what we think is the right thing to do and you agreed with us but i can see by your face that youre disappinted the thing you set out to do you havent done and im not goin to have it to say to myself that you was the only one of all of us that wasnt satisfied and that i was the stumblinblock that stood in your way so ill back down from sayin that id never touch that jar again and you can put it into my hands as you set out to do  mr dusante made no answer but stepped forward and taking mrs leckss large brown and workworn hand he respectfully touched it with his lips it is not probable that mrs leckss hand had ever before been kissed it is not probable that she had ever seen any one kiss the hand of another but the hard sense and keen insight of that independent countrywoman made her instantly aware of what was meant by that oldfashioned act of courteous homage her tall form grew more erect she slightly bowed her head and received the salute with a quiet dignity which would have become a duchess  this little scene touched us all and mrs aleshine afterward informed me that for a moment she hadnt a dry eye in her head  mr dusante now handed the gingerjar to mrs lecks who immediately stepped toward ruth and lucille  you two young ones she said can jus take this jar an your hands can be the first to lift off that paper of fishhooks and take out the money which you will then divide among our good friends these sailormen  ruth and lucille immediately sat down on the floor of the piazza and the one emptied the board money into the lap of the other where it was speedily divided into three equal portions one of which was placed in the hands of each mariner  the men stood motionless each holding his money in his open right hand and then the redbearded coxswain spoke  it aint for me nor for bill nor for jim nuther to say a word agin what you all think is right and square weve stood by ye an obeyed orders since we first shipped on that island an we intend to do so straight along dont we jim an bill  illustration he respectfully touched it with his lips  aye aye sir said jim and bill in hearty hoarse response  theres some of ye specially mrs aleshine though meanin no disrespec to anybody else that wed follow to the crosstrees of the topgallantmast of the tallest ship that ever floated in the middle of the raginest typhoon that ever blowed wouldnt we jim an bill  aye aye sir sang out jim and bill  but though we stand ready to obey orders said the coxswain we made up our minds when we heard what was goin to be done that wed listen keerful fer one thing an we have listened keerful an we havent heard that one thing an that thing was what we should do with this money an not havin heard it an so bein under no orders as to the spendin of it we take the money an thank you kindly one an all dont we jim an bill  aye aye sir said jim and bill  and into the pocket of each mariner clinked the money  mr dusante now took up the gingerjar and approached mrs lecks i hope madam he said that as the subject of our little differences has now been removed from this jar you will consent to accept it from me as a memento of the somewhat remarkable experiences through which it has accompanied us  take it sir said she to be sure i will an very glad am i to get it as long as i live it shall stand on the mantelpiece in my parlor an when i die it shall be left to my heirs to be taken care of as long as it holds together  every reason for dissatisfaction having now been banished from our little company we all settled down for a season of enjoyment even mr enderton who had found on the top shelf of a closet in his room at the inn a lot of old books appeared to be in a state of perfect content to the dusantes a residence in this absolutely rural portion of our middle states in the autumnal season was an entirely novel experience the crisp and invigorating air the mists and the glowing hues of the indiansummer time the softness of the sunshine and even those masses of limbs and twigs which had already dropped their leaves and spread themselves in a delicate network against the clear blue sky were all full of a novel beauty for these people who had lived so long in tropical lands and among perennial foliage and had never known the delights of an american country life out of season having enjoyed mrs leckss hospitality for a suitable period they proposed to that sensible woman that she should receive them as boarders until the winter should set in and to this practical proposition she gave a ready assent hoping that the really cold weather would long defer its coming  ruth and i established ourselves on the same terms with mrs aleshine a prolonged holiday from the labors of my business had been the object of my attempted journey to japan and i could think of no place where it would better please my young wife and myself to rest for a time than here among these good friends  a continual source of amusement to us were the acts and doings of mrs aleshine and her three sailormen these bold mariners had enlisted soul and body into the service of the thrifty housewife and as it was impossible to do anything in connection with the growing of the onions until the desired fields should be acquired and the spring should open many and diverse were the labors at which the coxswain and those two ablebodied seamen bill and jim set themselves or were set by mrs aleshine  the brilliantly painted front door which at first had excited the good womans ire gradually came to command her admiration and when her sailormen had done everything else that they could in the barns the fields or at the woodpile she gave them the privilege to paint various portions of her property leaving designs and colors to their own taste and fancy whether they milked the cows cut the wood or painted the sides of the house they always worked like good fellows and in nautical costume they holystoned the front deck as they called the floor of the piazza until it seemed sacrilegious to set foot upon it and when the house and the palefence had been suitably painted they allowed their fancies lofty flights in the decoration of the smaller outbuildings and various objects in the grounds one of the men had a pocketchart of the colors adopted by the different steamship companies all over the world and now smokehouses corncribs chickenhouses and so on down to pumps and hitchingposts were painted in great bands of blue and red and white and black arranged in alternating orders until an observer might have supposed that a commercial navy had been sunk beneath mrs aleshines house grounds leaving nothing but its smokestacks visible  the greatest work of decoration however was reserved by the redbearded coxswain for himself designed by his own brain and executed by his own hands this was the tattooing of the barn around this building the sides of which were already of a color sufficiently resembling a welltanned human skin the coxswain painted in blue spots resembling tattooing an immense cable passing several times about the structure a seaserpent almost as long as the cable eight anchors two ships under full sail with a variety of cannons and flags which filled up all the remaining spaces this great work was a long time in execution and before it was half finished its fame had spread over the surrounding country  illustration the greatest work of decoration was reserved by the redbearded coxswain for himself  the decoration of her premises was greatly enjoyed by mrs aleshine it gives em somethin to do said she till the onion season comes on it makes em happy an the leaves an flowers bein pretty nigh gone i like to see the place blossomin out as if it was a coldweather garden  in the evenings in the large kitchen the sailormen danced their hornpipes and around the great fireplace they spun long yarns of haps and mishaps on distant seas mrs aleshine always and the rest of us often sat by the fire and enjoyed these nautical recreations  havin myself done housekeepin in the torrid zone she once said a lot of the things they tell come home to me quite natral an id do anything in the world to make em content to live on dry land like common christians instead of cavortin about on the pitchin ocean runnin into each other an springin leaks with no likelihood of findin a furnished island at every pint where their ship happened to go down  on one subject only did any trouble now come into the mind of mrs aleshine and she once had a little talk with me in regard to it  ive been afeard from the very beginnin she said an after a while i moren half believed it that elizabeth grootenheimer was settin her cap at the coxswain so i just went to him an i spoke to him plain this sort o thing wont do at all says i an although i havent a doubt you see it for yourself i thought it my dooty to speak my mind about it theres plenty of young women in this township that would make you sailormen fustrate wives an glad enough id be to see you all married an settled an gone to farmin right here amongst us but elizabeth grootenheimer wont do settin aside everythin else if there was to be any children they might be little coxswains but theyd be grootenheimers too stonedumb grootenheimers an i tell you plain that this county cant stand no more grootenheimers to which he says says he i want you to understan maam that if ever me or jim or bill makes up our mind to set sail for any sort of a weddin port we wont weigh anchor till weve got our clearance papers from you by which he meant that hed ask my advice about courtin an now my mind is easy an i can look ahead with comfort to oniontime  i found it necessary to go to philadelphia for a day or two to attend to some business matters and the evening before i started the coxswain came to me and asked a favor for himself and his mates  it maynt have passed out of your mind sir said he that when me an jim an bill took that money that you all give us which wasnt zackly like prizemoney because the rest of the crew to put it that way didnt get any we listened keerful to see if anything was said as to what we was to do with the money an nothin bein said we took it and we wasnt long makin up our minds as to what we was goin to do with it what we wanted to do was to put up some sort of signal what couldnt get blowed away or more like a kind of reglar moniment as would make them that looked at it remember the rough squalls and the jolly larks weve gone through with together an it was when we was talkin about mrs lecks bein give the gingerjar to put on her mantelpiece an keep forever that me an jim an bill we said says we that mrs aleshine should have a gingerjar too havin as much right to one as her mate an that that would be the signalflag or the moniment that wed put up now sir as youre goin to town we ask you to take this money which is the whole lot that was give us an have a gingerjar built jus the size an shape an genral trim of that other one but of no potterystuff for you kin buy em jus like that an that aint what we want we want her built of good oak stout an strong with liveoak knees inside to keep her stiff an save her from bein stove in in case of a collision we want her bottom coppered up above the waterline with real silver an we want a turtleback deck with a round hatchway with a tightfittin hatch jus like common jars we want her sides calked with oakum an well scraped an painted so that with water inside of her or outside of her she wont leak an on the bottom of her so they kin be seen if she keels over we wants the names of me an jim an bill which weve wrote on this piece of paper an on her sides below the waterline on the silver copperin we want the names of all the rest of you an the latitood an longitood of that island an anything out of the logs that might a been kep by any of you as might help to be remembered the thing what happened an then if theres any room left on the copperin an any money lef to pay for em you might have cut on as many anchors an hearts an bits of cable an such like suitable things as would fill up an that jar were goin to give to mrs aleshine to put on her mantelpiece to stay there as long as she lives or anybody that belongs to her an by george sir he added behind his hand although there was nobody to hear if ever them two jars run into each other it wont be mrs aleshines thatll go down  i undertook this commission and in due course of time there came to the village the most astonishing gingerjar that was ever built and which satisfied the three mariners in every particular when it was presented to mrs aleshine her admiration of this work of art her delight in its ownership and her gratitude to the donors were alike boundless  however could i have had the idee said she privately to me that any one of them noble sailormen could have brought himself down to marry elizabeth grootenheimer  it was not long after this happy event that another great joy came to mrs aleshine her son returned from japan he had heard of the loss of the steamer in which his mother and mrs lecks had set sail and was in great trouble of mind until he received a letter from his mother which brought him speedily home he had no intention of settling in meadowville but it had been a long time since he had seen his mother  he was a fine young man handsome and well educated and we were all delighted with him and in a very short time he and lucille dusante being the only young bachelor and maiden of the company became so intimate and superfriendly that it was easy to see that to mrs aleshine might come the unexpected rapture of eventually being the mother of lucille  we stayed much later at meadowville than we had expected even after the little hills and vales had been well covered with snow sleighing and coasting parties led by the lively newcomer offered attractions especially to lucille which bound us to the cheery homes of mrs lecks and mrs aleshine but after a time the dusantes considered it prudent to go to florida for the rest of the winter mr enderton had long since read all the books on his closet shelf and departed for new york and ruth and i determined that we too must move eastward  but before our little company separated mrs aleshines son and lucille dusante had settled it between them that when the springtime came they would set sail for a wedding port this match was a highly satisfactory one to all concerned for mr dusante could scarcely have found a young brotherinlaw who would make his sister so happy and who was at the same time so well fitted by disposition and previous occupation to assist in his increasing business cares  in the spring the dusante family came north again and lucille and her lover were married and then all of us except mr enderton who had obtained a most congenial position as assistant librarian in a public institution seldom visited gathered at meadowville to spend a week or two together after which ruth and i would repair to the new england town which was to be our home and the dusante family the young husband included would set out on a tour partly of business and partly of pleasure through canada and the far northwest  it was arranged that whenever it should be possible lucille and mrs dusante should spend their summers at meadowville and as this would also give her much of the society of her son the heart of mrs aleshine could ask no more  this visit to meadowville was in the onion season and one morning ruth and i sat upon a fence and watched the three sailormen busily at work the soil looked so fine and smooth that one might almost have supposed that it had been holystoned and the three nautical farmers in their tightwaisted loosebottomed trousers their tarpaulin hats and their widecollared shirts were seated on the ground at different points engrossed in the absorbing task of setting out young onions as onions had never been set out before all the careful attention to patient minutiæ which nautical handiwork had taught them was now displayed in their new vocation in a portion of the field which had been first planted the onions had sprouted and we could see evidences of astonishing designs here were anchors in onions hearts in onions brigs barks and schooners in onions and more things pertaining to ships the hearts affections and the raging main outlined in onions than ruth and i could give names to  it seems to me said i that there must have been some sort of enchantment in that little island in the pacific for in one way or another it has made us all very happy  that is true answered ruth and do you know i believe the cause of a great part of that happiness was the board money in the gingerjar  illustration
