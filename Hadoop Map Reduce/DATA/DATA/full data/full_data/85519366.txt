85519366	the ministers charge  or  the apprenticeship of lemuel barker  by  william d howells  author of the rise of silas lapham a modern instance indian summer etc      the ministers charge  or the apprenticeship of lemuel barker     i   on their way back to the farmhouse where they were boarding sewells wife reproached him for what she called his recklessness you had no right she said to give the poor boy false hopes you ought to have discouraged himthat would have been the most merciful wayif you knew the poetry was bad now he will go on building all sorts of castles in the air on your praise and sooner or later they will come tumbling about his earsjust to gratify your passion for saying pleasant things to people  i wish you had a passion for saying pleasant things to me my dear suggested her husband evasively  oh a nice time i should have  i dont know about your nice time but i feel pretty certain of my own how do you knowoh do get up you implacable cripple he broke off to the lame mare he was driving and pulled at the reins  dont saw her mouth cried mrs sewell  well let her get up then and i wont i dont like to saw her mouth but i have to do something when you come down on me with your interminable consequences i dare say the boy will never think of my praise again and besides as i was saying when this animal interrupted me with her illtimed attempts at grazing how do you know that i knew the poetry was bad  how by the sound of your voice i could tell you were dishonest in the dark david  perhaps the boy knew that i was dishonest too suggested sewell  oh no he didnt i could see that he pinned his faith to every syllable  he used a quantity of pins then for i was particularly profuse of syllables i find that it requires no end of them to make the worse appear the better reason to a poet who reads his own verses to you but come now lucy let me off a syllable or two ii have a conscience you know well enough and if i thoughtbut pshaw ive merely cheered a lonely hour for the boy and hell go back to hoeing potatoes tomorrow and that will be the end of it  i hope that will be the end of it said mrs sewell with the darkling reserve of ladies intimate with the designs of providence  well argued her husband who was trying to keep the matter from being serious perhaps he may turn out a poet yet you never can tell where the lightning is going to strike he has some idea of rhyme and some perception of reason andyes some of the lines were musical his general attitude reminded me of piers plowman didnt he recall piers plowman to you  im glad you can console yourself in that way david said his wife relentlessly  the mare stopped again and sewell looked over his shoulder at the house now black in the twilight on the crest of the low hill across the hollow behind them i declare he said the loneliness of that place almost broke my heart there he added as the faint sickle gleamed in the sky above the roof ive got the new moon right over my left shoulder for my pains thats what comes of having a sympathetic nature                                       the boy was looking at the new moon across the broken gate which stopped the largest gap in the tumbled stone wall he still gripped in his hand the manuscript which he had been reading to the minister  there lem called his mothers voice from the house i guess youve seen the last of em for one while im fraid youll take cold out there n the dew come in child  the boy obeyed i was looking at the new moon mother i saw it over my right shoulder did you hearhear him he asked in a broken and husky voicehear how he praised my poetry mother                                       oh do make her get up david cried mrs sewell these mosquitoes are eating me alive  i will saw her mouth all to the finest sort of kindlingwood if she doesnt get up this very instant said sewell jerking the reins so wildly that the mare leaped into a galvanic canter and continued without further urging for twenty paces of course lucy he resumed profiting by the opportunity for conversation which the mares temporary activity afforded i should feel myself greatly to blame if i thought i had gone beyond mere kindness in my treatment of the poor fellow but at first i couldnt realise that the stuff was so bad their saying that he read all the books he could get and was writing every spare moment gave me the idea that he must be some sort of literary genius in the germ and i listened on and on expecting every moment that he was coming to some passage with a little lift or life in it and when he got to the end and hadnt come to it i couldnt quite pull myself together to say so i had gone there so full of the wish to recognise and encourage that i couldnt turn about for the other thing well i shall know another time how to value a rural neighbourhood report of the existence of a local poet usually there is some hardheaded cynic in the community with native perception enough to enlighten the rest as to the true value of the phenomenon but there seems to have been none here i ought to have come sooner to see him and then i could have had a chance to go again and talk soberly and kindly with him and show him gently how much he had mistaken himself oh get up by this time the mare had lapsed again into her habitual absentmindedness and was limping along the dark road with a tendency to come to a full stop from step to step the remorse in the ministers soul was so keen that he could not use her with the cruelty necessary to rouse her flagging energies as he held the reins he flapped his elbows up toward his face as if they were wings and contrived to beat away a few of the mosquitoes with them mrs sewell in silent exasperation fought them from her with the bough which she had torn from an overhanging birchtree  in the morning they returned to boston and sewells parish duties began again he was rather faithfuller and busier in these than he might have been if he had not laid so much stress upon duties of all sorts and so little upon beliefs he declared that he envied the ministers of the good old times who had only to teach their people that they would be lost if they did not do right it was much simpler than to make them understand that they were often to be good for reasons not immediately connected with their present or future comfort and that they could not confidently expect to be lost for any given transgression or even to be lost at all he found it necessary to do his work largely in a personal way by meeting and talking with people and this took up a great deal of his time especially after the summer vacation when he had to get into relations with them anew and to help them recover themselves from the moral lassitude into which people fall during that season of physical recuperation  he was occupied with these matters one morning late in october when a letter came addressed in a handwriting of copybook carefulness but showing in every painstaking stroke the writers want of training which when he read it filled sewell with dismay it was a letter from lemuel barker whom sewell remembered with a pang of selfupbraiding as the poor fellow he had visited with his wife the evening before they left willoughby pastures and it enclosed passages of a long poem which barker said he had written since he got the fall work done the passages were not submitted for sewells criticism but were offered as examples of the character of the whole poem for which the author wished to find a publisher they were not without ideas of a didactic and satirical sort but they seemed so wanting in literary art beyond a mechanical facility of versification that sewell wondered how the writer should have mastered the notion of anything so literary as publication till he came to that part of the letter in which barker spoke of their having had so much sickness in the family that he thought he would try to do something to help along the avowal of this meritorious ambition inflicted another wound upon sewells guilty consciousness but what made his blood run cold was barkers proposal to come down to boston if sewell advised and find a publisher with sewells assistance  this would never do and the minister went to his desk with the intention of despatching a note of prompt and total discouragement but in crossing the room from the chair into which he had sunk with a cheerful curiosity to read the letter he could not help some natural rebellion against the punishment visited upon him he could not deny that he deserved punishment but he thought that this to say the least was very illtimed he had often warned other sinners who came to him in like resentment that it was this very quality of inopportuneness that was perhaps the most sanative and divine property of retribution the eternal justice fell upon us he said at the very moment when we were least able to bear it or thought ourselves so but now in his own case the clearsighted prophet cried out and revolted in his heart it was saturday morning when every minute was precious to him for his sermon and it would take him fully an hour to write that letter it must be done with the greatest sympathy he had seen that this poor foolish boy was very sensitive and yet it must be done with such thoroughness as to cut off all hope of anything like literary achievement for him  at the moment sewell reached his desk with a spirit disciplined to the sacrifice required of it he heard his wifes step outside his study door and he had just time to pull open a drawer throw the letter into it and shut it again before she entered he did not mean finally to conceal it from her but he was willing to give himself breath before he faced her with the fact that he had received such a letter nothing in its way was more terrible to this good man than the righteousness of that good woman in their case as in that of most other couples who cherish an ideal of dutiful living she was the custodian of their potential virtue and he was the instrument often faltering and imperfect of its application to circumstances and without wishing to spare himself too much he was sometimes aware that she did not spare him enough she worked his moral forces as mercilessly as a woman uses the physical strength of a man when it is placed at her direction  what is the matter david she asked with a keen glance at the face he turned upon her over his shoulder  nothing that i wish to talk of at present my dear answered sewell with a boldness that he knew would not avail him if she persisted in knowing  well there would be no time if you did said his wife im dreadfully sorry for you david but its really a case you cant refuse their own minister is taken sick and its appointed for this afternoon at two oclock and the poor thing has set her heart upon having you and you must go in fact i promised you would ill see that youre not disturbed this morning so that youll have the whole forenoon to yourself but i thought id better tell you at once its only a childa little boy you wont have to say much  oh of course i must go answered sewell with impatient resignation and when his wife left the room which she did after praising him and pitying him in a way that was always very sweet to him he saw that he must begin his sermon at once if he meant to get through with it in time and must put off all hope of replying to lemuel barker till monday at least but he chose quite a different theme from that on which he had intended to preach by an immediate inspiration he wrote a sermon on the text the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel in which he taught how great harm could be done by the habit of saying what are called kind things he showed that this habit arose not from goodness of heart or from the desire to make others happy but from the wish to spare onesself the troublesome duty of formulating the truth so that it would perform its heavenly office without wounding those whom it was intended to heal he warned his hearers that the kind things spoken from this motive were so many sins committed against the soul of the flatterer and the soul of him they were intended to flatter they were deceits lies and he besought all within the sound of his voice to try to practise with one another an affectionate sincerity which was compatible not only with the brotherliness of christianity but the politeness of the world he enforced his points with many apt illustrations and he treated the whole subject with so much fulness and fervour that he fell into the error of the literary temperament and almost felt that he had atoned for his wrongdoing by the force with which he had portrayed it  mrs sewell who did not always go to her husbands sermons was at church that day and joined him when some ladies who had lingered to thank him for the excellent lesson he had given them at last left him to her  really david she said i wondered your congregation could keep their countenances while you were going on did you think of that poor boy up at willoughby pastures when you were writing that sermon  yes my dear replied sewell gravely he was in my mind the whole time  well you were rather hard upon yourself and i think i was rather too hard upon you that time though i was so vexed with you but nothing has come of it and i suppose there are cases where people are so lost to common sense that you cant do anything for them by telling them the truth  but youd better tell it all the same said sewell still in a glow of righteous warmth from his atonement and now a sudden temptation to play with fire seized him you wouldnt have excused me if any trouble had come of it  no i certainly shouldnt said his wife but i dont regret it altogether if its made you see what danger you run from that tendency of yours what in the world made you think of it  oh it came into my mind said sewell  he did not find time to write to barker the next day and on recurring to his letter he saw that there was no danger of his taking another step without his advice and he began to postpone it when he had time he was not in the mood he waited for the time and the mood to come together and he also waited for the most favourable moment to tell his wife that he had got that letter from barker and to ask her advice about answering it if it had been really a serious matter he would have told her at once but being the thing it was he did not know just how to approach it after his first concealment he knew that to begin with he would have to account for his mistake in attempting to keep it from her and would have to bear some just upbraiding for this unmanly course and would then be miserably led to the distasteful contemplation of the folly by which he had brought this trouble upon himself sewell smiled to think how much easier it was to make ones peace with ones god than with ones wife and before he had brought himself to the point of answering barkers letter there came a busy season in which he forgot him altogether     ii   one day in the midst of this sewell was called from his study to see some one who was waiting for him in the receptionroom but who sent in no name by the housemaid  i dont know as you remember me the visitor said rising awkwardly as sewell came forward with a smile of inquiry my names barker  barker said the minister with a cold thrill of instant recognition but playing with a factitious uncertainty till he could catch his breath in the presence of the calamity oh yes how do you do he said and then planting himself adventurously upon the commandment to love ones neighbour as onesself he added im very glad to see you  in token of his content he gave barker his hand and asked him to be seated  the young man complied and while sewell waited for him to present himself in some shape that he could grapple with morally he made an involuntary study of his personal appearance that morning before starting from home by the milktrain that left willoughby pastures at 45 barker had given his sunday boots a coat of blacking which he had eked out with stovepolish and he had put on his best pantaloons which he had outgrown and which having been made very tight a season after tight pantaloons had gone out of fashion in boston caught on the tops of his boots and stuck there in spite of his efforts to kick them loose as he stood up and his secret attempts to smooth them down when he had reseated himself he wore a singlebreasted coat of cheap broadcloth fastened across his chest with a carnelian claspbutton of his fathers such as country youth wore thirty years ago and a belated summer scarf of gingham tied in a breadth of knot long since abandoned by polite society  sewell had never thought his wifes receptionroom very splendidly appointed but barker must have been oppressed by it for he sat in absolute silence after resuming his chair and made no sign of intending to open the matter upon which he came in the kindness of his heart sewell could not refrain from helping him on  when did you come to boston he asked with a cheeriness which he was far from feeling  this morning said barker briefly but without the tremor in his voice which sewell expected  youve never been here before i suppose suggested sewell with the vague intention of generalising or particularising the conversation as the case might be  barker abruptly rejected the overture whatever it was i dont know as you got a letter from me a spell back he said  yes i did confessed sewell i did receive that letter he repeated and i ought to have answered it long ago but the fact is he corrected himself when it came to his saying this and said i mean that i put it by intending to answer it when i could do so in the proper way until im very sorry to say i forgot it altogether yes i forgot it and i certainly ask your pardon for my neglect but i cant say that as its turned out i altogether regret it i can talk with you a great deal better than i could write to you in regard to yoursewell hesitated between the words poems and verses and finally saidwork i have blamed myself a great deal he continued wincing under the hurt which he felt that he must be inflicting on the young man as well as himself for not being more frank with you when i saw you at home in september i hope your mother is well  shes middling said barker but my married sister that came to live with us since you was there has had a good deal of sickness in her family her husbands laid up with the rheumatism most of the time  oh murmured sewell sympathetically well i ought to have told you at that time that i could not see much hope of your doing acceptable work in a literary way and if i had supposed that you ever expected to exercise your faculty of versifying to any serious purposefor anything but your own pleasure and entertainmenti should certainly have done so and i tell you now that the specimens of the long poem you have sent me give me even less reason to encourage you than the things you read me at home  sewell expected the audible crash of barkers aircastles to break the silence which the young man suffered to follow upon these words but nothing of the kind happened and for all that he could see barker remained wholly unaffected by what he had said it nettled sewell a little to see him apparently so besotted in his own conceit and he added but i think i had better not ask you to rely altogether upon my opinion in the matter and i will go with you to a publisher and you can get a professional judgment excuse me a moment  he left the room and went slowly upstairs to his wife it appeared to him a very short journey to the third story where he knew she was decking the guestchamber for the visit of a friend whom they expected that evening he imagined himself saying to her when his trial was well over that he did not see why she complained of those stairs that he thought they were nothing at all but this sense of the absurdity of the situation which played upon the surface of his distress flickered and fled at sight of his wife bustling cheerfully about and he was tempted to go down and get barker out of the house and out of boston if possible without letting her know anything of his presence  well said mrs sewell meeting his face of perplexity with a penetrating glance what is it david  nothing that iseverything lemuel barker is here  lemuel barker who is lemuel barker she stood with the pillow sham in her hand which she was just about to fasten on the pillow and sewell involuntarily took note of the fashion in which it was ironed  why surely you remember that simpleton at willoughby pastures if his wife had dropped the pillowsham and sunk into a chair beside the bed fixing him with eyes of speechless reproach if she had done anything dramatic or said anything tragic no matter how unjust or exaggerated sewell could have borne it but she only went on tying the sham on the pillow without a word the fact is he wrote to me some weeks ago and sent me some specimens of a long poem  just before you preached that sermon on the tender mercies of the wicked  yes faltered sewell i had been waiting to show you the letter  you waited a good while david  i knowi know said sewell miserably i was waitingwaiting he stopped and then added with a burst i was waiting till i could put it to you in some favourable light  im glad youre honest about it at last my dear  yes and while i was waiting i forgot barkers letter altogether i put it away somewherei cant recollect just where at the moment but that makes no difference hes here with the whole poem in his pocket now sewell gained a little courage from his wifes forbearance she knew that she could trust him in all great matters and perhaps she thought that for this little sin she would not add to his punishment and what i propose to do is to make a complete thing of it this time of course he went on convicting himself i see that i shall inflict twice the pain that i should have done if i had spoken frankly to him at first and of course there will be the added disappointment and the expense of his coming to boston but he added brightly we can save him any expense while hes here and perhaps i can contrive to get him to go home this afternoon  he wouldnt let you pay for his dinner out of the house anywhere said mrs sewell you must ask him to dinner here  well said sewell with resignation and suspecting that his wife was too much piqued or hurt by his former concealment to ask what he now meant to do about barker he added im going to take him round to a publisher and let him convince himself that theres no hope for him in a literary way  david cried his wife and now she left off adjusting the shams and erecting herself looked at him across the bed you dont intend to do anything so cruel  cruel  yes why should you go and waste any publishers time by getting him to look at such rubbish why should you expose the poor fellow to the mortification of a perfectly needless refusal do you want to shirk the responsibilityto put it on some one else  no you know i dont  well then tell him yourself that it wont do  i have told him  what does he say  he doesnt say anything i cant make out whether he believes me or not  very well then youve done your duty at any rate mrs sewell could not forbear saying also if youd done it at first david there wouldnt have been any of this trouble  thats true owned her husband so very humbly that her heart smote her  well go down and tell him he must stay to dinner and then try to get rid of him the best way you can your time is really too precious david to be wasted in this way you must get rid of him somehow  sewell went back to his guest in the receptionroom who seemed to have remained as immovably in his chair as if he had been a sitting statue of himself he did not move when sewell entered  on second thoughts said the minister i believe i will not ask you to go to a publisher with me as i had intended it would expose you to unnecessary mortification and it would be from my point of view an unjustifiable intrusion upon very busy people i must ask you to take my word for it that no publisher would bring out your poem and it never would pay you a cent if he did the boy remained silent as before and sewell had no means of knowing whether it was from silent conviction or from mulish obstinacy mrs sewell will be down presently she wished me to ask you to stay to dinner we have an early dinner and there will be time enough after that for you to look about the city  i shouldnt like to put you out said barker  oh not at all returned sewell grateful for this sign of animation and not exigent of a more formal acceptance of his invitation you know he said that literature is a trade like every other vocation and that you must serve an apprenticeship if you expect to excel but first of all you must have some natural aptitude for the business you undertake you understand asked sewell for he had begun to doubt whether barker understood anything he seemed so much more stupid than he had at home his faculties were apparently sealed up and he had lost all the personal picturesqueness which he had when he came in out of the barn at his mothers call to receive sewell  yes said the boy  i dont mean continued sewell that i wouldnt have you continue to make verses whenever you have the leisure for it i think on the contrary that it will give a grace to your life which it might otherwise lack we are all in daily danger of being barbarised by the sordid details of life the constantly recurring little duties which must be done but which we must not allow to become the whole of life sewell was so much pleased with this thought when it had taken form in words that he made a mental note of it for future use we must put a border of pinks around the potatopatch as emerson would say or else the potatopatch is no better than a field of thistles perhaps because the logic of this figure rang a little false sewell hastened to add but there are many ways in which we can prevent the encroachment of those little duties without being tempted to neglect them which would be still worse i have thought a good deal about the condition of our young men in the country and i have sympathised with them in what seems their want of opportunity their lack of room for expansion i have often wished that i could do something for themhelp them in their doubts and misgivings and perhaps find some way out of the trouble for them i regret this tendency to the cities of the young men from the country i am sure that if we could give them some sort of social and intellectual life at home they would not be so restless and dissatisfied  sewell felt as if he had been preaching to a dead wall but now the wall opened and a voice came out of it saying you mean something to occupy their minds  exactly so cried sewell something to occupy their minds now he continued with a hope of getting into some sort of human relations with his guest which he had not felt before why shouldnt a young man on a farm take up some scientific study like geology for instance which makes every inch of earth vocal every rock historic and the waste places social barker looked so blankly at him that he asked again you understand  yes said barker but having answered sewells personal question he seemed to feel himself in no wise concerned with the general inquiry which sewell had made and he let it lie where sewell had let it drop but the minister was so well pleased with the fact that barker had understood anything of what he had said that he was content to let the notion he had thrown out take its chance of future effect and rising said briskly come upstairs with me into my study and i will show you a picture of agassiz its a very good photograph  he led the way out of the receptionroom and tripped lightly in his slippered feet up the steps against which barker knocked the toes of his clumsy boots he was not large nor naturally loutish but the heaviness of the country was in every touch and movement he dropped the photograph twice in his endeavour to hold it between his stiff thumb and finger  sewell picked it up each time for him and restored it to his faltering hold when he had securely lodged it there he asked sweetly did you ever hear what agassiz said when a scheme was once proposed to him by which he could make a great deal of money  i dont know as i did replied barker  but gentlemen ive no time to make money barker received the anecdote in absolute silence standing helplessly with the photograph in his hand and sewell with a hasty sigh forbore to make the application to the ordinary american ambition to be rich that he had intended thats a photograph of the singer nilsson he said cataloguing the other objects on the chimneypiece she was a peasant you know a country girl in norway thats grévy the president of the french republic his father was a peasant lincoln of course sforza throwing his hoe into the oak he said explaining the picture that had caught barkers eye on the wall above the mantel he was working in the field when a band of adventurers came by and he tossed his hoe at the tree if it fell to the ground he would keep on hoeing if it caught in the branches and hung there he would follow the adventurers it caught and he went with the soldiers and became duke of milan i like to keep the pictures of these great originals about me said sewell because in our time when we refer so constantly to law we are apt to forget that god is creative as well as operative he used these phrases involuntarily they slipped from his tongue because he was in the habit of saying this about these pictures and he made no effort to adapt them to barkers comprehension because he could not see that the idea would be of any use to him he went on pointing out the different objects in the quiet room and he took down several books from the shelves that covered the whole wall and showed them to barker who however made no effort to look at them for himself and did not say anything about them he did what sewell bade him do in admiring this thing or that but if he had been an indian he could not have regarded them with a greater reticence sewell made him sit down from time to time but in a sitting posture barkers silence became so deathlike that sewell hastened to get him on his legs again and to walk him about from one point to another as if to keep life in him at the end of one of these otherwise aimless excursions mrs sewell appeared and infused a gleam of hope into her husbands breast apparently she brought none to barker or perhaps he did not conceive it polite to show any sort of liveliness before a lady he did what he could with the hand she gave him to shake and answered the brief questions she put to him about his family to precisely the same effect as he had already reported its condition to sewell  dinners ready now said mrs sewell for all comment she left the expansiveness of sympathy and gratulation to her husband on most occasions and on this she felt that she had less than the usual obligation to make polite conversation her two children came downstairs after her and as she unfolded her napkin across her lap after grace she said this is my son alfred mr barker and this is edith barker took the acquaintance offered in silence the young sewells smiled with the wise kindliness of children taught to be good to all manner of strange guests and the girl cumbered the helpless country boy with offers of different dishes  mr sewell as he cut at the roast beef lengthwise being denied by his wife a pantomimic prayer to be allowed to cut it crosswise tried to make talk with barker about the weather at willoughby pastures it had been a very dry summer and he asked if the fall rains had filled up the springs he said he really forgot whether it was an apple year he also said that he supposed they had dug all their turnips by this time he had meant to say potatoes when he began but he remembered that he had seen the farmers digging their potatoes before he came back to town and so he substituted turnips afterwards it seemed to him that dig was not just the word to use in regard to the harvesting of turnips he wished he had said got your turnips in but it appeared to make no difference to barker who answered yes sir and no sir and yes sir and let each subject drop with that     iii   the silence grew so deep that the young sewells talked together in murmurs and the clicking of the knives on the plates became painful sewell kept himself from looking at barker whom he nevertheless knew to be changing his knife and fork from one hand to the other as doubt after doubt took him as to their conventional use and to be getting very little good of his dinner in the process of settling these questions the doorbell rang and the sound of a whispered conference between the visitor and the servant at the threshold penetrated to the diningroom some one softly entered and then mrs sewell called out yes yes come in come in miss vane she jumped from her chair and ran out into the hall where she was heard to kiss her visitor she reappeared still holding her by the hand and then miss vane shook hands with sewell saying in a tone of cordial liking how dye do and to each of the young people as she shook hands in turn with them how dye do dear she was no longer so pretty as she must have once been but an air of distinction and a delicate charm of manner remained to her from her fascinating youth  young sewell pushed her a chair to the table and she dropped softly into it after acknowledging barkers presentation by mrs sewell with a kindly glance that probably divined him  you must dine with us said mrs sewell you can call it lunch  no i cant mrs sewell said miss vane i could once and should have said with great pleasure when i went away that i had been lunching at the sewells but i cant now ive reformed what have you got for dinner  roast beef said sewell  nothing i dislike more replied miss vane what else she put on her glasses and peered critically about the table  stewed tomatoes baked sweet potatoes macaroni  how unimaginative what are you going to have afterwards  cottage pudding  the very climax of the commonplace well miss vane began to pull off her gloves and threw her veil back over her shoulder i will dine with you but when i say dine and people ask me to explain i shall have to say why the sewells still dine at one oclock you know and laugh over your oldfashioned habits with them i should like to do differently and to respect the sacredness of broken bread and that sort of thing but im trying to practise with every one an affectionate sincerity which is perfectly compatible not only with the brotherliness of christianity but the politeness of the world miss vane looked demurely at mrs sewell i cant make any exceptions  the ladies both broke into a mocking laugh in which sewell joined with sheepish reluctance after all one does not like to be derided even by ones dearest friends  as soon as i hear my other little sins denounced from the pulpit im going to stop using profane language and carrying away peoples spoons in my pocket  the ladies seemed to think this also a very good joke and his children laughed in sympathy but sewell hung his head barker sat bolt upright behind his plate and stared at miss vane i never have been all but named in church before she concluded and ive heard others say the same  why didnt you come to complain sooner asked sewell  well i have been away ever since that occasion i went down the next day to newport and ive been there ever since admiring the ribbonplanting  on the lawns or on the ladies asked sewell  both and sowing broadcast the seeds of plain speaking i dont know what newport will be in another year if they all take root  i dare say it will be different said sewell im not sure it will be worse he plucked up a little spirit and added now you see of how little importance you really are in the community you have been gone these three weeks and your own pastor didnt know you were out of town  yes you did david interposed his wife i told you miss vane was away two weeks ago  did you well i forgot it immediately the fact was of no consequence one way or the other how do you like that as a bit of affectionate sincerity  i like it immensely said miss vane its delicious i only wish i could believe you were honest she leaned back and laughed into her handkerchief while sewell regarded her with a face in which his mortification at being laughed at was giving way to a natural pleasure at seeing miss vane enjoy herself what do you think she asked since youre in this mood of exasperated veracityor pretend to beof the flower charity  do you mean by the barrel or the single sack the graham or the best haxall or the healthfood coldblast asked sewell  miss vane lost her power of answering in another peal of laughter sobering off and breaking down again before she could say i mean cut flowers for patients and prisoners  oh that kind i dont think a single pansy would have an appreciable effect upon a burglar perhaps a bunch of forgetmenots might or a few lilies of the valley carelessly arranged as to the influence of a graceful little boutonnière in cases of rheumatism or cholera morbus it might be efficacious but i cant really say  how perfectly cynical cried miss vane dont you know how much good the flower mission has accomplished among the deserving poor hundreds of bouquets are distributed every day they prevent crime  that shows how susceptible the deserving poor are i dont find that a bowl of the most expensive and delicate roses in the centre of a dinnertable tempers the asperity of the conversation when it turns upon the absent but perhaps it oughtnt to do so  i dont know about that said miss vane but if you had an impulsive niece to supply with food for the imagination you would be very glad of anything that seemed to combine practical piety and picturesque effect  oh if you mean that began sewell more soberly and his wife leaned forward with an interest in the question which she had not felt while the mere joking went on  yes when sibyl came in this morning with an imperative demand to be allowed to go off and do good with flowers in the homes of virtuous poverty as well as the hospitals and prisons i certainly felt as if there had been an interposition if you will allow me to say so  miss vane still had her joking air but a note of anxiety had crept into her voice  i dont think it will do the sick and poor any harm said sewell and it may do sibyl some good he smiled a little in adding it may afford her varied energies a little scope  miss vane shook her head and some lines of age came into her face which had not shown themselves there before and you would advise letting her go into it she asked  by all means replied sewell but if shes going to engage actively in the missionary work i think youd better go with her on her errands of mercy  oh of course shes going to do good in person what she wants is the sensation of doing goodof seeing and hearing the results of her beneficence shed care very little about it if she didnt  oh i dont know that you can say that replied sewell in deprecation of this extreme view i dont believe he continued that she would object to doing good for its own sake  of course she wouldnt david who in the world supposed she would demanded his wife bringing him up roundly at this sign of wandering and miss vane laughed wildly  and is this what your doctrine of sincerity comes to this fulsomeness youre very little better than one of the wicked it seems to me well i hoped that you would approve of my letting sibyl take this thing up but such unbounded encouragement  oh i dont wish to flatter said sewell in the spirit of her raillery it will be very well for her to go round with flowers but dont let her he continued seriouslydont let her imagine its more than an innocent amusement it would be a sort of hideous mockery of the good we ought to do one another if there were supposed to be anything more than a kindly thoughtfulness expressed in such a thing  oh if sibyl doesnt feel that its real for the time being she wont care anything about it she likes to lose herself in the illusion she says  well said sewell with a slight shrug then we must let her get what good she can out of it as an exercise of the sensibilities  o my dear exclaimed his wife you dont mean anything so abominable as that ive heard you say that the worst thing about fiction and the theatre was that they brought emotions into play that ought to be sacred to real occasions  did i say that well i must have been right i  barker made a scuffling sound with his boots under the table and rose to his feet i guess he said i shall have to be going  they had all forgotten him and sewell felt as if he had neglected this helpless guest why no you mustnt go i was in hopes we might do something to make the day pleasant to you i intended proposing  yes his wife interrupted believing that he meant to give up one of his precious afternoons to barker and hastening to prevent the sacrifice my son will show you the public garden and the common and go about the town with you she rose too and young sewell accustomed to suffer silently acquiesced if your train isnt to start very soon  i guess i better be going said barker and mrs sewell now gave her husband a look conveying her belief that barker would be happier if they let him go at the same time she frowned upon the monstrous thought of asking him to stay the night with them which she detected in sewells face  she allowed him to say nothing but im sorry but if you really must  i guess i better persisted barker he got himself somehow to the door where he paused a moment and contrived to pant well good day and without effort at more cordial leavetaking passed out  sewell followed him and helped him find his hat and made him shake hands he went with him to the door and beginning to suffer afresh at the wrong he had done barker he detained him at the threshold if you still wish to see a publisher mr barker i will gladly go with you  oh not at all not at all i guess i dont want to see any publisher this afternoon well good afternoon he turned away from sewells remorseful pursuit and clumsily hurrying down the steps he walked up the street and round the next corner sewell stood watching him in rueful perplexity shading his eyes from the mild october sun with his hand and some moments after barker had disappeared he remained looking after him  when he rejoined the ladies in the diningroom they fell into a conscious silence  have you been telling lucy he asked  yes ive been telling david it was the only way did you offer to go with him to a publisher again  yes i did it was the only way said sewell  miss vane and his wife both broke into a cry of laughter the former got her breath first so that was the origin of the famous sermon that turned all our heads grey with good resolutions sewell assented with a sickly grin what in the world made you encourage him  my goodness of heart which i didnt take the precaution of mixing with goodness of head before i used it  everything was food for miss vanes laugh even this confession but what is the natural history of the boy how came he to write poetry what do you suppose he means by it  that isnt so easy to say as to his natural history he lives with his mother in a tumbledown unpainted wooden house in the deepest fastness of willoughby pastures lucy and i used to drive by it and wonder what kind of people inhabited that solitude there were milk cans scattered round the dooryard and the monday we were there a povertystricken wash flapped across it the thought of the place preyed upon me till one day i asked about it at the postoffice and the postmistress told me that the boy was quite a literary character and read everything he could lay his hands on and sat up nights writing poetry it seemed to me a very clear case of genius and the postmistresss facts rankled in my mind till i couldnt stand it any longer then i went to see him i suppose lucy has told you the rest  yes mrs sewell has told me the rest but still i dont see how he came to write poetry i believe it doesnt pay even in extreme cases of genius  ah but thats just what this poor fellow didnt know he must have read somewhere in some deleterious newspaper about the sale of some large edition of a poem and have had his own wild hopes about it i dont say his work didnt show sense it even showed some rude strength of a didactic satirical sort but it certainly didnt show poetry he might have taken up painting by a little different chance and when it was once known about the neighbourhood that he wrote poetry his vanity was flattered  yes i see but wasnt there any kind soul to tell him that he was throwing his time away  it appears not  and even the kind soul from boston who visited him suggested mrs sewell go on david  visited him in spite of his wifes omniscienceeven the kind soul from boston paltered with this plain duty even he to spare himself the pain of hurting the boys feelings tried to find some of the lines better than others and left him with the impression that he had praised them  well that was pretty bad said miss vane you had to tell him today i suppose that there was no hope for him  yes i had to tell him at last after letting him waste his time and money in writing more stuff and coming to boston with it ive put him to needless shame and ive inflicted suffering upon him that i cant lighten in the least by sharing  no thats the most discouraging thing about pitying people it does them no manner of good said miss vane and just hurts you dont you think that in an advanced civilisation we shall cease to feel compassion why dont you preach against common pity as you did against common politeness  well it isnt quite such a crying sin yet but really really exclaimed sewell the world seems so put together that i believe we ought to think twice before doing a good action  david said his wife warningly  oh let him go on cried miss vane with a laugh im proof against his monstrous doctrines go on mr sewell  what i mean is this sewell pushed himself back in his chair and then stopped  is what prompted both the ladies  why suppose the boy really had some literary faculty should i have had any right to encourage it he was very well where he was he fed the cows and milked them and carried the milk to the crossroads where the dealer collected it and took it to the train that was his life with the incidental facts of cutting the hay and fodder and bedding the cattle and his experience never went beyond it i doubt if his fancy ever did except in some wild mistaken excursion why shouldnt he have been left to this condition he ate he slept he fulfilled his use which of us does more  how would you like to have been in his place asked his wife  i couldnt put myself in his place and therefore i oughtnt to have done anything to take him out of it answered sewell  it seems to me thats very unamerican said miss vane i thought we had prospered up to the present point by taking people out of their places  yes we have replied the minister and sometimes it seems to me the result is hideous i dont mind people taking themselves out of their places but if the particles of this mighty cosmos have been adjusted by the divine wisdom what are we to say of the temerity that disturbs the least of them  im sure i dont know said miss vane rising im almost afraid to stir in view of the possible consequences but i cant sit here all day and if mrs sewell will excuse me ill go at once yes i guess i better be going as your particle barker says let us hope hell get safely back to his infinitesimal little crevice in the cosmos hes a very pretty particle dont you think that thick coarse wavy black hair growing in a natural bang over his forehead would make his fortune if he were a certain kind of young lady  they followed her to the door chatting and sewell looked quickly out when he opened it for her  as she shook his hand she broke into another laugh really you looked as if you were afraid of finding him on the steps  if i could only have got near the poor boy said sewell to his wife as they returned withindoors if i could only have reached him where he lives as our slang says but do what i would i couldnt find any common ground where we could stand together we were as unlike as if we were of two different species i saw that everything i said bewildered him more and more he couldnt understand me our education is unchristian our civilisation is pagan they both ought to bring us in closer relations with our fellowcreatures and they both only put us more widely apart every one of us dwells in an impenetrable solitude we understand each other a little if our circumstances are similar but if they are different all our words leave us dumb and unintelligible     iv   barker walked away from the ministers door without knowing where he was going and with a heart full of hot pain he burned with a confused sense of shame and disappointment and anger it had turned out just as his mother had said mr sewell would be mighty different in boston from what he was that day at willoughby pastures there he made barker think everything of his poetry and now he pretended to tell him that it was not worth anything and he kept hinting round that barker had better go back home and stay there did he think he would have left home if there had been anything for him to do there had not he as much as told him that he was obliged to find something to make a living by and help the rest what was he afraid of was he afraid that barker wanted to come and live off him he could show him that there was no great danger if he had known how he would have refused even to stay to dinner  what made him keep the pictures of these people who had got along if he thought no one else ought to try barker guessed to himself that if that mr agassiz had had to get a living off the farm at willoughby pastures he would have found time to make money what did mr sewell mean by speaking of that nilsson lady by her surname without any miss or mrs was that the way people talked in boston  mr sewell had talked to him as if he were a baby and did not know anything and barker was mad at himself for having stayed half a minute after the minister had owned up that he had got the letter he wrote him he wished he had said well thats all i want of you sir and walked right out but he had not known how to do it did they think it was very polite to go on talking with that woman who laughed so much and forget all about him pretty poor sort of manners to eat with her bonnet on and tell them she hated their victuals  barker tried to rage against them in these thoughts but at the bottom of all was a simple grief that he should have lost the friend whom he thought he had in the minister the friend he had talked of and dreamed of ever since he had seen and heard him speak those cordial words the friend he had trusted through all and had come down to boston counting upon so much the tears came into his eyes as he stumbled and scuffled along the brick pavements with his uncouth country walk  he was walking up a straight long street with houses just alike on both sides and bits of grass before them that sometimes were gay with late autumn flowers a horsecar track ran up the middle and the cars seemed to be tinkling by all the time and people getting on and off they were mostly ladies and children and they were very well dressed sometimes they stared at barker as they crossed his way in entering or issuing from the houses but generally no one appeared to notice him in some of the windows there were flowers in painted pots and in others little marble images on stands  there were more images in the garden that barker came to presently an image of washington on horseback and some orator speaking with his hand up and on top of a monument a kind of turk holding up a man that looked sick the man was almost naked but he was not so bad as the image of a woman in a granite basin it seemed to barker that it ought not to be allowed there a great many people of all kinds were passing through the garden and after some hesitation he went in too and walked over the bridge that crossed the pond in the middle of the garden where there were rowboats and boats with images of swans on them barker made a sarcastic reflection that boston seemed to be a great place for images and passed rather hurriedly through the garden on the other side of the bridge there were beds of all kinds of flowers scattered about and they were hardly touched by the cold yet if he had been in better heart he would have liked to look round a little but he felt strange being there all alone and he felt very lowspirited  he wondered if this were the public garden that mrs sewell had spoken of and if that kind of grove across the street were the common he felt much more at home in it as he wandered up and down the walks and finally sat down on one of the iron benches beside the path at first he obscurely doubted whether he had any right to do so unless he had a lady with him most of the seats were occupied by couples who seemed to be courting but he ventured finally to take one nobody disturbed him and so he remained  it was a beautiful october afternoon the wind warm and dry caught the yellow leaves from the trees overhead in little whiffs and blew them about the grass which the fall rains had made as green as may and a pensive golden light streamed through the long loose boughs and struck across the slopes of the common slight buggies flashed by on the street near which he sat and glistening carriages with drivers dressed out in uniform like soldiers rumbled down its slope  while he sat looking now at the street and now at the people sauntering and hurrying to and fro in the common he tried to decide a question that had mixed itself up with the formless resentment he had felt ever since mr sewell played him false it had got out in the neighbourhood that he was going to boston before he left home his mother must have told it and people would think he was to be gone a long time he had warned his mother that he did not know when he should be back before he started in the morning and he knew that she would repeat his words to everybody who stopped to ask about him during the day with what she had said to him in reply you better come home tonight lem and ill have ye a good hot supper waitin for ye  the question was whether he should go back on the five oclock train which would reach willoughby centre after dark and house himself from public ignominy for one night at least or whether selfrespect did not demand that he should stay in boston for twentyfour hours at any rate and see if something would not happen he had now no distinct hope of anything but his pride and shame were holding him fast while the homesickness tugged at his heart and made him almost forget the poverty that had spurred him to the adventure of coming to boston he could see the cows coming home through the swampy meadow as plain as if they were coming across the common his mother was calling them she and his sister were going to milk in his absence and he could see her now how she looked going out to call the cows in her bare grey head gaunt of neck and cheek in the ugly bloomer dress in which she was not grotesque to his eyes though it usually affected strangers with stupefaction or alarm but it all seemed far away as far as if it were in another planet that he had dropped out of he was divided from it by his failure and disgrace he thought he must stay and try for something he did not know what but he could not make up his mind to throw away his money for nothing at the hotel down by the depot where he had left his bag they were going to make him pay fifty cents for just a room alone  any them beats round here been trying to come their games on you  at first barker could not believe himself accosted though the young man who spoke stood directly in front of him and seemed to be speaking to him he looked up and the young man added heigh  beats i dont know what you mean said barker  confidence sharps young feller theyre round everywheres and dont you forget it move up a little  barker was sitting in the middle of the bench and at this he pushed away from the young man who had dropped himself sociably beside him he wore a pair of black pantaloons very tight in the legs and widening at the foot so as almost to cover his boots his coat was deeply braided and his waistcoat was cut low so that his plastron scarf hung out from the shirtbosom which it would have done well to cover  i tell you bostons full of em he said excitedly one of em come up to me just now and says he seems to me ive seen you before but i cant place you oh yes says i ill tell you where it was i happened to be in the police court one morning when they was sendin you up for three months i tell you he got round the corner might a played checkers on his coat tail why what do you suppose would been the next thing if i hadnt have let him know i saw through him demanded the young man of barker who listened to this adventure with imperfect intelligence hed a said haint i seen you down kennebunk way someres and when i said no im from leominster or whereever i was from if i was green hed say oh yes so it was leominster hows the folks and hed try to get me to think that he was from leominster too and then hed want me to go off and see the sights with him and pretty soon hed meet a feller that ud dun him for that money he owed him and hed say he hadnt got anything with him but a cheque for forty dollars and the other fellerd say hed got to have his money and hed kind of insinuate it was all a putup job about the cheque for forty dollars anyway and that ud make the first feller mad and hed take out the check and ask him what he thought o that and the other fellerd say well it was a good cheque but it want money and he wanted money and then the first fellerd say well come along to the bank and get your money and the otherd say the bank was shut well then the first fellerd say well sir i aint agoin to ask any favour of you how much is your bill and the other fellerd say ten dollars or fifteen or may be twentyfive if they thought i had that much and the first fellerd say well heres a gentleman from up my way and i guess hell advance me that much on my cheque if i make it worth his while he knows me and the first thing you knowhes been treatin you and so polite showin you round and ast you to go to the theayteryou advance the money and you keep on with the first feller and pretty soon he asks you to hold up a minute he wants to go back and get a cigar and he goes round the corner and you hold up and hold up and in about a half an hour or may be less time you begin to smell a rat and you go for a policeman and the next morning you find your name in the papers one more unfortunate you look out for em young feller wish i had let that one go on till he done something so i could handed him over to the cops its a shame theyre allowed to go round when the cops knows em hello there comes my mate now the young man spoke as if they had been talking of his mate and expecting him and another young man his counterpart in dress but of a sullen and heavy demeanour very unlike his own brisk excitement approached flapping a banknote in his hand i just been tellin this young feller about that beat you know  oh hes all right said the mate just seen him down on tremont street between two cops must ha caught him in the act  you dont say so well thats good anyway why didnt you get it changed demanded the young man with painful surprise as his mate handed him the banknote  no i didnt i been to moren twenty places and there aint no small bills nowhere the last place i offered em twentyfive cents if theyd change it  why didnt you offer em fifty id a give fifty and glad to do it why ive got to have this bill changed  well im sorry for you said the mate with ironical sympathy because i dont see how youre goin to git it done wont you move up a little bit young feller he sat down on the other side of barker im about tired out he took his head between his hands in sign of extreme fatigue and drooped forward with his eyes fixed on the ground  lemuels heart beat fifty cents would pay for his lodging and he could stay till the next day and prolong the chance of something turning up without too sinful a waste of money  how much is the bill he asked  ten dollars said the young man despondently  and will you give me fifty cents if i change it  well i said id give fifty cents replied the young man gloomily and i will  its a bargain said lemuel promptly and he took from his pocket the two fivedollar notes that formed his store and gave them to the young man  he looked at them critically how do i know theyre good he asked youre a stranger to me young feller and how do i know you aint tryin to beat me he looked sternly at lemuel but here the mate interposed  how does he know that you aint tryin to beat him he asked contemptuously i never saw such a feller as you are here you make me run half over town to change that bill and now when a gentleman offers to break it for you you have to go and accuse him of tryin to put off counterfeit money on you if i was him id see you furder  oh well i dont want any words about it here take your money said the young man as long as i said id do it ill do it heres your half a dollar he put it with the banknote into lemuels hand and rose briskly you stay here jimmy till i come back i wont be gone a minute  he walked down the mall and went out of the gate on tremont street then the mate came to himself why ive let him go off with both them bills now and he owes me one of em with that he rose from lemuels side and hurried after his vanishing comrade before he was out of sight he had broken into a run  lemuel sat looking after them his satisfaction in the affair alloyed by dislike of the haste with which it had been transacted his rustic mind worked slowly it was not wholly content even with a result in its own favour where the process had been so rapid he was scarcely able to fix the point at which the talk ceased to be a warning against beats and became his opportunity for speculation he did not feel quite right at having taken the fellows halfdollar and yet a bargain was a bargain nevertheless if the fellow wanted to rue it lemuel would give him fifteen minutes to come back and get his money and he sat for that space of time where the others had left him he was not going to be mean and he might have waited a little longer if it had not been for the behaviour of two girls who came up and sat down on the same bench with him they could not have been above fifteen or sixteen years old and lemuel thought they were very pretty but they talked so and laughed so loud and scuffled with each other for the paper of chocolate which one of them took out of her pocket that lemuel after first being abashed by the fact that they were city girls became disgusted with them he was a stickler for propriety of behaviour among girls his mother had taught him to despise anything like carryingon among them and at twenty he was as severely virginal in his morality as if he had been twelve  people looked back at these tomboys when they had got by and some shabby young fellows exchanged saucy speeches with them when lemuel got up and walked away in reproving dignity one of the hoydens bounced into his place and they both sent a cry of derision after him but lemuel would not give them the satisfaction of letting them know that he heard them and at the same time he was not going to let them suppose that they had driven him away he went very slowly down to the street where a great many horsecars were passing to and fro and waited for one marked fitchburg lowell and eastern depots he was not going to take it but he meant to follow it on its way to those stations in the neighbourhood of which was the hotel where he had left his travellingbag he had told them that he might take a room there or he might not now since he had this halfdollar extra he thought that he would stay for the night it probably would not be any cheaper at the other hotels  he ran against a good many people in trying to keep the car in sight but by leaving the sidewalk from time to time where it was most crowded he managed not to fall very much behind the worst was that the track went crooking and turning about so much in different streets that he began to lose faith in its direction and to be afraid in spite of the sign on its side that the car was not going to the depots after all but it came in sight of them at last and then lemuel blown with the chase but secure of his ground stopped and rested himself against the side of a wall to get his breath the pursuit had been very exhausting and at times it had been mortifying for here and there people who saw him running after the car had supposed he wished to board it and in their goodnature had hailed and stopped it after this had happened twice or thrice lemuel perceived that he was an object of contempt to the passengers in the car but he did not know what to do about it he was not going to pay six cents to ride when he could just as well walk and on the other hand he dared not lose sight of the car for he had no other means of finding his way back to his hotel  but he was all right now as he leaned against the housewall panting and mopping his forehead with his handkerchief he saw his hotel a little way down the street and he did not feel anxious about it  gave you the slip after all said a passer who had apparently been interested in lemuels adventure  oh i didnt want to catch it said lemuel  ah merely fond of exercise said the stranger well its a very good thing if you dont overdo it he walked by and then after a glance at lemuel over his shoulder he returned to him may i ask why you wanted to chase the car if you didnt want to catch it  lemuel hesitated he did not like to confide in a total stranger this gentleman looked kind and friendly but he was all the more likely on that account to be a beat the expression was probably such as a beat would put on in approaching his intended prey oh nothing said lemuel evasively  i beg your pardon said the stranger and he walked away with what lemuel could only conjecture was the air of a baffled beat  he waited till he was safely out of sight and then followed on down the street towards his hotel when he reached it he walked boldly up to the clerks desk and said that he guessed he would take a room for the night and gave him the check for his bag that he had received in leaving it there  the clerk wrote the number of a room against lemuels name in the register and then glanced at the bag it was a large bag of oil cloth a kind of bag which is by nature lank and hollow and must be made almost insupportably heavy before it shows any signs of repletion the shirt and pair of everyday pantaloons which lemuel had dropped that morning into its voracious maw made no apparent effect there as the clerk held it up and twirled it on the crook of his thumb  i guess i shall have to get the money for that room in advance he said regarding the bag very critically however he might have been wounded by the doubt of his honesty or his solvency implied in this speech lemuel said nothing but took out his tendollar note and handed it to the clerk the latter said apologetically its one of our rules where there isnt baggage and then glancing at the note he flung it quickly across the counter to lemuel that wont do  wont do repeated lemuel taking up the bill  counterfeit said the clerk      v   lemuel stretched the note between his hands and pored so long upon it that the clerk began to tap impatiently with his fingertips on the register it wont go faltered the boy looking up at the clerks sharp face  it wont go here replied the clerk got anything else  lemuels head whirled the air seemed to darken around him as he pored again upon the note and turned it over and over two tears scalded their way down his cheeks and his lips twitched when the clerk added some beats been workin you but he made no answer his heart was hot with shame and rage and heavy with despair he put the note in his pocket and took his bag and walked out of the hotel he had not money enough to get home with now and besides he could not bear to go back in the disgrace of such calamity it would be all over the neighbourhood as soon as his mother could tell it she might wish to keep it to herself for his sake but she could not help telling it to the first person and every person she saw she would have to go over to the neighbours to tell it in a dreary homesick longing he saw her crossing the familiar meadows that lay between the houses bareheaded in her apron her face set and rigid with wonder at what had happened to her lem he could not bear the thought he would rather die he would rather go to sea this idea flashed into his mind as he lifted his eyes aimlessly and caught sight of the tall masts of the coalships lying at the railroad wharves and he walked quickly in the direction of them so as not to give himself time to think about it so as to do it now quick right off but he found his way impeded by all sorts of obstacles a gate closed across the street to let some trains draw in and out of a station then a lot of string teams and slow heavyladen trucks got before him with a turmoil of express wagons herdics and hacks in which he was near being run over and was yelled at sworn at and laughed at as he stood bewildered with his lank bag in his hand he turned and walked back past the hotel again he felt it an escape after all not to have gone to sea and now a hopeful thought struck him he would go back to the common and watch for those fellows who fooled him and set the police on them and get his money from them they might come prowling round again to fool somebody else he looked out for a car marked like the one he had followed down from the common and began to follow it on its return he got ahead of the car whenever it stopped so as to be spared the shame of being seen to chase it and he managed to keep it in sight till he reached the common there he walked about looking for those scamps and getting pushed and hustled by the people who now thronged the paths at last he was tired out and on the beacon street mall where he had first seen those fellows he found the very seat where they had all sat together and sank into it the seats were mostly vacant now a few persons sat there reading their evening papers as the light began to wane they folded up their papers and walked away and their places were filled by young men who at once put their arms round the young women with them and seemed to be courting they did not say much if anything they just sat there it made lemuel ashamed to look at them he thought they ought to have more sense he looked away but he could not look away from them all there were so many of them he was all the time very hungry but he thought he ought not to break into his halfdollar as long as he could help it or till there was no chance left of catching those fellows the night came on the gaslamps were lighted and some lights higher up like moonlight off on the other paths projected long glares into the night and made the gas look sickly and yellow sitting still there while it grew later he did not feel quite so hungry but he felt more tired than ever there were not so many people around now and he did not see why he should not lie down on that seat and rest himself a little he made feints of reclining on his arm at first to see if he were noticed then he stretched himself out with his bag under his head and his hands in his pockets clutching the money which he meant to make those fellows take back he got a gaslamp in range to keep him awake and lay squinting his eyes to meet the path of rays running down from it to him then he shivered and rose up with a sudden start the dull rich dawn was hanging under the trees around him while the electric lamps like paler moons now still burned among their tops the sparrows bickered on the grass and the gravel of the path around him  he could not tell where he was at first but presently he remembered and looked for his bag it was gone and the money was gone out of both his pockets he dropped back upon the seat and leaning his head against the back he began to cry for utter despair he had hardly ever cried since he was a baby and he would not have done it now but there was no one there to see him  when he had his cry out he felt a little better and he got up and went to the pond in the hollow and washed his hands and face and wiped them on the handkerchief his mother had ironed for him to use at the ministers it was still in the folds she had given it as he shook it out rising up he saw that people were asleep on all the benches round the pond he looked hopelessly at them to see if any of them were those fellows but he could not find them he seemed to be the only person awake on the common and wandered out of it and down through the empty streets filled at times with the moony light of the waning electrics and at times merely with the grey dawn a man came along putting out the gas and some milkcarts rattled over the pavement by and by a marketwagon with the leaves and roots of cabbages sticking out from the edges of the canvas that covered it came by and lemuel followed it he did not know what else to do and it went so slow that he could keep up though the famine that gnawed within him was so sharp sometimes that he felt as if he must fall down he was going to drop into a doorway and rest but when he came to it he found on an upper step a man folded forward like a limp bundle snoring in a fetid sodden sleep and shocked into new strength he hurried on at last the wagon came to a place that he saw was a market there were no buyers yet but men were flitting round under the long arcades of the markethouses with lanterns under their arms among boxes and barrels of melons apples potatoes onions beans carrots and other vegetables which the country carts as they arrived continually unloaded the smell of peaches and cantaloupes filled the air and made lemuel giddy as he stood and looked at the abundance the men were not saying much now and then one of them priced something the owner pretended to figure on it and then they fell into a playful scuffle but all silently a black cat lay luxuriously asleep on the canvas top of a barrel of melons and the man who priced the melons asked if the owner would throw the cat in there was a butchers cart laden with carcasses of sheep and one of the men asked the butcher if he called that stuff mutton no imitation said the butcher they all seemed to be very goodnatured lemuel thought he would ask for an apple but he could not  the neighbouring restaurants began to send forth the smell of breakfast and he dragged up and down till he could bear it no longer and then went into one of them meaning to ask for some job by which he could pay for a meal but his shame again would not let him he looked at the fat whiteaproned boy drawing coffee hot from a huge urn and serving a countryman with a beefsteak it was close and sultry in there the open sugarbowl was black with flies and a scent of decaying meat came from the next cellar like some nice fresh doughnuts said the boy to lemuel he did not answer he looked around as if he had come in search of some one then he went out and straying away from the market he found himself after a while in a street that opened upon the common  he was glad to sit down and he said to himself that now he would stay there and keep a good lookout for the chaps that had robbed him but again he fell asleep and he did not wake now till the sun was high and the paths of the common were filled with hurrying people he sat where he had slept for he did not know what else to do or where to go sometimes he thought he would go to mr sewell and ask him for money enough to get home but he could not do it he could more easily starve  after an hour or two he went to get a drink at a fountain he saw a little way off and when he came back some people had got his seat he started to look for another and on his way he found a cent in the path and he bought an apple with ita small one that the dealer especially picked out for cheapness it seemed pretty queer to lemuel that a person should want anything for one apple the apple when he ate it made him sick his head began to ache and it ached all day late in the afternoon he caught sight of one of those fellows at a distance but there was no policeman near lemuel called out stop there you but the fellow began to run when he recognised lemuel and the boy was too weak and faint to run after him  the day wore away and the evening came again and he had been twentyfour hours houseless and without food he must do something he could not stand it any longer there was no sense in it he had read in the newspapers how they gave soup at the policestations in boston in the winter perhaps they gave something in summer he mustered up courage to ask a gentleman who passed where the nearest station was and then started in search of it if the city gave it then there was no disgrace in it and lemuel had as much right to anything that was going as other people that was the way he silenced his pride  but he missed the place he must have gone down the wrong street from tremont to washington the gentleman had said the street that ran along the common was tremont and the next was washington the crossstreet that lemuel got into was filled with people going and coming and lounging about there were girls going along two or three together with books under their arms and other girls talking with young fellows who hung about the doors of brightly lighted shops and flirting with them one of the girls whom he had seen the day before in the common turned upon lemuel as he passed and said there goes my young man now good evening johnny it made lemuels cheek burn he would have liked to box her ears for her the fellows all set up a laugh  towards the end of the street the crowd thickened and there the mixture of gas and the white moony lights that glared higher up and winked and hissed shone upon the faces of a throng that had gathered about the doors and windows of a store a little way down the other street lemuel joined them and for pure listlessness waited round to see what they were looking at by and by he was worked inward by the shifting and changing of the crowd and found himself looking in at the door of a room splendidly fitted up with mirrors and marble everywhere and coloured glass and carved mahogany there was a long counter with three men behind it and over their heads was a large painting of a woman worse than that image in the garden the men were serving out liquor to the people that stood around drinking and smoking and battening on this picture lemuel could not help looking either what place is this he asked of the boy next him  why dont you know said the boy its jimmy bakers just opened  oh said lemuel he was not going to let the boy see that he did not know who jimmy baker was just then something caught his eye that had a more powerful charm for him than that painting it was a large bowl at the end of the counter which had broken crackers in it and near it were two plates one with cheese and one with bits of dried fish and smoked meat the sight made the water come into his mouth he watched like a hungry dog with a sympathetic working of the jaws the men who took a bit of fish or meat or cheese and a cracker or all four of them before or after they drank presently one of the crowd near him walked in and took some fish and cracker without drinking at all he merely winked at one of the bar tenders who winked at him in return  a tremendous tide of daring rose in lemuels breast he was just going to go in and risk the same thing himself when a voice in the crowd behind him said haint you had most enough young feller some the rest of us would like a chance to see now  lemuel knew the voice and turning quickly he knew the impudent face it belonged to he did not mind the laugh raised at his expense but launched himself across the intervening spectators and tried to seize the scamp who had got his money from him the scamp had recognised lemuel too and he fell back beyond his grasp and then lunged through the crowd and tore round the corner and up the street lemuel followed as fast as he could in spite of the weakness he had felt before wrath and the sense of wrong lent him speed and he was gaining in the chase when he heard a girls voice there goes one of them now and then a man seemed to be calling after him stop there he turned round and a policeman looking gigantic in his belted blue flannel blouse and his straw helmet bore down upon the country boy with his club drawn and seized him by the collar  you come along he said  i havent done anything said lemuel submitting as he must and in his surprise and terror losing the strength his wrath had given him he could scarcely drag his feet over the pavement and the policeman had almost to carry him at arms length  a crowd had gathered about them and was following lemuel and his captor but they fell back when they reached the steps of the policestation and lemuel was pulled up alone and pushed in at the door he was pushed through another door and found himself in a kind of office a stout man in his shirtsleeves was sitting behind a desk within a railing and a large book lay open on the desk this man whose blue waistcoat with brass buttons marked him for some sort of officer looked impersonally at lemuel and then at the officer while he chewed a quill toothpick rolling it in his lips what have you got there he asked  assaulting a girl down here and grabbing her satchel said the officer who had arrested lemuel releasing his collar and going to the door whence he called you come in here lady and a young girl her face red with weeping and her hair disordered came back with him she held a crumpled straw hat with the brim torn loose and in spite of her disordered looks she was very pretty with blue eyes flung very wide open and rough brown hair wavy and cut short almost like a boys this lemuel saw in the frightened glance they exchanged  this the fellow that assaulted you asked the man at the desk nodding his head toward lemuel who tried to speak but it was like a nightmare he could not make any sound  there were three of them said the girl with hysterical volubility one of them pulled my hat down over my eyes and tore it and one of them held me by the elbows behind and they grabbed my satchel away that had a book in it that i had just got out of the library i hadnt got it more than  what name asked the man at the desk  a young mans darling said the girl after a bashful hesitation lemuel had read that book just before he left home he had not thought it was much of a book  the captain wants to know your name said the officer in charge of lemuel  oh said the girl with mortification statira dudley  what age asked the captain  nineteen last june replied the girl with eager promptness that must have come from shame from the blunder she had made lemuel was twenty the 4th of july  weight pursued the captain  well i haint been weighed very lately answered the girl with increasing interest i dont know as i been weighed since i left home  the captain looked at her judicially  that so well you look pretty solid guess ill put you down at a hundred and twenty  well i guess its full as much as that said the girl with a flattered laugh  dunno how high you are suggested the captain glancing at her again  well yes i do i am just five feet two inches and a half  you dont look it said the captain critically  well i am insisted the girl with a returning gaiety  the captain apparently checked himself and put on a professional severity  what businessoccupation  saleslady said the girl  residence  no 2334 pleasant avenue  the captain leaned back in his armchair and turned his toothpick between his lips as he stared hard at the girl  well now he said after a moment you know youve got to come into court and testify tomorrow morning  yes said the girl rather falteringly with a sidelong glance at lemuel  youve got to promise to do it or else it will be my duty to have you locked up overnight  have me locked up gasped the girl her wide blue eyes filling with astonishment  detain you as a witness the captain explained of course we shouldnt put you in a cell we should give you a good room and if you aint sure youll appear in the morning  the girl was not of the sort whose tongues are paralysed by terror oh ill be sure to appear captain indeed i will captain you neednt lock me up captain lock me up she broke off indignantly it would be a pretty idea if i was first to be robbed of my satchel and then put in prison for it overnight a great kind of law that would be why i never heard of such a thing i think its a perfect shame i want to know if thats the way you do with poor things that you dont know about  thats about the size of it said the captain permitting himself a smile in which the officer joined  well its a shame cried the girl now carried far beyond her personal interest in the matter  the captain laughed outright it is pretty rough but what you going to do  do why id but here she stopped for want of science and added from emotion id do anything before id do that  well said the captain then i understand youll come round to the police court and give your testimony in the morning  yes said the girl with a vague compassionate glance at lemuel who had stood there dumb throughout the colloquy  if you dont i shall have to send for you said the captain  oh ill come replied the girl in a sort of disgust and her eyes still dwelt upon lemuel  thats all returned the captain and the girl accepting her dismissal went out  now that it was too late lemuel could break from his nightmare oh dont let her go i aint the one i was running after a fellow that passed off a counterfeit tendollar bill on me in the common yesterday i never touched her satchel i never saw her before  whats that demanded the captain sharply  youve got the wrong one cried lemuel i never did anything to the girl  why you fool retorted the captain angrily why didnt you say that when she was here instead of standing there like a dumb animal heigh  lemuels sudden flow of speech was stopped at its source again his lips were locked he could not answer a word  the captain went on angrily if youd spoke up in time may be i might a let you go i dont want to do a man any harm if i cant do him some good next time if youve got a tongue in your head use it i cant do anything for you now i got to commit you  he paused between his sentences as if to let lemuel speak but the boy said nothing the captain pulled his book impatiently toward him and took up his pen  whats your name  lemuel barker  i thought may be there was a mistake all the while said the captain to the officer while he wrote down lemuels name but if a man haint got sense enough to speak for himself i cant put the words in his mouth age he demanded savagely of lemuel  twenty  weight  a hundred and thirty  i could see with half an eye that the girl want very sanguine about it but whats the use i couldnt tell her she was mistaken height  five feet six  occupation  i help mother carry on the farm  just as i expected cried the captain slow as a yoke of oxen residence  willoughby pastures  the captain could not contain himself well willoughby pastures or whatever your name isyoull get yourself into the papers this time sure and i must say it serves you right if you cant speak for yourself whos going to speak for you do you suppose might send round to the girls houseno she wouldnt be there ten to one youve got to go through now next time dont be such an infernal fool  the captain blotted his book and shut it  well have to lock him up here tonight he said to the policeman last batch has gone round better go through him but lemuel had been gone through before and the officers search of his pockets only revealed their emptiness the captain struck a bell on his desk if it aint all right you can make it right with the judge in the morning he added to lemuel  lemuel looked up at the policeman who had arrested him he was an elderly man with a kindly face squarely fringed with a chinbeard the boy tried to speak but he could only repeat i never saw her before i never touched her  the policeman looked at him and then at the captain  too late now said the latter got to go through the mill this time but if it aint right you can make it right  another officer had answered the bell and the captain indicated with a comprehensive roll of his head that he was to take lemuel away and lock him up  oh my moaned the boy as they passed the door of a small room opening on an inner corridor a smell of coffee gushed out of it the officer stopped and lemuel caught sight of two gentlemen in the room with a policeman who was saying  get a cup of coffee here when we want it try one he suggested hospitably  no thank you said one of the gentlemen with the bland respectfulness of people being shown about an institution how many of you are attached to this station  eightyone said the officer largest station in town gang goes on at one in the morning and another at eight and another at six pm he looked inquiringly at the officer in charge of lemuel  any matches asked this officer  everything but money said the other taking some matches out of his waistcoat pocket  lemuels officer went ahead lighting the gas along the corridor and the boy followed while the other officer brought up the rear with the visitor whom he was lecturing they passed some neat rooms each with two beds in it and he answered some question tramps not much give them a board when theyre drunk send em round to the wayfarers lodge when theyre sober these officers rooms  lemuel followed his officer downstairs into a basement where on either side of a whitewalled brilliantly lighted specklessly clean corridor there were numbers of cells very clean and smelling of fresh whitewash each had a broad low shelf in it and a bench opposite a little wider than a mans body lemuel suddenly felt himself pushed into one of them and then a railed door of iron was locked upon him he stood motionless in the breadth of light and lines of shade which the gaslight cast upon him through the door and knew the gentlemen were looking at him as their guide talked  well fill up pretty well sunday nights most the arrests for drunkenness but all the arrests before seven oclock sent to the city prison only keep them that come in afterwards  one of the gentlemen looked into the cell opposite lemuels there seems to be only one bunk do you ever put more into a cell  well hardly ever if theyre men lot o women brought in most always ask to be locked up together for company  i dont see where they sleep said the visitor do they lie on the floor  the officer laughed sleep they dont want to sleep what they want to do is to set up all night and talk it over  both of the visitors laughed  some of the cells resumed the officer have two bunks but we hardly ever put more than one in a cell  the visitors noticed that a section of the rail was removed in each door near the floor  thats to put a dipper of water through or anything explained the officer there he continued showing them lemuels door see how the rails are bent there you wouldnt think a man could squeeze through there but we found a fellow half out o that one night backwards captain came down with a rattan and made it hot for him  the visitors laughed and lemuel in his cell shuddered  i never saw anything so astonishingly clean said one of the gentlemen and do you keep the gas burning here all night  yes calculate to give em plenty of light said the officer with comfortable satisfaction in the visitors complimentary tone  and the sanitary arrangements seem to be perfect doctor said the other visitor  oh perfect  yes said the officer we do the best we can for em  the visitors made a murmur of approbation their steps moved away lemuel heard the guide saying dunno what that fellows in for find out in the captains room  he didnt look like a very abandoned ruffian said one of the visitors with both pity and amusement in his voice     vi   lemuel stood and leaned his head against the wall of his cell the tears that had come to his relief in the morning when he found that he was robbed would not come now he was trembling with famine and weakness but he could not lie down it would be like accepting his fate and every fibre of his body joined his soul in rebellion against that the hunger gnawed him incessantly mixed with an awful sickness  after a long time a policeman passed his door with another prisoner a drunken woman whom he locked into a cell at the end of the corridor when he came back lemuel could endure it no longer say he called huskily through his door wont you give me a cup of that coffee upstairs i havent had anything but an apple to eat for nearly two days i dont want you to give me the coffee you can take my clasp button  the officer went by a few steps then he came back and peered in through the door at lemuels face oh thats you he said he was the officer who had arrested lemuel  yes please get me the coffee im afraid i shall have a fit of sickness if i go much longer  well said the officer i guess i can get you something he went away and came back after lemuel had given up the hope of his return with a saucerless cup of coffee and a slice of buttered bread laid on the top of it he passed it in through the opening at the bottom of the door  oh my gasped the starving boy he thought he should drop the cup his hand shook so when he took it he gulped the coffee and swallowed the bread in a frenzy  hereheres the button he said as he passed the empty cup out to the officer  i dont want your button answered the policeman he hesitated a moment i shall be round at the court in the morning and i guess if it aint right we can make it so  thank you sir said lemuel humbly grateful  you lay down now said the officer we shant put anybody in on you tonight  i guess i better said lemuel he crept in upon the lower shelf and stretched himself out in his clothes with his arm under his head for a pillow the drunken woman at the end of the corridor was clamouring to get out she wished to get out just half a minute she said and settle with that hussy then she would come back willingly sometimes she sang sometimes she swore but with the coffee still sensibly hot in his stomach and the comfort of it in every vein her uproar turned into an agreeable fantastic medley for lemuel and he thought it was the folks singing in church at willoughby pastures and they were all asking him who the new girl in the choir was and he was saying statira dudley and then it all slipped off into a smooth yellow nothingness and he heard some one calling him to get up  when he woke in the morning he started up so suddenly that he struck his head against the shelf above him and lay staring stupidly at the ironwork of his door  he heard the order to turn out repeated at other cells along the corridor and he crept out of his shelf and then sat down upon it waiting for his door to be unlocked he was very hungry again and he trembled with faintness he wondered how he should get his breakfast and he dreaded the trial in court less than the thought of going through another day with nothing to eat he heard the stir of the other prisoners in the cells along the corridors the low groans and sighs with which people pull themselves together after a bad night and he heard the voice of the drunken woman now sober poured out in voluble remorse and in voluble promise of amendment for the future to every one who passed if they would let her off easy she said aisy of course and it was in her native accent that she bewailed the fate of the little ones whom her arrest had left motherless at home no one seemed to answer her but presently she broke into a cry of joy and blessing and from her cell at the other end of the corridor came the clink of crockery steps approached with several pauses and at last they paused at lemuels door and a man outside stooped and pushed in through the opening at the bottom a big bowl of baked beans a quarter of a loaf of bread and a tin cup full of coffee coffees extra he said jocosely comes from the officers youre in luck young feller  i hant got anything to pay for it with faltered lemuel  guess theyll trust you said the man anyrate i got orders to leave it he passed on and lemuel gathered up his breakfast and arranged it on the shelf where he had slept then he knelt down before it and ate  an hour later an officer came and unbolted his door from the outside hurry up he said marias waiting  maria repeated lemuel innocently  yes returned the officer other names black she dont like to wait come out of here  lemuel found himself in the corridor with four or five other prisoners whom some officers took in charge and conducted upstairs to the door of the station he saw no woman but a sort of omnibus without windows was drawn up at the curbstone  i thought he said to an officer that there was a lady waiting to see me maria black he added seeing that the officer did not understand  the policeman roared and could not help putting his head in at the office door to tell the joke  well you must introduce him called a voice from within  guess you hant got the name exactly straight young man said the policeman to lemuel as he guarded him down the steps its black maria youre looking for there she is he continued pointing to the omnibus and dont you forget it shes particular to have folks recognise her shes blacker n shes painted  the omnibus was in fact a sort of aesthetic drab relieved with salmon as lemuel had time to notice before he was hustled into it with the other prisoners and locked in  there were already several there and as lemuels eyes accustomed themselves to the light that came in through the little panes at the sides of the roof he could see that they were women and by and by he saw that two of them were the saucy girls who had driven him from his seat in the common that day and laughed so at him they knew him too and one of them set up a shrill laugh hello johnny that you you dont say so what you up for this time going down to the island well give us a call there do be sociable ward 11s the address the other one laughed and then swore at the first for trying to push her off the seat  lemuel broke out involuntarily in all the severity that was native to him you ought to be ashamed of yourselves  this convulsed the bold things with laughter when they could get their breath one of them said pshaw i know what hes up for preaching on the common say young feller dont you want to hold a prayermeetin here  they burst into another shriek of laughter so wild and shrill that the driver rapped on the roof and called down dry up in there  oh you mind your horses and well look after the passengers go and set on his knee jen and cheer him up a little  lemuel sat in a quiver of abhorrence the girl appealed to remained giggling beside her companion  ii pity ye said lemuel  the irishwoman had not stopped bewailing herself and imploring right and left an easy doom she now addressed herself wholly to lemuel whose personal dignity seemed to clothe him with authority in her eyes she told him about her children left alone with no one to look after them the two little girls the boy only three years old when the van stopped at a station to take in more passengers she tried to get outto tell the gentlemen at the office about it she said  after several of these halts they stopped at the basement of a large stone building that had a wide flight of steps in front and columns like the church at willoughby pastures only the church steps were wood and the columns painted pine here more officers took charge of them and put them in a room where there were already twentyfive or thirty other prisoners the harvest of the night before and presently another vanload was brought in  there were many women among them but here there was no laughing or joking as there had been in the van scarcely any one spoke except the irishwoman who crept up to an officer at the door from time to time and begged him to tell the judge to let her have it easy this time lemuel could not help seeing that she and most of the others were familiar with the place those two saucy jades who had mocked him were silent and had lost their bold looks  after waiting what seemed a long time the door was opened and they were driven up a flight of stairs into a railed enclosure at the corner of a large room where they remained huddled together while a man at a long desk rattled over something that ended with god bless the commonwealth of massachusetts on a platform behind the speaker sat a greyhaired man in spectacles and lemuel knew that he was in the courtroom and that this must be the judge he could not see much of the room over the top of the railing but there was a buzz of voices and a stir of feet beyond that made him think the place was full but full or empty it was the same to him his shame could not be greater or less he waited apathetically while the clerk read off the charges against the vastly greater number of his fellowprisoners arrested for drunkenness when these were disposed of he read from the back of a paper which he took from a fresh pile bridget gallagher complained of for habitual drunkenness guilty or not guilty  not guilty your honour answered the irishwoman who had come from lemuels station but make it aisy for me this time judge and yell never catch me in it again ive three helpless childer at home your honour starvin and cryin for their mother holy mary make it aisy judge  a laugh went round the room which a stern voice checked with silence there but which renewed itself when the old woman took the stand at the end of the clerks long desk while a policeman mounted a similar platform outside the rail and gave his testimony against her it was very conclusive and it was not affected by the denials with which the poor woman gave herself away more and more she had nothing to say when invited to do so except to beg for mercy the judge made a few inquiries apparently casual of the policeman then after a moments silence in which he sat rubbing his chin he leaned forward and said quietly to the clerk  give her three months  the woman gave a wild irish cry o my poor childer and amidst the amusement of the spectators which the constables could not check at once was led wailing below  before lemuel could get his breath those bold girls one after the other were put upon the stand the charge against them was not made the subject of public investigation the judge and some other elderly gentleman talked it over together and the girls who had each wept in pleading guilty were put on probation as lemuel understood it and weeping still and bridling a little were left in charge of this elderly gentleman and lemuel saw them no more  one case followed another and lemuel listened with the fascination of terror the sentences seemed terribly severe and out of all proportion to the offences suddenly his own name was called his name had been called in public places before at the school exhibitions where he had taken prizes in elocution and composition in church once when the minister had mentioned him for peculiar efficiency and zeal among other sabbathschool teachers it was sacred to him for his fathers sake who fell in the war and who was recorded in it on the ugly pathetic monument on the village green and hitherto he had made it respected and even honoured and had tried all the harder to keep it so because his family was poor and his mother had such queer ways and dressed so he dragged himself to the stand which he knew he must mount and stole from under his eyelashes a glance at the courtroom which took it all in there were some people whom he did not know for reporters busy with their pencils next the railings and there was a semicircular table in the middle of the room at which a large number of policemen sat and they had their straw helmets piled upon it with the hats of the lawyers who sat among them beyond the seats which covered the floor were filled with the sodden loafers whom the law offers every morning the best dramatic amusement in the city presently among the stupid eyes fixed upon him lemuel was aware of the eyes of that fellow who had passed the counterfeit money on him and when this scamp got up and coolly sauntered out of the room lemuel was held in such a spell that he did not hear the charge read against him or the clerks repeated demand guilty or not guilty  he was recalled to himself by the voice of the judge young man do you understand are you guilty of assaulting this lady and taking her satchel or not  not guilty said lemuel huskily and he looked not at the judge but at the pretty girl who confronted him from a stand at the other end of the clerks desk blushing to find herself there up to her wideflung blue eyes lemuel blushed too and dropped his eyes and it seemed to him in a crazy kind of way that it was impolite to have pleaded not guilty against her accusation he stood waiting for the testimony which the judge had to prompt her to offer  state the facts in regard to the assault he said gravely  i dont know as i can do it very well began the girl  we shall be satisfied if you do your best said the judge with the glimmer of a smile which spread to a laugh among the spectators unrebuked by the constables since the judge had invited it  in this atmosphere of sympathy the girl found her tongue and with a confiding twist of her pretty head began again well now ill tell you just how it was id just got my book out of the public library and i was going down neponset street on my way home hurrying along because i see it was beginning to be pretty late and the first thing i know somebody pulled my hat down over my eyes and tore the brim half off so i dont suppose i can ever wear it again its such a lookin thing any rate it aint the one ive got on though its some like it and then the next thing somebody grabbed away the satchel id got on my arm and as soon as i could get my eyes clear again i see two fellows chasin up the street and i told the officer somebodyd got my book and i knew it was one of those fellows runnin away and i said there they go now and the officer caught the hind one and i guess the other one got away and the officer told me to follow along to the stationhouse and when we got there they took my name and where i roomed and my age  do you recognise this young man as one of the persons who robbed you interrupted the judge nodding his head toward lemuel who now lifted his head and looked his accuser fearlessly in her pretty eyes  why no she promptly replied the first thing i knew hed pulled my hat over my eyes  but you recognise him as one of those you saw running away  oh yes hes one of them said the girl  what made you think he had robbed you  why because my satchel was gone returned the girl with logic that apparently amused the gentlemen of the bar  but why did you think he had taken it  because i see him running away  you couldnt swear that he was the one who took your satchel  why of course not i didnt see him till i saw him running and i dont know as he was the one now added the girl in a sudden burst of generosity  and if it was to do over again i should say as much to the officers at the station but i got confused when they commenced askin me who i was and how much i weighed and what my height was and he didnt say anything and i got to thinkin may be it was and when they told me that if i didnt promise to appear at court in the morning theyd have to lock me up i was only too glad to get away alive  by this time all the blackguard audience were sharing unchecked the amusement of the bar the judge put up his hand to hide a laugh then he said to lemuel do you wish to question the plaintiff  the two young things looked at each other and both blushed no said lemuel  the girl looked at the judge for permission and at a nod from him left the stand and sat down  the officer who had arrested lemuel took the stand on the other side of the rail from him and corroborated the girls story but he had not seen the assault or robbery and could not swear to either then lemuel was invited to speak and told his story with the sort of nervous courage that came to him in extremity he told it from the beginning and his adventure with the two beats in the common made the audience laugh again even then lemuel could not see the fun of it he stopped and the stout ushers in blue flannel sacks commanded silence then lemuel related how he had twice seen one of the beats since that time but he was ashamed to say how he had let him escape out of that very room half an hour before he told how he had found the beat in the crowd before the saloon and how he was chasing him up the street when he heard the young lady hollo out there they go now and then the officer arrested him  the judge sat a moment in thought then said quietly the charge is dismissed and before lemuel well knew what it meant a gate was opened at the stand and he was invited to pass out he was free the officer who had arrested him shook his hand in congratulation and excuse and the lawyers and the other policemen gave him a friendly glance the loafers and beats of the audience did not seem to notice him they were already intent upon a case of coloured assault and battery which had been called and which opened with the promise of uncommon richness both of the parties being women  lemuel saw that girl who had accused him passing down the aisle on the other side of the room she was with another girl who looked older lemuel walked fast to get out of their way he did not know why but he did not want to speak to the girl they walked fast too and when he got down the stairs on to the ground floor of the court house they overtook him  say said the older girl i want to speak to you i think its a down shame the way that youve been treated and statira she feels jus s i do about it and i tell her shes got to say so its the least she can do i tell her after what she got you in for my names manda grier i room th stira n i come th her this mornin t help keep her up bt i didnt know t was goin to be sch a perfect flatout  as the young woman rattled on she grew more and more glib she was what they call whopperjawed and spoke a language almost purely consonantal cutting and clipping her words with a rapid play of her whopperjaw till there was nothing but the bare bones left of them statira was crying and lemuel could not bear to see her cry he tried to say something to comfort her but all he could think of was i hope youll get your book back and manda grier answered for her  oh i guess t aint the book t she cares for s far forth s the book goes i guess she can afford to buy another book well enough bt i tell her shes done n awful thing and a thing t shell carry to her grave th her nt shell remember to her dyin day thats what i tell her  she hant got any call to feel bad about it said lemuel clumsily it was just a mistake then not knowing what more to say he said being come to the outer door by this time well i wish you good morning  well good morning said manda grier and she thrust her elbow sharply into statira dudleys side so that she also said faintly  well good morning she was fluent enough on the witnessstand and in the police station but now she could not find a word to say  the three stood together on the threshold of the courthouse not knowing how to get away from one another  manda grier put out her hand to lemuel he took it and well good morning he said again  well good morning repeated manda grier  then statira put out her hand and she and lemuel shook hands and said together well good morning and on these terms of high civility they parted he went one way and they another he did not look back but the two girls marching off with locked arms and flying tongues when they came to the corner turned to look back they both turned inward and so bumped their heads together  why youcoot cried manda grier and they broke out laughing  lemuel heard their laugh and he knew they were laughing at him but he did not care he wandered on he did not know whither and presently he came to the only place he could remember     vii   the place was the common where his trouble had begun he looked back to the beginning and could see that it was his own fault to be sure you might say that if a fellow came along and offered to pay you fifty cents for changing a tendollar bill you had a right to take it but there was a voice in lemuels heart which warned him that greed to anothers hurt was sin and that if you took too much for a thing from a necessitous person you oppressed and robbed him you could make it appear otherwise but you could not really change the nature of the act he owned this with a sigh and he owned himself justly punished he was still on those terms of personal understanding with the eternal spirit of right which most of us lose later in life when we have so often seemed to see the effect fail to follow the cause both in the case of our own misdeeds and the misdeeds of others  he sat down on a bench and he sat there all day except when he went to drink from the tin cup dangling by the chain from the nearest fountain his good breakfast kept him from being hungry for a while but he was as aimless and as hopeless as ever and as destitute he would have gone home now if he had had the money he was afraid they would be getting anxious about him there though he had not made any particular promises about the time of returning he had dropped a postal card into a box as soon as he reached boston to tell of his safe arrival and they would not expect him to write again  there were only two ways for him to get home to turn tramp and walk back or to go to that mr sewell and borrow the money to pay his passage to walk home would add intolerably to the public shame he must suffer and the thought of going to mr sewell was even in the secret which it would remain between him and the minister a pang so cruel to his pride that he recoiled from it instantly he said to himself he would stand it one day more something might happen and if nothing happened he should think of it again in the meantime he thought of other things of that girl among the rest and how she looked at the different times as nearly as he could make out she seemed to be a very fashionable girl at any rate she was dressed fashionably and she was nicelooking he did not know whether she had behaved very sensibly but he presumed she was some excited  toward dark when lemuel was reconciling himself to another nights sleep in the open air a policeman sauntered along the mall and as he drew nearer the boy recognised his friendly captor he dropped his head but it was too late the officer knew him and stopped before him  well he said hard at it i see  lemuel made no answer but he was aware of a friendly look in the officers face mixed with fatherly severity  i was in hopes you had started back to willoughby pastures before this you dont want to get into the habit of settin round on the common much first thing you know you cant quit it where you goin to put up tonight i dont know murmured lemuel  got no friends in town you can go to  no  well now look here do you think you could find your way back to the station  i guess so said lemuel looking up at the officer questioningly  well when you get tired of this you come round and well provide a bed for you and you get back home tomorrow quick as you can  thank you said lemuel he was helpless against the advice and its unjust implication but he could not say anything  get out o boston anyway wherever you go or dont go continued the officer its a bad place  he walked on and left lemuel to himself again he thought bitterly that no one knew better than himself how luridly wicked boston was and that there was probably not a soul in it more helplessly anxious to get out of it he thought it hard to be talked to as if it were his fault as if he wished to become a vagrant and a beggar he sat there an hour or two longer and then he took the officers advice so far as concerned his going to the station for a bed swallowing his pride as he must he must do that or he must go to mr sewell it was easier to accept humiliation at the hands of strangers he found his way there with some difficulty and slinking in at the front door he waited at the threshold of the captains room while he and two or three officers disposed of a respectably dressed man whom a policeman was holding up by the collar of his coat they were searching his pockets and taking away his money his keys and his pencil and penknife which the captain sealed up in a large envelope and put into his desk  there take him and lock him up hes pretty well loaded said the captain  then he looked up and saw lemuel hello cant keep away eh he demanded jocosely well weve heard about you i told you the judge would make it all right whats wanted bed well here the captain filled up a blank which he took from a pigeonhole and gave it to lemuel i guess thatll fix you out for the night and tomorrow you put back to willoughby pastures tight as you can get there youre on the wrong track now first thing you know youll be a professional tramp and then you wont be worth the powder to blow you i use plain talk with you because youre a beginner i wouldnt waste my breath on that fellow behind you  lemuel looked round and almost touched with his a face that shone fiery red through the rusty growth of a weeks beard and recoiled from a figure that was fouler as to shirt and coat and trousers than anything the boy had seen though the tramps used to swarm through willoughby pastures before the selectmen began to lock them up in the town poorhouse and set them to breaking stone there was no ferocity in the loathsome face it was a vagrant swine that looked from it no worse in its present mood than greedy and sleepy  bed demanded the captain writing another blank never been here before i suppose he continued with goodnatured irony i dont seem to remember you  the captain laughed and the tramp returned a husky thank you sir and took himself off into the street  then the captain came to lemuels help you follow him he said and youll come to a bed by and by  he went out and since he could do no better did as he was bid he had hardly ever seen a drunken man at willoughby pastures where the prohibition law was strictly enforced there was no such person as a thief in the whole community and the tramps were gone long ago yet here was he famed at home for the rectitude of his life and the loftiness of his aims consorting with drunkards and thieves and tramps and warned against what he was doing by a policeman as if he was doing it of his own will it was very strange business if it was all a punishment for taking that fellows halfdollar it was pretty heavy punishment he was not going to say that it was unjust but he would say it was hard his spirit was now so bruised and broken that he hardly knew what to think  he followed the tramp as far off as he could and still keep him in sight and he sometimes thought he had lost him in the streets that climbed and crooked beyond the common towards the quarter whither they were going but he reappeared slouching and shambling rapidly on in the glare of some electric lights that stamped the ground with shadows thick and black as if cut in velvet or burnt into the surface here and there some girl brushed against the boy and gave him a joking or jeering word her face flashed into light for a moment and then vanished in the darkness she passed into it was that hot october and the night was close and still on the steps of some of the houses groups of fat weary women were sitting and children were playing on the sidewalks using the lampposts for goal or tag the tramp ahead of lemuel issued upon a brilliantly lighted little square with a great many horsecars coming and going in it a church with stores on the ground floor and fronting it on one side a row of handsome old stone houses with iron fences and on another a great hotel with a highpillared portico where men sat talking and smoking  people were waiting on the sidewalk to take the cars a druggists window threw its mellow lights into the street from open cellar ways came the sound of banjos and violins at one of these cellar doors his guide lingered so long that lemuel thought he should have to find the way beyond for himself but the tramp suddenly commanded himself from the music the light and the smell of strong drink which lemuel caught a whiff of as he followed and turning a corner led the way to the side of a lofty building in a dark street where they met other like shapes tending toward it from different directions     viii   lemuel entered a lighted doorway from a bricked courtyard and found himself with twenty or thirty houseless comrades in a large square room with benching against the wall for them to sit on they were all silent and quelledlooking except a young fellow whom lemuel sat down beside and who ascertaining that he was a newcomer seemed disposed to do the honours of the place he was not daunted by the reserve native to lemuel or by that distrust of strangers which experience had so soon taught him he addressed him promptly as mate and told him that the high narrow threesided tabling in the middle of the room was where they would get their breakfast if they lived  and i guess i shall live he said i notice i most always live till breakfasttime whatever else i do or i dont do but sometimes it dont seem as if i could saw my way through that quarter of a cord of wood at a glance of inquiry which lemuel could not forbear he continued what i mean by a quarter of a cord of wood is that they let you exercise that much free in the morning before they give you your breakfast its the doctors orders this used to be a schoolhouse but its in better business now they got a kitchen under here that beats the parker house youll smell it pretty soon no whacking on the knuckles here any more all serene i tell you youll see i dont know how i should got along without this institution and i tell the manager so every time i see him thats him hollering next out of that room there its a name he gives all of us he knows its a name well answer to dont you forget it when it comes your turn  he was younger than lemuel apparently but his swarthy large mouthed droll eyed face affirmed the experience of a sage he wore a blue flannel shirt with loose trousers belted round his waist and he crushed a soft felt hat between his hands his hair was clipped close to his skull and as he rubbed it now and then it gave out a pleasant rasping sound  the tramps disappeared in the order of their vicinity to the managers door and it came in time to this boy and lemuel  you come along with me he said and do as i do when they entered the presence of the manager who sat at a desk lemuels guide nodded to him and handed over his order for a bed  ever been here before asked the manager as if going through the form for a joke  never he took a numbered card which the manager gave him and stood aside to wait for lemuel who made the same answer to the same question and received his numbered card  now said the young fellow as they passed out of another door we aint either of us next any more im thirtynine and youre forty and dont you forget it all right boss he called back to the manager ill take care of him this way he said to lemuel the reason why i said id never been here before he explained on the way down was because you got to say something when he asks you most of em says last fall or last year but i say never because its just as true and he seems to like it better were going down to the dressingroom now and then were going to take a bath do you know why  no said lemuel  because we cant help it its the doctors orders he thinks its the best thing you can do just before you go to bed  the basement was brightly lighted with gas everywhere and a savoury odour of onionflavoured broth diffused itself through the whole place  smell it you might think that was supper but it aint its breakfast you got a bath and a nights rest as well as the quarter of a cord of wood between you and that stew hungry  not very said lemuel faintly  because if you say you are theyll give you all the bread and water you can hold now but i ruther wait  i guess i dont want anything tonight said lemuel shrinking from the act of beggary  well i guess you wont lose anything in the long run said the other youll make it up at breakfast  they turned into a room where eight or ten tramps were undressing some of them were old men quite sodden and stupefied with a life of vagrancy and privation others were of a dull or cunning middleage two or three were as young as lemuel and his partner and looked as if they might be poor fellows who had found themselves in a strange city without money or work but it was against them that they had known where to come for a nights shelter lemuel felt  there were large iron hooks hanging from the walls and ceiling and his friend found the numbers on two of them corresponding to those given lemuel and himself and brass checks which they hung around their necks  you got to hang your things on that hook all but your shoes and stockings and you got to hang on to them yourself fortys your number and fortys your hook and they give you the clothes offn it in the morning  he led the way through the corridor into a large room where a row of bathtubs flanked the wall half of them filled with bathers who chatted in tones of subdued cheerfulness under the pleasant excitement of unlimited hot and cold water as each newcomer appeared a black boy perched on a windowsill jumped down and dashed his head from a large bottle which he carried  free shampoo explained lemuels mate doctors orders only you have to do the rubbing yourself i dont suppose you need it but some the pardners here couldnt sleep without it he continued as lemuel shrank a little from the bottle and then submitted its a regular nightcap  the tramps recognised the humour of the explanation by a laugh intended to be respectful to the establishment in its control which spread along their line and the black boy grinned  there aint anything mean about the wayfarers hotel said the mate and they all laughed again a little louder  each man having dried himself from his bath was given a coarse linen nightgown sometimes it was not quite whole but it was always clean and then he gathered up his shoes and stockings and went out  hold on a minute said the mate to lemuel when they left the bathroom you ought to see the kitchen and in his nightgown with his shoes in his hand he led lemuel to the open door which that delicious smell of broth came from a vast coppertopped boiler was bubbling within and trying to get its lid off the odour made lemuel sick with hunger  refrigerator in the next room the mate lectured on best beef chucks in the market fish for fridayswe dont make any man go against his religion in this house pots of butter as big as a cheesenone of your oleomargarinethe real thing every time potatoes and onions and carrots laying around on the floor barrels of hardtack and bread like spongebounce you up if you was to jump on itbaked by the women at the chardon street homeoh i tell you we do things in style here  a man who sat reading a newspaper in the corner looked up sharply hello there whats wanted  just dropped in to wish you good night jimmy said lemuels mate  you clear out said the man goodhumouredly as if to an old acquaintance who must not be allowed to presume upon his familiarity  all right jimmy said the boy he set his left hand horizontally on its wrist at his left shoulder and cut the air with it in playful menace as the man dropped his eyes again to his paper theyre all just so in this house he explained to lemuel no nonsense but goodnatured theyre all right they know me  he mounted two flights of stairs in front of lemuel to a corridor where an attendant stood examining the numbers on the brass checks hung around tramps necks as they came up with their shoes in their hands he instructed them that the numbers corresponded to the cots they were to occupy as well as the hooks where their clothes hung some of them seemed hardly able to master the facts they looked wistfully like cowed animals into his face as he made the case clear  two vast rooms exquisitely clean like the whole house opened on the right and left of the corridor and presented long phalanxes of cots each furnished with two coarse blankets a quilt and a thin pillow  used to be schoolrooms said lemuels mate in a low tone  cots thirtynine and forty said the attendant looking at their checks right over there in the corner  come along said the mate leading the way with the satisfaction of an habitué best berth in the room and about the last they reach in the morning you see they got to take us as we come when they call us and the last feller in at nights the first feller out in the morning because his beds the nearest the door  he did not pull down the blankets of his cot at once but stretched himself out in the quilt that covered them cool off a little first he explained well this is what i call comfort mate heigh  lemuel did not answer he was watching the attendant with a group of tramps who could not find their cots  cant read i suppose said the mate a little disdainfully well look at that old chap will you a poor fellow was fumbling with his blankets as if he did not know quite how to manage them the attendant had to come to his help and tuck him in well there exclaimed the mate lifting himself on his elbow to admire the scene i dont suppose hes ever been in a decent bed before haylofts his style or a boardpile he sank down again and went on well you do see all kinds of folks here thats a fact sorry there aint more in tonight so s to give you a specimen you ought to be here in the winter well it aint so lonesome now in summer as it used to be sometimes i used to have nearly the whole place to myself summer nights before they got to passin these laws against tramps in the country and lockin em up when they ketched em that drives em into the city summers now because theyre always sure of a nights rest and a days board here if they ask for it but winters the time youll see all these cots full then they let on the steamheat and its comfortable and its always airy and healthy the vast room was in fact perfectly ventilated and the poor who housed themselves that night and many welltodo sojourners in hotels had reason to envy the vagrants their free lodging  the mate now got under his quilt and turned his face toward lemuel with one hand under his cheek they dont let everybody into this room s i was tellin ye this room is for the bigbugs you know sometimes a drunk will get in though in spite of everything why ive seen a drunk at the stationhouse when ive been gettin my order for a bed stiffen up so t the captain himself thought he was sober and then ive followed him round here wobblin and corkscrewin all over the sidewalk and then ive seen him stiffen up in the office again and go through his bath like a little man and get into bed as drunk as a fish and may be wake up in the night with the man with the poker after him and make things hum well sir one night there was a drunk in here that thought the man with the poker was after him and he just up and jumped out of this window behind youthree stories from the ground  lemuel could not help lifting himself in bed to look at it did it kill him he asked kill him no you cant kill a drunk one night there was a drunk got loose here and he run downstairs into the woodyard and he got hold of an axe down there and it took five men to get that axe away from that drunk he was goin for the snakes  the snakes repeated lemuel are there snakes in the woodyard  the other gave a laugh so loud that the attendant called out less noise over there  ill tell you about the snakes in the morning said the mate and he turned his face away from lemuel  the stories of the drunks had made lemuel a little anxious but he thought that attendant would keep a sharp lookout so that there would not really be much danger he was very drowsy from his bath in spite of the hunger that tormented him but he tried to keep awake and think what he should do after breakfast     ix   come turn out said a voice in his ear and he started up to see the great dormitory where he had fallen asleep empty of all but himself and his friend  make out a nights rest asked the latter didnt i tell you wed be the last up come along he preceded lemuel still drowsy down the stairs into the room where they had undressed and where the tramps were taking each his clothes from their hook and hustling them on  what time is it johnny asked lemuels mate of the attendant i left my watch under my pillow  five oclock said the man helping the poor old fellow who had not known how to get into bed to put on his clothes  well thats a pretty good start said the other he finished his toilet by belting himself around the waist and come along mate he said to lemuel ill show you the way to the toolroom  he led him through the corridor into a chamber of the basement where there were bright rows of woodsaws and ranks of sawhorses with heaps of the latter in different stages of construction house selfsupporting as far as it can we dont want to be beholden to anybody if we can help it we make our own horses here but we cant make our saws or we would ever had much practice with the wood saw  no said lemuel with a throb of homesickness that brought back the hacked log behind the house and the axe resting against it we always chopped our stovewood  yes thats the way in the country well now said the other ill show you how to choose a saw dont you be took in by no new saw because its bright and looks pretty you want to take a saw thats been filed and filed away till it aint more n an inch and a half deep and then you want to tune it up just solike a banjonot too tight and not too slackand then itll slip through a stick o wood likelyin he selected a saw and put it in order for lemuel there he picked out another heres my old standby he took up a sawhorse at random to indicate that one need not be critical in that and led through the open door into the woodyard where a score or two of saws were already shrilling and wheezing through the wood  it was a wide and lofty shed with piles of cordwood and slabs at either end and walled on the farther side with kindling sawed split and piled up with admirable neatness the place gave out the sweet smell of the woods from the bark of the logs and from the fresh section of their grain a double rank of sawhorses occupied the middle space and beside each horse lay a quarter of a cord of wood at which the men were toiling in sullen silence for the most part only exchanging a grunt or snarl of dissatisfaction with one another  morning mates said lemuels friend cheerfully as he entered the shed and put his horse down beside one of the piles thought wed look in and see how you was gettin along just stepped round from the parker house while our breakfast was acookin hope you all rested well  the men paused with their saws at different slopes in the wood and looked round the night before in the nakedness in which lemuel had first seen them the worst of them had the inalienable comeliness of nature and their faces softened by their relation to their bodies were not so bad they were not so bad looking from their white nightgowns but now clad in their filthy rags and caricatured out of all native dignity by their motley and misshapen attire they were a hideous gang and all the more hideous for the grin that overspread their stubbly muzzles at the boys persiflage  dont let me interrupt you fellows he said flinging a log upon his horse and dashing his saw gaily into it dont mind me i know you hate to lose a minute of this fun i understand just how you feel about it and i dont want you to stand upon ceremony with me treat me just like one of yourselves gents this beech wood is the regular nova scotia thing aint it tough and knotty i cant bear any of your cheap woodlot stuff from around here what i want is nova scotia wood every time then i feel that im gettin the worth of my money his log dropped apart on each side of his horse and he put on another well mates he rattled on this is lovely aint it i wouldnt give up my little quarter of a cord of green nova scotia before breakfast for anything ive got into the way of it and i cant live without it  the tramps chuckled at these ironies and the attendant who looked into the yard now and then did not interfere with them  the mate went through his stint as rapidly as he talked and he had nearly finished before lemuel had half done he did not offer to help him but he delayed the remnant of his work and waited for him to catch up talking all the while with gay volubility joking this one and that and keeping the whole company as cheerful as it was in their dull sodden nature to be he had a floating eye that harmonised with his queer mobile face and played round on the different figures but mostly upon lemuels dogged rustic industry as if it really amused him  whats your lay after breakfast he asked as they came to the last log together  lay repeated lemuel  what you goin to do  i dont know i cant tell yet  you know said the other you can come back here and get your dinner if you want to saw wood for it from ten till twelve and you get your supper if youll saw from five to six  are you going to do that asked lemuel cautiously  no sir said the other i cant spare the time im goin to fill up for all day at breakfast and then im goin up to lay round on the common till its time to go to the police court and when thats over im goin back to the common agin and lay round the rest of the day i haint got any leisure for no such nonsense as woodsawin i dont mind the work but i hate to waste the time its the way with most o the pardners unless its the green hands that so pards  some of them had already gone in to breakfast the smell of the stew came out to the woodyard through the open door lemuel and his friend finished their last stick at the same time and went in together and found places side by side at the table in the waiting room the attendant within its oblong was serving the men with heavy quart bowls of the steaming broth he brought half a loaf of light elastic bread with each and there were platters of hardtack set along the board which every one helped himself from freely and broke into his broth  morning jimmy said the mate as the man brought him and lemuel their portions i hate to have the diningroom chairs off a paintin when theres so much style about everything else and ive got a visitor with me but i tell him hell have to take us as he finds us and stand it this mornin he wasted no more words on his joke but plunging his large tin spoon into his bowl kept his breath to cool his broth blowing upon it with easy grace and swallowing it at a tremendous rate though lemuel after following his example still found it so hot that it brought the tears into his eyes it was delicious and he was ravenous from his twentyfour hours fast but his companion was scraping the bottom of his bowl before lemuel had got halfway down and he finished his second as lemuel finished his first  just oncet more for both of us jimmy he said pushing his bowl across the board and when the man brought them back he said now im goin to take it easy and enjoy myself i cant never seem to get the good of it till about the third or fourth bowl too much of a hurry  do they give you four bowls gasped lemuel in astonishment  they give you four barrels if you can hold it replied the other proudly and some the mates can pretty near they got an awful tank as a general rule the pards has there aint anything mean about this house they dont scamp the broth and they dont shab the measure i do wish you could see that refrigerator oncet never been much at sea have you mate  lemuel said he had never been at sea at all  the other leaned forward with his elbows on each side of his bowl and lazily broke his hardtack into it well i have i was shipped when i was about eleven years old by a shark that got me drunk i wanted to ship but i wanted to ship on an american vessel for new orleans first thing i knowed i turned up on a swedish brig bound for venice ever been to itly  no said lemuel  well i haint but oncet oncet is enough for me i run away while i was in venice and went ashoreif you can call it ashore its all water and you got to go round in boats gondolas they call em thereand went to see the american counsul and told him i was an american boy and tried to get him to get me off but he couldnt do anything if you ship under the swedish flag youre a swede and the whole united states couldnt get you off if id a shipped under the american flag id a been an american i dont care if i was born in hottentot thats what the counsul said i never want to see that town agin i used to hear songs about venicebeautiful venice bride of the sea but i think its a kind of a hole of a place well what i started to say was that when i turn up in boston nowand i most generally doi dont go to no sailor boardinhouse i break for the wayfarers lodge every time its a temperance house and they give you the worth o your money  come hurry up said the attendant he wiped the table impatiently with his towel and stood waiting for lemuel and the other to finish all the rest had gone  dont you be too fresh pard said the mate with the effect of standing upon his rights guess if you was on your third bowl you wouldnt hurry  the attendant smiled dont you want to lend us a hand with the dishes he asked  whos sick asked the other in his turn  johnnys got a day off  the boy shook his head no i couldnt if it was a case of sickness of course id do it but i couldnt spare the time i couldnt really why i ought to be up on the common now  lemuel had listened with a face of interest  dont you want to make half a dollar young feller asked the attendant  yes i do said lemuel eagerly  know how to wash dishes  yes answered the boy not ashamed of his knowledge as the boy of another civilisation might have been nothing more distinctly marks the rustic new england civilisation than the taming of its men to the performance of certain domestic offices elsewhere held dishonourably womanish the boy learns not only to milk and to keep the milk cans clean but to churn to wash dishes and to cook  come around here then said the attendant and lemuel promptly obeyed  well now said his mate thats right id do it myself if i had the time he pulled his soft wool hat out of his hip pocket well good morning pards i dont know as i shall see you again much before night lemuel was lifting a large tray heavy with empty brothbowls what time did you say it was jimmy  seven oclock  well i just got time to get there said the other putting on his hat and pushing out of the door  at the moment lemuel was lifting his tray of empty brothbowls mr sewell was waking for the early quartertoeight breakfast which he thought it right to makenot perhaps as an example to his parishioners most of whom had the leisure to lie later but as a sacrifice not too definite to the lingering ideal of suffering he could not work before breakfasthis delicate digestion forbade thator he would have risen still earlier and he employed the twenty minutes he had between his bath and his breakfast in skimming the morning paper  just at present mr sewell was taking two morning papers the advertiser which he had always taken and a cheap little one cent paper which had just been started and which he bad subscribed for experimentally with the vague impression that he ought to encourage the young men who had established it he did not like it very well it was made up somewhat upon the western ideal and dealt with local matters in a manner that was at once a little more lively and a little more intimate than he had been used to but before he had quite made up his mind to stop it his wife had come to like it on that very account she said it was interesting on this point she used her conscience a little less actively than usual and he had to make her observe that to be interesting was not the whole duty of journalism it had become a matter of personal pride with them respectively to attack and defend the sunrise as i shall call the little sheet though that was not the name and mr sewell had lately made some gain through the character of the police reports which the sunrise had been developing into a feature it was not that offensive matters were introduced the worst cases were in fact rather blinked but sewell insisted that the tone of flippant gaiety with which many facts so serious so tragic for their perpetrators and victims were treated was odious he objected to the court being called a mill and prisoners grists and the procedure grinding he objected to the familiar name of uncle for the worthy gentleman to whose care certain offenders were confided on probation he now read that department of the sunrise the first thing every morning in the hope of finding something with which to put mrs sewell hopelessly in the wrong but this morning a heading in the foreign news of the advertiser caught his eye and he laid the sunrise aside to read at the breakfasttable his wife came down in a cotton dress as a tribute to the continued warmth of the weather and said that she had not called the children because it was saturday and they might as well have their sleep out he liked to see her in that dress it had a leafy rustling that was pleasant to his ear and as she looked into the library he gaily put out his hand which she took and suffered herself to be drawn toward him then she gave him a kiss somewhat less businesslike and preoccupied than usual  well youve got lemuel barker off your mind at last she divined in recognition of her husbands cheerfulness  yes hes off admitted sewell  i hope hell stay in willoughby pastures after this of course it puts an end to our going there next summer oh i dont know sewell feebly demurred  i do said his wife but not despising his insincerity enough to insist that he did also the mellow note of an apostles bellthe gift of an aesthetic parishionercame from below and she said well theres breakfast david and went before him down the stairs  he brought his papers with him it would have been her idea of heightened cosiness at this breakfast which they had once a week alone together not to have the newspapers but she saw that he felt differently and after a number of years of married life a woman learns to let her husband have his own way in some unimportant matters it was so much his nature to have some sort of reading always in hand that he was certainly more himself and perhaps more companionable with his papers than without them  she merely said let me take the sunrise when she had poured out his coffee and he had helped her to cantaloupe and steak and spread his advertiser beside his plate he had the sunrise in his lap  no you may have the advertiser he said handing it over the table to her i was down first and i got both the papers im not really obliged to make any division but ive seen the advertiser and im willing to behave unselfishly if youre very impatient for the police report in the sunrise ill read it aloud for you i think that will be a very good test of its quality dont you  he opened the little sheet and smiled teasingly at his wife who said yes read it aloud im not at all ashamed of it  she put the advertiser in her lap and leaned defiantly forward while she stirred her coffee and sewell unfolded the little sheet and glanced up and down its columns go on if you cant find it i can  never mind here it is said sewell and he began to read  the mill opened yesterday morning with a smaller number of grists than usual but they made up in quality what they lacked in quantity  our friends metaphor seems to have weakened under him a little commented sewell and then he pursued  a reasonable supply of drunks were despatched  come now lucy youll admit that this is horrible he broke off  no said his wife i will admit nothing of the kind its flippant ill allow go on  i cant said sewell but he obeyed  a reasonable supply of drunks were despatched and an habitual drunk in the person of a burly dame from tipperary who pleaded not guilty and then urged the poor childer in extenuation was sent down the harbour for three months uncle cook had been put in charge of a couple of young frailties whose hind name was woman  how do you like that my dear asked sewell exultantly  mrs sewell looked grave and then burst into a shocked laugh you must stop that paper david i cant have it about for the children to get hold of but it is funny isnt it that will do  no i think youd better have it all now there cant be anything worse its funny yes with that truly infernal drollery which the newspaper wits seem to have the art of he read onwhen a case was called that brought the breath of clover blossoms and hayseed into the sultry courtroom and warmed the cockles of the habitués toughened pericardiums with a touch of real poetry this was a case of assault with intent to rob in which a lithe young blonde answering to the good old puritanic name of statira dudley was the complainant and the defendant an innocent looking bucolic youth yclept  sewell stopped and put his hand to his forehead  what is it david demanded his wife why dont you go on is it too scandalous  no no murmured the minister  well  i cant go on but you must read it lucy he said in quite a passion of humility and you must try to be merciful that poor boythat  he handed the paper to his wife and made no attempt to escape from judgment but sat submissive while she read the report of lemuels trial the story was told throughout in the poeticojocular spirit of the opening sentences the reporter had felt the simple charm of the affair only to be ashamed of it and the more offensive about it  when she had finished mrs sewell did not say anything she merely looked at her husband who looked really sick  at last he said making an effort to rise from his chair i must go and see him i suppose  yes if you can find him responded his wife with a sigh  find him echoed sewell  yes goodness knows what more trouble the wretched creatures got into by this time you saw that he was acquitted didnt you she demanded in answer to her husbands stare  no i didnt i supposed he was convicted of course  well you see it isnt so bad as it might be she said using a pity which she did not perhaps altogether feel eat your breakfast now david and then go and try to look him up  oh i dont want any breakfast pleaded the minister  he offered to rise again but she motioned him down in his chair david you shall im not going to have you going about all day with a headache eat and then when youve finished your breakfast go and find out which station that officer baker belongs to and he can tell you something about the boy if any one can  sewell made what shift he could to grasp these practical ideas and he obediently ate of whatever his wife bade him she would not let him hurry his breakfast in the least and when he had at last finished she said now you can go david and when youve found the boy dont you let him out of your sight again till youve put him aboard the train for willoughby pastures and seen the train start out of the depot with him never mind your sermon i will be setting down the heads of a sermon while youre gone that will do you good if you write it out whether it helps any one else or not  sewell was not so sure of that he had no doubt that his wife would set down the heads of a powerful sermon but he questioned whether any discourse however potent would have force to benefit such an abandoned criminal as he felt himself in walking down his brown stone steps and up the long brick sidewalk of bolingbroke street toward the public garden the beds of geraniums and the clumps of scarletblossomed salvia in the little grassplots before the houses which commonly flattered his eye with their colour had a suggestion of penal fires in them now that needed no lingering superstition in his nerves to realise something very like perdition for his troubled soul it was not wickedness he had been guilty of but he had allowed a good man to be made the agency of suffering and he was sorely to blame for he had sinned against himself this was what his conscience said and though his reason protested against his state of mind as a phase of the religious insanity which we have all inherited in some measure from puritan times it could not help him he went along involuntarily framing a vow that if providence would mercifully permit him to repair the wrong he had done he would not stop at any sacrifice to get that unhappy boy back to his home but would gladly take any open shame or obloquy upon himself in order to accomplish this  he met a policeman on the bridge of the public garden and made bold to ask him at once if he knew an officer named baker and which station he could be found at the policeman was overrich in the acquaintance of two officers of the name of baker and he put his hand on sewells shoulder in the paternal manner of policemen when they will be friendly and advised him to go first to the neponset street station to which one of these bakers was attached and inquire there first anyway thats what i should do in your place  sewell was fulsomely grateful as we all are in the like case and at the station he used an urbanity with the captain which was perhaps not thrown away upon him but which was certainly disproportioned to the trouble he was asking him to take in saying whether he knew where he could find officer baker  yes i do said the captain you can find him in bed upstairs but id rather you wouldnt wake a man off duty if you dont have to especially if you dont know hes the one whats wanted  sewell stopped to say that the captain was quite right and then he explained why he wished to see officer baker  the captain listened with nods of his head at the names and facts given guess you wont have to get baker up for that i can tell you what there is to tell i dont know where your young man is now but i gave him an order for a bed at the wayfarers lodge last night and i guess he slept there you a friend of his  yes said sewell much questioning inwardly whether he could be truly described as such i wish to befriend him he added savingly i knew him at home and i am sure of his innocence  oh i guess hes innocent enough said the captain well now i tell you what you do if you want to befriend him you get him home quick as you can  yes said sewell helpless to resent the officers authoritative and patronising tone thats what i wish to do do you suppose hes at the wayfarers lodge now asked sewell  cant say said the captain tilting himself back in his chair and putting his quill toothpick between his lips like a cigarette the only way is to go and see  thank you very much said the minister accepting his dismissal meekly as a man vowed to ignominy should but feeling keenly that he was dismissed and dismissed in disgrace  at the lodge he was received less curtly the manager was there with a long mornings leisure before him and disposed to friendliness that sewell found absurdly soothing he turned over the orders for beds delivered by the vagrants the night before and yes he said coming to lemuels name he slept here but nobody knows where he is by this time wait a bit sir he added to sewells fallen countenance there was one of the young fellows stayed to help us through with the dishes this morning ill have him up or may be youd like to go down and take a look at our kitchen youll find him there if its the one heres our card we can supply you with all sorts of firewood at less cost than the dealers and youll be helping the poor fellows to earn an honest bed and breakfast this way sir  sewell promised to buy his wood there put the card respectfully into his pocket and followed the manager downstairs and through the basement to the kitchen he arrived just as lemuel was about to lift a trayful of clean soupbowls to carry it upstairs after a glance at the minister he stood still with dropped eyes  sewell did not know in what form to greet the boy on whom he had unwillingly brought so much evil and he found the greater difficulty in deciding as he saw lemuels face hardening against him  barker he said at last im very glad to find youi have been very anxious to find you  lemuel made no sign of sympathy but stood still in his long check apron with his sleeves rolled up to his elbow and the minister was obliged to humble himself still further to this figure of lowly obstinacy  i should like to speak with you can i speak with you a few moments  the manager politely stepped into the storeroom and affected to employ himself there leaving lemuel and the minister alone together     x   sewell lost no time i want you to go home barker i feel that i am wholly to blame and greatly to blame for your coming to boston with the expectation that brought you and that i am indirectly responsible for all the trouble that has befallen you since you came i want to be the means of your getting home in any way you can let me  this was a very different way of talking from the smooth superiority of address which the minister had used with him the other day at his own house lemuel was not insensible to the atonement offered him and it was not from sulky stubbornness that he continued silent and left the minister to explore the causes of his reticence unaided  i will go home with you if you like pursued the minister though his mind misgave him that this was an extreme which mrs sewell would not have justified him in i will go with you and explain all the circumstances to your friends in case there should be any misunderstandingthough in that event i should have to ask you to be my guest till monday here the unhappy man laid hold of the sheep which could not bring him greater condemnation than the lamb  i guess they wont know anything about it said lemuel with whatever intention  it seemed hardened indifference to the minister and he felt it his disagreeable duty to say i am afraid they will i read of it in the newspaper this morning and im afraid that an exaggerated report of your misfortunes will reach willoughby pastures and alarm your family  a faint pallor came over the boys face and he stood again in his impenetrable rustic silence the voice that finally spoke from it said i guess i dont want to go home then  you must go home said the minister with more of imploring than imperiousness in his command what will they make of your prolonged absence  i sent a postal to mother this morning they lent me one  but what will you do here without work and without means i wish you to go home with mei feel responsible for youand remain with me till you can hear from your mother im sorry you came to bostonits no place for you as you must know by this time and i am sure your mother will agree with me in desiring your return  i guess i dont want to go home said lemuel  are you afraid that an uncharitable construction will be placed upon what has happened to you by your neighbours lemuel did not answer i assure you that all that can be arranged i will write to your pastor and explain it fully but in any event continued sewell it is your duty to yourself and your friends to go home and live it down it would be your duty to do so even if you had been guilty of wrong instead of the victim of misfortune  i dont know said lemuel as i want to go home and be the laughingstock  against this point sewell felt himself helpless he could not pretend that the boy would not be ridiculous in the eyes of his friends and all the more ridiculous because so wholly innocent he could only say that is a thing you must bear and then it occurred to him to ask do you feel that it is right to let your family meet the ridicule alone  i guess nobody will speak to mother about it more than once said lemuel with a just pride in his mothers powers of retort a woman who unaided and alone had worn the bloomer costume for twenty years in the heart of a commentative community like willoughby pastures was not likely to be without a cutting tongue for her defence  but your sister urged sewell your brotherinlaw he feebly added  i guess they will have to stand it replied lemuel  the minister heaved a sigh of hopeless perplexity what do you propose to do then you cant remain here without means do you expect to sell your poetry he asked goaded to the question by a conscience peculiarly sore on that point  it made lemuel blush no i dont expect to sell it now they took it out of my pocket on the common  i am glad of that said the minister as simply and i feel bound to warn you solemnly that there is absolutely no hope for you in that direction  lemuel said nothing  the minister stood baffled again after a bad moment he asked have you anything particular in view  i dont know as i have  how long can you remain here  i dont know exactly  sewell turned and followed the manager into the refrigerator room where he had remained patiently whistling throughout this interview  when he came back lemuel had carried one trayful of bowls upstairs and returned for another load which he was piling carefully up for safe transportation  the manager tells me said sewell that practically you can stay here as long as you like if you work but he doesnt think it desirable you should remain nor do i but i wish to find you here again when i come back i have something in view for you  this seemed to be a question and lemuel said all right and went on piling up his bowls he added i shouldnt want you to take a great deal of trouble  oh its no trouble groaned the minister then i may depend upon seeing you here any time during the day  i dont know as im going away lemuel admitted  well then goodbye for the present said sewell and after speaking again to the manager and gratefully ordering some kindling which he did not presently need he went out and took his way homeward but he stopped half a block short of his own door and rang at miss vanes to his perturbed and eager spirit it seemed nothing short of a divine mercy that she should be at home if he had not been a man bent on repairing his wrong at any cost to others he would hardly have taken the step he now contemplated without first advising with his wife who he felt sure would have advised against it his face did not brighten at all when miss vane came briskly in with the how dye do which he commonly found so cheering she pulled up the blind and saw his knotted brow  what is the matter you look as if you had got lemuel barker back on your hands  i have said the minister briefly  miss vane gave a wild laugh of delight you dont mean it she sputtered sitting down before him and peering into his face what do you mean  sewell was obliged to possess miss vanes entire ignorance of all the facts in detail from point to point he paused he began really to be afraid she would do herself an injury with her laughing  she put her hand on his arm and bowed her head forward with her face buried in her handkerchief whatwhatdo you supposepose they did with the popopoem they stole from him  well one thing im sure they didnt do said sewell bitterly they didnt read it  miss vane hid her face in her handkerchief and then plucked it away and shrieked again she stopped with the sudden calm that succeeds such a paroxysm and does mrs sewell know all about this she panted  she knows everything except my finding him in the dishwashing department of the wayfarers lodge said sewell gloomily and my coming to you  why do you come to me asked miss vane her face twitching and her eyes brimming  because answered sewell id rather not go to her till i have done something  miss vane gave way again and sewell sat regarding her ruefully  what do you expect me to do she looked at him over her handkerchief which she kept pressed against her mouth  i havent the least idea what i expected you to do i expected you to tell me you have an inventive mind  miss vane shook her head her eyes grew serious and after a moment she said im afraid im not equal to lemuel barker besides she added with a tinge of trouble i have my problem already  yes said the minister sympathetically how has the flower charity turned out  she went yesterday with one of the ladies and carried flowers to the city hospital but she wasnt at all satisfied with the result she said the patients were mostly disgusting old men that hadnt been shaved i think that now she wants to try her flowers on criminals she says she wishes to visit the prisons  sewell brightened forlornly why not let her reform barker  this sent miss vane off again poor boy she sighed when she had come to herself no theres nothing that i can do for him except to order some firewood from his benefactors  i did that said sewell but i dont see how its to help barker exactly  i would gladly join in a public subscription to send him home but you say he wont go home  he wont go home sighed the minister hes determined to stay i suspect he would accept employment if it were offered him in the right spirit  miss vane shook her head theres nothing i can think of except shovelling snow and as yet its rather warm october weather  theres certainly no snow to shovel admitted sewell he rose disconsolately well theres nothing for it i suppose but to put him down at the christian union and explain his checkered career to everybody who proposes to employ him  miss vane could not keep the laughter out of her eyes she nervously tapped her lips with her handkerchief to keep it from them suddenly she halted sewell in his dejected progress toward the door i might give him my furnace  furnace echoed sewell  yes jackson has struck for twelve dollars a month and at present there is a lockouti believe thats what its called and i had determined not to yield as long as the fine weather lasted i knew i should give in at the first frost i will take barker now if you think he can manage the furnace  ive no doubt he can has jackson really struck miss vane nodded he hasnt said anything to me about it  he probably intends to make special terms to the clergy but he told me he was putting up the rates on all his famblies this winter  if he puts them up on me i will take barker too said the minister boldly if he will come he added with less courage well i will go round to the lodge and see what he thinks of it of course he cant live upon ten dollars a month and i must look him up something besides  thats the only thing i can think of at present said miss vane  oh youre indefinitely good to think of so much said sewell you must excuse me if my reception of your kindness has been qualified by the reticence with which barker received mine this morning  oh do tell me about it cried miss vane  sometime i will but i can assure you it was such as to make me shrink from another interview i dont know but barker may fling your proffered furnace in my teeth but im sure we both mean well and i thank you all the same goodbye  poor mr sewell said miss vane following him to the door may i run down and tell mrs sewell  not yet said the minister sadly he was too insecure of barkers reception to be able to enjoy the joke  when he got back to the wayfarers lodge whither he made himself walk in penance he found lemuel with a book in his hand reading while the cook stirred about the kitchen and the broth which he had well under way for the midday meal lifted the lid of its boiler from time to time and sent out a joyous whiff of steam the place had really a cosiness of its own and sewell began to fear that his victim had been so far corrupted by its comfort as to be unwilling to leave the refuge he had often seen the subtly disastrous effect of bounty and it was one of the things he trembled for in considering the question of public aid to the poor before he addressed barker he saw him entered upon the dire life of idleness and dependence partial or entire which he had known so many americans even willing to lead since the first great hard times began and he spoke to him with the asperity of anticipative censure  barker he said and lemuel lifted his head from the book he was reading i have found something for you to do i still prefer you should go home and i advise you to do so but he added at the look that came into lemuels face if you are determined to stay this is the best i can do for you it isnt a full support but its something and you must look about for yourself and not rest till youve found full work and something better fitted for you do you think you can take care of a furnace  hot air asked lemuel  yes  i guess so i took care of the church furnace last winter  i didnt know you had one said the minister brightening in the ray of hope would you be willing to take care of a domestic furnacea furnace in a private house  lemuel pondered the proposal in silence whatever objections there were to it in its difference from the aims of his ambition in coming to the city of boston he kept to himself and his ignorance of city prejudices and sophistications probably suggested nothing against the honest work to his pride i guess i should he said at last well then come with me  sewell judged it best not to tell him whose furnace he was to take care of he had an impression that miss vane was included in the resentment which lemuel seemed to cherish toward him but when he had him at her door its the lady whom you saw at my house the other day he explained it was then too late for lemuel to rebel if he had wished and they went in  if there was any such unkindness in lemuels breast toward her it yielded promptly to her tact she treated him at once not like a servant but like a young person and yet she used a sort of respect for his independence which was soothing to his rustic pride she put it on the money basis at once she told him that she should give him ten dollars a month for taking care of the furnace keeping the sidewalk clear of snow shovelling the paths in the backyard for the women to get at their clotheslines carrying up and down coal and ashes for the grates and doing errands she said that this was what she had always paid and asked him if he understood and were satisfied  lemuel answered with one yes to both her questions and then miss vane said that of course till the weather changed they should want no fire in the furnace but that it might change any day and they should begin at once and count october as a full month she thought he had better go down and look at the furnace and see if it was in order she had had the pipes cleaned but perhaps it needed blacking the cook would show him how it worked she went with him to the head of the basement stairs and calling down jane here is lemuel come to look after the furnace left him and jane to complete the acquaintance upon coming in sight of each other and went back to the minister he had risen to go and she gave him her hand while a smile rippled into laughter on her lips  do you think she asked struggling with her mirth to keep unheard of those below that it is quite the work for a literary man  if he is a man said sewell courageously the work wont keep him from being literary  miss vane laughed at his sudden recovery of spirit as she had laughed at his dejection but he did not care he hurried home with a sermon kindling in his mind so obviously that his wife did not detain him beyond a few vital questions and let him escape from having foisted his burden upon miss vane with the simple comment well we shall see how that will work  as once before sewell tacitly took a hint from his own experience and enlarging to more serious facts from it preached effort in the erring he denounced mere remorse better not feel that at all he taught and he declared that what is ordinarily distinguished from remorse as repentance was equally a mere corrosion of the spirit unless some attempt at reparation went with it he maintained that though some mischiefsperhaps most mischiefswere irreparable so far as restoring the original status was concerned yet every mischief was reparable in the goodwill and the good deed of its perpetrator do what you could to retrieve yourself from error and then not leave the rest to providence but keep doing the good however small must grow if tended and nurtured like a useful plant as the evil would certainly grow like a wild and poisonous weed if left to itself sin he said was a terrible mystery one scarcely knew how to deal with it or to attempt to determine its nature but perhapshe threw out the thought while warning those who heard him of its danger in some aspectssin was not wholly an evil we were so apt in this world of struggle and ambition to become centred solely in ourselves that possibly the wrong done to anotherthe wrong that turned our thoughts from ourselves and kept them bent in agony and despair upon the suffering we had caused another and knew not how to mitigatepossibly this wrong nay certainly this wrong was good in disguise but returning to his original point we were to beware how we rested in this despair in the very extremity of our anguish our fear our shame we were to gird ourselves up to reparation strive to do good he preached strive most of all to do good to those you have done harm to his text was cease to do evil  he finished his sermon during the afternoon and in the evening his wife said they would run up to miss vanes sewell shrank from this a little with the obscure dread that lemuel might have turned his back upon good fortune and abandoned the place offered him in which case sewell would have to give a wholly different turn to his sermon but he consented as indeed he must he was as curious as his wife to know how the experiment had resulted  miss vane did not wait to let them ask my dear she said kissing mrs sewell and giving her hand to the minister in one he is a pearl and ive kept him from mixing his native lustre with rising sun stove polish by becoming his creditor in the price of a pair of overalls i had no idea they were so cheap and you can see that they will fade with a few washings to a perfect millet blue they were quite his own idea when he found the furnace needed blacking and he wanted to use the fifty cents he earned this morning toward the purchase but i insisted upon advancing the entire dollar myself neatness selfrespect aweinspiring deferencehe is each and every one of them in person  sewell could not forbear a glance of triumph at his wife  you leave us very little to ask said that injured woman  but ive left myself a great deal to tell my dear retorted miss vane and i propose to keep the floor though i dont really know where to begin i thought you had got past the necessity of beginning said sewell we know that the new pearl sweeps cleanmiss vane applauded his mixed metaphorand now you might go on from that point  well you may think im rash said miss vane but ive thoroughly made up my mind to keep him  dear dear miss vane cried the minister mrs sewell thinks youre rash but i dont what do you mean by keeping him  keeping him as a fixturea permanencya continuosity  oh a continuosity i know what that is in the ordinary acceptation of the term but im not sure that i follow your meaning exactly  why its simply this said miss vane i have long secretly wanted the protection of what jane calls a manbody in the house and when i saw how lemuel had blacked the furnace i knew i should feel as safe with him as with a whole body of troops  well sighed the minister you have not been rash perhaps but youll allow that youve been rapid  no said miss vane i wont allow that i have simply been intuitivenothing more his functions are not decided yet but it is decided that he is to stay hes to sleep in the little room over the l and in my tranquillised consciousness hes been there years already  and has sibyl undertaken barkers reformation asked sewell  dont interrupt dont anticipate i admit nothing till i come to it but after i had arranged with lemuel i began to think of sibyl  that was like some ladies i have known of said sewell you women commit yourselves to a scheme in order to show your skill in reconciling circumstances to the irretrievable well  dont interrupt david cried his wife  oh let him go on said miss vane its all very well taking people into your house on the spur of the moment and in obedience to a generous impulse but when you reflect that the object of your good intentions slept in the wayfarers lodge the night before and in the policestation the night before that and enjoys a newspaper celebrity in connection with a case of assault and battery with intent to robwhy then you do reflect  yes said sewell that is just the point where i should begin  i thought continued miss vane i had better tell sibyl all about it so if by any chance the neighbours kitchens should have heard of the casethey read the police reports very carefully in the kitchens  they do in some drawingrooms interrupted sewell  its well for you they do david said his wife your protégé would have been in your refuge still if they didnt  i see cried the minister i shall have to take the sunrise another week  miss vane looked from one to the other in sympathetic ignorance but they did not explain and she went on  and if they should hear lemuels name and put two and two together and the talk should get to sibylwell i thought it all over until the whole thing became perfectly lurid and i wished lemuel barker was back in the depths of willoughby pastures  i understand said sewell go on  miss vane did so after stopping to laugh it seemed to me i couldnt wait for sibyl to get homeshe spent the night in brookline and didnt come till five oclockto tell her i began before she had got her hat or gloves off and she sat down with them on and listened like a threeyears child to the ancient mariner but she lost no time when she understood the facts she went out immediately and stripped the nasturtium bed if you could have seen it when you came in theres hardly a blossom left she took the decorations of lemuels room into her own hands at once and if there is any saving power in nasturtiums he will be a changed person she says that now the great object is to keep him from feeling that he has been an outcast and needs to be reclaimed she says nothing could be worse for him i dont know how she knows  barker might feel that he was disgraced said the minister but i dont believe that a whole system of ethics would make him suspect that he needed to be reclaimed  he makes me suspect that i need to be reclaimed said miss vane when he looks at me with those beautiful honest eyes of his  mrs sewell asked has he seen the decorations yet  not at all they are to steal upon him when he comes in tonight the gas is to be turned very low and he is to notice everything gradually so as not to get the impression that things have been done with a design upon him she laughed in reporting these ideas which were plainly those of the young girl sh she whispered at the end  a tall girl with a slim vase in her hand drifted in upon their group like an apparition she had heavy black eyebrows with beautiful blue eyes under them full of an intensity unrelieved by humour  aunty she said severely have you been telling  only mr and mrs sewell sibyl said miss vane their knowing wont hurt hell never know it  if he hears you laughing hell know its about him hes in the kitchen now hes come in the back way do be quiet she had given her hand without other greeting in her preoccupation to each of the sewells in turn and now she passed out of the room     xi   what makes lemuel such a gift said miss vane in a talk which she had with sewell a month later is that he is so supplementary  do you mean just in the supplementary sense of the term  well not in the fifthwheel sense i mean that he supplements us all and singularif you will excuse the legal exactness  oh certainly said sewell i should like even more exactness  yes but before i particularise i must express my general satisfaction in him as a manbody i had no idea that man bodies in a house were so perfectly admirable  ive sometimes feared that we were not fully appreciated said sewell well  the house is another thing with a manbody in it ive often gone without little things i wanted simply because i hated to make sarah bring them and because i hated still worse to go after them knowing we were both weakly and tired now i deny myself nothing i make lemuel fetch and carry without remorse from morning till night i never knew it before but the manbody seems never to be tired or ill or sleepy  yes said sewell that is often the idea of the womanbody im not sure that its correct  oh dont attack it implored miss vane you dont know what a blessing it is then the manbody never complains and i cant see that he expects anything more in an order than the clear understanding of it he doesnt expect it to be accounted for in any way the fact that you say you want a thing is enough it is very strange then the moral support of the presence of a manbody is enormous i now know that i have never slept soundly since i have kept house alonethat i have never passed a night without hearing burglars or smelling fire  and now  and now i shouldnt mind a legion of burglars in the house i shouldnt mind being burned in my bed every night i feel that lemuel is in charge and that nothing can happen  is he really so satisfactory asked sewell exhaling a deep relief  he is indeed said miss vane i couldnt exaggerate it  well well dont try we are finite after all you know do you think it can last  i have thought of that answered miss vane i dont see why it shouldnt last i have tried to believe that i did a foolish thing in coming to your rescue but i cant see that i did i dont see why it shouldnt last as long as lemuel chooses and he seems perfectly contented with his lot he doesnt seem to regard it as domestic service but as domestication and he patronises our inefficiency while he spares it his commonsense is extraordinary its exemplary it almost makes one wish to have commonsense ones self they had now got pretty far from the original proposition and sewell returned to it with the question well and how does he supplement you singularly  oh oh yes said miss vane i could hardly tell you without going into too deep a study of character  im rather fond of that suggested the minister  yes and ive no doubt we should all work very nicely into a sermon as illustrations but i cant more than indicate the different cases in the first place janes forgetfulness seems to be growing upon her and since lemuel came shes abandoned herself to ecstasies of oblivion  yes  yes shes quite given over remembering anything because she knows that he will remember everything  i see and you  well you have sometimes thought i was a little rash  a little did i think it was a little  well a good deal but it was all nothing to what ive been since lemuel came i used to keep some slight check upon myself for sibyls sake but i dont now i know that lemuel is there to temper to delay to modify the effect of every impulse and so i am all impulse now and ive quite ceased to rule my temper i know that lemuel has selfcontrol enough for all the tempers in the house and so i feel perfectly calm in my wildest transports of fury  i understand said sewell and does sibyl permit herself a similar excess in her fancies and ambitions  quite said miss vane i dont know that she consciously relies upon lemuel to supplement her any more than jane does but she must be unconsciously aware that no extravagance of hers can be dangerous while lemuel is in the house  unconsciously aware is good she hasnt got tired of reforming him yet  i dont know i sometimes think she wishes he had gone a little farther in crime then his reformation would be more obvious  yes i can appreciate that does she still look after his art and literature  that phase has changed a little she thinks now that he ought to be stimulated if anythingthat he ought to read george eliot shes put middlemarch and romola on his shelf she says that he looks like tito malemma  sewell rose well i dont see but what your supplement is a very demoralising element i shall never dare to tell mrs sewell what youve said  oh she knows it cried miss vane weve agreed that you will counteract any temptation that lemuel may feel to abuse his advantages by the ferociously selfdenying sermons you preach at him every sunday  do i preach at him do you notice it asked sewell nervously  notice it laughed miss vane i should think your whole congregation would notice it you seem to look at nobody else  i know it since he began to come i cant keep my eyes off him i do deliver my sermons at him i believe i write them at him he has an eye of terrible and exacting truth i feel myself on trial before him he holds me up to a standard of sincerity that is killing me mrs sewell was bad enough i was reasonably bad myself but this couldnt you keep him away do you think its exactly decorous to let your manservant occupy a seat in your family pew how do you suppose it looks to the supreme being  miss vane was convulsed i had precisely those misgivings but lemuel hadnt he asked me what the number of our pew was and i hadnt the heartor else i hadnt the faceto tell him he mustnt sit in it how could i do you think its so very scandalous  i dont know said sewell it may lead to great abuses if we tacitly confess ourselves equal in the sight of god how much better are we than the roman catholics  miss vane could not suffer these ironies to go on  he approves of your preaching he has talked your sermons over with me you oughtnt to complain  oh i dont do you think hes really softening a little toward me  not personally that i know said miss vane but he seems to regard you as a channel of the truth  i ought to be glad of so much said sewell i confess that i hadnt supposed he was at all of our way of thinking they preached a very appreciable orthodoxy at willoughby pastures  i dont know about that said miss vane i only know that he approves your theology or your ethics  ethics i hope im sure theyre right after a thoughtful moment the minister asked have you observed that they have softened him socially at allbroken up that terrible rigidity of attitude that dismaying retentiveness of speech  i know what you mean cried miss vane delightedly i believe lemuel is a little more supple a little less like a granite boulder in one of his meadows but i cant say that hes glib yet he isnt apparently going to say more than he thinks  i hope he thinks more than he says sighed the minister my interviews with lemuel have left me not only exhausted but bruised as if i had been hurling myself against a dead wall yes i manage him better from the pulpit and i certainly oughtnt to complain i dont expect him to make any response and i perceive that i am not quite so sore as after meeting him in private life                                       that evening lemuel was helping to throng the platform of an overcrowded horsecar it was saturday night and he was going to the provision man up toward the south end whom miss vane was dealing with for the time being in an economical recoil from her expensive back bay provision man to order a forgotten essential of the sundays supplies he had already been at the grocers and was carrying home three or four packages to save the cart from going a third time that day to bolingbroke street and he stepped down into the road when two girls came squeezing their way out of the car  well im glad said one of them in a voice lemuel knew at once t theres one mans got the politeness to make a little grain o room for you thank you sir she added with more scorn for the others than gratitude for lemuel youre a gentleman anyway  the hardened offenders on the platform laughed but lemuel said simply youre quite welcome  why lands sakes shouted the girl well if taint you stira she exclaimed to her companion in utter admiration then she added to lemuel why i didnt spose but what youd a ben back home long ago well i am glad ben in boston ever since well i want to know  the conductor had halted his car for the girls to get off but as he remarked with a vicious jerk at his bellstrap he could not keep his car standing there while a woman was asking about the folks and the horses started up and left lemuel behind well there said manda grier f i haint made you lose your car i never see folks like some them conductors  oh i guess i can walk the rest of the way said lemuel his face bright with a pleasure visible in the light of the lamp that brought out statira dudleys smiles and the forward thrust of manda griers whopperjaw as they turned toward the pavement together  well i guess f ive spoke about you once i have a hundred times in the last six weeks i always told stira youd ben sure to turn up bfore this f youd ben in boston all the time n t i guessed youd got a disgust for the place n t you wouldnt want to see it again for one while  statira did not say anything she walked on the other side of manda grier who thrust her in the side from time to time with a lift of her elbow in demand of sympathy and corroboration but though she only spoke to answer yes or no lemuel could see that she was always smiling or else biting her lip to keep herself from it he thought she looked about as pretty as anybody could and that she was again very fashionably dressed she had on a short dolman and a pretty hat that shaded her forehead but fitted close round and she wore long gloves that came up on her sleeves she had a book from the library she walked with a little bridling movement that he found very ladylike manda grier tilted along between them and her tongue ran and ran so that lemuel when they came to miss vanes provision mans could hardly get in a word to say that he guessed he must stop there  statira drifted on a few paces but manda grier halted abruptly with him well f youre ever up our way we shd be much pleased to have you call mr barker she said formally  i should be much pleased to do so said lemuel with equal state  taint but just a little ways round here on the avenue she added  lemuel answered i guess i know where it is he did not mean it for anything of a joke but both the girls laughed and though she had been so silent before statira laughed the most  he could not help laughing either when manda grier said i guess if you was likely to forget the number you could go round to the station and inquire they got your address too  manda grier you be still said statira  stira said thats the way she knew you was from willoughby pastures her folks is from up that way themselves she says the minute she heard the name she knew it couldnt a ben you whoever it was done it  manda grier cried statira again  i tell her she dont believe t any harm can come out the town o willoughby anywheres  manda cried statira  lemuel was pleased but he could not say a word he could not look at statira  well good evening said amanda grier  well good evening said lemuel  well good evening said statira  well good evening said lemuel again  the next moment they were gone round the corner and he was left standing before the provision mans with his packages in his hand it did not come to him till he had transacted his business within and was on his way home that he had been very impolite not to ask if he might not see them home he did not know but he ought to go back and try to find them and apologise for his rudeness and yet he did not see how he could do that either he had no excuse for it he was afraid it would seem queer and make them laugh besides he had those things for miss vane and the cook wanted some of them at once  he could hardly get to sleep that night for thinking of his blunder and at times he cowered under the bedclothes for shame he decided that the only way for him to do was to keep out of their way after this and if he ever met them anywhere to pretend not to see them  the next morning he went to hear mr sewell preach as usual but he found himself wandering far from the sermon and asking or answering this or that in a talk with those girls that kept going on in his mind the minister himself seemed to wander and at times when lemuel forced a return to him he thought he was boggling strangely for the first time mr sewells sermon in his opinion did not come to much  while his place in miss vanes household was indefinitely ascertained he had the whole of sunday and he always wrote home in the afternoon or brought up the arrears of the journal he had begun keeping but the sunday afternoon that followed he was too excited to stay in and write he thought he would go and take a walk and get away from the things that pestered him he did not watch where he was going and after a while he turned a corner and suddenly found himself in a long street planted with shadetrees and looking oldfashioned and fallen from a former dignity he perceived that it could never have been fashionable like bolingbroke street or beacon the houses were narrow and their doors opened from little cavernous arches let into the brick fronts and they stood flush upon the pavement the sidewalks were full of people mostly girls walking up and down at the corners young fellows lounged and there were groups before the cigar stores and the fruit stalls which were open it was not very cold yet and the children who swarmed upon the low doorsteps were bareheaded and often summer clad the street was not nearly so well kept as the streets on the back bay that lemuel was more used to but he could see that it was not a rowdy street either he looked up at a lamp on the first corner he came to and read pleasant avenue on it then he said that the witch was in it he dramatised a scene of meeting those girls and was very glib in it and they were rather shy and miss dudley kept behind amanda grier who nudged her with her elbow when lemuel said he had come round to see if anybody had robbed them of their books on the way home after he left them last night  but all the time as he hurried along to the next corner he looked fearfully to the right and left presently he began to steal guilty glances at the numbers of the houses he said to himself that he would see what kind of a looking house they did live in any way it was only no 900 odd when he began and he could turn off if he wished long before he reached 1334 as he drew nearer he said he would just give a look at it and then rush by but 1334 was a house so much larger and nicer than he had expected that he stopped to collect his slow rustic thoughts and decide whether she really lived there or whether she had just given that number for a blind he did not know why he should think that though she was dressed well enough to come out of any house  while he lingered before the house an old man with a cane in his hand and his mouth hanging open stopped and peered through his spectacles whose glare he fixed upon lemuel till he began to feel himself a suspicious character the old man did not say anything but stood faltering upon his stick and now and then gathering up his lower lip as if he were going to speak but not speaking lemuel cleared his throat hmmn is this a boardinghouse  i dont know crowed the old man in a high senile note you want table board or rooms  i dont want board at all began lemuel again  what crowed the old man and he put up his hand to his ear  people were beginning to put their heads out of the neighbouring windows and to walk slowly as they went by so as to hear what he and the old man were saying he could not run away now and he went boldly up to the door of the large house and rang  a girl came and he asked her with a flushed face if miss amanda grier boarded there somehow he could not bear to ask for miss dudley  well the girl said she rooms here as if that might be a different thing to lemuel altogether  oh he said is she in  well you can walk in said the girl and ill see she came back to ask who shall i say called  mr barker said lemuel and then glowed with shame because he had called himself mister the girl did not come back but she hardly seemed gone before manda grier came into the room he did not know whether she would speak to him but she was as pleasant as could be and said he must come right up to her and stiras room it was pretty high up but he did not notice the stairs manda grier kept talking so and when he got to it and manda grier dashed the door open and told him to walk right in he would not have known but he was in somebodys sittingroom a curtained alcove hid the bed and the room was heated by a cheerful little kerosene stove there were bright folding carpetchairs and the lid of the washstand had a cloth on it that came down to the floor and there were plants in the window there was a mirror on the wall framed in black walnut with gilt moulding inside and a familygroup photograph in the same kind of frame and two chromes and a clock on a bracket  statira seemed surprised to see him the room was pretty warm and her face was flushed he said it was quite mild out and she said was it then she ran and flung up the window and said why so it was and that she had been in the house all day and had not noticed the weather  she excused herself and the room for being in such a state she said she was ashamed to be caught in such a looking dress but they were not expecting company and she did suppose manda grier would have given her time to put the room to rights a little he could not understand why she said all this for the whole room was clean and statira herself was beautifully dressed in the same dress that she had worn the night before or one just like it and after she had put up the window manda grier said stira dudley do you want to kill yourself and ran and pulled aside the curtain in the corner and took down the dolman from among other clothes that hung there and threw it on statiras shoulders who looked as pretty as a pink in it but she pretended to be too hot and wanted to shrug it off and manda grier called out mr barker will you make her keep it on and lemuel sat dumb and motionless but filled through with a sweet pleasure  he tried several times to ask them if they had been robbed on the way home last night as he had done in the scene he had dramatised but he could not get out a word except that it had been pretty warm all day  statira said i think its been a very warm fall and manda grier said i think the summers goin to spend the winter with us and they all three laughed  what speeches you do make manda grier said statira  well anything better than quaker meetin i say retorted manda grier and then they were all three silent and lemuel thought of his clothes and how fashionably both of the girls were dressed  i guess said statira itll be a pretty sickly winter if it keeps along this way they say a green christmas makes a fat grave yard  i guess youll see the snow fly long before christmas said manda grier or thanksgiving either  i guess so too said lemuel though he did not like to seem to take sides against statira  she laughed as if it were a good joke and said taint but about a fortnight now till thanksgiving anyway  if it comes a good fall of snow before thanksgivin wont you come round and give us a sleighride mr barker asked manda grier  they all laughed at her audacity and lemuel said yes he would and she said well give you a piece of real willoughby centre mincepie if you will  they all laughed again  manda grier said statira in protest  her folks sent her half a dozen last thanksgivin persisted manda grier  manda pleaded statira  manda grier sprang up and got lemuel a foldingchair you aint a bit comfortable in that stiff old thing mr barker  lemuel declared that he was perfectly comfortable but she would not be contented till he had changed and then she said why dont you look after your company stira dudley i should think youd be ashamed  lemuels face burned with happy shame and statira who was as red as he was stole a look at him that seemed to say that there was no use trying to stop manda grier but when she went on i dont know but its the fashion to willoughby centre they both gave way again and laughed more than ever and statira said well manda grier what do you spose mr barker ll think  she tried to be sober but the wild girl set her and lemuel off laughing when she retorted guess hell think what he did when he was brought up in court for highway robbery  manda grier sat upright in her chair and acted as if she had merely spoken about the weather he knew that she was talking that way just to break the ice and though he would have given anything to be able to second her he could not  how you do carry on manda grier said statira as helpless as he was  guess i got a pretty good load to carry said manda grier  they all now began to find their tongues a little and statira told how one season when her mother took boarders she had gone over to the pastures with a party of summerfolks on a strawride and picked blueberries she said she never saw the berries as thick as they were there  lemuel said he guessed he knew where the place was but the fire had got into it last year and there had not been a berry there this summer  statira said what a shame she said there were some barkers over east willoughby way and she confessed that when he said his name was barker and he was from willoughby pastures that night in the station she thought she should have gone through the floor  then they talked a little about how they had both felt but not very much and they each took all the blame and would not allow that the other was the least to blame statira said she had behaved like a perfect coot all the way through and lemuel said that he guessed he had been the coot if there was any  i guess there was a pair of you said manda grier and at this association of them in manda griers condemnation he could see that statira was blushing though she hid her face in her hands for her ears were all red  he now rose and said he guessed he would have to be going but when manda grier interposed and asked why whats your hurry he said he guessed he had not had any and statira laughed at the wit of this till it seemed to him she would perish  well then you set right straight down again said manda grier with mock severity as if he were an obstinate little boy and he obeyed though he wished that statira had asked him to stay too  why the land sakes exclaimed manda grier have you been lettin him keep his hat all this while stira dudley you take it right away from him and statira rose all smiling and blushing and said  will you let me take your hat mr barker as if he had just come in and made him feel as if she had pressed him to stay she took it and went and laid it on a stand across the room and lemuel thought he had never seen a much more graceful person she wore a full breton skirt which was gathered thickly at the hips and swung loose and free as she stepped when she came back and sat down letting the back of one pretty hand fall into the palm of the other in her lap it seemed to him impossible that such an elegant young lady should be tolerating a person dressed as he was  there began manda grier i guess mr barker wont object a great deal to our going on if it is sunday s kind of a sunday game anyways you posed to games on sunday  i dont know as i am said lemuel  now manda grier dont you pleaded statira  shall too persisted manda i guess if theres any harm in the key there aint any harm in the bible and so it comes out even dyou ever try your fate with a key and a bible she asked lemuel  i dont know as i did he answered  well its real fun n its curious how it comes out oftentimes well i dont spose theres anything in it but it is curious  i guess we hadnt better said statira i dont believe mr barker ll care for it  lemuel said he would like to see how it was done anyway  manda grier took the key out of the door and looked at it that key ll cut the leaves all to pieces  cant you find some other suggested statira  i dont know but may be i could said manda grier you just wait a half a second  before lemuel knew what she was doing she flew out of the door and he could hear her flying down the stairs  well i must say said statira and then neither she nor lemuel said anything for a little while at last she asked that window trouble you any  lemuel said not at all and he added perhaps its too cold for you  oh no said the girl i cant seem to get anything too cold for me im the greatest person for cold weather im real glad its comin winter we had the greatest time last winter continued statira with those english sparrows used to feed em crumbs there on the windowsill and it seemed as if they got to know we girls and theyd hop right inside if youd let em used to make me feel kind of creepy to have em they say its a sign of death to have a bird come into your room and i was always for drivin em out but manda she said she guessed the lord didnt take the trouble to send birds round to every one and if the rule didnt work one way it didnt work the other you believe in signs  i dont know as i do much mother likes to see the new moon over her right shoulder pretty well said lemuel  well i declare said statira thats just the way with my aunt now youre up here she said springing suddenly to her feet i want you should see what a nice view we got from our window  lemuel had it on his tongue to say that he hoped it was not going to be his last chance he believed he would have said it if manda grier had been there but now he only joined statira at the window and looked out they had to stoop over and get pretty close together to see the things she wished to show him and she kept shrugging her sack on and once she touched him with her shoulder he said yes to everything she asked him about the view but he saw very little of it he saw that her hair had a shade of gold in its brown and that it curled in tight little rings where it was cut on her neck and that her skin was very white under it when she touched him that time it made him feel very strange and when she glanced at him out of her blue eyes he did not know what he was doing he did not laugh as he did when manda grier was there  statira said oh excuse me when she touched him and he answered perfectly excusable but he said hardly anything else he liked to hear her talk and he watched the play of her lips as she spoke once her breath came across his cheek when she turned quickly to see if he was looking where she was pointing  they sat down and talked and all at once statira exclaimed well i should think manda grier was makin that key  now whatever happened lemuel was bound to say i dont think shes been gone very long  well youre pretty patient i must say said statira and he did not know whether she was making fun of him or not he tried to think of something to say but could not i hope shell fetch a lamp too when she comes statira went on and now he saw that it was beginning to be a little darker perhaps that about the lamp was a hint for him to go but he did not see exactly how he could go till manda grier came back he felt that it would not be polite  well there said statira as if she divined his feeling i shall give manda grier a good talkingto im awfully afraid were keeping you mr barker  not at all said lemuel im afraid im keeping you  oh not at all said statira she became rather quieter till manda grier came back  manda grier burst into the room with a key in one hand and a lamp in the other well i knew you twod be holdin quakers meetin  we haint at all how dyou know we have have we mr barker returned statira in simultaneous admission and denial  well if you want to know i listened outside the door said manda grier and you want sayin a word either of you i guess i got a key now thatll do she added setting down her lamp and i borrowed an old bible t i guess taint gon to hurt a great deal  i dont know as i want to play it much said statira  well i guess you got to now said manda grier after all my trouble haint she mr barker  it flattered lemuel through and through to be appealed to but he could not say anything  well said statira if i got to i got to but you got to hold the bible  you got to put the key in cried manda grier she sat holding the bible open toward statira  she offered to put the key in and then she stopped well im great who are we going to find it for first  oh company first said manda grier  you company mr barker asked statira looking at lemuel over her shoulder  i hope not said lemuel gallantly at last  well i declare said statira  quite one the family said manda grier and that made statira say manda and lemuel blush to his hair well anyway continued manda grier youre company enough to have your fate found first put in the key stira  no i shant do it  well i shall then she took the key from statira and shut the book upon it at the song of solomon and bound it tightly in with a ribbon lemuel watched breathlessly he was not sure that he knew what kind of fate she meant but he thought he knew and it made his heart beat quick manda grier had passed the ribbon through the ring of the key which was left outside of the leaves and now she took hold of the key with her two forefingers you got to be careful not to touch the bible with your fingers she explained or the charm wont work now ill say over two verses t where the keys put in and mr barker you got to repeat the alphabet at the same time and when it comes to the first letter of the right name the bible will drop out of my fingers all i can do now then set me as a seal on thine heart  a b c d began lemuel pshaw now manda grier you stop pleaded statira  you be still go on mr barkeras a seal upon thine arm for love is as strong as deathdont say the letters so fast jealousy as cruel as the gravedont look at stira look at methe coals thereof are coals of fireyoure sayin it too slow nowwhich hath a most vehement flame i declare stira dudley if you joggle memany waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown ityou must put just so much time between every letter if you stop on every particular one it aint fairif a man would give all the substance of his house for loveyou stop laughin you twoit would be utterly consumed well there now we got to go it all over again and my arms most broke now  i dont believe mr barker wants to do it again said statira looking demurely at him but lemuel protested that he did and the game began again this time the bible began to shake at the letter d and statira cried out now manda grier youre making it and manda grier laughed so that she could scarcely hold the book lemuel laughed too but he kept on repeating the letters at s the book fell to the floor and statira caught it up and softly beat manda grier on the back with it oh you mean thing she cried out you did it on purpose  manda grier was almost choked with laughing  do you know anybody of the name of sarah mr barker she gasped and then they all laughed together till statira said well i shall surely die now manda grier its your turn and you see if i dont pay you up  i guess i aint afraid any retorted manda grier the book ll do what it pleases in spite of you  they began again statira holding the book this time and lemuel repeating as before and he went quite through the alphabet without anything happening well i declare said statira looking grave lets try it over again  you may try and you may try and you may try said manda grier it wont do you any good i haint got any fate in that line  well thats what were goin to find out said statira but again the verses and alphabet were repeated without effect  now you satisfied asked manda grier  no not yet begin again mr barker  he did so and at the second letter the book dropped statira jumped up and manda grier began to chase her round the room to box her ears for her she said lemuel sat looking on he did not feel at all severe toward them as he usually did toward girls that cut up he did not feel that this was cutting up in fact  stop stop implored statira and ill let you try it over again  no its your turn now  no i aint going to have any said statira folding her arms  you got to said manda grier the rest of us has and now youve got to haint she got to mr barker  yes said lemuel delightedly youve got to miss dudley  miss dudley repeated manda grier how that does sound  i dont know as it sounds any worse than mr barker said lemuel  well said manda grier judicially i shed think it was bout time they was both of em dropped t any rate i dont want you should call me miss grierlemuel  oh cried statira well you are getting along manda grier  well dont you let yourself be outdone then stira  i guess mr barkers good enough for me a while yet said statira and she hastened to add the name i mean and at this they all laughed till statira said i shall certainly die she suddenly recovered herselfthose girls seemed to do everything like lightning lemuel observedand said no i aint goin to have mine told at all i dont like it seems kind of wicked i ruther talk i never could make it just right to act so with the bible  lemuel was pleased at that statira seemed prettier than ever in this mood of reverence  well dont talk too much when im gone said manda grier and before anybody could stop her she ran out of the room but she put her head in again to say ill be back as soons i can take this key home  lemuel did not know what to do the thought of being alone with statira again was full of rapture and terror he was glad when she seized the door and tried to keep manda grier  iiguess i better be going he said  you shant go till i get back anyway said manda grier hospitably you keep him stira  she gave statira a little push and ran down the stairs  statira tottered against lemuel with that round soft shoulder which had touched him before he put out his arms to save her from falling and they seemed to close round her of themselves she threw up her face and in a moment he had kissed her he released her and fell back from her aghast  she looked at him  ii didnt mean to he panted his heart was thundering in his ears  she put up her hands to her face and began to cry  oh my goodness he gasped he wavered a moment then he ran out of the room  on the stairs he met manda grier coming up now mr barker youre real mean to go she pouted  i guess i better be going lemuel called back in a voice so husky that he hardly knew it for his own     xii   lemuel let himself into miss vanes house with his key to the back gate and sat down still throbbing in his room over the l and tried to get the nature of his deed or misdeed before his mind he had grown up to manhood in an austere reverence for himself as regarded the other sex and in a secret fear as exacting for them as it was worshipful of women his mother had held all show of love sickness between young people in scorn she said they were silly things when she saw them soft upon one another and lemuel had imbibed from her a sense of unlawfulness of shame in the love making he had seen around him all his life these things are very open in the country even in large villages they have kissinggames at the childrens parties in the church vestries and refectories and as a little boy lemuel had taken part in such games but as he grew older his reverence and his fear would not let him touch a girl once a big girl much older than he came up behind him in the playground and kissed him he rubbed the kiss off with his hand and scoured the place with sand and gravel one winter all the big boys and girls at school began courting whenever the teacher was out of sight a moment at the noonspell some of them sat with their arms round one another lemuel wandered off by himself in the snows of the deep woods the sight of such things the thought of them put him to shame for those fools as he tacitly called them and now what had he done himself he could not tell at times he was even proud and glad of it and then he did not know what would become of him but mostly it seemed to him that he had been guilty of an enormity that nothing could ever excuse he must have been crazy to do such a thing to a young lady like that her tearstained face looked her wonder at him still  by this time she had told manda grier all about it and he dared not think what their thoughts of him must be it seemed to him that he ought to put such a monster as he was out of the world but all the time there was a sweetness a joy in his heart that made him half frantic with fear of himself  lemuel  he started up at the sound of sibyl vanes voice calling to him from the diningroom which opened into the l  yes maam he answered tremulously going to his door miss vane had been obliged to instruct him to say maam to her niece whom he had at first spoken of by her christian name  was that you came in a little while ago  yes maam i came in  oh and have you had your supper  ii guess i dont want any supper  dont want any supper you will be ill why dont you  i dont know as i feel just like eating anything  well it wont do will you see please if jane is in the kitchen  lemuel came forward full of his unfitness for the sight of men but gathering a little courage when he found the diningroom so dark he descended to the basement and opened the door of the kitchen looked in and shut it again yes maam shes there  oh sibyl seemed to hesitate then she said light the gas down there hadnt you better  i dont know but i had lemuel assented  but before he could obey and lemuel she called down again come and light it up here too please  i will as soon as ive lit it here said lemuel  an imperious order came back you will light it here now please  all right assented lemuel when he appeared in the upper entry and flashed the gas up he saw sibyl standing at the receptionroom door with her finger closed into a book which she had been reading  youre not to say that you will do one thing when youre told to do another  lemuel whitened a little round the lips im not to do two things at once either i suppose  sibyl ignored this reply please go and get your supper and when youve had it come up here again ive some things for you to do  ill do them now said lemuel fiercely i dont want any supper and i shant eat any  why lemuel what is the matter with you asked the girl in the sudden effect of motherly solicitude you look very strange you seem so excited  im not hungry thats all said the boy doggedly what is it you want done  wont you please go up to the third floor said sibyl in a phase of timorous dependence and see if everything is right there i thought i heard a noise see if the windows are fast wont you  lemuel turned and she followed with her finger in her book and her book pressed to her heart talking it seemed to me that i heard steps and voices its very mysterious i suppose any one could plant a ladder on the roof of the l part and get into the windows if they were not fastened  have to be a pretty long ladder grumbled lemuel  yes sibyl assented it would and it didnt sound exactly like burglars  she followed him halfway up the second flight of stairs and stood there while he explored the third story throughout  there aint anything there he reported without looking at her and was about to pass her on the stairs in going down  oh thank you very much lemuel she said with fervent gratitude in her voice she fetched a tremulous sigh i suppose it was nothing yes she added hoarsely it must have been nothing oh let me go down first she cried putting out her hand to stop him from passing her she resumed when they reached the ground floor again aunty has gone out and jane was in the kitchen and it began to grow dark while i sat reading in the drawingroom and all at once i heard the strangest noise her voice dropped deeply on the last word yes it was very strange indeed thank you lemuel she concluded  quite welcome said lemuel dryly pushing on towards the basement stairs  oh and lemuel will you let jane give you your supper in the diningroom so that you could be here if i heard anything else  i dont want any supper said lemuel  the girl scrutinised him with an expression of misgiving then with a little sigh as of one who will not explore a painful mystery she asked would you mind sitting in the diningroom then till aunty gets back  id just as lives sit there said lemuel walking into the dark diningroom and sitting down  oh thank you very much aunty will be back very soon i suppose shes just gone to the sewells to tea  she followed him to the threshold you musti mustlight the gas in here for you  guess i can light the gas said lemuel getting up to intercept her in this service she had run into the receptionroom for a match and she would not suffer him to prevent her  no no i insist and lemuel she said turning upon him i must ask you to excuse my speaking harshly to you i wasagitated  perfectly excusable said lemuel  i am afraid said the girl fixing him with her eyes that you are not well  oh yes im well impretty tired thats all  have you been walking far  yesnot very  the walking ought to do you good said sibyl with serious thoughtfulness i think she continued you had better have some bryonia dont you think you had  no no i dont want anything protested lemuel  she looked at him with a feeling of baffled anxiety painted on her face and as she turned away she beamed with a fresh inspiration i will get you a book she flew into the receptionroom and back again but she only had the book that she had herself been reading  perhaps you would like to read this ive finished it i was just looking back through it  thank you i guess i dont want to read any just now  she leaned against the side of the diningtable beyond which lemuel sat and searched his fallen countenance with a glance contrived to be at once piercing and reproachful i see she said you have not forgiven me  forgiven you repeated lemuel blankly  yesfor giving way to my agitation in speaking to you  i dont know said lemuel with a sigh of deep inward trouble as i noticed anything  i told you to light the gas in the basement suggested sibyl and then i told you to light it up here and theni scolded you  oh yes admitted lemuel that he dropped his head again  sibyl sank upon the edge of a chair lemuel you have something on your mind  the boy looked up with a startled face  yes i can see that you have pursued sibyl what have you been doing she demanded sternly  lemuel was so full of the truth that it came first to his lips in all cases he could scarcely force it aside now with the evasion that availed him nothing i dont know as ive been doing anything in particular  i see that you dont wish to tell me cried the girl but you might have trusted me i would have defended you no matter what you had donethe worse the better  lemuel hung his head without answering  after a while she continued if i had been that girl who had you arrested and i had been the cause of so much suffering to an innocent person i should never have forgiven myself i should have devoted my life to expiation i should have spent my life in going about the prisons and finding out persons who were unjustly accused i should have done it as a penance yes even if he had been guilty  lemuel remained insensible to this extreme of selfsacrifice and she went on this bookit is a storyis all one picture of such a nature there is a girl whos been brought up as the ward of a young man he educates her and she expects to be his wife and he turns out to be perfectly false and unworthy in every way but she marries him all the same although she likes some one else because she feels that she ought to punish herself for thinking of another and because she hopes that she will die soon and when her guardian finds out what shes done for him it will reform him its perfectly sublime itsennobling if every one could read this book they would be very different  i dont see much sense in it said lemuel goaded to this comment  you would if you read it when she diesshe is killed by a fall from her horse in hunting and has just time to join the hands of her husband and the man she liked first and tell them everything it is wrought up so that you hold your breath i suppose it was reading that that made me think there were burglars getting in but perhaps youre right not to read it now if youre excited already ill get you something cheerful she whirled out of the room and back in a series of those swift nervous movements peculiar to her there that will amuse you i know she put the book down on the table before lemuel who silently submitted to have it left there it will distract your thoughts if anything will and i shall ask you to let me sit just here in the receptionroom so that i can call you if i feel alarmed  all right said lemuel lapsing absently to his own troubled thoughts  thank you very much said sibyl she went away and came back directly dont you think she asked that its very strange you should never have seen or heard anything of her  heard of who he asked dragging himself painfully up from the depths of his thoughts  that heartless girl who had you arrested  she wasnt heartless retorted lemuel indignantly  you think so because you are generous and cant imagine such heartlessness perhaps added sibyl with the air of being illumined by a happy thought she is dead that would account for everything she may have died of remorse it probably preyed upon her till she couldnt bear it any longer and then she killed herself  lemuel began to grow red at the first apprehension of her meaning as she went on he changed colour more and more  she is alive cried sibyl shes alive and you have seen her you neednt deny it youve seen her today lemuel rose in clumsy indignation i dont know as anybodys got any right to say what ive done or havent done  o lemuel cried sibyl do you think anyone in this house would intrude in your affairs but if you need a frienda sister  i dont need any sister i want you should let me alone  at these words so little appreciative of her condescension her romantic beneficence her unselfish interest sibyl suddenly rebounded to her former level which she was sensible was far above that of this unworthy object of her kindness she rose from her chair and pursued  if you need a frienda sisterim sure that you can safely confide inthe cook she looked at him a moment and broke into a malicious laugh very unlike that of a social reformer which rang shriller at the bovine fury which mounted to lemuels eyes the rattle of a nightlatch made itself heard in the outer door sibyls voice began to break as it rose i never expected to be treated in my own aunts house with such perfect ingratitude and impudence yes impudenceby one of her servants  she swept out of the room and her aunt who entered it after calling to her in vain stood with lemuel and heard her mount the stairs sobbing to her own room and lock herself in  what is the matter lemuel asked miss vane breathing quickly she looked at him with the air of a judge who would not condemn him unheard but would certainly do so after hearing him whether it was lemuels perception of this that kept him silent or his confusion of spirit from all the late rapidly successive events or a wish not to inculpate the girl who had insulted him he remained silent  answer me said miss vane sharply  lemuel cleared his throat i dont know as ive got anything to say he answered finally  but i insist upon your saying something said miss vane what is this impudence  there hasnt been any impudence replied lemuel hanging his head  very well then you can tell me what sibyl means persisted miss vane  lemuel seemed to reflect upon it no i cant tell you he said at last slowly and gently  you refuse to make any explanation whatever  yes  miss vane rose from the chair which she had mechanically sunk into while waiting for him to speak and ceased to be the kindly generous soul she was in asserting herself as a gentlewoman who had a contumacious servant to treat with you will wait here a moment please  all right said lemuel she had asked him not to receive instructions from her with that particular answer but he could not always remember  she went upstairs and returned with some banknotes that rustled in her trembling hand it is two months since you came and ive paid you one month she said and she set her lips and tried to govern her head which nevertheless shook with the vehemence she was struggling to repress she laid two tendollar notes upon the table and then added a five a little apart this second month was to be twenty instead of ten i shall not want you any longer and should be glad to have you go nowat oncetonight but i had intended to offer you a little present at christmas and i will give it you now  lemuel took up the two tendollar notes without saying anything and then after a moment laid one of them down its only half a month he said i dont want to be paid for any more than ive done  lemuel cried miss vane i insist upon your taking it i employed you by the month  it dont make any difference about that ive only been here a month and a half  he folded the notes and turned to go out of the room miss vane caught the fivedollar note from the table and intercepted him with it well then you shall take it as a present  i dont want any present said lemuel patiently waiting her pleasure to release him but keeping his hands in his pockets  you would have taken it at christmas said miss vane you shall take it now  i shouldnt take a present any time returned lemuel steadily  you are a foolish boy cried miss vane you need it and i tell you to take it  he made no reply whatever  you are behaving very stubbornlyungratefully said miss vane  lemuel lifted his head his lip quivered a little i dont think youve got any right to say im ungrateful  i dont mean ungrateful said miss vane i mean unkindvery silly indeed and i wish you to take this money you are behaving resentfullywickedly i am much older than you and i tell you that you are not behaving rightly why dont you do what i wish  i dont want any money i havent earned  i dont mean the money why dont you tell me the meaning of what i heard my niece said you had been impudent to her perhaps she didnt understand  she looked wistfully into the boys face  after a long time he said i dont know as ive got anything to say about it  very well then you may go said miss vane with all her hauteur  well good evening said lemuel passively but the eyes that he looked at her with were moist and conveyed a pathetic reproach to her unmeasured astonishment he offered her his hand her amaze was even greatermore infinite as she afterwards told sewell when she found herself shaking it  he went out of the room and she heard him walking about his room in the l putting together his few belongings then she heard him go down and open the furnace door and she knew he was giving a final conscientious look at the fire he closed it and she heard him close the basement door behind him and knew that he was gone  she explored the l and then she descended to the basement and mechanically looked it over everything that could be counted hers by the most fastidious sense of property had been left behind him in the utmost neatness on their accustomed nail just inside the furnaceroom hung the blue overalls they looked like a suicidal lemuel hanging there  miss vane went upstairs slowly with a heavy heart under the hall light stood sibyl picturesque in the deep shadow it flung upon her face  aunt hope she began in a tragic voice  dont speak to me you wicked girl cried her aunt venting her selfreproach upon this victim it is your doing  sibyl turned with the meekness of an ostentatious scapegoat unjustly bearing the sins of her tribe and went upstairs into the wilderness of her own thoughts again     xiii   the sense of outrage with which lemuel was boiling when miss vane came in upon sibyl and himself had wholly passed away and he now saw his dismissal unjust as between that girl and him unimpeachably righteous as between him and the moral frame of things if he had been punished for being ready to take advantage of that fellows necessity and charge him fifty cents for changing ten dollars he must now be no less obviously suffering for having abused that young ladys trust and defencelessness only he was not suffering onetenth as much when he recurred to that wrong in fact and tried to feel sorry for it and ashamed his heart thrilled in a curious way he found himself smiling and exulting and miss vane and her niece went out of his mind and he could not think of anything but of being with that girl of hearing her talk and laugh of touching her he sighed he did not know what his mother would say if she knew he did not know where he was going it seemed a hundred years since the beginning of the afternoon  a horsecar came by and lemuel stopped it he set his bag down on the platform and stood there near the conductor without trying to go inside for the bag was pretty large and he did not believe the conductor would let him take it in  the conductor said politely after a while see d i get your fare  no said lemuel he paid and the conductor went inside and collected the other fares  when he came back he took advantage of lemuels continued presence to have a little chat he was a short plump stubbymoustached man and he looked strong and well but he said with an introductory sigh well sir i get sore all over at this business there aint a bone in me that haint got an ache in it sometimes i cant tell but what its the ache got a bone in it ache seems the biggest  why what makes it asked lemuel absently  oh its this standin its the hours and changin the hours so much you haint got a chance to get used to one set o hours before they get em all shifted round again last week i was on from eight to eight this week its from twelve to twelve lord knows what its going to be next week and this is one o the best lines in town too  i presume they pay you pretty well said lemuel with awakening interest  well they pay a dollar n half a day said the conductor  why its more than forty dollars a month said lemuel  well it is said the conductor scornfully if you work every day in the week but i cant stand it more than six days out o seven and if you miss a day or if you miss a trip they dock you no sir its about the meanest business i ever struck if i want a married man n if i didnt like to be regular about my meals and get em at home th my wife i wouldnt stand it a minute but thats where it is its regular  a lady from within signalled the conductor he stopped the car and the lady who had risen with her escort remained chatting with a friend before she got out the conductor snapped his bell for starting with a look of patient sarcasm see that he asked lemuel some these women act as if the cars was their private carriage and you got to act so too or the lady complains of you and the company bounces you in a minute stocks owned along the line and they think they own you too you cant get em to set more than ten on a side theyll leave the car first id like to catch em on some the south end or cambridge cars id show em how to pack live stock once anyway yes sir these ladies that ride on this line think they can keep the car standin while they talk about the opera but youd ought to see how they all look if a poor woman tries their little game oh i tell you rich people are hard  lemuel reflected upon the generalisation he regarded miss vane as a rich person but though she had blamed him unjustly and had used him impatiently even cruelly in this last affair he remembered other things and he said  well i dont know as i should say all of them were hard  well may be not admitted the conductor but i dont envy em the way i look at it and the way i tell my wife i wouldnt want their money f i had to have the rest of it aint any of em happy i saw that when i lived out no sir what me and my wife want to do is to find us a nice little place in the country  at the words a vision of willoughby pastures rose upon lemuel and a lump of homesickness came into his throat he saw the old wood coloured house crouching black within its walls under the cold november stars if his mother had not gone to bed yet she was sitting beside the cookingstove in the kitchen and perhaps his sister was brewing something on it potion or lotion for her husbands rheumatism miss vane had talked to him about his mother she had said he might have her down to visit him if everything went on right but of course he knew that miss vane did not understand that his mother wore bloomers and he made up his mind that her invitation was never to be accepted at the same time he had determined to ask miss vane to let him go up and see his mother some sunday  s furs we go said the conductor f youre goin on you want to take another car here  i guess ill go back with you a little ways said lemuel i want to ask you  guess well have to take a back seat then said the conductor leading the way through the car to the other platform or a standee he added snapping the bell what is it you want to ask  oh nothing how do you fellows learn to be conductors how long does it take you  till other passengers should come the conductor lounged against the guard of the platform in a conversational posture  well generally it takes you four or five days you got to learn all the cross streets and the principal places on all the lines  yes  it didnt take me moren two boston boy  yes said lemuel with a fine discouragement i presume the conductors are mostly from boston  theyre from everywhere and some of em are pretty streaked i can tell you and then the rest of us has got to suffer throws suspicion on all of us one fellow gets to stealin fares and then everybodys got to wear a bellpunch i never hear mine go without thinkin it says stop thief makes me sick i can tell you  after a while lemuel asked how do you get such a position  the conductor seemed to be thinking about some thing else its a pretty queer kind of a world anyway the way everybodys mixed up with everybody else whats the reason if a man wants to steal he cant steal and suffer for it himself without throwin the shame and the blame on a lot more people that never thought o stealin i dont notice much when a fellow sets out to do right that folks think everybody else is on the square no sir they dont seem to consider that kind of complaint so catching now you take another thing a woman goes round with the scarlet fever in her clothes and a whole carful of people take it home to their children but let a nice young girl get in fresh as an apple and a perfect daisy for wholesomeness every way and she dont give it to a single soul on board no sir its a world i cant see through nor begin to  i never thought of it that way said lemuel darkened by this black pessimism of the conductor he had not practically found the world so unjust as the conductor implied but he could not controvert his argument he only said may be the right thing makes us feel good in some way we dont know of  well i dont want to feel good in some way i dont know of myself said the conductor very scornfully  no thats so lemuel admitted he remained silent with a vague wonder flitting through his mind whether mr sewell could make anything better of the case and then settled back to his thoughts of statira pierced and confused as they were now with his pain from that trouble with miss vane  what was that you asked me just now said the conductor  that i asked you lemuel echoed oh yes i asked you how you got your place on the cars  well sir you have to have recommendationsthey wont touch you without em and then you have to have about seventyfive dollars capital to start with you got to get your coat and your cap and your badge and you got to have about twenty dollars of your own to make change with first off company dont start you with a cent  lemuel made no reply after a while he asked do you know any good hotel around here where i could go for the night  well theres the brunswick and theres the vandome said the conductor theyre both pretty fair houses lemuel looked round at the mention of the aristocratic hostelries to see if the conductor was joking he owned to something of the kind by adding theres a little hotel if you want something quieter that aint a great ways from here he gave the name of the hotel and told lemuel how to find it  thank you said lemuel i guess ill get off here then well good evening  guess ill have to get another nickel from you said the conductor snapping his bell new trip he explained  oh said lemuel paying it seemed to him a short ride for five cents  he got off and as the conductor started up the car he called forward through it to the driver wanted to try for conductor i guess but i guess the seventyfive dollars capital settled that little point for him  lemuel heard the voice but not the words he felt his bag heavy in his hand as he walked away in the direction the conductor had given him and he did not set it down when he stood hesitating in front of the hotel it looked like too expensive a place for him with its stainedglass door and its bulk hoisted high into the air he walked by the hotel and then he came back to it and mustered courage to go in his bag if not superb looked a great deal more like baggage than the lank sack which he had come to boston with he had bought it only a few days before in hopes of going home before long he set it down with some confidence on the tesselated floor of cheap marble and when a shirtsleeved drowsyeyed young man came out of a little room or booth near the door where there was a desk and a row of bells and a board with keys hanging from the wall above it lemuel said quite boldly that he would like a room the man said well they did not much expect transients it was more of a familyhotel like but he guessed they had a vacancy and they could put him up he brushed his shirt sleeves down with his hands and looked apologetically at some ashes on his trousers and said well it was not much use trying to put on style anyway when you were taking care of a furnace and had to run the elevator yourself and look after the whole concern he said his aunt mostly looked after letting the rooms but she was at church and he guessed he should have to see about it himself he bade lemuel just get right into the elevator and he put his bag into a cage that hung in one corner of the hallway and pulled at the wire rope and they mounted together on the way up he had time to explain that the clerk who usually ran the elevator when they had no elevatorboy had kicked and they were just between hay and grass as you might say he showed lemuel into a grandiose parlour or drawingroom enormously draped and upholstered and furnished in a composite application of yellow jute and red plush to the ashen easychairs and sofa a foldingbed in the figure of a chiffonier attempted to occupy the whole side of the wall and failed  im afraid its more than i can pay said lemuel i guess i better see some other room but the man said the room belonged to a boarder that had just gone and he guessed they would not charge him very much for it he guessed lemuel had better stay he pulled the bed down and showed him how it worked and he lighted two bulbous gasburners contrived to burn the gas at such a low pressure that they were like two unsnuffed candles for brilliancy he backed round over the spacious floor and looked about him with an unfamiliar marauding air which had a certain boldness but failed to impart courage to lemuel who trembled for fear of the unknown expense but he was ashamed to go away and when the man left him he went to bed after some suspicious investigation of the machine he was to sleep in he found its comfort unmistakable he was tired out with what had been happening and the events of the day recurred in a turmoil that helped rather than hindered slumber none evolved itself distinctly enough from the mass to pursue him what he was mainly aware of was the daring question whether he could not get the place of that clerk who had kicked  in the morning he saw the landlady who was called mrs harmon and who took the pay for his lodging and said he might leave his bag a while there in the office she was a large smooth tranquil person who seemed ready for any sort of consent she entered into an easy conversation with lemuel and was so sympathetic in regard to the difficulties of getting along in the city that he had proposed himself as clerk and been accepted almost before he believed the thing had happened he was getting a little used to the rapidity of urban transactions but his mind had still a rustic difficulty in keeping up with his experiences  i suppose said mrs harmon it aint very usual to take anybody without a reference i never do it but so long as you havent been a great while in the cityyou ever had a place in boston before  well not exactly what you may call a place said lemuel with a conscience against describing in that way his position at miss vanes it was only part work he added i wasnt there but a little while  know anybody in the city  yes said lemuel reluctantly i know rev david l sewell some  oh all right said mrs harmon with eager satisfaction i have to be pretty particular who i have in the house the boarders are all highclass and i have to have all the departments accordingly ill see mr sewell about you as soon as i get time and i guess you can take right hold now if you want to  mrs harmon showed him in half a minute how to manage the elevator and then left him with general instructions to tell everybody who came upon any errand he did not understand that she would be back in a very short time he found pen and paper in the office and she said he might write the letter that he asked leave to send his mother when he mentioned his mother she said yes indeed with a burst of maternal sympathy which was imagined in her case for she had already told lemuel that if she had ever had any children she would not have gone into the hotel business which she believed unfriendly to their right nurture she said she never liked to take ladies with children  he enclosed some money to his mother which he had intended to send but which before the occurrence of the good fortune that now seemed opening upon him he thought he must withhold he made as little as he could of his parting with miss vane whom he had celebrated in earlier letters to his mother he did not wish to afflict her on his own account or incense her against miss vane who he felt could not help her part in it but his heart burned anew against miss sibyl while he wrote he dwelt upon his good luck in getting this new position at once and he let his mother see that he considered it a rise in life he said he was going to try to get mrs harmon to let him go home for thanksgiving though he presumed he might have to come back the same night  his letter was short but he was several times interrupted by the lady boarders many of whom stopped to ask mrs harmon something on their way to their rooms from breakfast they did not really want anything in most cases but they were strict with lemuel in wanting to know just when they could see mrs harmon and they delayed somewhat to satisfy a natural curiosity in regard to him they made talk with him as he took them up in the elevator and did what they could to find out about him most of them had their doorkeys in their hands and dangled them by the triangular pieces of brass which the keys were chained to they affected some sort of negligée breakfast costume and lemuel thought them very fashionable they nearly all snuffled and whined as they spoke some had a soft lazy nasal others broke abruptly from silence to silence in voices of nervous sharpness like the cry or the bleat of an animal one young girl who was quite pretty had a high hoarse voice like a gander  lemuel did not mind all this he talked through his nose too and he accepted mrs harmons smooth characterisation of her guests as she called them which she delivered in a slow unimpassioned voice i never have any but the highest class people in my housethe very nicest and i never have any jangling going on in the first place i never allow anybody to have anything to complain of and then if they do complain im right up and down with them i tell them their rooms are wanted and they understand what i mean and i never allow any trouble among the servants i tell them if they are not suited that i dont want them to stay and if they get to quarrelling among themselves i send them all away and get a new lot i pay the highest wages and i can always do it if you want to keep up with the times at all you have got to set a good table and i mean to set just as good a table as any in boston i dont intend to let any one complain of my house on that score well its as broad as its long if you set a good table you can ask a good price and if you dont you cant thats all pay as you go is my motto  mrs harmon sat talking in the little den beside the door which she called the office when she returned from that absence which she had asked him to say would not be more than fifteen minutes at the outside it had been something more than two hours and it had ended almost clandestinely but knowledge of her return had somehow spread through the house and several ladies came in while she was talking to ask when their windowshades were to be put up or to say that they knew their gasfixtures must be out of order or that there were mice in their closets for they had heard them gnawing or that they were sure their setbowls smelt and that the traps were not working mrs harmon was prompt in every exigency she showed the greatest surprise that those shades had not gone up yet she said she was going to send round for the gasfitter to look at the fixtures all over the house and that she would get some potash to pour down the bowls for she knew the drainage was perfectit was just the pipes down to the traps that smelt she advised a cat for the mice and said she would get one she used the greatest sympathy with the ladies recognising a real sufferer in each and not attempting to deny anything from the diningroom came at times the sound of voices which blended in a discord loud above the clatter of crockery but mrs harmon seemed not to hear them an excited foreigner of some sort finally rushed from this quarter and thrust his head into the booth where lemuel and mrs harmon sat long enough to explode some formula of renunciation upon her which left her serenity unruffled she received with the same patience the sarcasm of a boarder who appeared at the officedoor with a bag in his hand and said he would send an expressman for his trunk he threw down the money for his receipted bill and when she said she was sorry he was going he replied that he could not stand the table any longer and that he believed that french cook of hers had died on the way over he was tired of the nova scotia temporary who had become permanent a gentleman waited for the parting guest to be gone and then said to the tranquil mrs harmon so mellen has kicked has he  yes mr evans said mrs harmon mr mellen has kicked  and dont you want to abuse him a little you can to me you know suggested the gentleman  he had a full beard parted at the chin it was almost white and looked older than the rest of his face his eyes were at once sad and whimsical lemuel tried to think where he had seen him before  thank you i dont know as it would do any good mr evans but if he could have waited one week longer i should have had that cook  yes that is what i firmly believe do you feel too much broken up to accept a ticket to the wednesday matinée at the museum  no i dont said mrs harmon but i shouldnt want to deprive mrs evans of it  oh she wouldnt go said mr evans with a slight sigh you had better take it jeffersons going to do bob acres  is that so asked mrs harmon placidly taking the ticket well im ever so much obliged to you mr evans mr evans mr barker our new clerk she said introducing them  lemuel rose with rustic awkwardness and shook hands with mr evans who looked at him with a friendly smile but said nothing  now mr barker is here i guess i can get the time mr evans said well he was glad she could and went out of the street door hes just one of the nicest gentlemen ive got continued mrs harmon following him with her eye as far as she conveniently could without turning her head him and his wife both ever heard of the saturday afternoon  i dont know as i have said lemuel  well hes one of the editors its a kind of a sunday paper i guess for all it dont come out that day i presume he could go every night in the week to every theatre in town if he wanted to i dont know how many tickets hes give me some of the ladies seem to think hes always makin fun of them but i cant ever feel that way he used to board with a great friend of mine him and his wife theyve been with me now ever since mrs hewitt died she was the one they boarded with before they say he used to be dreadful easy going n t his wife was all t saved him but i guess hes different now well i must go out and see after the lunch you watch the office and say just what i told you before     xiv   sewell chanced to open his door to go out just as miss vane put her hand on the bellpull the morning after she had dismissed lemuel the cheer of his monday face died out at the unsmiling severity of hers but he contrived to ask her in and said he would call mrs sewell if she would sit down in the receptionroom a moment  i dont know she said with a certain look of inquiry not unmixed with compassion its about lemuel  the minister fetched a deep sigh yes i know it but she will have to know it sooner or later he went to the stairway and called her name and then returned to miss vane in the receptionroom  has lemuel been here she asked  no  you said you knew it was about him  it was my bad conscience i suppose and your face that told me  miss vane waited for mrs sewells presence before she unpacked her heart then she left nothing in it she ended by saying i have examined and crossexamined sibyl but its like crossquestioning a chameleon she changed colour with every new light she was put into here miss vane had got sorrowfully back to something more of her wonted humour and laughed  poor sibyl said mrs sewell  poor retorted miss vane not at all i could get nothing out of either of them but i feel perfectly sure that lemuel was not to blame  its very possible suggested mrs sewell that he did say something in his awkward way that she misconstrued into impertinence  miss vane did not seem to believe this if lemuel had given me the slightest satisfaction she began in selfexculpation but no she broke off it had to be she rose i thought i had better come and tell you at once mr sewell i suppose you will want to look him up and do something more for him i wish if you find him you would make him take this note she gave the minister a ten dollar bill i tried to do so but he would not have it i dont know what i shall do without him he is the best and most faithful creature in the world even in this little time i had got to relying implicitly upon his sense his judgment his goodness hiswell good morning  she ran out of the door and left sewell confronted with his wife  he did not know whether she had left him to hope or to despair and he waited for his wife to interpret his emotion but mrs sewell tacitly refused to do this after a dreary interval he plucked a random cheerfulness out of space and said well if miss vane feels in that way about it i dont see why the whole affair cant be arranged and barker reinstated  david returned his wife not vehemently at all when you come out with those mannish ideas i dont know what to do  well my dear said the minister i should be glad to come out with some womanish ideas if i had them i dare say they would be better but i do my poor best under the circumstances what is the trouble with my ideas except that the sex is wrong  you think you men replied mrs sewell that a thing like that can be mended up and smoothed over and made just the same as ever you think that because miss vane is sorry she sent barker away and wants him back she can take him back  i dont see why she cant ive sometimes supposed that the very highest purpose of christianity was mutual forgivenessforbearance with one anothers errors  thats all very well said mrs sewell but you know that whenever i have taken a cook back after she had shown temper its been an entire failure and this is a far worse case because there is disappointed goodwill mixed up with it i dont suppose barker is at all to blame whatever has happened you may be perfectly sure that it has been partly a bit of stageplay in sibyl and partly a mischievous desire to use her power over him i foresaw that she would soon be tired of reforming him but whatever it is its something that you cant repair suppose barker went back to them could they ignore whats happened  of course not sewell admitted  well and should he ask her pardon or she his  the socratic method is irresistible said the minister sadly you have proved that nothing can be done for barker with the vanes and now the question is what can be done for him  thats something i must leave to you david said his wife dispiritedly she arose and as she passed out of the room she added you will have to find him in the first place and you had better go round to the police stations and the tramps lodginghouses and begin looking  sewell sighed heavily under the sarcastic advice but acted upon it and set forth upon the useless quest because he did not know in the least what else to do  all that week barker lay a lurking discomfort in his soul though as the days passed the burden grew undeniably lighter sewell had a great many things besides barker to think of but when sunday came and he rose in his pulpit he could not help casting a glance of guilty fear toward miss vanes pew and drawing a long breath of guilty relief not to see lemuel in it we are so made that in the reaction the minister was able to throw himself into the matter of his discourse with uncommon fervour it was really very good matter and he felt the literary joy in it which flatters the author even of a happily worded supplication to the deity he let his eyes freed from their bondage to lemuels attentive face roam at large in liberal ease over his whole congregation and when toward the close of his sermon one visage began to grow out upon him from the two or three hundred others and to concentrate in itself the facial expression of all the rest and become the only countenance there it was a perceptible moment before he identified it as that of his inalienable charge then he began to preach at it as usual but defiantly and with yet a haste to be through and to get speech with it that he felt was ludicrous and must appear unaccountable to his hearers it seemed to him that he could not bring his sermon to a close he ended it in a cloudy burst of rhetoric which he feared would please the nervous elderly ladieswho sometimes blamed him for a want of emotionalityand knew must grieve the judicious while the choir was singing the closing hymn he contrived to beckon the sexton to the pulpit and described and located lemuel to him as well as he could without actually pointing him out he said that he wished to see that young man after church and asked the sexton to bring him to his room the sexton did so to the best of his ability but the young man whom he brought was not lemuel and had to be got rid of with apologies  on three or four successive sundays lemuels face dawned upon the minister from the congregation and tasked his powers of impersonal appeal and mental concentration to the utmost it never appeared twice in the same place and when at last sewell had tutored the sexton carefully in lemuels dress he was driven to despair one morning when he saw the boy sliding along between the seats in the gallery and sitting down with an air of satisfaction in an entirely new suit of clothes  after this defeat the sexton said with humorous sympathy well there aint anything for it now mr sewell but a detective or else an advertisement in the personals  sewell laughed with him at his joke and took what comfort he could from the evidence of prosperity which lemuels new clothes offered he argued that if barker could afford to buy them he could not be in immediate need and for some final encounter with him he trusted in providence and was not too much cast down when his wife made him recognise that he was trusting in luck it was an ordeal to look forward to finding lemuel sooner or later among his hearers every sunday but having prepared his nerves for the shock as men adjust their sensibilities to the recurrent pain of a disease he came to bear it with fortitude especially as he continually reminded himself that he had his fixed purpose to get at lemuel at last and befriend him in any and every possible way he tried hard to keep from getting a grudge against him  at the hotel lemuel remained in much of his original belief in the fashion and social grandeur of the ladies who formed the majority of mrs harmons guests our womankind are prone to a sort of helpless intimacy with those who serve them the ladies had an instinctive perception of lemuels trustiness and readily gave him their confidence and much of their history he came to know them without being at all able to classify them with reference to society at large as of that large tribe among us who have revolted from domestic care and have skilfully unseated the black rider who remains mounted behind the husband of the average ladyboarder some of them had never kept house being young and newly married though of this sort there were those who had tried it in flats and had reverted to their natural condition of boarding they advised lemuel not to take a flat whatever he did unless he wanted to perish at once other lady boarders had broken up housekeeping during the first years of the war and had been boarding round ever since going from hotels in the city to hotels in the country and back again with the change of the seasons these mostly had husbands who had horses and they talked with equal tenderness of the husbands and the horses so that you could not always tell which jim or bob was usually they had no children but occasionally they had a married daughter or a son who lived west there were several single ladies one who seemed to have nothing in this world to do but to come down to her meals and another a physician who had not been able in embracing the medical profession to deny herself the girlish pleasure of her pet name and was lettered in the list of guests in the entry as dr cissie bluff in the attic which had a northlight favourable to their work were two girls who were studying art at the museum one of them looked delicate at first sight and afterwards seemed merely very gentle with a cleareyed pallor which was not unhealth a student in the law school sat at the table with these girls and seemed sometimes to go with them to concerts and lectures from his talk which was almost the only talk that made itself heard in the diningroom it appeared that he was from wyoming territory he treated the young ladies as representative of boston and its prejudices though apparently they were not bostonians there were several serious and retiring couples of whom one or other was an invalid and several who were poor and preferred the plated gentility of mrs harmons hotelit was called the st albans mrs harmon liked the nameto the genuine poverty of such housekeeping as they could have set up about each of these women a home might have clung with all its loves and cares they were naturally like other women but here they were ignoble particles without attraction for one another or apparently joy for themselves impermanent idle listless they had got rid of the trouble of housekeeping and of its dignity and usefulness there were a few children in the house not at all noisy the boys played on the sidewalk and the little girls stayed in their rooms with their mothers and rarely took the air oftener than they  they came down rather later to breakfast and they seemed not to go to school some of them had piano lessons in their rooms their mothers did not go out much sometimes they went to church or the theatre and they went shopping but they had apparently no more social than domestic life now and then they had a friend to lunch or dinner if a lady was absent it was known to mrs harmon and through her to the other ladies that she was spending the day with a friend of hers at an hotel in newton or lexington or woburn in a city full of receptions of dinnergiving and partygoing mrs harmons guests led the lives of cloistered nuns so far as such pleasures were concerned occasionally a transient had rooms for a week or two and was continually going and receiving visits she became the object of a certain unenvious curiosity with the other ladies who had not much sociability among themselves they waited a good while before paying visits at one anothers rooms and then were very punctilious not to go again until their calls had been returned they were all doctoring themselves they did not talk gossip or scandal much they talked of their diseases and physicians and their married daughters and of mrs harmon whom they censured for being too easygoing certain of them devoured novels which they carried about clasped to their breasts with their fingers in them at the place where they were reading they did not often speak of them and apparently took them as people take opium  the men were the husbands or fathers of the women and were wholly without the domestic weight or consequence that belongs to men living in their own houses there were certain old bachelors among whom were two or three decayed branches of good boston families spendthrifts or invalided bankrupts mr evans was practically among the single gentlemen for his wife never appeared in the parlour or diningroom and was seen only when she went in or out heavily veiled for a walk lemuel heard very soon that she had suffered a shock from the death of her son on the cars the other ladies made much of her inability to get over it and said nothing would induce them to have a son of theirs go in and out on the cars  among these people such as they were and far as they might be from a final civilisation lemuel began to feel an ambition to move more lightly and quickly than he had yet known how to do to speak promptly and to appear well our schooling does not train us to graceful or even correct speech even our colleges often leave that uncouth many of mrs harmons boarders spoke bad grammar through their noses but the ladies dressed stylishly and the men were good arithmeticians lemuel obeyed a native impulse rather than a good example in cultivating a better address but the incentive to thrift and fashion was all about him he had not been ignorant that his clothes were queer in cut and out of date and during his stay at miss vanes he had taken much council with himself as to whether he ought not to get a new suit with his first money instead of sending it home now he had solved the question after sending the money home by the discovery of a place on a degenerate street in a neighbourhood of chinese laundries with the polite name of misfit parlours where they professed to sell the failures of the leading tailors of boston new york and chicago after long study of the window of the parlours lemuel ventured within one day and was told when he said he could not afford the suit he fancied that he might pay for it on the instalment plan which the proprietor explained to him in the mirror he was almost startled at the stylishness of his own image the proprietor of the parlours complimented him you see youve got a good figure for a suit of clotheswhat i call a ready made figure you can go into a clothing store anywheres and fit you  he took the first instalment of the price with lemuels name and address and said he would send the clothes round but in the evening he brought them himself and no doubt verified lemuels statement by this device it was a saturday night and the next morning lemuel rose early to put them on he meant to go to church in them and in the afternoon he did not know just what he should do he had hoped that some chance might bring them together again and then he could see from the way miss dudley and manda grier behaved just what they thought he had many minds about the matter himself and had gone from an extreme of selfabhorrence to one of selfvindication and between these he had halted at every gradation of blame and exculpation but perhaps what chiefly kept him away was the uncertainty of his future till he could give some shape to that he had no courage to face the past sometimes he wished never to see either of those girls again but at other times he had a longing to go and explain to justify himself or to give himself up to justice  the new clothes gave him more heart than he had yet had but the most he could bring himself to do was to walk towards pleasant avenue the next sunday afternoon which mrs harmon especially gave himand to think about walking up and down before the house it ended in his walking up and down the block first on one side of the street and then on the other he knew the girls window miss dudley had shown him it was the middle window of the top story when they were looking out of it and he glanced up at it then he hurried away but he could not leave the street without stopping at the corner to cast a last look back at the house there was an apothecarys at that corner and while he stood wistfully staring and going round the corner a little way and coming back to look at the things in the apothecarys window he saw manda grier come swiftly towards him he wanted to run away now but he could not he felt nailed to the spot and he felt the colour go out of his face she pretended not to see him at first but with a second glance she abandoned the pretence and at his saying faintly good afternoon she said with freezing surprise oh good afternoon mr barker and passed into the apothecarys  he could not go now since he had spoken and leave all so inconclusive again and yet manda grier had been so repellent so cutting in her tone and manner that he did not know how to face her another time when she came out he faltered i hope there isnt anybody sick at your house miss grier  oh nobody that youll care about mr barker she answered airily and began to tilt rapidly away with her chin thrust out before her  he made a few paces after her and then stopped she seemed to stop too and he caught up with her  i hope he gasped there aint anything the matter with miss dudley  oh nothing t youll care about said manda grier and she added with terrible irony youve ben round to inquire so much that you haint allowed time for any great change  has she been sick long faltered lemuel i didnt dare to come he cried out ive been wanting to come but i didnt suppose you would speak to meany of you now his tongue was unlocked he ran on i dont know as its any excusethere aint any excuse for such a thing i know she must perfectly despise me and that im not fit for her to look at but id give anything if i could take it all back and be just where i was before you tell her wont you how i feel  manda grier who had listened with a killingly averted face turned sharply upon him you mean about stayin away so long i dont know as she cared a great deal but its a pretty queer way of showin you cared for her  i didnt mean that retorted lemuel and he added by an immense effort i meantthe way i behaved when i was there i meant  oh said manda grier turning her face away again she turned it so far away that the back of her head was all that lemuel could see i guess you better speak to statira about that  by this time they had reached the door of the boardinghouse and manda grier let herself in with her latchkey wont you walk in mr barker she said in formal tones of invitation  is she well enough to seecompany murmured lemuel i shouldnt want to disturb her  i dont believe but what she can see you said manda grier for the first time relentingly  all right said lemuel gulping the lump in his throat and he followed manda grier up the flights of stairs to the door of the girls room which she flung open without knocking  stira she said heres mr barker and lemuel from the dark landing where he lurked a moment could see statira sitting in the rockingchair in a pretty blue dressinggown after a first flush she looked pale and now and then put up her hand to hide a hoarse little cough     xv   walk right in mr barker cried manda grier and lemuel entered more awkward and sheepish in his new suit from the misfit parlours than he had been before in his willoughby pastures best clothes statira merely said why mr barker and stood at her chair where she rose youre quite a stranger wont you sit down  lemuel sat down and manda grier said politely wont you let me take your hat mr barker and they both treated him with so much ceremony and deference that it seemed impossible he could ever have done such a monstrous thing as kiss a young lady like miss dudley and he felt that he never could approach the subject even to accept a just doom at her hands  they all talked about the weather for a minute and then manda grier said well i guess i shall have to go down and set this boneset to steep and as he rose and stood to let her pass she caught his arm and gave it a clutch he did not know whether she did it on purpose or why she did it but somehow it said to him that she was his friend and he did not feel so much afraid  when she was gone however he returned to the weather for conversation but when statira said it was lucky for her that the winter held off so he made out to inquire about her sickness and she told him that she had caught a heavy cold at first it seemed just to be a headcold but afterwards it seemed to settle on the lungs and it seemed as if she never could throw it off they had had the doctor twice but now she was better and the cough was nearly all gone  i guess i took the cold that day from havin the window open she concluded and she passed her hand across her lap and looked down demurely and then up at the ceiling and her head twitched a little and trembled  lemuel knew that his hour had come if ever it were to come and he said hoarsely i guess if i made you take cold that day it wasnt all i did i guess i did worse than that  she did not look at him and pretend ignorance as manda grier would have done but lifting her moist eyes and then dropping them she said why mr barker what can you mean  you know what i mean he retorted with courage astonishing to him it was because i liked you so much he could not say loved it seemed too bold theres nothing else can excuse it and i dont know as that can  she put up her hands to her eyes and began to cry and he rose and went to her and said oh dont cry dont cry and somehow he took hold of her hands and then her arms went round his neck and she was crying on his breast  youll think im rather of a silly person crying so much about nothing she said when she lifted her head from his shoulder to wipe her eyes but i cant seem to help it and she broke down again i presume its because ive been sick and im kind of weak yet i know you wouldnt have done that that day if you hadnt have cared for me and i wasnt mad a bit not half as mad as i ought to have been but when you stayed away so long and never seemed to come near any more i didnt know what to think but now i can understand just how you felt and i dont blame you one bit i should have done just so myself if id been a man i suppose and now its all come right i dont mind being sick or anything only when thanksgiving came we felt sure youd call and wed got the pies nicely warmed oh dear she gave way again and then pressed her cheek tight against his to revive herself manda said she knew it was just because you was kind of ashamed and i was too sick to eat any of the pies anyway and so it all turned out for the best and i dont want you to believe that im one to cry over spilt milk especially when its all gathered up again  her happy tongue ran on revealing divining everything and he sat down with her in his arms hardly speaking a word till her heart was quite poured out manda grier left them a long time together and before she came back he had told statira all about himself since their last meeting she was very angry at the way that girl had behaved at miss vanes but she was glad he had found such a good place now without being beholden to any one for it and she showed that she felt a due pride in his being an hotel clerk he described the hotel and told what he had to do there and about mrs harmon and the fashionableness of all the guests but he said he did not think any of the ladies went ahead of her in dress if they came up to her and statira pressed her lips gratefully against his cheek and then lifting her head held herself a little away to see him again and said youre splendidly dressed too i noticed it the first thing when you came in you look just as if you had always lived in boston  is that so asked lemuel and he felt his heart suffused with tender pride and joy he told her of the misfit parlours and the instalment plan and she said well it was just splendid and she asked him if he knew she wasnt in the store any more and no she added delightedly upon his confession of ignorance im going to work in the boxfactory after this where manda grier works its better pay and you have more control of your hours and you can set down while you work if youve a mind to i think its going to be splendid what should you say if manda grier and me took some rooms and went to housekeepin  i dont know said lemuel but in his soul he felt jealous of her keeping house with manda grier  well i dont know as we shall do it said statira as if feeling his tacit reluctance  manda grier came in just then and cast a glance of friendly satire at them well i declare she said for all recognition of the situation  lemuel made an offer to rise but statira would not let him i guess manda grier wont mind it much  i guess i can stand it if you can said manda grier and this seemed such a witty speech that they all laughed till as statira said she thought she should die they laughed the more when manda grier added dryly i presume you wont want your boneset now she set the vessel she had brought it up in on the stove and covered it with a saucer i do know as i should if i was in your place its kind o curious i should bring both remedies home with me at once at this they all laughed a third time till manda grier said sh sh do you want to raise the roof  she began to bustle about and to set out a little table and cover it with a napkin and as she worked she talked on i guess if you dont want any boneset tea a little of the other kind wont hurt any of us and i kinder want a cup myself she set it to steep on the stove and it went through lemuels mind that she might have steeped the boneset there too if she had thought of it but he did not say anything though it seemed a pretty good joke on manda grier she ran on in that way of hers so that you never could tell whether she really meant a thing or not i guess if i have to manage many more cases like yours stira dudley i shall want to lay in a whole chest of it what do you think mr barker  mr barker repeated statira  well im afraid to say lemuel any more for fear hell fly off the handle and never come again what do you think mr barker of havin to set at that window every sunday for the last three weeks and keep watch of both sidewalks till you get such a crick in your neck and your eyes so set in your head you couldnt move either of em  now manda grier said statira from lemuels shoulder  well i dont say i had to do it and i dont say who the young man was that i was put to look out for  manda  but i do say its pretty hard to wait on a sick person one side the room and keep watch for a young man the other side both at once  manda grier youre too bad pouted statira dont you believe a word she says mr barker  mr barker repeated manda grier  well i dont care said statira i know who i mean  i dont said manda grier and i didnt know who you meant this afternoon when you was standin watch t the window and says you there there he is and i had to run so quick with the dipper of water i had in my hand to water the plants that i poured it all over the front of my dress  do you believe her asked statira  and i didnt know who you meant proceeded manda grier busy with the cups and saucers when you kept hurryin me up to change it oh quick quick how long you are i know hell get away i know he will and i had to just sling on a shawl and rush out after this boneset  there now that shows shes makin it all up cried statira she put on a sack and i helped her on with it myself so there  well if it was a sack and after all the young man was gone when i got down int the street concluded manda grier solemnly  lemuel had thought she was talking about him but now a pang of jealousy went through him and showed at the eyes he fixed on her  i dont know what i shd a done she resumed demurely if i hadnt have found mr barker at the apothecarys and got him to come home th me but of course twant the same as if it was the young man  lemuels arm fell from statiras waist in his torment  why lemuel she said in tender reproach  why you coot cried manda grier in utter amazement at his singlemindedness and burst into a scream of laughter she took the teapot from the stove and set it on the table there young man if you are the young manyou better pull up to the table and have something to start your ideas stira let him come and lemuel blushing for shame at his stupidity did as he was bid  ive got the greatest mind in the world to set next to stira myself said manda grier for fear she should miss that young man and now they both laughed together at lemuel but the girls let him sit between them and statira let him keep one of her hands under the table as much as she could i never saw such a jealous piece why i shall begin to be afraid for myself what should you think of stiras going to housekeeping with me  i dont believe he likes the idea one bit statira answered for him  oh yes i do lemuel protested  d you tell him manda grier demanded of her she nodded with saucy defiance well you have got along and about the box factory statira nodded again with a look of joyous intelligence at lemuel well what haint you told i wonder manda grier added seriously to lemuel i think itll be about the best thing in the world for stira i see for the last six months shes been killin herself in that store she cant ever get a chance to set down a minute and shes on her feet from mornin till night and i think its more n half that thats made her sick i dont say what the other fourfifths was  now manda grier stop  well thats over with now and now we want to keep you out that store i been lookin out for this place for stira a good while she can go onto the small boxes if she wants to and she can set down all the time and shell have a whole hour for her dinner and she can work by the piece and do as much or as little as shes a mind to but if shes a mind to work she can make her five and six dollars a week easy mr stevenss real nice and kind and he looks out for the girls that aint exactly strongnot but what stiras as strong as anybody when shes welland he dont put em on the green paper work because its got arsenic in it and it makes your head ache and youre liable to blood poisonin one the girls fainted and had spasms and as soon as he found it out he took her right off and hes just like clockwork to pay i think itll do everything for stira to be along th me there where i can look after her  lemuel said he thought so too he did not really think at all he was so flattered at being advised with about statira as if she were in his keeping and it was for him to say what was best for her and when she seemed uncertain about his real opinion and said she was not going to do anything he did not approve of he could scarcely speak for rapture but he protested that he did approve of the scheme entirely  but you shouldnt want we girls to set up housekeeping in rooms she suggested and he said that he should and that he thought it would be more independent and homelike  were half doin it now said manda grier and i know some roomstwo of emwhere we could get along first rate and not cost us much more n half what it does here  after she cleared up the teathings she made another errand downstairs and lemuel and statira went back to their rockingchair it still amazed him that she seemed not even to make it a favour to him she seemed to think it was favour to her what was stranger yet was that he could not feel that there was anything wrong or foolish about it he thought of his mothers severity about young folks sickishness as she called it and he could not understand it he knew that he had never had such right and noble thoughts about girls before perhaps statira was better than other girls she must be she was just like a child and he must be very good himself to be anyways fit for her if she cared so much for him it must be a sign that he was not so bad as he had sometimes thought a great many things went through his mind the silent comment and suggestion of their talk and all the time while he was saying something or listening to her he was aware of the overwhelming wonder of her being so frank with him and not too proud or ashamed to have him know how anxious she had been ever since they first met for fear he did not care for her she had always appeared so stylish and reserved and now she was not proud at all he tried to tell her how it had been with him the last three weeks all that he could say was that he had been afraid to come she laughed and said the idea of his being afraid of her she said that she was glad of everything she had gone through at times she lifted herself from his shoulder and coughed but that was when she had been laughing or crying a little they told each other about their families statira said she had not really any folks of her own she was just brought up by her aunt and lemuel had to tell her that his mother wore bloomers statira said she guessed she should not care much for the bloomers and in everything she tried to make out that he was much better than she was and just exactly right she already spoke of his sister by her first name and she entered into his whole life as if she had always known him he said she must come with him to hear mr sewell preach sometime but she declared that she did not think much of a minister who could behave the way he had done to lemuel he defended sewell and maintained that if it had not been for him he might not have come to boston and so might never have seen her but she held out that she could not bear mr sewell and that she knew he was doublefaced and everything lemuel said well he did not know that he should ever have anything more to do with him but he liked to hear him preach and he guessed he tried to do what was about right statira made him promise that if ever he met mr sewell again he would not make up to him any way and she would not tolerate the thought of miss vane  what you two quarlin about demanded manda grier coming suddenly into the room and that turned their retrospective griefs into joy again  im scoldin him because he dont think enough of himself cried statira  well he seems to take it pretty meekly said manda grier i guess you didnt scold very hard now young man she added to lemuel i guess you better be goin its five oclock and if you should be out after dark and the bears should get you i dont know what stira would do  taint five yet pleaded statira that old watch of yours is always tryin to beat the town clock  well its the clock thats ahead this time said manda grier my watch says quarter of come now stira you let him go or he shant come back any more  they had a parting that lemuels mother would have called sickish without question but it all seemed heavenly sweet and right statira said now he had got to kiss manda grier too and when he insisted her chin knocked against his and saved her lips and she gave him a good box on the ear  there i guess that ll do for one while she said arranging her tumbled hair but theres more kisses where that came from for both of you if you want em coots  once when lemuel was little he had a fever and he was always seeming to glide down the schoolhouse stairs without touching the steps with his feet he remembered this dream now when he reached the street he felt as if he had floated down on the air and presently he was back in his little den at the hotel he did not know how he ran the elevator up and down for the ladies who called him from the different floors and he took note of the sunday difference in their toilet as they passed in to tea but in the same dreamy way  after the boarders had supped he went in as usual with mrs harmons nephew less cindery than on weekdays from the cellar and mrs harmon silken smooth for her evening worship at the shrine of a popular preacher from new york the sunday evening before she had heard an agnostic lecture in the boston theatre and she said she wished to compare notes her tranquillity was unruffled by the fact that the headwaitress had left just before tea she presumed they could get along just as well without her as with her the boarders had spoiled her anyway she looked round at lemuels face which beamed with his happiness and said she guessed she should have to get him to open the diningroom doors and seat the transients the next few days till she could get another head waitress it did not seem to be so much a request as a resolution but lemuel willingly assented mrs harmons nephew said that so long as they did not want him to do it he did not care who did it and if a few of them had his furnace to look after they would not be so anxious to kick     xvi   lemuel had to be up early in the morning to get the bills of fare which mrs harmon called the meanyous written in time for the seven oclock breakfasters and after opening the diningroom doors with fit ceremony he had to run backward and forward to answer the rings at the elevator and to pull out the chairs for the ladies at the table and slip them back under them as they sat down the ladies at the st albans expected to get their moneys worth but their exactions in most things were of use to lemuel he grew constantly nimbler of hand and foot under them and he grew quickerwitted he ceased to hulk in mind and body he did not employ this new mental agility in devising excuses and delays he left that to mrs harmon whose conscience was easy in it but from seven oclock in the morning till eleven at night when the ladies came in from the theatre he was so promptly so comfortingly at their service that they all said they did not see how they had ever got along without him  his activities took the form of interruptions rather than constant occupation and he found a good deal of brokenup time on his hands which he passed in reading and in reveries of statira at the hours when the elevator was mostly in use he kept a book in it with him and at other times he had it in the office as mrs harmon called his little booth he remained there reading every night after the house quieted down after dinner until it was time to lock up for the night and several times mr evans stopped and looked in at him where he sat in the bad combustion of the gas that was taking the country tan out of his cheeks one night when he came in late and lemuel put his book down to take him up in the elevator he said dont disturb yourself im going to walk up but he lingered at the door looking in with the queer smile that always roused the ladies fears of tacit ridicule i suppose you dont find it necessary he said finally to chase a horsecar now when you want to find your way to a given point  lemuel reddened and dropped his head he had already recognised in mr evans the gentleman from whose kindly curiosity he had turned that first day in the suspicion that he might be a beat no he said i guess i can go pretty near everywhere in boston now  well said mr evans it was an ingenious system how do you like boston  i like it firstrate but ive not seen many other places answered lemuel cautiously  well if you live here long enough you wont care to see any other places youll know theyre not worth seeing lemuel looked up as if he did not understand exactly and mr evans stepped in and lifted the book he had been reading it was one he had bought at second hand while he was with miss vane a tough little epitome of the philosophies in all times the crabbed english version of a dry german original mr evans turned its leaves over do you find it a very exciting story he asked  why it isnt a story said lemuel in simple surprise  no asked mr evans i thought it must be most of the young gentlemen who run the elevators i travel in read stories do you like this kind of reading  lemuel reflected and then he said he thought you ought to find out about such things if you got a chance  yes said the editor musingly i suppose one oughtnt to throw any sort of chance away but youre sure you dont prefer the novels youll excuse my asking you  oh perfectly excusable said lemuel he added that he liked a good novel too when he could get hold of it  you must come to my room some day and see if you cant get hold of one there or if you prefer metaphysics ive got shelves full that youre welcome to i suppose he added you hadnt been in boston a great while when i met you that day  no said lemuel dropping his head again i had just come  as if he saw that something painful lurked under the remembrance of the time for lemuel the editor desisted  the next morning he stopped on his way to breakfast with some books which he handed to lemuel dont feel at all obliged to read them he said because i lend them to you they wont be of the least use to you if you do so  i guess that anything you like will be worth reading said lemuel flattered by the trouble so chief a boarder as mr evans had taken with him  not if they supplied a want you didnt feel you seem to be fond of books and after a while youll be wanting to lend them yourself ill give you a little hint that im too old to profit by remember that you can lend a person more books in a day than he can read in a week  his laugh kept lemuel shy of him still in spite of a willingness that the editor showed for their better acquaintance he seemed to wish to know about lemuel particularly since he had recognised the pursuer of the horsecar in him and this made lemuel close up the more he would have liked to talk with him about the books evans had lent him but when the editor stopped at the office door where lemuel sat reading one of them and asked him what he thought of it the boy felt that somehow it was not exactly his opinion that mr evans was getting at and this sense of being inspected and arranged in anothers mind though he could not formulate the operation in his own somehow wounded and repelled him it was not that the editor ever said anything that was not kind and friendly he was always doing kind and friendly things and he appeared to take a real interest in lemuel at the end of the first week after lemuel had added the head waitership to his other duties evans stopped in going out of the diningroom and put a dollar in his hand  what is it for asked lemuel  for really i dont know it must be tributemoney said the editor in surprise but with a rising curiosity i never know what its for  lemuel turned red and handed it back i dont know as i want any money i havent earned  that night after dinner when evans was passing the office door on his way out of the hotel lemuel stopped him and said with embarrassment mr evans i dont want you should think i didnt appreciate your kindness this morning  ah im not sure it was kindness said evans with immediate interest why didnt you take the money  well i told you why said lemuel overcoming the obscure reluctance he felt at evanss manner as best he could ive been thinking it over and i guess i was right but i didnt know whether i had expressed it the best way  the way couldnt be improved but why did you think you hadnt earned my dollar  i dont do anything but open the doors and show people to their places i dont call that anything  but if you were a waiter and served at table  i wouldnt be one said lemuel with a touch of indignation and i shouldnt take presents anyway  evans leaned against the doorjamb  have you heard of the college students who wait at the mountain hotels in vacation they all take fees do you think yourself better than they are  yes i do cried lemuel  well i dont know but you are said the editor thoughtfully but i think i should distinguish perhaps theres no shame in waiting at table but there is in taking fees  yes thats what i meant said lemuel a little sorry for his heat i shouldnt be ashamed to do any kind of work and to take my pay for it but i shouldnt want to have folks giving me money over and above as if i was a beggar  the editor stood looking him absently in the face after a moment he asked what part of new england did you come from mr barker  i came from the middle part of the statefrom willoughby pastures  do those ideasthose principlesof yours prevail there  i dont know whether they do or not said lemuel  if you were sure they did i should like to engage board there for next summer said the editor going out  it was monday night a leisure time with him and he was going out to see a friend a minister with whom monday night was also leisure time  after he was gone some of the other boarders began to drop in from the lectures and concerts which they frequented in the evening the ladies had all some favour to ask of lemuel some real or fancied need of his help in return for his promise or performance they each gave him advice what they expressed collectively was that they should think that he would put his eyes out reading by that gas and that he had better look out or he would ruin his health anyway reading so much they asked him how much time he got for sleep and they said that from twelve till six was not enough and that he was just killing himself they had all offered to lend him books the least literary among them had a sort of house pride in his fondness for books their sympathy with this taste of his amused their husbands who tolerated it but in their hearts regarded it as a womanish weakness indicating a want of fibre in lemuel mrs harmon as a business woman and therefore occupying a middle ground between the sexes did not exactly know herself what to make of her clerks studiousness all that she could say was that he kept up with his work she assumed that before lemuels coming she had been the sole motive power of the house but it was really a sort of democracy and was managed by the majority of its inmates an element of demagoguery tampered with the irish vote in the person of jerry nominally porter but actually factotum who had hitherto pending the strikes of the different functionaries filled the offices now united in lemuel he had never been clerk because his literature went no further than the ability to write his name and to read a passage of the constitution in qualifying for the suffrage he did not like the new order of things but he was without a party and helpless to do more than neglect the gongbell when he had reason to think lemuel had sounded it  about eleven oclock the lawstudent came in with the two girl art students fresh from the outside air and gay from the opera they had been hearing the young man told lemuel he ought to go to see it after the girls had opened their door one of them came running back to the elevator and called down to lemuel that there was no icewater and would he please send some up  lemuel brought it up himself and when he knocked at the door the same girl opened it and made a pretty outcry over the trouble she had given him i supposed of course jerry would bring it she said contritely and as if for some atonement she added wont you come in mr barker and see my picture  lemuel stood in the gush of the gaslight hesitating and the law student called out to him jollily come in mr barker and help me play artcritic he was standing before the picture with his overcoat on and his hat in his hand first appearance on any stage he added and as lemuel entered if i were you he said id fire that porter out of the hotel hes outlived his usefulness  its a shame your having to bring the water said miss swan she was the girl who had spoken before  the other one came forward and said wont you sit down  she spoke to lemuel the lawstudent answered thank you i dont care if i do  lemuel did not know whether to stay nor what to say of miss swans picture and he thanked the young lady and remained standing  o jessie jessie jessie cried miss swan  the other went to her tranquilly as if used to such vehement appeals  just see how my poor cow looks since i painted out that grass she hasnt got a leg to stand on  the lawstudent did nothing but make jokes about the picture i think she looks pretty well for a cow that you must have had to study from a milkcannearest you could come to a cow in boston  miss carver the other young lady ignored his joking and after some criticisms on the picture left him and miss swan to talk it over she talked to lemuel and asked him if he had read a book he glanced at on the table and seemed willing to make him feel at ease but she did not he thought she was very proud and he believed she wanted him to go but he did not know how to go her eyes were so still and pure but they dwelt very coldly upon him her voice was like that look put into sound it was rather high pitched but very sweet and pure and cold he hardly knew what he said he felt hot and he waited for some chance to get away  at last he heard miss swan saying must you go mr berry so soon and saw her giving the student her hand with a bow of burlesque desolation  lemuel prepared to go too all his rusticity came back upon him and he said well i wish you good evening  it seemed to him that miss carvers still eyes looked a sort of starry scorn after him he found that he had brought away the book they had been talking about and he was a long time in question whether he had better take it back at once or give it to her when she came to breakfast  he went to bed in the same trouble of mind every night he had fallen asleep with statira in his thoughts but now it was miss carver that he thought of and more and more uncomfortably he asked himself what she would say if she saw his mother in the bloomers she was herself not dressed so fashionably as statira but very nicely     xvii   at sewells house the maid told evans to walk up into the study without seating him first in the receptionroom as if that were needless with so intimate a friend of the family he found sewell at his desk and he began at once without the forms of greeting  if you dont like that other subject ive got a new one for you and you could write a sermon on it that would make talk  you look at it from the newspaper point of view returned sewell in the same humour im not an enterprise and i dont want to make talk in your sense i dont know that i want to make talk at all i should prefer to make thought to make feeling  well said the editor this would do all three  would you come to hear me if i wrote the sermon  ah thats asking a good deal  why dont you develop your idea in an article youre always bragging that you preach to a larger congregation than i  i propose to let you preach to my congregation too if youll write this sermon ive talked to you before about reporting your sermons in saturday afternoon they would be a feature and if we could open with this one and have a good incisive editorial on it disputing some of your positions and treating certain others with a little satire at the same time maintaining a very respectful attitude towards you on the whole and calling attention to the fact that there was a strong and increasing interest in your utterances which we were the first to recogniseit would be a card we might agree beforehand on the points the editorial was to touch and so make one hand wash another see  i see that journalism has eaten into your soul what is your subject  well in general terms and in a single word complicity dont you think that would be rather taking mr sewell in his striking sermon on complicity and so forth it would be a great hit and it would stand a chance of sticking like emersons compensation  delightful the most amusing part is that youve really a grain of business in your bushel of chaff sewell wheeled about in his swivelchair and sat facing his guest deeply sunken in the low easy seat he always took when did this famous idea occur to you he pursued swinging his glasses by their cord  about three weeks ago at the theatre there was one of those pieces on that make you despair of the stage and ashamed of writing a play even to be rejected by ita farrago of indecently amusing innuendoes and laughably vile situations such as if they were put into a book would prevent its being sent through the mail the theatre apparently can still be as filthy in suggestion as it was at the restoration and not shock its audiences there were all sorts of people there that night young girls who had come with young men for an evenings polite amusement families middleaged husbands and wives respectablelooking single women and average bachelors i dont think the ordinary theatrical audience is of a high grade intellectually its third or fourth rate but morally it seems quite as good as other public assemblages all the people were nicely dressed and they sat there before that nasty messit was an english comedy where all the jokes turn upon the belief of the characters that their wives and husbands are the parents of illegitimate offspringand listened with as smooth self satisfaction as if they were not responsible for it but all at once it occurred to me that they were responsible every one of themas responsible as the players as the author himself  did you come out of the theatre at that point asked sewell  oh i was responsible too but i seemed to be the only one ashamed of my share in the business  if you were the only one conscious of it your merit wasnt very great suggested the minister  well i should like the others to be conscious of it too thats why i want you to preach my sermon i want you to tell your people and my people that the one who buys sin or shame or corruption of any sort is as guilty as the one who sells it  it isnt a new theory said sewell still refusing to give up his ironical tone it was discovered some time ago that this was so before god  well ive just discovered that it ought to be so before man said evans  still youre not the first said sewell  yes said the editor i think i am from my peculiar standpoint the other day a friend of minean upright just worthy man no one more sowas telling me of a shocking instance of our national corruption he had just got home from europe and he had brought a lot of dutiable things that a customs inspector passed for a trifling sum that was all very well but the inspector afterwards came round with a confidential claim for a hundred dollars and the figures to show that the legal duties would have been eight or ten times as much my friend was glad to pay the hundred dollars but he defied me to name any country in europe where such a piece of official rascality was possible he said it made him ashamed of america evans leaned his head back against his chair and laughed  yes said sewell with a sigh and no longer feigning lightness thats awful  well now said evans dont you think it your duty to help people realise that they cant regard such transactions de haut en bas if they happen to have taken part in them i have heard of the shameful condition of things down in maine where im told the french canadians whove come in regularly expect to sell their votes to the highest bidder at every election since my new system of ethics occurred to me ive fancied that there must have always been a shameful state of things there if americans could grow up in the willingness to buy votes i want to have people recognise that there is no superiority for them in such an affair that theres nothing but inferiority that the man who has the money and the wit to corrupt is a far baser rascal than the man who has the ignorance and the poverty to be corrupted i would make this principle seek out every weak spot every sore spot in the whole social constitution im sick to death of the frauds that we practise upon ourselves in order to be able to injure others just consider the infernal ease of mind in which men remain concerning mens share in the social evil  ah my dear friend you cant expect me to consider that in my pulpit cried the minister  no i couldnt consider it in my paper i suppose we must leave that where it is unless we can affect it by analogy and show that there is infamy for both parties to any sin committed in common you must select your instances in other directions but you can find plenty of themenough and to spare it would give the series a tremendous sendoff said evans relapsing into his habitual tone if you would tackle this subject in your first sermon for publication there would be money in it the thing would make a success in the paper and you could get somebody to reprint it in pamphlet form come what do you say  i should say that you had just been doing something you were ashamed of answered sewell people dont have these tremendous moral awakenings for nothing  and you dont think my present state of mind is a gradual outgrowth of my first consciousness of the common responsibility of actors and audience in the representation of a shameless comedy  no i shouldnt think it was said the minister securely  well youre right evans twisted himself about in his chair and hung his legs over one of the arms  the real reason why i wish you to preach this sermon is because i have just been offering a fee to the headwaiter at our hotel  and you feel degraded with him by his acceptance for it is a degradation  no thats the strangest thing about it i have a monopoly of the degradation for he didnt take my dollar  ah then a sermon wont help you why wouldnt he take it  he said he didnt know as he wanted any money he hadnt earned said evans with a touch of mimicry  the minister started up from his lounging attitude is his name barker he asked with unerring prescience  yes said evans with a little surprise do you know him  yes returned the minister falling back in his chair helplessly not luxuriously so well that i knew it was he almost as soon as you came into the room tonight  what harm have you been doing him demanded the editor in parody of the ministers acuteness in guessing the guilty operation of his own mind  the greatest im the cause of his being in boston  this is very interesting said evans we are companions in crimepals its a great honour but what strikes me as being so interesting is that we appear to feel remorse for our misdeeds and i was almost persuaded the other day by an observer of our species that remorse had gone out or rather had never existed except in the fancy of innocent people that real criminals like ourselves were afraid of being found out but werent in the least sorry perhaps if we are sorry it proves that we neednt be lets judge each other ive told you what my sin against barker is and i know yours in general terms its a fearful thing to be the cause of a human souls presence in boston but what did you do to bring it about who is barker where did he come from what was his previous condition of servitude he puzzles me a good deal  oh ill tell you said sewell and he gave his personal chapter in lemuels history  evans interrupted him at one point and what became of the poem he brought down with him  it was stolen out of his pocket one night when he slept in the common  ah then he cant offer it to me and he seems very far from writing any more i can still keep his acquaintance go on  sewell told in amusing detail of the wayfarers lodge where he had found barker after supposing he had gone home evans seemed more interested in the place than in the ministers meeting with lemuel there which sewell fancied he had painted rather well describing lemuels severity and his own anxiety  there said the editor there you have ita practical illustration our civilisation has had to come to it  come to what  complicity  sewell made an impatient gesture  dont sacrifice the consideration of a great principle cried evans to the petty effect of a good story on an appreciative listener i realise your predicament but dont you see that in establishing and regulating a place like that the city of boston has instinctively sanctioned my idea you may say that it is aiding and abetting the trampnuisance by giving vagrants food and shelter but other philosophers will contend that it isblindly perhaps fulfilling the destiny of the future state which will at once employ and support all its citizens that it is prophetically recognising my new principle of complicity  your new principle cried sewell you have merely given a new name to one of the oldest principles in the moral world  and that is a good deal to do i can tell you said evans all the principles are pretty old now but dont give way to an ignoble resentment of my interruption go on about barker  after some feints that there was nothing more important to tell sewell went on to the end and when he had come to it evans shook his head it looks pretty black for you but its a beautifully perfect case of complicity what do you propose to do now youve rediscovered him  oh i dont know i hope no more mischief if i could only get him back on his farm  yes i suppose that would be the best thing but i dare say he wouldnt go back  thats been my experience with him  they talked this aspect of the case over more fully and evans said well i wouldnt go back to such a place myself after id once had a glimpse of boston but i suppose its right to wish that barker would i hope his mother will come to visit him while hes in the hotel i would give a good deal to see her fancy her coming down in her bloomers and the poor fellow being ashamed of her it would be a very good subject for a play does she wear a hat or a bonnet what sort of headgear goes with that sleek odalisque style of dress a turban i suppose  mrs barker said the minister unable to deny himself the fleeting comfort of the editors humorous view of the situation is as far from a sleek odalisque as any lady ive ever seen in spite of her oriental costume if i remember her yashmak was not gathered at the ankles but hung loose like occidental trousers and the day we met she wore simply her own hair there was not much of it on top and she had it cut short in the neck she was rather a terrible figure her having ever been married would have been inconceivable except for her son  i should like to have seen her said evans laughing back in his chair  she was worth seeing as a survival of the superficial fermentation of the period of our social history when it was believed that women could be like men if they chose and ought to be if they ever meant to show their natural superiority but she was not picturesque  the sons very handsome i can see that the lady boarders think him so  do you find him at all remarkable otherwise what dismayed me more than his poetry even was that when he gave that up he seemed to have no particular direction  oh he reads a good deal and pretty serious books and he goes to hear all the sermons and lectures in town  i thought he came to mine only sighed the minister with a retrospective suffering well what can be done for him now i feel my complicity with barker as poignantly as you could wish  ah you see how the principle applies everywhere cried the editor joyously he added but i really think that for the present you cant do better than let barker alone hes getting on very well at mrs harmons and although the conditions at the st albans are more transitory than most sublunary things barker appears to be a fixture our little system has begun to revolve round him unconsciously he keeps us going  well said sewell consenting to be a little comforted he was about to go more particularly into the facts but mrs sewell came in just then and he obviously left the subject  evans did not sit down again after rising to greet her and presently he said good night  she turned to her husband what were you talking about when i came in  when you came in  yes you both had that looki can always tell itof having suddenly stopped  oh said sewell pretending to arrange the things on his desk evans had been suggesting the subject for a sermon he paused a moment and then he continued hardily and hed been telling me aboutbarker hes turned up again  of course said mrs sewell whats happened to him now  nothing apparently but some repeated strokes of prosperity he has become clerk elevatorboy and headwaiter at the st albans  and what are you going to do about him  evans advises me to do nothing  well thats sensible at any rate said mrs sewell i really think youve done quite enough david and now he can be left to manage for himself especially as he seems to be doing well  oh hes doing as well as i could hope and better but im not sure that i shouldnt have personally preferred a continued course of calamity for him i shall never be quite at peace about him till i get him back on his farm at willoughby pastures  well that you will never do and you may as well rest easy about it  i dont know as to never doing it said sewell all prosperity especially the prosperity connected with mrs harmons hotel is transitory and i may succeed yet  does everything go on there in the old way does mr evans say mrs sewell did not refer to any former knowledge of the st albans but to a remote acquaintance with the character and methods of mrs harmon with whom the sewells had once boarded she was then freshly widowed by the loss of her first husband and had launched her earliest boardinghouse on that sea of disaster where she had buoyantly outridden every storm and had floated triumphantly on the top of every ingulfing wave they recalled the difficult navigation of that primitive craft in which each of the boarders had taken a hand at the helm and their reminiscences of her financial embarrassments were mixed with those of the unfailing serenity that seemed not to know defeat and with fond memories of her goodness of heart and her ideal devotion in any case of sickness or trouble  i should think the prosperity of mrs harmon would convince the most negative of agnostics that there was an overruling providence if nothing else did said sewell its so defiant of all law so delightfully independent of causation  well let barker alone with her then said his wife rising to leave him to the hours of late reading which she had never been able to break up     xviii   after agreeing with his wife that he had better leave barker alone sewell did not feel easy in doing so he had that tendollar note which miss vane had given him and though he did not believe since evans had reported barkers refusal of his fee that the boy would take it he was still constrained to do something with it before giving it back to her he decided at least to see barker and learn about his prospects and expectations he might find some way of making himself useful to him  in a state of independence he found lemuel much more accessible than formerly and their interview was more nearly amicable sewell said that he had been delighted to hear of lemuels whereabouts from his old friend evans and to know that they were housed together he said that he used to know mrs harmon long ago and that she was a goodhearted wellmeaning woman though without much forecast he even assented to lemuels hasty generalisation of her as a perfect lady though they both felt a certain inaccuracy in this and sewell repeated that she was a woman of excellent heart and turned to a more intimate inquest of lemuels life  he tried to find out how he employed his leisure time saying that he always sympathised with young men away from home and suggesting the readingroom and the frequent lectures at the young mens christian union for his odd moments he learned that lemuel had not many of these during the week and that on sundays he spent all the time he could get in hearing the different noted ministers for the rest he learned that lemuel was very much interested in the city and appeared to be rapidly absorbing both its present civilisation and its past history he was unsmilingly amused at the comments of mixed shrewdness and crudity which lemuel was betrayed into at times beyond certain limits of diffidence that he had apparently set himself at his blunders and misconceptions at the truth divined by the very innocence of his youth and inexperience he found out that lemuel had not been at home since he came to boston he had expected to go at thanksgiving but it came so soon after he had got his place that he hated to ask the folks were all well and he would send the kind remembrances which the minister asked him to give his mother sewell tried to find out in saying that mrs sewell and himself would always be glad to see him whether lemuel had any social life outside of the st albans but here he was sensible that a door was shut against him and finally he had not the courage to do more about that money from miss vane than to say that from time to time he had sums intrusted him and that if lemuel had any pressing need of money he must borrow of him he fancied he had managed that rather delicately for lemuel thanked him without severity and said he should get along now he guessed but he was much obliged neither of them mentioned miss vane and upon the whole the minister was not sure that he had got much nearer the boy after all  certainly he formed no adequate idea of the avidity and thoroughness with which lemuel was learning his boston it was wholly a public boston which unfolded itself during the winter to his eager curiosity and he knew nothing of the social intricacies of which it seems solely to consist for so many of us to him boston society was represented by the coteries of homeless sojourners in the st albans boston life was transacted by the ministers the lecturers the public meetings the concerts the horsecars the policemen the shopwindows the newspapers the theatres the ships at the docks the historical landmarks the charity apparatus  the effect was a ferment in his mind in which there was nothing clear it seemed to him that he had to change his opinions every day he was whirled round and round he never saw the same object twice the same he did not know whether he learned or unlearned most with the pride that comes to youth from the mere novelty of its experiences was mixed a shame for his former ignorance an exasperation at his inability to grasp their whole meaning  his activities in acquainting himself with boston interested evans who tried to learn just what his impression was but this was the last thing that lemuel could have distinctly imparted  well upon the whole he asked one day what do you think from what youve seen of it which is the better place boston or willoughby pastures if you were friendless and homeless would you rather be cast away in the city or in the country  lemuel did not hesitate about this in the city they havent got any idea in the country whats done to help folks along in the city  is that so asked evans its against tradition he suggested  yes i know that lemuel assented and in the country they think the city is a place where nobody cares for you and everybody is against you and wants to impose upon you well when i first came to boston he continued with a consciousness of things that evans did not betray his own knowledge of i thought so too and i had a pretty hard time for a while it dont seem as if people did care for you except to make something out of you but if any one happens to find out that youre in trouble theres ten times as much done for you in the city as there is in the country  perhaps thats because there are ten times as many to do it said evans in the hope of provoking this impartial spirit further  no it isnt that altogether its because theyve seen ten times as much trouble and know how to take hold of it better i think our folks in the country have been flattered up too much if some of them could come down here and see how things are carried on they would be surprised they wouldnt believe it if you told them  i didnt know we were so exemplary said evans  oh city folks have their faults too said lemuel smiling in recognition of the irony  no what  lemuel seemed uncertain whether to say it well theyre too aristocratic  evans enjoyed this frank simplicity he professed not to understand and begged lemuel to explain  well at home in the country they mightnt want to do so much for you or be so polite about it but they wouldnt feel themselves so much above you theyre more on an equality if i needed help id rather be in town but if i could help myself id just as soon be in the country only he added there are more chances here  yes there are more chances and do you think its better not to be quite so kind and to be more on an equality  why dont you demanded lemuel  well i dont know said evans with a whimsical affection of seriousness shouldnt you like an aristocracy if you could be one of the aristocrats dont you think youre opposed to aristocracy because you dont want to be under i have spoken to be a duke when we get an order of nobility and i find that its a great relief i dont feel obliged to go in for equality nearly as much as i used  lemuel shyly dropped the subject not feeling himself able to cope with his elder in these railleries he always felt his heaviness and clumsiness in talking with the editor who fascinated him he did not know but he had said too much about city people being aristocratic it was not quite what he meant he had really been thinking of miss carver and how proud she was when he said it  lately he had seemed to see a difference between himself and other people and he had begun to look for it everywhere though when he spoke to evans he was not aware how strongly the poison was working in him it was as if the girl had made that difference she made it again whatever it was between herself and the black man who once brought her a note and a bunch of flowers from one of her young lady pupils she was very polite to him trying to put him at ease just as she had been with lemuel that night if he came into the dining room to seat a transient when miss carver was there he knew that she was mentally making a difference between him and the boarders the ladies all had the custom of bidding him good morning when they came in to breakfast and they all smiled upon him except miss carver she seemed every morning as if more surprised to see him standing there at the door and showing people to their places she looked puzzled and sometimes she blushed as if she were ashamed for him  he had discovered in fine that there were sorts of honest work in the world which one must not do if he would keep his selfrespect through the consideration of others once all work had been work but now he had found that there was work which was service and that service was dishonour he had learned that the people who did this work were as a class apart and were spoken of as servants with slight that was unconscious or conscious but never absent  some of the ladies at the st albans had tried to argue with lemuel about his not taking the fees he refused and he knew that they talked him over one day when he was showing a room to a transient he heard one of them say to another in the next apartment well i did hate to offer it to him just as if he was a common servant and the other said well i dont see what he can expect if he puts himself in the place of a servant and then they debated together whether his quality of clerk was sufficient to redeem him from the reproach of servitude they did not call his running the elevator anything because a clerk might do that in a casual way without loss of dignity they alleged other cases of the kind  his inner life became a turmoil of suspicions that attached themselves to every word spoken to him by those who must think themselves above him he could see now how far behind in everything willoughby pastures was and how the summer folks could not help despising the people that took them to board and waited on them like servants in cities he esteemed the boarders at the st albans in the degree that he thought them enlightened enough to contemn him for his station and he had his own ideas of how such a person as mr evans really felt toward him he felt toward him and was interested in his reading as a person might feel toward and be interested in the attainments of some anomalous animal a learned pig or something of that kind  he could look back now on his life at miss vanes and see that he was treated as a servant therea petted servant but still a servantand that was what made that girl behave so to him he always thought of sibyl as that girl  he would have thrown up his place at once though he knew of nothing else he could do he would have risked starving rather than keep it but he felt that it was of no use that the stain of servitude was indelible that if he were lifted to the highest station it would not redeem him in miss carvers eyes all this time he had scarcely more than spoken with her to return her good mornings at the diningroom door or to exchange greetings with her on the stairs or to receive some charge from her in going out or to answer some question of hers in coming in as to whether any of the pupils who had lessons of her had been there in her absence he made these interviews as brief as possible he was as stiff and cold as she  the lawstudent whose full name was alonzo w berry had one joking manner for all manner of men and women and lemuels suspicion could not find any offensive distinction in it toward himself but he disabled berrys own gentility for that reason and easily learning much of the lawstudents wild past in the west from so eager an autobiographer he could not comfort himself with his friendship while the student poured out his autobiography without stint upon lemuel his shyness only deepened upon the boy there were things in his life for which he was in equal fear of discovery his arrest and trial in the police court his mothers queerness and his servile condition at miss vanes the thought that mr sewell knew about them all made him sometimes hate the minister till he reflected that he had evidently told no one of them but he was always trembling lest they should somehow become known at the st albans and when berry was going on about himself his exploits his escapes his loveschiefly his loveslemuels soul was sealed within him a vision of his disgraces filled him with horror  but in the delight of talking about himself berry was apparently unaware that lemuel had not reciprocated his confidences he celebrated his familiarity with miss swan and her friend though no doubt he had the greater share of the acquaintancethat was apt to be the case with himand from time to time he urged lemuel to come up and call on them with him  i guess they dont want me to call said lemuel with feeble bitterness at last one evening after an elaborate argument from berry to prove that lemuel had the time and that he just knew they would be glad to see him  why demanded berry and he tried to get lemuels reason but when lemuel had stated that belief he could not have given the reason for it on his deathbed berry gave the conundrum up for the time but he did not give lemuel up he had an increasing need of him as he advanced in a passion for miss swan which as he frankly prophesied was bound to bring him to the poppingpoint sooner or later he debated with himself in lemuels presence all the best forms of popping and he said that it was simply worth a ranch to be able to sing to him    shes a darling    shes a daisy    shes a dumpling    shes a lamb  and to feel that he knew who she was he usually sang this refrain to lemuel when he came in late at night after a little supper with some of the fellows that had left traces of its cheer on his bated breath once he came downstairs alone in the elevator in his shirtsleeves and stockingfeet for the purpose of singing it after lemuel had thought him in bed  every sunday afternoon during the winter lemuel went to see statira and sometimes in the evening he took her to church but she could not understand why he always wanted to go to a different church she did not see why he should not pick out one church and stick to it the ministers seemed to be all alike and she guessed one was pretty near as good as another manda grier said she guessed they were all lemuel to her and statira said well she guessed that was pretty much so she no longer pretended that he was not the whole world to her either with him or with manda grier she was so happy from morning till night day in and day out that manda grier said if she were in her place she should be afraid something would happen  statira worked in the boxfactory now she liked it a great deal better than the store and declared that she was ever so much stronger the cough lingered still but none of them noticed it much she called it a cold and said she kept catching more manda grier told her that she could throw it off soon enough if she would buy a few clothes for warmth and not so many for looks but they did not talk this over before lemuel before he came statira took a soothing mixture that she got of the apothecary and then they were all as bright and gay as could be and she looked so pretty that he said he could not get used to it the housekeeping experiment was a great success she and manda grier had two rooms now and they lived better than ever they had for less money of course statira said it was not up to the st albans which lemuel had told them of at first a little braggingly in fact she liked to have him brag of it and of the splendours of his position and surroundings she was very curious but not envious of anything and it became a joke with her and manda grier who pretended to despise the whole affair  at first it flattered lemuel to have her admire his rise in life so simply and ardently but after a while it became embarrassing in proportion as it no longer seemed so superb to him she was always wanting him to talk of it after a few sundays with the long hours they had passed in telling each other all they could think of about themselves they had not much else to talk of now that she had him to employ her fancy statira no longer fed it on the novels she used to devour he brought her books but she did not read them she said that she had been so busy with her sewing she had no time to read and every week she showed him some pretty new thing she had been making and tried it on for him to see how she looked in it often she seemed to care more to rest with her head on his shoulder and not talk at all and for a while this was enough for him too though sometimes he was disappointed that she did not even let him read to her out of the books she neglected she would not talk over the sermons they heard together but once when mr evans offered him tickets for the theatre and lemuel had got the night off and taken statira it seemed as if she would be willing to sit up till morning and talk the play over  nothing else ever interested her so much except what one of the girls in the boxfactory had told her about going down to the beach summers and waiting on table this girl had been at old orchard where they had splendid times with one veranda all to themselves and the gentlemenhelp and in the afternoon the girls got together on the beachor the grass right in front of the hoteland sewed they got nearly as much as they did in the boxfactory and then the boarders all gave you something extra some of them gave as much as a dollar a week apiece the headwaiter was a college student and a perfect gentleman he was always dressed up in a dresssuit and a white silk necktie statira said that next summer she wanted they should go off somewhere she and manda grier and wait on table together and she knew lemuel could easily get the headwaiters place after the st albans she should not want he should be clerk because then they could not have such good times for they would be more separated  lemuel heard her restively through and then broke out fiercely and told her that he had seen enough of waiting on table at the st albans for him never to want her to do it and that the boarders who gave money to the waiters despised them for taking it he said that he did not consider just helping mrs harmon out the same as being headwaiter and that he would not be a regular waiter for any money he would rather starve  statira did not understand she asked him meekly if he were mad at her he seemed so and he had to do what he could to cheer her up  manda grier took statiras part pretty sharply she said it was one thing to live out in a private familythat was a disgrace if you could keep the breath of life in you any other wayand it was quite another to wait in an hotel and she did not want to have any one hint round that she would let statira demean herself lemuel was offended by her manner and her assumption of owning statira she defended him but he could not tell her how he had changed the influences were perhaps too obscure for him to have traced them all himself after the first time he had hardly mentioned the art student girls to her there were a great many things that statira could not understand she had been much longer in the city than lemuel but she did not seem to appreciate the difference between that and the country she dressed very stylishly no one went beyond her in that but in many things he could see that she remained countrified once on a very mild april evening when they were passing through the public garden she wished him to sit on a vacant seat they came to all the others were occupied by young couples who sat with their arms around each other  no no shuddered lemuel i dont want people should take you for one of these servantgirls  why lem how proud youre getting she cried with easy acquiescence youre awfully stuck up well then youve got to take a horsecar i cant walk any further     xix   lemuel had found out about the artstudents from berry he said they were no relation to each other and had not even been acquainted before they met at the artschool he had first met them at the st albans miss swan was from the western part of the state and miss carver from down plymouth way the latter took pupils and sometimes gave lessons at their houses she was to berrys thinking not half the genius and not half the duck that miss swan was though she was a duck in her way too miss swan as nearly as he could explain was studying art for the fun of it or the excitement for she was well enough off her father was a lawyer out there and berry believed that a rising soninlaw in his own profession would be just the thing for the old mans declining years he said he should not be very particular about settling down to practice at once if his wife wanted to go to europe a while and kind of tender foot it round for a year or two in the artcentres over there he would let the old man run the business a little longer sometimes it did an old man good there was no hurry berrys own father was not excited about his going to work right away he had the money to run berry and a wife too if it came to that miss swan understood that he had not told her so in just so many words but he had let her know that alonzo w berry senior was not borrowing money at two per cent a month any more he said he did not care to make much of a blow about that part of it till he was ready to act and he was not going to act till he had a deadsure thing of it he was having a very good time as it went along and he guessed miss swan was too no use to hurry a girl when she was on the right track  berry invented these axioms apparently to put himself in heart in the abstract he was already courageous enough he said that these eastern girls were not used to having any sort of attention that there was only about a tenth or fifteenth of a fellow to every girl and that it tickled one of them to death to have a whole man around he was not meanly exultant at their destitution he said he just wished one of these pretty boston girlsnice well dressed cultured and brought up to be snubbed and neglected by the tenths and fifteenths of men they had at homecould be let loose in the west and have a regular roundup of fellows or no he would like to have about five thousand fellows from out there that never expected a woman to look at them unloaded in boston and see them open their eyes wouldnt one of em get home alive if kindness could kill em i never saw such a place i cant get used to it it makes me tired any sort of fellow could get married in boston  berry made no attempt to reconcile his uncertainty as to his own chances with this general theory but he urged it to prove that miss swan and miss carver would like to have lemuel call he said they had both said they wished they could paint him he had himself sustained various characters in costume for them and one night he pretended that they had sent him down for lemuel to help out with a certain group but they received him with a sort of blankness which convinced him that berry had exceeded his authority there was a helplessness at first and then an indignant determination to save him from a false position even at their own cost which lemuel felt rather than saw miss carver was foremost in his rescue she devoted herself to this and left miss swan to punish berry who conveyed from time to time his sense that he was getting it by a wink to lemuel  an observer with more social light might have been more puzzled to account for berrys toleration by these girls who apparently associated with him on equal terms since he was not a servant he was their equal in lemuels eyes perhaps his acceptance might otherwise be explained by the fact that he was very amusing chivalrously harmless and extremely kindhearted and useful to them one must not leave out of the reckoning his open devotion for miss swan which in itself would do much to approve him to her and commend him to miss carver if she were a generous girl and very fond of her friend it is certain that they did tolerate berry who made them laugh even that night in spite of themselves till miss swan said well whats the use and stopped trying to discipline him after that they had a very sociable evening though lemuel kept his distance and would not let them include him knowing what the two girls really thought of him he would not take part in berrys buffooneries but talked soberly and rather austerely with miss carver and to show that he did not feel himself an inferior whatever she might think he was very sarcastic about some of the city ways and customs they spoke of there were a good many books aboutnovels mostly but not the kind statira used to read and poems miss carver said she liked to take them up when she was nervous from her work and if the weather was bad and she could not get out for a walk a book seemed to do her almost as much good nearly all the pictures about in the room seemed to be miss swans in fact when lemuel asked about them and tried to praise them in such a way as not to show his ignorance miss carver said she did very little in colour her lessons were all in black and white he would not let her see that he did not know what this was but he was ashamed and he determined to find out he determined to get a drawingbook and learn something about it himself to his thinking the room was pretty harumscarum there were shawls hung upon the walls and rugs and pieces of cloth which sometimes had half finished paintings fastened to them there were paintings standing round the room on the floor sometimes right side out and sometimes faced to the walls there were two or three fleeces and foxpelts scattered about instead of a carpet and there were two easels and stands with paints all twisted up in lead tubes on them he compared the room with statiras and did not think much of it at first  afterwards it did not seem so bad he began to feel its picturesqueness for he went there again and let the girls sketch him when miss swan asked him that night if he would let them he wished to refuse but she seemed so modest about it and made it such a great favour on his part that he consented she said she merely wished to make a little sketch in colour and miss carver a little study of his head in black and white and he imagined it a trifling affair that could be despatched in a single night they decided to treat his head as a young roman head and at the end of a long sitting beguiled with talk and with thoughtful voluntaries from berry on his banjo he found that miss carver had rubbed her study nearly all out with a piece of bread and miss swan said she should want to try a perfectly new sketch with the shoulders draped the coat had confused her she would not let any one see what she had done though berry tried to make her let him  lemuel looked a little blank when she asked him for another sitting but berry said oh youll have to come barker penalty of greatness you know have you in williams  everetts window notices in all the papers the exquisite studies by miss swan and miss carver of the head of the gentlemanly and accommodating clerk of the st albans as a roman youth chromoed as a christmas card by prang and photograph copies everywhere youre all right barker  one night miss swan said in rapture with some momentary success oh im perfectly in love with this head  berry looked up from his banjo which he ceased to strum hello hello hello  then the two broke into a laugh in which lemuel helplessly joined  whatwhat is it asked miss carver looking up absently from her work  nothing just a little outburst of passion from our young friend here said berry nodding his head toward miss swan  what does it mean mad asked miss carver in the same dreamy way continuing her work  yes madeline said berry explain yourself  mr berry cried miss swan warningly  thats me alonzo w jr go on  you forget yourself said the girl with imperfect severity  well you forgot me first said berry with affected injury aint it hard enough to sit here night after night strumming on the old banjo while another fellow is going down to posterity as a roman youth with a red shawl round his neck without having to hear people say theyre in love with that head of his  miss carver now stopped her work and looked from her friend with her head bowed in laughter on the back of her hand to that of berry bent in burlesque reproach upon her and then at lemuel who was trying to control himself  but i can tell you what miss swan you spoke too late as the man said when he swallowed the chicken in the fresh egg mr barker has a previous engagement that so barker  lemuel turned firered and looked round at miss carver who met his glance with her clear gaze she turned presently to make some comment on miss swans sketch and then after working a little while longer she said she was tired and was going to make some tea  the girls both pressed lemuel to stay for a cup but he would not and berry followed him downstairs to explain and apologise  its all right said lemuel what difference would it make to them whether i was engaged or not  well i suppose as a general rule a girl would rather a fellow wasnt philosophised berry he whistled ruefully and lemuel drawing a book toward him in continued silence he rose from the seat he had taken on the desk in the little office and said well i guess itll all come out right come to think of it i dont know anything about your affairs and i can tell em so  oh it dont matter  he had pulled the book toward him as if he were going to read but he could not read his head was in a whirl after a first frenzy of resentment against berry he was now angry at himself for having been so embarrassed he thought of a retort that would have passed it all off lightly then he reflected again that it was of no consequence to these young ladies whether he was engaged or not and at any rate it was nobodys business but his own of course he was engaged to statira but he had hardly thought of it in that way manda grier had joked about the time when she supposed she should have to keep old maids hall alone when she first did this lemuel thought it delightful but afterwards he did not like it so much it began to annoy him that manda grier should mix herself up so much with statira and himself he believed that statira would be different would be more like other ladies he generalised it in this way but he meant miss swan and miss carver if she had not manda grier there all the time to keep her back he convinced himself that if it were not for manda grier he should have had no trouble in telling statira that the artstudents were sketching him and that he had not done so yet because he hated to have manda ask her so much about them and call them that swan girl and that carver girl as she would be sure to do and clip away the whole evening with her questions and her guesses it was now nearly a fortnight since the sketching began and he had let one sunday night pass without mentioning it he could not let another pass and he knew manda grier would say they were a good while about it and would show her ignorance and put statira up to asking all sorts of things he could not bear to think of it and he let the next sunday night pass without saying anything to statira the sittings continued but before the third sunday came miss swan said she did not see how she could do anything more to her sketch and miss carver had already completed her study they criticised each others work with freedom and good humour and agreed that the next thing was to paint it out and rub it out  no said berry what you want is a fresh eye on it ive worried over it as much as you havesuffered more i believeand barker cant tell whether he looks like a roman youth or not why dont you have up old evans  miss swan took no apparent notice of this suggestion and miss carver who left berrys snubbing entirely to her said nothing after a minutes study of the pictures miss swan suggested if mr barker had any friends he would like to show them to  oh no thank you returned lemuel hastily there isnt anybody and again he found himself turning very red  well i dont know how we can thank you enough for your patience mr barker said the girl  oh dont mention it iveive enjoyed it said lemuel  gameevery time said berry and their evening broke up with a laugh  the next morning lemuel stopped miss swan at the door of the breakfast room and said ive been thinking over what you said last night and i should like to bring some onea lady friend of mineto see the pictures  why certainly mr barker any time some evening she suggested  should you mind it if i came tomorrow night he asked and he thought it right to remind her its sunday night  oh not at all tomorrow night by all means we shall both be at home and very glad to see you she hurried after miss carver loitering on her way to their table and lemuel saw them put their heads together as if they were whispering he knew they were whispering about him but they did not laugh probably they kept themselves from laughing in coming out from breakfast miss swan said i hope your friend isnt very critical mr barker and he answered confusedly oh not at all thank you but he said to himself that he did not care whether she was trying to make fun of him or not he knew what he had made up his mind to do  statira did not seem to care much about going to see the pictures when he proposed it to her the next evening she asked why he had been keeping it such a great secret and he could not pretend as he had once thought he could that he was keeping it as a surprise for her should you like to see em manda she asked with languid indifference  i d know as i care much about lems picture slongs weve got him around manda grier whipped out but i should like t see those celebrated girls t weve heard s much about  well said statira carelessly and they went into the next room to put on their wraps lemuel vexed to have manda grier made one of the party and helpless to prevent her going walked up and down wondering what he should say when he arrived with this unexpected guest  but miss swan received both of the girls very politely and chatted with manda grier whose conversation in defiance of any sense of superiority that the swan girl or the carver girl might feel was a succession of laconic snaps sometimes witty but mostly rude and contradictory  miss carver made tea and served it in some pretty cups which lemuel hoped statira might admire but she took it without noticing and in talking with miss carver she drawled and said nyeees and i dont know as i dooo and well i should think as muuch with a prolongation of all the final syllables in her sentences which he had not observed in her before and which she must have borrowed for the occasion for the gentility of the effect she tried to refer everything to him and she and manda grier talked together as much as they could and when the others spoke of him as mr barker they called him lem they did not look at anything or do anything to betray that they found the studio on which lemuel had once expatiated to them different from other rooms  at last miss swan abruptly brought out the studies of lemuels head and put them in a good light manda grier and statira got into the wrong place to see them  manda blurted out well he looks s if hed had a fit of sickness in that one and perhaps in fact miss carver had refined too much upon a delicate ideal of lemuels looks  so he dooes drawled statira and how funny he looks with that red thing ooon  miss swan explained that she had thrown that in for the colour and that they had been fancying him in the character of a young roman  you think hes got a roman noose asked statira through her own  i think lems got a kind of a pug mself said manda grier  well manda grier said statira  lemuel could not look at miss carver whom he knew to be gazing at the two girls from the little distance to which she had withdrawn miss swan was biting her lip  so thats the celebrated st albans is it said manda grier when they got in the street dont know s i really ever expected to see the inside f it you notice the kind of oilcloth they had on that upper entry stira  they did not mention lemuels pictures or the artists and he scarcely spoke on the way home  when they parted statira broke out crying and would not let him kiss her     xx   im afraid your little friend at the st albans isnt altogether happy of late said evans toward the end of what he called one of his powwows with sewell their talk had taken a vaster range than usual and they both felt the need that people know in dealing with abstractions of finally getting the ground beneath their feet again  ah asked sewell with a twinge that allayed his satisfaction in this whats the matter with him  oh the knowledge of good and evil i suspect  i hope theres nothing wrong said sewell anxiously  oh no i used the phrase because it came easily just what i mean is that im afraid his view of our social inequalities is widening and deepening and that he experiences the dissatisfaction of people who dont command that prospect from the summit i told you of his censure of our aristocratic constitution  yes said sewell with a smile  well im afraid he feels it more and more if i can judge from the occasional distance and hauteur with which he treats me he is humiliated by it nothing makes a man so proud as humiliation you know  thats true  there are a couple of pretty girls at the st albans artstudents who have been painting barker so i learn from a reformed cowboy of the plains who is with us as a lawstudent and is about with one of the young ladies a good deal theyre rather nice girls quite nice in fact and theres no harm in the cowboy and a good deal of fun but if barker had conceived of being painted as a social inferior and had been made to feel that he was merely a model and if he had become at all aware that one of the girls was rather prettythey both are  i see  i dont say its so but he seems lowspirited why dont you come round and cheer him upget into his confidence  get into the centre of the earth cried sewell i never saw such an inapproachable creature  evans laughed he is rather remote the genuine american youth is apt to be so especially if he thinks you mean him a kindness but there ought to be some way of convincing him that he need not feel any ignominy in his employment after so many centuries of christianity and generations of democracy it ought to be very simple to convince him that there is nothing disgraceful in showing people to their places at table  it isnt said the minister soberly  no it isnt said evans i wonder he added thoughtfully why we despise certain occupations we dont despise a man who hammers stone or saws boards why should we despise a barber is the care of the human head intrinsically less honourable than the shaping of such rude material why do we still condemn the tailor who clothes us and honour the painter who portrays us in the same clothes why do we despise waiters i tried to make barker believe that i respected all kinds of honest work but i lied i despised him for having waited on table why have all manner of domestics fallen under our scorn and come to be stigmatised in a lump as servants  ah i dont know said the minister there is something in personal attendance upon us that dishonours but the reasons of it are very obscure i couldnt give them perhaps its because its work that in a simpler state of things each of us would do for himself and in this state is too proud to do  that doesnt cover the whole ground said evans  and you think that poor boy is troubledis really suffering from a sense of inferiority to the other young people  oh i dont say certainly perhaps not but if he were what should you say was the best thing for him to do remain a servant cast his lot with these outcasts or try to separate and distinguish himself from them as we all do come we live in the worldwhich isnt so bad though its pretty stupid he couldnt change it now what ought he to do  sewell mused a while without answering anything then he said with a smile its very much simpler to fit people for the other world than for this dont you think  yes it is it was a cold day for the clergy when it was imagined that they ought to do both  well said sewell rising to follow his friend to the door i will come to see barker and try to talk with him hes a very complicated problem i supposed that i had merely his material prosperity to provide for after getting him down here but if i have to reconcile him to the constitution of society  yes said evans i wish youd let me know the result of your labours i think i could make a very incisive article on the subject the topic is always an attractive one there is nobody who doesnt feel that somebody else is taking on airs with him and ought to have his comb cut or if you should happen to prove to barker that his ignominy is in accordance with the development theory and is a necessary survival or something of that sort dont you see what a card it would be for us with the better classes  they went downstairs together and at the street door evans stopped again or ill tell you what make it a simple study of barkers minda sort of psychological interview and then with what ive been able to get from him we can present the impression that boston makes upon a young fresh shrewd mind that would be something rather new wouldnt it come the afternoon would make it worth your while and then you could work it into a sermon afterwards  you shameless reprobate said sewell laying his hand affectionately on his friends arm  there was nothing in lemuels case that seemed to him urgent and he did not go to see him at once in the meantime fast day came and lemuel got away at last to pay his first visit home  seems to me ye aint lookin over and above well lem was the first thing his mother said to him even before she noticed how well he was dressed  his new spring overcoat another prize from the misfit parlours and his new pointedtoe shoes and derby hat with the suit of clothes he had kept so carefully all through the winter were not the complete disguise he had fancied they might be at willoughby pastures the depotmaster had known him as soon as he got out of the cars and ignored his splendour in recognising him he said hello lem and had not time to reconcile himself to the boys changed appearance before lemuel hurried away with the bag he had bought so long before for the visit he met several people on his way home from the depot two of them were women and one of these said she knew as soon as she looked at him who it was and the other said she should have known it was lem barker as far as she could see him she asked him if he was home for good now  his mother pushed back his thick hair with her hard old hand as she spoke to him and then she pressed his head down upon her neck which was mostly collarbone but lemuel could hear her heart beat and the tears came into his eyes  oh im all right mother he said huskily though he tried to say it cheerfully he let her hold his head there the longer because mixed with his tenderness for her was a horror of her bloomers which he was not at once able to overcome when he gained courage to look he saw that she had them on but now he had the strength to bear it  ye had any breakfast she asked and when he said that he had got a cup of coffee at fitchburg she said well she must get him something and she drew him a cup of japan tea and made him some milk toast and pickedfish talking all the time and telling him how his sister and her husband had gone to the village to have one of her teeth drawn they had got along through the winter pretty well but she guessed that they would have had more to complain of if it had not been for him this was her way of acknowledging the help lemuel had given them every week and it was casually sandwiched between an account of an indian spirit treatment which reuben had tried for his rheumatism and a question whether lemuel had seen anything of that mind cure down to boston  but when he looked about the room and saw here and there the simple comforts and necessaries which his money had bought the sick man and the two helpless women his heart swelled with joy and pride and he realised the pleasure we all feel in being a good genius at times it had come pretty hard to send the greater part of his weeks wages home but now he was glad he had done it the poor coarse food which his mother had served him as a treat the low cracked ceilings the waving floor covered with rag carpet the sagging doors and the oldfashioned trim of the smallpaned windows were all very different from the luxurious abundance the tesselated pavement and the tapestry brussels the lofty studding and the black walnut mouldings of the st albans and lemuel felt the difference with a curious mixture of pride and remorse in his own escape from the meanness of his home he felt the selfreproach to which the man who rises without raising with him all those dear to him is destined in some measure all his life his interests and associations are separated from theirs but if he is not an ignoble spirit the ties of affection remain unweakened he cares for them with a kind of indignant tenderness and calls himself to account before them in the midst of pleasures which they cannot share or even imagine  lemuels mother did not ask him much about his life in boston she had not the materials for curiosity about it but he told her everything that he thought she could understand she recurred to his hopes when he left home and their disappointment in sewell and she asked if lemuel ever saw him nowadays she could not reconcile herself to his reconciliation with sewell whom she still held to have behaved treacherously then she went back to lemuels looks and asked him if he kept pretty well and when he answered that he did she smoothed with her hand the knot between her eyes and did not question him further  he had the whole forenoon with his mother and he helped her to get the dinner as he used to do pulling the stovewood out of the snowdrift that still embedded part of the woodpile though the snow was all gone around boston it was thawing under the dull soft april sky and he saw the first bluebird perched on the clothesline when he went out for the wood his mother said there had been lots of them he walked about the place and into the barn taking in the forlornness and shabbiness and then he went up into the room over the shed where he used to study and write his heart ached with selfpity  he realised as he had not done at a distance how dependent this wretched home was upon him and after meaning the whole morning to tell his mother about statira he decided that he was keeping it from her not merely because he was ashamed to tell her that he was engaged but because it seemed such a crazy thing for a person in his circumstances if it was really an engagement he had not seen statira since that night when he brought her to look at the pictures the artstudents had made of him he felt that he had not parted with her kindly and he went to see her the night before he started home though it was not sunday but he had found her door locked and this made him angry with her he could not have said just why if he told his mother about statira now what should he tell her he compromised by telling her about the two girls that had painted his likeness  his mother seemed not to care a great deal about the pictures she said i dont want you should let any girl make a fool of you lem  oh no he answered and went and looked out of the window  i dont say but what theyre nice girls enough but in your place you no need to throw yourself away  lemuel thought of the awe of miss carver in which he lived and the difference between them and he could have laughed at his mothers ignorant pride what would she say if she knew that he was engaged to a girl that worked in a boxfactory but probably she would not think that studying art and teaching it was any better she evidently believed that his position in the st albans was superior to that of miss carver  his sister and her husband came home before they had finished dinner his sister had her face all tied up to keep from taking cold after having her tooth drawn and lemuel had to go out and help his rheumatic brotherinlaw put up the horse when they came in his brotherinlaw did not wash his hands before going to the table and lemuel could not keep his eyes off his black and broken fingernails his mothers and sisters nails were black too it must have been so when he lived at home  his sister could not eat she took some tea and went to bed his brotherinlaw pulled off his boots after dinner and put up his stockingfeet on the stovehearth to warm them  there was no longer any chance to talk with his mother indoors and he asked her if she would not like to come out it was very mild she put on her bonnet and they strolled down the road all the time lemuel had to keep from looking at her bloomers when they met any one driving he had to keep himself from trying to look as if he were not with her but was just out walking alone  the day wore heavily away his brotherinlaws rheumatism came on toward evening and his sisters face had swollen so that it would not do for her to go out lemuel put on some old clothes he found in his room and milked the cows himself  like old times lem said his mother when he came in  yes he assented quietly  he and his mother had tea together but pretty soon afterwards she seemed to get sleepy and lemuel said he had been up early and he guessed he would go to bed his mother said she guessed she would go too  after he had blown out his light she came in to see if he were comfortable i presume it seems a pretty poor place to you lem she said holding her lamp up and looking round  i guess if its good enough for you it is for me he answered evasively  no it aint she said i always ben used to it and i can see from your talk that youve got used to something different already well its right lem youre a good boy and i want you should get the good of boston all you can we dont any of us begrutch it to ye and what i came up to say now was dont you scrimp yourself down there to send home to us we got a roof over our heads and we can keep soul and body together somehow we always have and we dont need a great deal but i want you should keep yourself nicely dressed down to boston so t you can go with the best i dont want you should feel anyways meechin on account of your clothes you got a good figure lem you take after your father sometimes i wish you was a little bigger but he want and he had a big spirit he want afraid of anything and they said if hed come out o that battle where he was killed hed a ben a captain he was a good man  she had hardly ever spoken so much of his father before he knew now by the sound of her voice in the dim room that the tears must be in her eyes but she governed herself and went on  what i wanted to say was dont you keep sendin so much o your money home child its yours and i want you should have it most of it goes for patent medicines anyway when it gets here we cant keep reuben from buying em and hes always changin doctors and i want you should hold yourself high lem youre as good as anybody and dont you go with any girls especially that aint of the best youre gettin to that time o life when youll begin to think about em but dont you go and fall in love with the first little poppet you see because shes got pretty eyes and curly hair  it seemed to lemuel as if she must know about statira but of course she did not he lay still and she went on  dont you go and get engaged or any such foolishness in a hurry lem them artstudent girls you was tellin about i presume theyre all right enough but you wait a while young men think its a kind of miracle if a girl likes em and theyre ready to go crazy over it but its the most natural thing she can do you just wait a while when you get along a little further you can pick and choose for yourself i dont know as i should want you should marry for money but dont you go and take up with the first thing comes along because youre afraid to look higher whats become o that nasty thing that talked so to you at that miss vanes  lemuel said that he had never seen sibyl or miss vane since but he did not make any direct response to the anxieties his mother had hinted at her pride in him so ignorant of all the reality of his life in the city crushed him more than the sight and renewed sense of the mean conditions from which he had sprung what if he should tell her that miss carver whom she did not want him to marry in a hurry regarded him as a servant and treated him as she would treat a black man what if she knew that he was as good as engaged to marry a girl that could no more meet miss carver on the same level than she could fly he could only tell his mother not to feel troubled about him that he was not going to get married in any great hurry and pretend to be sleepy and turn his head away  she pulled the covering up round his neck and tucked it in with her strong rough old hand whose very tenderness hurt  he had expected to stay the greater part of the next day but he took an earlier train his sister was still laid up she thought she must have taken cold in her jaw her husband rumpled unshaven with a shawl over his shoulders cowered about the cookstove for the heat he began to hate this poverty and suffering to long for escape from it to the life which at that distance seemed so rich and easy and pleasant he trembled lest something might have happened in his absence to have thrown him out of his place  all the way to boston he was under the misery of the home that he was leaving his mothers pride added to the burden of it but when the train drew in sight of the city and he saw the steeples and chimneys and the thin masts of the ships printed together against the horizon his heart rose he felt equal to it to anything in it  he arrived in the middle of the afternoon and he saw no one at the hotel except the harmons till toward dinnertime then the ladies coming in from shopping had a word of welcome for him some of them stopped and shook hands at the office and when they began to come down to dinner they spoke to him and there again some of them offered their hands they said it seemed an age since he had gone  the artstudents came down with berry who shook hands so cordially with him that perhaps they could not help it miss carver seemed to hesitate but she gave him her hand too and she asked as the others had done whether he had found his family well  he did not know what to think sometimes he felt as if people were trying to make a fool of him almost he remained blushing and smiling to himself after the last of them had gone in to dinner he did not know what miss carver meant but her eyes seemed to have lost that cold distance and to have come nearer to him  late at night berry came to him where he sat at his desk well barker im glad youre back again old man feels as if youd been gone a month of sundays didnt know whether we should have you with us this first evening  lemuel grew hot with consciousness and did not make it better for himself by saying i dont know what you mean  well i dont suppose i should in your place returned berry its human nature its all right what did the ladies think of the roman youth the other night the distinguished artists werent sure exactly and i thought i could make capital with one of em if i could find out yes thats my little game barker thats what i dropped in for bismarck style of diplomacy ill tell you why they want to know if you wont give me away miss swan wanted to give her bit of colourthats what she calls itto one of the young ladies but shes afraid she didnt like it  i guess they liked it well enough said lemuel thinking with shame that statira had not had the grace to say a word of either of the pictures he attributed this to manda griers influence  well thats good so far as it goes said berry but now to come down to particulars what did they say thats what miss swan will ask me  i dont remember just what they said faltered lemuel  well they must have said something insisted berry jocosely give a fellow some little clue and i can piece it out for myself what did she say i dont ask which she was but i have my suspicions all i want to know is what she said anything like beautiful middle distance or splendid chiaroscuro or fine perspective or exquisite modelling come now try to think barker he gave lemuel time but to no purpose well he resumed with affected dejection ill have to try to imagine it i guess i can i havent worked my imagination much since i took up the law but look here barker he continued more briskly now you open up a little here ive been giving you my confidence ever since i saw youforcing it on you and you know just how far im gone on miss swan to a hundredth part of an inch but i dont know enough of your affections to swear that youve got any now which one is it dont be mean about it i wont give you away honest injun  lemuel was goaded to desperation his face burned and the perspiration began to break out on his forehead he did not know how to escape from this pursuit  which is it barker repeated his tormentor i know its human nature to deny it though i never could understand why if i was engaged the sunday papers should have it about as quick  im not engaged cried lemuel  you aint yelled berry  no  give me your hand neither am i  he shook lemuels helpless hand with mock heroic fervour we are brothers from this time forth barker you cant imagine how closely this tie binds you to me barker barker we are one with no particular prospect as far as i am concerned of ever being more  he offered to dramatise a burst of tears on lemuels shoulder but lemuel escaped from him  stop quit your fooling what if somebody should come in  they wont said berry desisting and stretching himself at ease in the only chair besides lemuels with which the office was equipped its too late for em now oer the onehalf world nature seems deadah and wicked dreams abuse the curtained sleepah we are safe here from all intrusion and i can lay bare my inmost thoughts to you barker if i happen to have any barker im awfully glad youre not engaged to either of those girlsor both and its not altogether because i enjoy the boon companionship of another unengaged man but its partly because i dont thinkshall i say it  say what asked lemuel not without some prescience  well you can forgive the brotherly frankness if you dont like it i dont think theyre quite up to you  lemuel gave a sort of start which berry interpreted in his own way  now hold on i know just how you feel been there myself i have seen the time too when i thought any sort of girl was too good for alonzo w jr but i dont now i think a w jr is good enough for the best i may be mistaken i was the other time but we all begin that way and the great object is not to keep on that way see now i suppose youre in lovepuppy lovewith that little thing probably the first girl you got acquainted with after you came to boston or may be a sweet survival of the willoughby pastures period all right perfectly natural in either case but dont you let it go any further my dear boy old man dont you let it go any further pause reflect consider love wisely but not too well take the unsolicited advice of a sufferer  pride joy shame remorse mixed in lemuels heart which eased itself in an involuntary laugh at berrys nonsense  now what i want you to dodear boy or old man as the case may beis to regard yourself in a new light regard yourself for the sake of the experiment as too good for any girl in boston no cant fetch it try again  lemuel could only laugh foolishly  well now thats singular pursued berry i supposed you could have done it without the least trouble well lets try something a little less difficult look me in the eye and regard yourself as too good for example for miss carver ha  an angry flush spread over lemuels embarrassed face i wish youd behave yourself he stammered  in any other cause i would said berry solemnly but i must be cruel to be kind seriously old man if you cant think yourself too good for miss carver i wish youd think yourself good enough now im not saying anything against the willoughby episode mind that has its place in the wise economy of nature just like anything else but there aint any outcome in it for you youve got a future before you barker and you dont want to go and load up with a love affair that youll keep trying to unload as long as you live no sir look at me i know im not an example in some things but in this little business of correctly placed affections i could give points to solomon why am i in love with m swan because i cant help it for one thing and because for another thing she can do more to develop the hidden worth and unsuspected powers of a w jr than any other woman in the world she may never feel that its her mission but she cant shake my conviction that way and i shall stay undeveloped to prove that i was right well now what you want my friend is development and you cant get it where youve been going she haint got it on hand and what you want to do is not to take something else in its placetender heart steadfast affections loyalty theyve got em at every shop in town theyre a drug in the market youve got to say no development heigh well ill just look round a while and if i cant find it at some of the other stores ill come back and take some of that steadfast affection you say it wont come off or run in washing see  you ought to be ashamed of yourself said lemuel trying to summon an indignant feeling and laughing with a strange pleasure at heart youve got no right to talk to me that way i want you should leave me alone  well since youre so pressing i will go said berry easily but if i find you at our next interview sitting under the shade of the mustardtree whose little seed i have just dropped i shall feel that i have not laboured in vain shes a darling shes a daisy shes a dumpling shes a lamb i refer to miss swan of course but on other lips the terms are equally applicable to miss carver and dont you forget it  he swung out of the office with a mazurka step his silk hat gaily tilted on the side of his head struck against the doorjamb and fell rolling across the entry floor lemuel laughed wildly at twenty these things are droll     xxi   a week passed and lemuel had not tried to see statira again he said to himself that even when he had tried to do what was right and to show those young ladies how much he thought of her by bringing her to see their pictures she had acted very ungratefully and had as good as tried to quarrel with him then when he went to see her before his visit home she was out she had never been out before when he called  now he had told berry that they were not engaged at first this shocked him as if it were a lie then he said to himself that he had a right to make that answer because berry had no right to ask the questions that led to it then he asked himself if he really were engaged to statira he had told her that he liked her better than any one else in the world and she had said as much to him but he pretended that he did not know whether it could be called an engagement  there was no one who could solve the question for him and it kept asking itself that whole week and especially when he was with miss carver as happened two or three times through berrys connivance once he had spent the greater part of an evening in the studio where he talked nearly all the time with miss carver and he found out that she was the daughter of an old ships captain at corbitant her mother was dead and her aunt had kept house for her father it was an old square house that her grandfather built in the days when corbitant had direct trade with france she described it minutely and told how a french gentleman had died there in exile at the time of the french revolution and who was said to haunt the house but miss carver had never seen any ghosts in it they all began to talk of ghosts and weird experiences even berry had had some strange things happen to him in the west then the talk broke in two again and lemuel sat apart with miss carver who told at length the plot of a story she had been reading it was a story called romola and she said she would lend it to lemuel she said she did not see how any one could bear to be the least selfish or untrue after reading it that made lemuel feel cold but he could not break away from her charm she sat where the shaded lamp threw its soft light on one side of her face it looked almost like the face of a spirit and her eyes were full of a heavenly gentleness  lemuel asked himself how he could ever have thought them proud eyes he asked himself at the same time and perpetually whether he was really engaged to statira or not he thought how different this evening was from those he spent with her she could not talk about anything but him and her dress and manda grier could not do anything but say saucy things which she thought were smart miss swan was really witty it was as good as the theatre to hear her and berry going on together berry was pretty bright there was no denying it he sang to his banjo that night one of the songs was spanish he had learned it in new mexico  lemuel began to understand better how such nice young ladies could go with berry at first after berry talked so to him that night in the office against statira he determined that he would keep away from him but berry was so sociable and goodnatured that he could not the first thing he knew lemuel was laughing at something berry said and then he could not help himself  berry was coming now every chance he had to talk about the art students he seemed to take it for granted that lemuel was as much interested in miss carver as he was himself in miss swan and lemuel did begin to speak of her in a shy way berry asked him if he had noticed that she looked like that spanish picture of the virgin that miss swan had pinned up next to the door and lemuel admitted that there was some resemblance  notice those eyes of hers so deep and sorry for everybody in general if it was anybody in particular that fellow would be in luck oh shes a dumpling theres no mistake about it nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remembered thats miss carvers style she looks as if she just wanted to forgive somebody something im afraid you aint wicked enough barker look here whats the reason we cant make up a little party for the easter service at the catholic cathedral sunday night the girls would like to go i know  no no i cant i mustnt said lemuel and he remained steadfast in his refusal it would be the second sunday night that he had not seen statira and he felt that he must not let it pass so berry went off to the cathedral with the artstudents and he kept out of the way till they were gone  he said to himself that he would go a little later than usual to see statira to let her know that he was not so very anxious but when he found her alone and she cried on his neck and owned that she had not behaved as she should that night when she went to see the pictures and that she had been afraid he hated her and was not coming any more he had stayed away so long his heart was melted and he did everything to soothe and comfort her and they were more loving together than they had been since the first time manda grier came in and said through her nose like an old countrywoman the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love and statira exclaimed in the old way manda that he had once thought so cunning and rested there in his arms with her cheek tight pressed against his  she did not talk except when she was greatly excited about something she rarely had anything to say she had certain little tricks poutings bridlings starts outcries which had seemed the most bewitching things in the world to lemuel she tried all these now unaffectedly enough in listening to his account of his visit home and so far as she could she vividly sympathised with him  he came away heavy and unhappy somehow these things no longer sufficed for him he compared this evening with the last he had spent with the artstudents which had left his brain in a glow and kept him awake for hours with luminous thoughts but he had got over that unkindness to statira and he was glad of that he pitied her now and he said to himself that if he could get her away from manda grier and under the influence of such girls as miss swan and miss carver it would be much better for her he did not relent toward manda grier he disliked her more than ever and in the friendship which he dramatised between statira and miss carver he saw her cast adrift without remorse  sewell had told him that he was always at leisure monday night and the next evening lemuel went to pay his first visit to the minister since his first day in boston it was early and evans who usually came that evening had not arrived yet but sewell had him in his thought when he hurried forward to meet his visitor  oh is it you mr barker he asked in a note of surprise i am glad to see you i had been intending to come and look you up again will you sit down mr evans was here the other night and we were talking of you i hope you are all well  very well thank you said lemuel taking the hand the minister offered and then taking the chair he indicated sewell did not know exactly whether to like the greater ease which lemuel showed in his presence but there was nothing presumptuous in it and he could not help seeing the increased refinement of the young mans beauty the knot between his eyes gave him interest while it inflicted a vague pang upon the minister i have been at home since i saw you lemuel looked down at his neat shoes to see if they were in fit state for the ministers studycarpet and sewells eye sympathetically following wandered to the various details of lemuels simple and becoming dressthe light spring suit which he had indulged himself in at the misfit parlours since his mother had bidden him keep his money for himself and not send so much of it home  ah have you cried the minister i hope you found your people all well how is the place looking i suppose the season isnt quite so advanced as it is with us  theres some snow in the woods yet said lemuel laying the stick he carried across the hatbrim on his knees mother was well but my sister and her husband have had a good deal of sickness  oh im sorry for that said sewell with the general sympathy which evans accused him of keeping on tap professionally well how did you like the looks of willoughby pastures compared with boston rather quieter i suppose  yes it was quieter answered lemuel  but the first touch of spring must be very lovely there i find myself very impatient with these sweet early days in town i envy you your escape to such a place  lemuel opposed a cold silence to the lurking didacticism of these sentences and sewell hastened to add and i wish i could have had your experience in contrasting the country and the town after your long sojourn here on your first return home such a chance can come but once in a lifetime and to very few  there are some pleasant things about the country lemuel began  oh i am sure of it cried sewell with cheerful aimlessness  the stillness was a kind of rest after the noise here i think any one might be glad to get back to such a place  i was sure you would interrupted sewell  if he was discouraged or broken down any way lemuel calmly added  oh said sewell you mean that you found more sympathy among your old friends and neighbours than you do here  no said lemuel bluntly thats what city people think but its all a mistake there isnt half the sympathy in the country that there is in the city folks pry into each others business more but they dont really care so much what i mean is that you could live cheaper and the fight isnt so hard you might have to use your hands more but you wouldnt have to use your head hardly at all there isnt so much oppositioncompetition  oh said sewell a second time but this competitionthis strugglein which one or the other must go to the wall isnt that painful  i dont know as it is answered lemuel as long as youre young and strong and it dont always follow that one must go to the wall ive seen some things where both got on better  sewell succumbed to this worldly wisdom he was frequently at the disadvantage men of cloistered lives must be in having his theories in advance of his facts he now left this point and covertly touched another that had come up in his last talk with evans about barker but you find in the country dont you a greater equality of social condition people are more on a level and have fewer artificial distinctions  yes theres that admitted lemuel ive worried a good deal about that for ive had to take a servants place in a good many things and ive thought folks looked down on me for it even when they didnt seem to intend to do it but i guess it isnt so bad as i thought when i first began to notice it do you suppose it is his voice was suddenly tense with personal interest in the question which had ceased to be abstract  oh certainly not said the minister with an ease which he did not feel  i presume i had what you may call a servants place at miss vanes pursued lemuel unflinchingly and ive been what you may call head waiter at the st albans since ive been there if a person heard afterwards when i had made out something if i ever did that i had been a servant would theytheydespise me for it  not unless they were very silly people said sewell cordially i can assure you  but if they had ever seen me doing a servants work wouldnt they always remember it no matter what i was afterwards sewell hesitated and lemuel hurried to add i ask because ive made up my mind not to be anything but clerk after this  sewell pitied the simple shame the simple pride that isnt the question for you to ask my dear boy he answered gently and with an affection which he had never felt for his charge before theres another question more important and one which you must ask yourself should i care if they did after all the matters in your own hands your souls always your own till you do something wrong  yes i understand that lemuel sat silently thoughtful fingering his hatband it seemed to sewell that he wished to ask something else and was mustering his courage but if this was so it exhaled in a sigh and he remained silent  i should be sorry pursued the minister to have you dwell upon such things there are certain ignoble facts in life which we can best combat by ignoring them a slight of almost any sort ceases to be when you cease to consider it this did not strike sewell as wholly true when he had said it and he was formulating some modification of it in his mind when lemuel said  i presume a person can help himself some by being ashamed of caring for such things and thats what ive tried to do  yes thats what i meant  i guess ive exaggerated the whole thing some but if a thing is so thinking it aint wont unmake it  no admitted sewell reluctantly but i should be sorry all the same if you let it annoygrieve you what has pleased me in what ive been able to observe in you has been your willingness to take hold of any kind of honest work i liked finding you with your coat off washing dishes that morning at the wayfarers lodge and i liked your going at once to miss vanes in aas you did  of course lemuel interrupted i could do it before i knew how it was looked at here  and couldnt you do it now  not if there was anything else  ah thats the great curse of it thats what i deplore sewell broke out in our young people coming from the country to the city they must all have some genteel occupation i dont blame them but i would gladly have saved you this experiencethis knowledgeif i could i felt that i had done you a kind of wrong in being the means however indirectly and innocently of your coming to boston and i would willingly have done anything to have you go back to the country but you seemed to distrust meto find something hostile in meand i did not know how to influence you  yes i understand that said lemuel i couldnt help it at first but ive got to see it all in a different light since then i know that you meant the best by me i know now that what i wrote wasnt worth anything and just how you must have looked at it i didnt know some things then that i do now and since i have got to know a little more i have understood better what you meant by all you said  i am very glad said sewell with sincere humility that you have kept no hard feeling against me  oh not at all its all right now i couldnt explain very well that i hadnt come to the city just to be in the city but because i had to do something to help along at home you didnt seem to understand that there want anything there for me to take hold of  no im afraid i didnt or wouldnt quite understand that i was talking and acting im afraid from a preconceived notion lemuel made no reply not having learned yet to utter the pleasant generalities with which city people left a subject and after a while sewell added i am glad to have seen your face so often at church you have been a great deal in my mind and i have wished to do something to make your life happy and useful to you in the best way here but i havent quite known how at this point sewell realised that it was nearly eight months since lemuel had come to boston and he said contritely i have not made the proper effort im afraid but i did not know exactly how to approach you you were rather a difficult subject he continued with a smile in which lemuel consented to join but now that weve come to a clearer understanding he broke off and asked have you many acquaintances in boston  lemuel hesitated and cleared his throat not many  something in his manner prompted the minister to say that is such a very important thing for young men in a strange place i wish you would come oftener to see us hereafter young men in the want of companionship often form disadvantageous acquaintances which they cant shake off afterwards when they might wish to do so i dont mean evil acquaintance i certainly couldnt mean that in your case but frivolous ones from which nothing high or noble can come nothing of improvement or development  lemuel started at the word and blushed it was berrys word sewell put his own construction on the start and the blush  especially he went on i should wish any young man whom i was interested in to know refined and noble woman he felt that this was perhaps in lemuels case too much like prescribing port wine and carriage exercise to an indigent patient and he added if you cannot know such women it is better to know none at all it is not what women say or do so much as the art they have of inspiring a man to make the best of himself the accidental acquaintances that young people are so apt to form are in most cases very detrimental there is no harm in them of themselves perhaps but all irregularity in the life of the young is to be deplored  do you mean asked lemuel with that concreteness which had alarmed sewell before that they ought to be regularly introduced  i mean that a young girl who allowed a young man to make her acquaintance outside of thethesocial sanctionswould be apt to be a silly or romantic person at the best of course there are exceptions but i should be very sorry if any young man i knewno why shouldnt i say you at onceshould involve himself in any such way one thing leads to another especially with the young and the very fact of irregularity of romance of strangeness in an acquaintance throws a false glamour over the relation and appeals to the sentiments in an unwarranted degree  yes that is so said lemuel  the admission stimulated sewell in the belief that he had a clue in his hand which it was his duty to follow up the whole affair loses proportion and balance the fancy becomes excited and some of the most important intereststhe very most important interests of lifeare committed to impulse lemuel remained silent and it seemed the silence of conviction a young man is better for knowing women older than himself more cultivated devoted to higher things of course young people must see each other must fall in love and get married but there need be no haste about such things if there is hasteif there is rashness thoughtlessnessthere is sure to be unhappiness men are apt to outgrow their wives intellectually if their wives minds are set on home and children as they should be and allowance for this ought to be made if possible i would rather that in the beginning the wife should be the mental superior i hope it will be several years yet before you think seriously of such things but when the time comes i hope you will have seen some young girlthere are such for every one of uswhom it is civilisation and enlightenment refinement and elevation simply to know on the other hand a silly girls influence is degrading and ruinous she either drags those attached to her down to her own level or she remains a weight and a clog upon the life of a man who loves her  yes said lemuel with a sigh which sewell interpreted as that of relief from danger recognised in time  he pursued eagerly i could not warn any one too earnestly against such an entanglement  lemuel rose and looked about with a troubled glance sewell continued any such marriagea marriage upon any such conditions is sure to be calamitous and if the conditions are recognised beforehand it is sure to be iniquitous so far from urging the fulfilment of even a promise in such a case i would have every such engagement broken in the interest of humanityof morality  mrs sewell came into the room and gave a little start of surprise apparently not mixed with pleasure at seeing lemuel she had never been able to share her husbands interest in him while insisting upon his responsibility she disliked him not logically but naturally for the wrong and folly which he had been the means of her husbands involving himself in miss vanes kindliness toward lemuel which still survived and which expressed itself in questions about him whenever she met the minister was something that mrs sewell could not understand she now said oh mr barker and coldly gave him her hand have you been well must you go  yes thank you i have got to be getting back well good evening he bowed to the sewells  you must come again to see me said the minister and looked at his wife  yes it has been a very long time since you were here mrs sewell added  i havent had a great deal of time to myself said lemuel and he contrived to get himself out of the room  sewell followed him down to the door in the endeavour to say something more on the subject his wife had interrupted but he only contrived to utter some feeble repetitions he came back in vexation which he visited upon lemuel silly fellow he exclaimed  what has he been doing now asked mrs sewell with reproachful discouragement  oh i dont know i suspect that hes been involving himself in some ridiculous love affair mrs sewell looked a silent inculpation its largely conjecture on my part of coursehes about as confiding as an oysterbut i fancy i have said some things in a conditional way that will give him pause i suspect from his manner that he has entangled himself with some other young simpleton and that hes ashamed of it or tired of it already if thats the case i have hit the nail on the head i told him that a foolish rash engagement was better broken than kept the foolish marriages that people rush into are the greatest bane of life  and would you really have advised him david asked his wife to break off an engagement if he had made one  of course i should i  then i am glad i came in in time to prevent your doing anything so wicked  wicked sewell turned from his desk where he was about to sit down in astonishment  yes do you think that nobody else is to be considered in such a thing what about the poor silly girl if he breaks off with her oh you men are all alike even the best you think it is a dreadful thing for a young man to be burdened with a foolish love affair at the beginning of his career but you never think of the girl whose whole career is spoiled perhaps if the affair is broken off hasnt she any right to be considered  i should think said sewell distinctly daunted that they were equally fortunate if it were broken off  o my dear you know you dont think anything of the kind if he has more mind than she has and is capable of doing something in the world he goes on and forgets her but she remembers him perhaps its her one chance in life to get marriedto have a home you know very well that in a case of that kinda rash engagement as you call itboth are to blame and shall one do all the suffering very probably his fancy was taken first and he followed her up and flattered her into liking him and now shall he leave her because hes tired of her  yes said sewell recovering from the first confusion which his wifes unexpected difference of opinion had thrown him into i should think that was the very best reason in the world why he should leave her would his marrying make matters worse or better if he were tired of her as for wickedness i should feel myself guilty if i did not do my utmost to prevent marriages between people when one or other wished to break their engagement and had not the moral courage to do so there is no more pernicious delusion than that ones word ought to be kept in such an affair after the heart has gone out of it simply because its been given  david  but sewell was not to be restrained i am right about this lucy and you know it half the miserable marriages in the world could be prevented if there were only some frank and fearless adviser at hand to say to the foolish things that if they no longer fully and freely love each other they can commit no treason so deadly as being true to their word i wish he now added that i could be the means of breaking off every marriage that the slightest element of doubt enters into beforehand i should leave much less work for the divorce courts the trouble comes from that crazy and mischievous principle of false selfsacrifice that im always crying out against if a man has ceased to love the woman he has promised to marryor vice versathe best possible thing they can do the only righteous thing is not to marry  mrs sewell could not deny this she directed an oblique attack from another quarter as women do while affecting not to have changed her ground at all very well then david i wish you would have nothing to do with that crazy and mischievous principle yourself i wish you would let this ridiculous barker of yours alone from this time forth he has found a good place where he is of use and where he is doing very well now i think your responsibility is fairly ended i hope you wont meddle with his love affairs if he has any for if you do you will probably have your hands full he is very good looking and all sorts of silly little geese will be falling in love with him  well so far his love troubles are purely conjectural said sewell with a laugh im bound to say that barker himself didnt say a word to justify the conjecture that he was either in love or wished to be out of it however ive given him some wholesome advice which hell be all the better for taking merely as a prophylactic if nothing else  i am tired of him sighed mrs sewell is he going to keep perpetually turning up in this way i hope you were not very pressing with him in your invitations to him to call again  sewell smiled you were not my dear  you let him take too much of your time i was so provoked when i heard you going on with him that i came down to put an end to it  well you succeeded said sewell easily dont you think hes greatly improved in the short time hes been in the city  hes very well dressed i hope he isnt extravagant  hes not only well dressed but hes beginning to be well spoken i believe hes beginning to observe that there is such a thing as not talking through the nose he still says i dont know as but most of the men they turn out of harvard say that ive heard some of the professors say it  mrs sewell was not apparently interested in this     xxii   that night lemuel told mrs harmon that she must not expect him to do anything thenceforward but look after the accounts and the general management she must get a headwaiter and a boy to run the elevator she consented to this as she would have consented to almost anything else that he proposed  he had become necessary to the management of the st albans in every department and if the lady boarders felt that they could not now get on without him mrs harmon was even more dependent  with her still nominally at the head of affairs and controlling the expenses as a whole no radical reform could be effected but there were details of the outlay in which lemuel was of use and he had brought greater comfort into the house for less money he rejected her old and simple device of postponing the payment of debt as an economical measure and substituted cash dealings with new purveyors he gradually but inevitably took charge of the store room and stopped the waste there early in his administration he had observed the gross and foolish prodigality with which the portions were sent from the carvingroom and after replacing mrs harmons nephew there he established a standard portion that gave all the needed variety and still kept the quantity within bounds it came to his taking charge of this department entirely and as steward he carved the meats and saw that nothing was in a way to become cold before he opened the diningroom doors as headwaiter  his activities promoted the leisure which mrs harmon had always enjoyed and which her increasing bulk fitted her to adorn her nephew willingly relinquished the dignity of steward he said that his furnaces were as much as he wanted to take care of especially as in former years when it had begun to come spring he had experienced a stress of mind in keeping the heat just right when the ladies were all calling down the tubes for more of it or less of it which he should now be very glad not to have complicated with other cares he said that now he could look forward to the month of may with some pleasure  the guests sensibly or insensibly according to their several temperaments shared the increased ease that came from lemuels management the service was better in every way their beds were promptly made their rooms were periodically swept every night when they came up from dinner they found their pitchers of icewater at their doors this change was not accomplished without much of that rebellion and renunciation which was known at the st albans as kicking chambermaids and tablegirls kicked but they were replaced by lemuel who went himself to the intelligence office and pledged the new ones to his rule beforehand there was even some kicking among the guests who objected to the new portions and to having a second bill sent them if the first remained unpaid for a week but the general sense of the hotel was in lemuels favour  he had no great pleasure in the reform he had effected his heart was not in it except as waste and disorder and carelessness were painful to him he suffered to promote a better state of things as many a woman whose love is for books or pictures or society suffers for the perfection of her housekeeping and sacrifices her taste to achieve it he would have liked better to read to go to lectures to hear sermons with the knowledge of mr evanss life as an editor and the incentive of a writer near him he would have liked to try again if he could not write something though the shame of his failure in mr sewells eyes had burned so deep above all since he had begun to see how city people regarded the kind of work he had been doing he would have liked to get out of the hotel business altogether if he could have been sure of any other  as the spring advanced his cares grew lighter most of the regular boarders went away to country hotels and became regular boarders there their places were only partially filled by transients from the south and west who came and went and left lemuel large spaces of leisure in which he read or deputed mrs harmons nephew to the care of the office and pursued his studies of boston sometimes with mr evanswhose newspaper kept him in town and who liked to prowl about with him and to frequent the odd summer entertainmentsbut mostly alone they became friends after a fashion and were in each others confidence as regarded their opinions and ideas rather than their history now and then evans dropped a word about the boy he had lost or his wifes health but lemuel kept his past locked fast in his breast  the artstudents had gone early in the summer and berry had left boston for wyoming at the end of the spring term of the lawschool he had not been able to make up his mind to pop before miss swan departed but he thought he should fetch it by another winter and he had got leave to write to her on condition he said that he should conduct the whole correspondence himself  miss carver had left lemuel dreaming of her as an ideal yet true with a slow rustic constancy to statira for all that had been said and done he had not swerved explicitly from her there was no talk of marriage between them and could not be but they were lovers still and when miss carver was gone and the finer charm of her society was unfelt he went back to much of the old pleasure he had felt in statiras love the resentment of her narrowmindedness the shame for her ignorance passed the sense of her devotion remained  manda grier wanted her to go home with her for part of the summer but she would not have consented if lemuel had not insisted she wrote him back illspelt scrawly little letters in one of which she told him that her cough was all gone and she was as well as ever she took a little more cold when she returned to town in the first harsh september weather and her cough returned but she said she did not call it anything now  the hotel began to fill up again for the winter berry preceded the artstudents by some nervous weeks in which he speculated upon what he should do if they did not come at all then they came and the winter passed with repetitions of the last winters events and a store of common memories that enriched the present and insensibly deepened the intimacy in which lemuel found himself he could not tell whither the present was carrying him he only knew that he had drifted so far from the squalor of his past that it seemed like the shadow of a shameful dream  he did not go to see statira so often as he used and she was patient with his absences and defended him against manda grier who did not scruple to tell her that she believed the fellow was fooling with her and who could not always keep down a mounting dislike of lemuel in his presence one night towards spring when he returned early from statiras he found berry in the office at the st albans that you old man he asked well im glad youve come just going to leave a little billy ducks for you here but now i neednt the young ladies sent me down to ask if you had a copy of whittiers poems they want to find something in it i told em longfellow would do just as well but i couldnt seem to convince em they say he didnt write the particular poem they want  yes ive got whittiers poems here said lemuel unlocking his desk it belongs to mr evans i guess he wont care if i lend it  well now i tell you what said berry dont you let a borrowed book like that go out of your hands heigh you just bring it up yourself see he winked the eye next lemuel with exaggerated insinuation theyll respect you all the more for being so scrupulous and i guess they wont be very much disappointed on general principles if you come along theres lots of human nature in girlsthe best of em ill tell em i left you lookin for it i dont mind a lie or two in a good cause but you hurry along up now  he was gone before lemuel could stop him he could not do anything but follow  it appeared that it was miss swan who wished to see the poem she could not remember the name of it but she was sure she should know it if she saw it in the index she mingled these statements with her greetings to lemuel and miss carver seemed as glad to see him she had a little more colour than usual and they were all smiling so that he knew berry had been getting off some of his jokes but he did not care  miss swan found the poem as she had predicted and now all keep still she said and ill read it but she suddenly added or no you read it mr barker wont you  if barker aint just in voice tonight ill read it suggested berry  but she would not let him make this diversion she ignored his offer and insisted upon lemuels reading jessie says you read beautifully that passage in romola she reminded him but lemuel said it was only a few lines and tried to excuse himself at heart he was proud of his reading and he ended by taking the book  when he had finished the two girls sighed  isnt it beautiful jessie said miss swan  beautiful answered her friend  berry yawned  well i dont see much difference between that and a poem of longfellows why wouldnt longfellow have done just as well honestly now why isnt one poem just as good as another for all practical purposes  it is for some people said miss swan  berry figured an extreme anguish by writhing in his chair miss swan laughed in spite of herself and they began to talk in their usual banter which miss carver never took part in and which lemuel was quite incapable of sharing if it had come to savage sarcasm or a logical encounter he could have held his own but he had a natural weight and slowness that disabled him from keeping up with berrys light talk he envied it because it seemed to make everybody like him and lemuel would willingly have been liked  miss carver began to talk to him about the book and then about mr evans she asked him if he went much to his rooms and lemuel said no not at all since the first time mr evans had asked him up he said after a pause that he did not know whether he wanted him to come  i should think he would said miss carver it must be very gloomy for him with his wife such an invalid he seems naturally such a gay person  yes thats what i think said lemuel  i wonder said the girl if it seems to you harder for a naturally cheerful person to bear things than for one who has always been rather melancholy  yes it does he answered with the pleasure and surprise young people have in discovering any community of feeling they have thought themselves so utterly unlike each other i wonder why it should  i dont know perhaps it isnt so but i always pity the cheerful person the most  they recognised an amusing unreason in this and laughed miss swan across the room had caught the name  are you talking of mrs evans  berry got his banjo down from the wall where miss swan allowed him to keep it as bricabrac and began to tune it  i dont believe it agrees with this banjoseph being an object of virtue he said what shall it be ladies something light and gay adapted to disperse gloomy reflections he played a fandango how do you like that it has a tinge of melancholy in it and yet its lively too as a friend of mine used to say about the dead march  was his name berry asked miss swan  not alonzo w jr returned berry tranquilly and he and miss swan began to joke together  i know a friend of mr evanss said lemuel to miss carver mr sewell have you ever heard him preach  oh yes indeed we go nearly every sunday morning  i nearly always go in the evening now said lemuel dont you like him  yes said the girl theres something about himi dont know whatthat doesnt leave you feeling how bad you are but makes you want to be better he helps you so and hes so clear and he shows that hes had all the mean and silly thoughts that you have i dont knowits as if he were talking for each person alone  yes that is exactly the way i feel lemuel was proud of the coincidence he said to commend himself further to miss carver i have just been round to see him  i should think you would value his acquaintance beyond anything said the girl is he just as earnest and simple as he is in the pulpit  hes just the same every way lemuel went a little further i knew him before i came to boston he boarded one summer where we lived as he spoke he thought of the grey old unpainted house and of his brotherinlaw with his stockingfeet on the stove hearth and his mothers bloomers he thought of his arrest and his night in the policestation his trial and the wayfarers lodge and he wondered that he could think of such things and still look such a girl in the face but he was not without that strange joy in their being unknown to her which reserved and latent natures feel in mere reticence and which we all experience in some degree when we talk with people and think of our undiscovered lives  they went on a long time matching their opinions and feelings about many things as young people do and fancying that much of what they said was new with them when he came away after ten oclock he thought of one of the things that sewell had said about the society of refined and noble women it was not so much what they said or did that helped it was something in them that made men say and do their best and help themselves to be refined and noble men to make the most of themselves in their presence he believed that this was what miss carver had done and he thought how different it was with him when he came away from an evening with statira again he experienced that compassion for her in the midst of his pride and exultation he asked himself what he could do to help her he did not see how she could be changed  berry followed him downstairs and wanted to talk the evening over  i dont see how im going to stand it much longer barker he said i shall have to pop pretty soon or die one of the two and im afraid either one ll kill me wasnt she lovely tonight honey in the comb sugar in the gourd i say i wonder what it is about popping anyway that makes it so hard barker its simply a matter of business if you come to boil it down you offer a fellow so many cattle and let him take em or leave em but if the fellow happens to have on a long slim olivegreen dress of some colour and holds her head like a whole floral tribute on a stem and you happen to be the cattle youre offering you cant feel so independent about it somehow well whats the use shes a daisy if ever there was one ever notice what a peculiar blue her eyes are  blue said lemuel theyre brown  look here old man said berry compassionately do you think ive come down here to fool away my time talking about miss carver well take some saturday afternoon for that when we havent got anything else to do but its miss swan that has the floor at present what were you two talking about over there so long i cant get along with miss carver worth a cent  i hardly know what we did talk about said lemuel dreamily  well ive got the same complaint i couldnt tell you ten words that madeline saidin thine absence let me call thee madeline sweetbut i knew it was making an immortal spirit of me right straight along every time the worst thing about an evening like this is it dont seem to last any time at all why when those girls began to put up their hands to hide their yawns i felt like i was just starting in for a short call i wish i could have had a good phonograph around id put it on my sleepless pillow and unwind its precious record all through the watches of the night he imitated the thin phantasmal squeak of the instrument in repeating a number of miss swans characteristic phrases yes sir a pocket phonograph is the thing im after  i dont see how you can talk the way you do said lemuel shuddering inwardly at berrys audacious freedom and yet finding a certain comfort in it  thats just the way i felt myself at first but youll get over it as you go along the nicest thing about their style of angel is that theyre perfectly human after all you dont believe it now of course but you will  it only heightened lemuels conception of miss carvers character to have berry talk so lightly and daringly of her in her relation to him he lay long awake after he went to bed and in the turmoil of his thoughts one thing was clear so pure and high a being must never know anything of his shameful past which seemed to dishonour her through his mere vicinity he must go far from her and she must not know why but long afterwards mr sewell would tell her and then she would understand he owed her this all the more because he could see now that she was not one of the silly persons as mr sewell called them who would think meanly of him for having in his ignorance and inexperience done a servants work his mind had changed about that and he wondered that he could ever have suspected her of such a thing  about noon the next day the street door was opened hesitatingly as if by some one not used to the place and when lemuel looked up from the menus he was writing he saw the figure of one of those tramps who from time to time presented themselves and pretended to want work he scanned the vagabond sharply as he stood moulding a soft hat on his hands and trying to superinduce an air of piteous appeal upon the natural gaiety of his swarthy face well whats wanted  a dawning conjecture that had flickered up in the tramps eyes flashed into full recognition  why mate  lemuels heart stood still whatwhat do you want here  why dont you know me mate  all his calamity confronted lemuel  no he said but nothing in him supported the lie he had uttered  wayfarers lodge suggested the other cheerfully dont you remember  no  i guess you do said the mate easily anyway i remember you  lemuels feeble defence gave way come in here he said and he shut the door upon the intruder and himself and submitted to his fate what is it he asked huskily  why mate whats the matter nobodys goin to hurt you said the other encouragingly whats your lay here  lay  yes got a job here  im the clerk said lemuel with the ghost of his former pride of office  clerk said the tramp with goodhumoured incredulity wheres your diamond pin wheres your rings he seemed willing to prolong the playful inquiry wheres your patent leather boots  its not a common hotel its a sort of a family hotel and im the clerk what do you want  the young fellow lounged back easily in his chair why i did drop in to beat the house out of a quarter if i could or may be ten cents thank you sir god bless you sir he interrupted himself to burlesque a professional gratitude that style of thing you know but i dont know about it now look here mate whats the reason you couldnt get me a job here too i been off on a six months cruise since i saw you and id like a job on shore first rate couldnt you kind of ring me in for something i aint afraid of work although i never did pretend to love it but i should like to reform now and get into something steady heigh  there isnt anything to dotheres no place for you lemuel began  oh pshaw now mate you think pleaded the other ill take any sort of a job i dont care what it is i aint got any o that false modesty about me been round too much and i dont want to go back to the wayfarers lodge its a good place and i know my welcomes warm and waitin for me between two hot plates but the thing of it is its demoralisin thats what the chaplain said just afore i left theship n i promised him id give work a try anyway now you just think up something i aint in any hurry in proof he threw his soft hat on the desk and took up one of the menus this your bill of fare well it aint bad vurmiselly soup boiled holibut roast beef roast turkey with cranberry sauce roast pork with apple sauce chicken corquettes ditto patties three kinds of pie bread puddin both kinds of sauce ice cream nuts and coffee why mate  lemuel sat dumb and motionless he could see no way out of the net that had entangled him he began feebly to repeat there isnt anything when some one tried the door  mr barker called mrs harmon you in there  he made it worse by waiting a moment before he rose and opened the door i didnt know id locked it the lie came unbidden he groaned inwardly to think how he was telling nothing but lies mrs harmon did not come in she glanced with a little question at the young fellow who had gathered his hat from the table and risen with gay politeness  it was a crisis of the old sort the elevator boy had kicked and mrs harmon said i just stopped to say that i was going out and i could stop at the intelligence office myself to get an elevator boy  the mate took the word with a joyous laugh at the coincidence its just what me and mr barker was talking about im from up his way and ive just come down to boston to see if i couldnt look up a job and he was tellin me in here about your wantin a telegraphi mean a elevatorboy but he didnt think it would suit me but i should like to give it a try anyway its pretty dull up our way and i got to do something mr barker ll tell you who i am  he winked at lemuel with the eye not exposed to mrs harmon and gave her a broad frank prepossessing smile  well of course said mrs harmon smoothly any friend of mr barkers  we just been talkin over old times in here interrupted the mate i guess it was me shoved that bolt in i didnt want to have anybody see me talkin with him till id got some clothes that would be a little more of a credit to him  well thats right said mrs harmon appreciatively i always like to have everybody around my house looking neat and respectable i keep a firstclass house and i dont have any but firstclass help and i expect them to dress accordingly from the highest to the lowest  yes maam said the mate thats the way i felt about it myself me and mr barker both and he was just tellin me that if i was a mind to give the elevator a try hed lend me a suit of his clothes  very well then said mrs harmon if mr barker and you are a mind to fix it up between you  oh we are said the mate there wont be any trouble about that  i dont suppose i need to stop at the intelligence office i presume mr barker will show you how to work the elevator he helped us out with it himself at first  yes thats what he said the other chimed in but i guess id better go and change my clothes first well mate he added to lemuel im ready when youre ready  lemuel rose trembling from the chair where he had been chained as it seemed to him while the mate and mrs harmon arranged their affair with his tacit connivance he had not spoken a word he feared so much to open his lips lest another lie should come out of them that his sense of that danger was hardly less than his terror at the captivity in which he found himself  yes said mrs harmon ill look after the office till you get back mr barker ll show you where you can sleep  thank you maam said the mate with gratitude that won upon her  and im glad she added that its a friend of mr barkers thats going to have the place we think everything of mr barker here  well you cant think more of him than what we do up home rejoined the other with generous enthusiasm  in lemuels room he was not less appreciative why mate it does me good to see how youve got along i got to write a letter home at once and tell the folks what friends youve got in boston i dont believe they half understand it he smiled joyously upon lemuel who stood stock still with such despair in his face that probably the wretch pitied him  look here mate dont you be afraid now im on the reform lay with all my might and i mean business i aint agoin to do you any harm you bet your life these your things he asked taking lemuels winter suit from the hooks where they hung and beginning to pull off his coat he talked on while he changed his dress i was led away and i got my comeuppings or the other fellows come uppings for i want to blame any and i always said so and i guess the judge would say so too if it was to do over again  a frightful thought stung lemuel to life the judge was it a passengership  the other stopped buttoning lemuels trousers round him to slap himself on the thigh why mate dont you know enough to know what a sea voyage is why ive been down to the island for the last six months haint you never heard it called a sea voyage why we always come off from a cruise when we git back you dont mean to say you never been one  oh my goodness groaned lemuel havehave you been in prison  why of course  oh what am i going to do whispered the miserable creature to himself  the other heard him why you haint got to do anything im on the reform and you might leave everything layin around loose and i shouldnt touch it fact you ask the ships chaplain  he laughed in the midst of his assertions of good resolutions but sobered to the full extent probably of his face and nature and tying lemuels cravat on at the glass he said solemnly mate its all right im on the reform     xxiii   lemuels friend entered upon his duties with what may also be called artistic zeal he showed a masterly touch in managing the elevator from the first trip he was ready cheerful and obliging he lacked nothing but a little more reluctance and a seaside library novel to be a perfect elevatorboy  the ladies liked him at once he was so pleasant and talkative and so full of pride in lemuel that they could not help liking him and several of them promptly reached that stage of confidence where they told him as an old friend of lemuels they thought lemuel read too much and was going to kill himself if he kept on a great deal longer the mate said he thought so too and had noticed how bad lemuel looked the minute he set eyes on him but he asked what was the use he had said everything he could to him about it he was always just so up at home as he found opportunity he did what he could to console lemuel with furtive winks and nods  lemuel dragged absently and haggardly through the day in the evening he told mrs harmon that he had to go round and see mr sewell a moment  it was then nine oclock and she readily assented she guessed mr williamshe had told her his name was williamscould look after the office while he was gone mr williams was generously glad to do so behind mrs harmons smooth large form he playfully threatened her with his hand levelled at his shoulder but even this failed to gladden lemuel  it was halfpast nine when he reached the ministers house and the maid had a visible reluctance at the door in owning that mr sewell was at home mrs sewell had instructed her not to be too eagerly candid with people who came so late but he was admitted and sewell came down from his study to see him in the receptionroom  what is the matter he asked at once when he caught sight of lemuels face has anything gone wrong with you mr barker he could not help being moved by the boys looks he had a fleeting wish that mrs sewell were there to see him and be moved too and he prepared himself as he might to treat the trouble which he now expected to be poured out  yes said lemuel i want to tell you i want you to tell me what to do  when he had put the case fully before the minister his listener was aware of wishing that it had been a lovetrouble such as he foreboded at first  he drew a long and deep breath and before he began to speak he searched himself for some comfort or encouragement while lemuel anxiously scanned his face  yesyes i see yourdifficulty he began making the futile attempt to disown any share in it but perhapsperhaps it isnt so bad as it seems perhaps no harm will come perhaps he really means to do well and if you are vigilant inin keeping him out of temptation sewell stopped sensible that he was not coming to anything and rubbed his forehead  do you think asked lemuel dry mouthed with misery that i ought to have told mrs harmon at once  why it is always best to be truthful and aboveboardas a principle said the minister feeling himself somehow dragged from his moorings  then i had better do it yet  yes said sewell and he paused yes that is to sayas the mischief is doneperhapsperhaps there is no haste if you exercise vigilancebut if he has been in prisondo you know what he was in for  no i didnt know he had been in at all till we got to my room and then i couldnt ask himi was afraid to  yes said sewell kindly if helplessly  i was afraid if i sent him offor tried tothat he would tell about my being in the wayfarers lodge that night and they would think i had been a tramp i could have done it but i thought he might tell some lie about me and they might get to know about the trial  i see said sewell  i hated to lie said lemuel piteously but i seemed to have to  there was another yes on the ministers tongue he kept it back but he was aware of an instants relief in the speculationthe question presented itself abstractlyas to whether it was ever justifiable or excusable to lie were the jesuitical casuists possibly right in some slight shadowy sort he came back to lemuel groaning in spirit nonono he sighed we mustnt admit that you had to lie we must never admit that a truth flashed so vividly upon him that it seemed almost escape what worse thing could have come from telling the truth than has come from withholding it and that would have been some sort of end and thisthis is only the miserable beginning  yes said lemuel with all desirable humility but i couldnt see it at once  oh i dont blame you i dont blame you said sewell it was a sore temptation i blame myself he exclaimed with more comprehensiveness than lemuel knew but he limited his self accusal by adding i ought to have told mrs harmon myself what i knew of your history but i refrained because i knew you had never done any harm and i thought it cruel that you should be dishonoured by your misfortunes in a relation where you were usefully and prosperously placed and soand so i didnt but perhaps i was wrong yes i was wrong i have only allowed the burden to fall more heavily upon you at last  it was respite for lemuel to have some one else accusing himself and he did not refuse to enjoy it he left the minister to wring all the bitterness he could for himself out of his final responsibility the drowning man strangles his rescuer  sewell looked up and loosened his collar as if really stifling well well we must find some way out of it i will seesee what can be done for you tomorrow  lemuel recognised his dismissal if you say so mr sewell i will go straight back and tell mrs harmon all about it  sewell rose too nono there is no such haste you had better leave it to me now i will see to itin the morning  thank you said lemuel i hate to give you so much trouble  oh said sewell letting him out at the streetdoor and putting probably less thought and meaning into the polite words than they had ever contained before its no trouble  he went upstairs to his study and found mrs sewell waiting there well nowwhat david  now what he feebly echoed  yes what has that wretched creature come for now  you may well call him a wretched creature sighed sewell  is he really engaged has he come to get you to marry him  i think hed rather have me bury him at present sewell sat down and bracing his elbow on his desk rested his head heavily on his hand  well said his wife with a touch of compassion tempering her curiosity  he began to tell her what had happened and he did not spare himself in the statement of the case there you have the whole affair now and a very pretty affair it is but i declare he concluded i cant see that any one is to blame for it  no one david  well adam finally of course or eve or the serpent replied the desperate man  seeing him at this reckless pass his wife forebore reproach and asked what are you going to do  i am going around there in the morning to tell mrs harmon all about barker  she will send him away instantly  i dare say  and what will the poor thing do  goodness knows  im afraid badness knows it will drive him to despair  well perhaps notperhaps not sighed the minister at any rate we must not let him be driven to despair you must help me lucy  of course  mrs sewell was a good woman and she liked to make her husband feel it keenly  i knew that it must come to that she said  of course we must not let him be ruined if mrs harmon insists upon his going at onceas ive no doubt she willyou must bring him here and we must keep him till he can find some other home she waited and added for a final stroke of merciless beneficence he can have alfreds room and alf can take the front attic  sewell only sighed again he knew she did not mean this  barker went back to the st albans and shrunk into as small space in the office as he could he pulled a book before him and pretended to read hiding the side of his face toward the door with the hand that supported his head his hand was cold as ice and it seemed to him as if his head were in a flame williams came and looked in at him once and then went back to the stool which he occupied just outside the elevatorshaft when not running it he whistled softly between his teeth with intervals of respectful silence and then went on whistling in absence of any whom it might offend  suddenly a muffled clamour made itself heard from the depths of the diningroom like that noise of voices which is heard behind the scenes at the theatre when an armed mob is about to burst upon the stage irish tones high windy and angry yells and oaths defined themselves and mrs harmon came obesely hurrying from the dining room toward the office closely followed by jerry the porter when upon duty or as some of the boarders contended when in the right humour he blacked the boots and made the hardcoal fires and carried the trunks up and down stairs when in the wrong humour he had sometimes been heard to swear at mrs harmon but she had excused him in this eccentricity because she said he had been with her so long those who excused it with her on these grounds conjectured arrears of wages as another reason for her patience his outbreaks of bad temper had the celtic uncertainty the most innocent touch excited them as sometimes the broadest snub failed to do so and no one could foretell what direction his zigzag fury would take he had disliked lemuel from the first and had chafed at the subordination into which he had necessarily fallen he was now yelling after mrs harmon to know if she was not satisfied with wan gutthersnoipe that she must nades go and pick up another and whether the new wan was going to be too good to take prisints of money for his worruk from the boarthers and put all the rest of the help under the caumpliment of refusin ut or else demanin themselves by takin ut if this was the case hed have her to know that she couldnt kape anny other help and the quicker she found it out the betther mrs harmon was trying to appease him by promising to see lemuel at once and ask him about it  the porter raised his voice an octave d ye think im a loyar domn ye dont ye think im tellin the thruth  he followed her to the little office whither she had retreated on a purely mechanical fulfilment of her promise to speak to lemuel and crowded in upon them there  here he is now he roared in his frenzy hes too good to take the money thats offered to um hes too good to be waither he wannts to play the gintleman he thinks umself too good to do what the other servants do thats been tin times as lahng in the house  at the noise some of the ladies came hurrying out of the public parlour to see what the trouble was the streetdoor opened and berry entered with the two artstudents they involuntarily joined the group of terrified ladies  whats the row demanded berry is jerry on the kick  no one answered lemuel stood pale and silent fronting the porter who was shaking his fist in his face he had not heard anything definite in the outrage that assailed him he only conjectured that it was exposure of williamss character and the story of his own career in boston  why dont you fire him out of there barker called the law student dont be afraid of him  lemuel remained motionless but his glance sought the pitying eyes of the assembled women and then dropped before the amaze that looked at him from those of miss carver the porter kept roaring out his infamies  berry spoke again  mrs harmon do you want that fellow in there  no goodness knows i dont mr berry  all right berry swung the streetdoor open with his left hand and seemed with the same gesture to lay his clutch upon the porters collar fire him out myself he exclaimed and with a few swiftly successive jerks and bumps the burly shape of the porter was shot into the night i want you to get me an officer jerry he said putting his head out after him theres been a blackguard makin a row here never mind your hat go  oh my good gracious mr berry gasped mrs harmon what have you done if its back pay mrs harmon well pass round the hat dont you be troubled that fellow wasnt fit to be in a decent house  berry stopped a moment and looked at lemuel the artstudents did not look at him at all they passed on upstairs with berry  the other ladies remained to question and to comment mrs harmons nephew to whom the uproar seemed to have penetrated in his basement came up and heard the story from them he was quite decided he said that mr berry had done right he said that he was tired of having folks damn his aunt up hill and down dale and that if jerry had kept on a great deal longer he would have said something to him himself about it  the ladies justified him in the stand he took they returned to the parlour to talk it all over and he went back to his basement mrs harmon in tears retired to her room and lemuel was left standing alone in his office the mate stole softly to him from the background of the elevator where he had kept himself in safety during the outbreak  look here mate this thing been about your ringin me in here  oh go away go away lemuel huskily entreated  well thats what i intend to do i dont want to stay here and git you into no more trouble and i know thats whats been done you never done me no harm and i dont want to do you none im goin right up to your room to git my cloes and then ill skip  it wont do any good now itll only make it worse youd better stay now you must  well if you say so mate  he went back to his elevator and lemuel sat down at his desk and dropped his face upon his arms there toward eleven oclock evans came in and looked at him but without speaking he must have concluded that he was asleep he went upstairs but after a while he came down again and stopped again at the office door and looked in on the haggard boy hesitating as if for the best words barker mr berry has been telling me about your difficulty here i know all about youfrom mr sewell lemuel stared at him and i will stand your friend whatever people think and i dont blame you for not wanting to be beaten by that ruffian you could have stood no chance against him and if you had thrashed him it wouldnt have been a great triumph  i wish he had killed me said lemuel from his dustdry throat  oh no thats foolish said the elder with patient sad kindness who knows whether death is the end of trouble we must live things down not die them down he put his arm caressingly across the boys shoulder  i can never live this down said lemuel he added passionately i wish i could die  no said evans you must cheer up think of next saturday it will soon be here and then youll be astonished that you felt so bad on tuesday  he gave lemuel a parting pressure with his arm and turned to go upstairs  at the same moment the figure of mrs harmons nephew distracted violent burst up through the door leading to the basement  good heavens exclaimed the editor is mr harmon going to kick  the house is on fire yelled the apparition  a thick cloud of smoke gushed out of the elevatorshaft and poured into the hall which it seemed to fill instantly it grew denser and in another instant a wild hubbub began the people appeared from every quarter and ran into the street where some of the ladies began calling up at the windows to those who were still in their rooms a stout little old lady came to an open window and paid out hand over hand a small cable on which she meant to descend to the pavement she had carried this rope about with her many years against the exigency to which she was now applying it within the halls and the stairway became the scene of frantic encounter between wives and husbands rushing down to save themselves and then rushing back to save their forgotten friends many appeared in the simple white in which they had left their beds with the addition of such shawls or rugs as chance suggested a house was opened to the fugitives on the other side of the street and the crowd that had collected could not repress its applause when one of them escaped from the hoteldoor and shot across it applauded impartially men women and children and absorbed in the spectacle no one sounded the firealarm the department began to be severely condemned among the bystanders before the engines appeared  most of the ladies in their escape or their purpose of rescue tried each to possess herself of lemuel and keep him solely in her interest mr barker mr barker mr barker was called for in various sopranos and contraltos till an outsider took up the cry and shouted barker barker speech speech this made him very popular with the crowd who in their enjoyment of the fugitives were unable to regard the fire seriously a momentary diversion was caused by an elderly gentleman who came to the hoteldoor completely dressed except that he was in his stockings and demanded jerry the humourist who had called for a speech from lemuel volunteered the statement that jerry had just gone round the corner to see a man i want him said the old gentleman savagely i want my boots i cant go about in my stockings  cries for jerry followed but in fact the porter had forgotten all his grudges and enmities he had reappeared in perfect temper and had joined lemuel and berry in helping to get the women and children out of the burning house  the police had set a guard at the door in whom lemuel recognised the friendly old officer who had arrested him all out asked the policeman  the smoke which had reddened and reddened was now a thin veil drawn over the volume of flame that burned strongly and steadily up the well of the elevator and darted its tongues out to lick the framework without the heat was intense mrs harmon came panting and weeping from the diningroom with some unimportant pieces of silver driven forward by jerry and her nephew  they met the firemen come at last and pulling in their hose who began to play upon the flames the steam filled the place with a dense mist  lemuel heard berry ask him through the fog barker wheres old evans  oh i dont know he lamented back  he must have gone up to get mrs evans  he made a dash towards the stairs a fireman caught him and pulled him back you cant go up smokes thick as hell up there but lemuel pulled away and shot up the stairs he heard the firemen stop berry  you cant go i tell you whos runnin this fire anyway id like to know  he ran along the corridor which evanss apartment opened upon there was not much smoke there it had drawn up the elevatorwell as if in a chimney  he burst into the apartment and ran to the inner room where he had once caught a glimpse of mrs evans sitting by the window  evans stood leaning against the wall with his hand at his breast he panted help herhelp  where is she where is she demanded lemuel  she came from an alcove in the room holding a handkerchief drenched with cologne in her hand which she passed to her husbands face are you better now can you come dear rest on me  imim all right gogo i can get along  ill go when you go said mrs evans she turned to lemuel mr evans fainted but he is better now she took his hand with a tender tranquillity that ignored all danger or even excitement and gently chafed it  but comecome cried lemuel dont you know the house is on fire  yes i know it she replied we must get mr evans down you must help me lemuel had seldom seen her before but he had so long heard and talked of her hopeless invalidism that she was like one risen from the dead in her sudden strength and courage and he stared at the miracle of her restoration it was she who claimed and bore the greater share of the burden in getting her husband away he was helpless but in the open air he caught his breath more fully and at last could tremulously find his way out of the sympathetic crowd get a carriage she said to lemuel and then she added as it drove up and she gave an address i can manage him now  evans weakly pressed lemuels hand from the seat to which he had helped him and the hack drove away lemuel looked crazily after it a moment and then returned to the burning house  berry called to him from the top of the outside steps barker have you seen that partner of yours  lemuel ran up to him no  well come in here the elevators dropped and theyre afraid he went down with it  i know he didnt he wouldnt be such a fool  well well know when they get the fire under  i thought i saw something in the elevator and as long as you dont know where he is said a fireman  well said berry if youve got the upper hands of this thing im going to my room a minute  lemuel followed him upstairs to see if he could find williams the steam had ascended and filled the upper halls little cascades of water poured down the stairs falling from step to step the long strips of carpeting in the corridors swam in the deluge which the hose had poured into the building and a rain of heavy drops burst through the ceilings  most of the roomdoors stood open as the people had flung them wide in their rush for life at the door of berrys room a figure appeared which he promptly seized by the throat  dont be in a hurry he said as he pushed it into the room i want to see you  it was williams  i want to see what youve got in your pockets hold on to him barker  lemuel had no choice he held williams by the arms while berry went through him as he called the search he found upon him whatever small articles of value there had been in his room  the thief submitted without a struggle without a murmur  berry turned scornfully to lemuel this a friend of yours mr barker  still the thief did not speak but he looked at lemuel  yes he dryly gasped  well said berry staring fiercely at him for a moment if it wasnt for something old evans said to me about you a little while ago id hand you both over to the police  williams seemed to bear the threat with philosophic resignation but lemuel shrank back in terror berry laughed  why you are his pal go along ill get jerry to attend to you  lemuel slunk downstairs with williams look here mate said the rogue i guess i hant used you just right  lemuel expected himself to cast the thief off with bitter rejection but he heard himself saying hopelessly go away and try to behave yourself and then he saw the thief make the most of the favour of heaven and vanish through the crowd  he would have liked to steal away too but he remained and began mechanically helping again wherever he saw help needed by and by berry came out lemuel thought that he would tell some policeman to arrest him but he went away without speaking to any one  in an hour the firemen had finished their share of the havoc and had saved the building they had kept the fire to the elevatorshaft and the adjoining woodwork and but for the water they had poured into the place the ladies might have returned to their rooms which were quite untouched by the flames as it was lemuel joined with jerry in fetching such things to them as their needs or fancies suggested the refugees across the way were finally clothed by their efforts and were able to quit their covert indistinguishable in dress from any of the other boarders  the crowd began to go about its business the engines had disappeared from the little street with exultant shrieks in the morning the insurance companies would send their workmen to sweep out the extinct volcano and mop up the shrunken deluge preparatory to ascertaining the extent of the damage done in the meantime the police kept the boys and loafers out of the building and the order that begins to establish itself as soon as chaos is confessed took possession of the ruin  but it was all the same a ruin and a calamitous conclusion for the time being the place that had been in its grotesque and insufficient fashion a home for so many homeless people was uninhabitable even the harmons could not go back to it the boarders had all scattered but mrs harmon lingered dwelling volubly upon the scene of disaster she did not do much else she was not without a just pride in it but she was not puffed up by all the sympathy and consolation that had been offered her she thought of others in the midst of her own troubles and she said to lemuel who had remained working with jerry under her direction in putting together such things as she felt she must take away with her  well i dont know as i feel much worse about myself than i do about poor mr evans why ive got the ticket in my pocket now that he gave me for the wednesday matinee i do wonder how hes gettin along i guess theyve got you to thank if theyre alive to tell the tale what did you do to get that woman out alive lemuel looked blankly at her and did not answer and mr evans too you must have had your hands full and thats what i told the reporters but i told em i guessed youd be equal to it if any one would why i dont suppose mrs evans has been out of her room for a month or hardly stepped her foot to the floor well i dont want to see many people look as he did when you first got him out of the house  well i dont know as i want to see many more fires where i live said her nephew as if with the wish to be a little more accurate  jerry asked lemuel to watch mrs harmons goods while he went for a carriage and said sir to him it seemed to lemuel that this respect and mrs harmons unmerited praises together with the doom that was secretly upon him would drive him wild     xxiv   the evening after the fire mrs sewell sat talking it over with her husband in the light of the newspaper reports which made very much more of lemuels part in it than she liked the reporters had flattered the popular love of the heroic in using mrs harmons version of his exploits and represented him as having been most efficient and daring throughout and especially so in regard to the evanses  well that doesnt differ materially from what they told us themselves said sewell  you know very well david retorted his wife that there couldnt have been the least danger at any time and when he helped her to get mr evans downstairs the fire was nearly all out  very well then he would have saved their lives if it had been necessary it was a case of potential heroism that contained all the elements of selfsacrifice  mrs sewell could not deny this but she was not satisfied she was silent a moment before she asked what do you suppose that wretched creature will do now  i think very likely he will come to me answered sewell  i dare say the bell rang and i suppose thats he now  they listened and heard miss vanes voice at the door asking for them  mrs sewell ran down the stairs and kissed her oh im so glad you came isnt it wonderful ive just come from them and shes taking the whole care of him as if he had always been the sick one and she strong and well  what do you mean lucy he isnt ill  who isnt  what are you talking about  about mr evans  oh said miss vane with cold toleration she arrived at the study door and gave sewell her hand i scarcely knew him you know i only met him casually here ive come to see she added nervously if you know where lemuel is mr sewell have you seen anything of him since the fire how nobly he behaved but i never saw anything he wasnt equal to  mrs sewell objects to his saving human life said sewell not able to deny himself  i dont see how you can take the slightest interest in him began mrs sewell saying a little more than she meant  you would my dear returned miss vane if you had wronged him as i have  or as i said sewell  im thankful i havent then said his wife it seems to me that theres nothing else of him as to his noble behaviour it isnt possible you believe those newspaper accounts he didnt save any ones life there was no danger  miss vane preoccupied with her own ideal of the facts stared at her without replying and then turned to sewell  i want to find him and ask him to stay with me till he can get something else to do sewells eyebrows arched themselves involuntarily sibyl has gone to new york for a fortnight i shall be quite alone in the house and i shall be very glad of his company she explained to the eyebrows while ignoring them her chin quivered a little as she added i shall be proud of his company i wish him to understand that he is my guest  i suppose i shall see him soon said sewell and i will give him your message  will you tell him persisted miss vane a little hysterically that if he is in any way embarrassed i insist upon his coming to me immediatelyat once  sewell smiled yes  i know that im rather ridiculous said miss vane smiling in sympathy and i dont blame mrs sewell for not entering into my feelings nobody could who hadnt felt the peculiar lemuel glamour  i dont imagine hes embarrassed in any way said sewell he seems to have the gift of lighting on his feet but ill tell him how peremptory you are miss vane  well upon my word cried mrs sewell when miss vane had taken leave of them in an exaltation precluding every recurrent attempt to enlighten her as to the true proportions of lemuels part in the fire i really believe people like to be made fools of why didnt you tell her david that he had done nothing  what would have been the use she has her own theory of the affair besides he did do something he did his duty and my experience is that its no small thing to do it wasnt his fault that he didnt do more  he waited some days for lemuel to come to him and he inquired each time he went to see the evanses if they knew where he was but they had not heard of him since the night of the fire  its his shyness said evans i can understand how if he thought he had put me under an obligation he wouldnt come near meand couldnt  evans was to go out of town for a little while the proprietors of the saturday afternoon insisted upon his taking a rest and they behaved handsomely about his salary he did not want to go but his wife got him away finally after he had failed in two or three attempts at writing  lemuel did not appear to sewell till the evening of the day when the evanses left town it seemed as if he had waited till they were gone so that he could not be urged to visit them at first the minister scolded him a little for his neglect but lemuel said he had heard about them and knew they were getting along all right he looked as if he had not been getting along very well himself his face was thin and had an air at once dogged and apprehensive he abruptly left talking of evans and said i dont know as you heard what happened that night before the fire just after i got back from your house  no i hadnt  lemuel stopped then he related briefly and cleanly the whole affair sewell interrupting him from time to time with murmurs of sympathy and tchk tchk tchk and shocking shocking at the end he said i had hoped somehow that the general calamity had swallowed up your particular trouble in it though i dont know that general calamities ever do that with particular troubles he added more to himself than to lemuel and he put the idea away for some future sermon  mr evans stopped and said something to me that night he said we had to live things down and not die them down he wanted i should wait till saturday before i was sure that i couldnt get through tuesday he said how did we know that death was the end of trouble  yes said the minister with a smile of fondness for his friend that was like evans all over  i shant forget those things said lemuel theyve been in my head ever since if it hadnt been for them i dont know what i should have done  he stopped and after a moments inattention sewell perceived that he wished to be asked something more i hope he said that nothing more has been going wrong with you and as he asked this he laid his hand affectionately on the young mans shoulder just as evans had done lemuels eyes dimmed and his breath thickened what has become of the personthe discharged convict  i guess i had better tell you he said and he told him of the adventure with berry and williams  sewell listened in silence and then seemed quite at a loss what to say but lemuel saw that he was deeply afflicted at last he asked lifting his eyes anxiously to sewells do you think i did wrong to say the thief was a friend of mine and get him off that way  thats a very difficult question sighed sewell you had a duty to society  yes ive thought of that since  if i had been in your place im afraid i should be glad not to have thought of it in time and im afraid im glad that as it is its too late but doesnt it involve you with him in the eyes of the other young man yes i presume it does said lemuel i shall have to go away  back to willoughby pastures asked sewell with not so much faith in that panacea for lemuels troubles as he had once had  no to some other town do you know of anything i could get to do in new york  oh no no said the minister you neednt let this banish you we must seek this young mr  berry  mr berry out and explain the matter to him  then youll have to tell him all about me  yes why not  lemuel was silent and looked down  in the meantime pursued the minister i have a message for you from miss vane she has heard as we all have of your behaviour during the fire  it wasnt anything lemuel interrupted there wasnt the least danger and mrs evans did it all herself anyway it made me sick to see how the papers had it its a shame  sewell smiled im afraid you couldnt make miss vane think so but i can understand what you mean she has never felt quite easy about the waythe termson which she parted with you she has spoken to me several times of it andahexpressed her regret and now knowing that you have beeninterrupted in your life she is anxious to have you come to her  an angry flash lighted up lemuels face  i couldnt go back there i wouldnt do any such work again  i dont mean that sewell hastened to say miss vane wished me to ask you to come as her guest until you could find somethingmiss sibyl vane has gone to new york  im very much obliged to her said lemuel but i shouldnt want to give her so much trouble or any one ii liked her very much and i shouldnt want she should think i didnt appreciate her invitation  i will tell her said the minister i had no great hope you would see your way to accepting it but she will be glad to know that you received it he added rather interrogatively than affirmatively in the right spirit  oh yes said lemuel please to tell her i did  thank you said sewell with bland vagueness i dont know that ive asked yet where you are staying at present  im at mrs nashs 13 canary place mrs harmon went there first  oh and are you looking forward to rejoining her in a new place  i dont know as i am i dont know as i should want to go into an hotel again  sewell manifested a little embarrassment well you wont forget your promise to let me be of use to youpecuniarily if you should be in need of a small advance at any time  oh no but ive got enough money for a while yettill i can get something to do he rose and after a moments hesitation he said i dont know as i want you should say anything to that fellow about me to mr berry i mean  oh certainly not said sewell if you dont wish it  whatever it was in that reticent and elusive soul which prompted his request the minister now felt that he could not know but perhaps the pang that lemuel inflicted on himself had as much transport as anguish in it he believed that he had for ever cut himself off from the companionship that seemed highest and holiest on earth to him he should never see that girl again berry must have told miss swan and long before this miss carver had shuddered at the thought of him as the accomplice of a thief but he proudly said to himself that he must let it all go for if he had not been a thief he had been a beggar and a menial he had come out of a hovel at home and his mother went about like a scarecrow and it mattered little what kind of shame she remembered him in  he thought of her perpetually now and in those dialogues which we hold in reverie with the people we think much about he talked with her all day long at first when he began to do this it seemed a wrong to statira but now since the other was lost to him beyond other approach he gave himself freely up to the mystical colloquies he held with her as the devotee abandons himself to imagined converse with a saint besides if he was in love with statira he was not in love with jessie that he had made clear to himself for his feeling toward her was wholly different  most of the time in these communings he was with her in her own home down at corbitant where he fancied she had gone after the catastrophe at the st albans and he sat there with her on a porch at the front door which she had once described to him and looked out under the silver poplars at the vessels in the bay he formed himself some image of it all from pictures of the seaside which he had seen and there were times when he tried to go back with her into the life she had led there as a child perhaps his ardent guesses at this were as near reality as anything that could be made to appear for after her mother and brothers and sisters had died out of the wide old house her existence there was as lonely as if she had been a little ghost haunting it she had inherited her mothers temperament with her fathers constitution she was the child born to his last long absence at sea and her mothers last solitude at home when he returned he found his wife dead and his maiden sister caring for the child in the desolate house  this sister of captain carvers had been disappointed as the phrase is when a young girl another girl had won her lover from her her disappointment had hardened her to the perception of the neighbours and by a strange perversion of the sympathies and faculties she had turned from gossip and censure from religion and from all the sources of comfort that the bruised heart of corbitant naturally turned to and found such consolation as came to her in books that is to say romances and especially the romances that celebrated and deified such sorrow as her own she had been a pretty little thing when young and jessie remembered her as pretty in her early old age at heart she must still have been young when her hair was grey for she made a friend and companion of the child and they fed upon her romances together when the aunt died the child who had known no mother but her was stricken with a grief so deep and wild that at first her life and then her mind was feared for to get her away from the associations and influences of the place her father sent her to school in the western part of the state where she met madeline swan and formed one of those friendships which are like passions between young girls during her long absence her father married again and she was called home to his deathbed he was dead when she arrived he had left a will that made her dependent on her stepmother when madeline swan wrote to announce that she was coming to boston to study art jessie carver had no trouble in arranging with her stepmother by the sacrifice of her final claim on her fathers estate to join her friend there with a little sum of money on which she was to live till she should begin to earn something  her life had been a series of romantic episodes madeline said that if it could be written out it would be fascinating but she went to work very practically and worked hard she had not much feeling for colour but she drew better than her friend and what she hoped to do was to learn to illustrate books  one evening after a day of bittersweet reveries of jessie lemuel went to see statira she and manda grier were both very gay and made him very welcome they had tea for him statira tried all her little arts and manda grier told some things that had happened in the boxfactory he could not help laughing at them they were really very funny but he felt somehow that it was all a preparation for something else at last the two girls made a set at him as manda grier called it and tried to talk him into their old scheme of going to wait on table at some of the country hotels or the seaside they urged that now while he was out of a place it was just the time to look up a chance  he refused at first kindly and at last angrily and he would have gone away in this mood if statira had not said that she would never say another word to him about it and hung upon his neck while manda grier looked on in sullen resentment he came away sick and heavy at heart he said to himself that they would be willing to drag him into the mire they had no pride they had no sense they did not know anything and they could not learn he tried to get away from them to miss carver in his thoughts but the place where he had left her was vacant and he could not conjure her back out of the void he was haunted by a look of grieving reproach and wonder from her eyes     xxv   that evening sewell went to see an old parishioner of his who lived on the hill and who among his eccentricities had the habit of occupying his city house all summer long while his family flitted with other people of fashion to the seashore that year they talked of taking a cottage for the first time since they had sold their own cottage at nahant in a day of narrow things now past the ladies urged that he ought to come with them and not think of staying in boston now that he had a trouble of the eyes which had befallen him and boston would be so dull if he could not get about freely and read as usual  he answered that he would rather be blind in boston than telescopic at beverly or any other summer resort and that as for the want of proper care which they urged he did not think he should lack in his own house if they left him where he could reach a bell his youngest daughter a lively little blonde laughed with a cousin of his wifes who was present and his wife decorously despaired the discussion of the topic was rather premature for they were not thinking of going to beverly before middle of may if they took the cottage but an accident had precipitated it and they were having it out as people do each party in the hope that the other would yield if kept at long enough before the time of final decision came  do you think said the husband and father who looked a whimsical tyrant at the worst but was probably no easier to manage for his whimsicality that i am going to fly in the face of prosperity and begin to do as other people wish because im pecuniarily able to do as i please  the little blonde rose decisively from the low chair where she had been sitting if papa has begun to reason about it we may as well yield the point for the present mamma come lily let us leave him to cousin charles  oh but i say cried cousin charles if im to stay and fight it out with him ive got to know which side im on  youre on the right side said the young lady over her shoulder you always are cousin charles  cousin charles in the attempt to kiss his hand toward his flatterer pulled his glasses off his nose by their cord bromfield he said i dont see but this commits me against you and then the ladies having withdrawn the two men put on that business air with which our sex tries to atone to itself for having unbent to the lighter minds of the other heaven knows what women do when the men with whom they have been talking go away  if you should happen to stay in town continued the cousin treacherously i shall be very glad for i dont know but i shall be here the greater part of the summer myself  i shall stay said the other but there wont be anything casual about it  what do you hear from tom asked the cousin feeling about on the mantel for a match he was a fullbodied handsome amiablelooking old fellow whose breath came in quick sighs with this light exertion he had a blond complexion and what was left of his hair a sort of ethereal down on the top of his head and some cherished fringes at the temples was turning the yellowish grey that blond hair becomes  the other gentleman stretched at ease in a deep chair with one leg propped on a cricket had the distinction of long forms which the years had left in their youthful gracility his snowwhite moustache had been allowed to droop over the handsome mouth whose teeth were beginning to go theyre on the other side of the clock he said referring to the matches he added with another glance at his relative charles you ought to bant its beginning to affect your wind  beginning your memorys going bromfield but they say theres a new system that allows you to eat everything im waiting for that in the meantime ive gone back to my baccy  theyve cut mine off sighed the other doesnt it affect your heart  not a bit but what do you do now you cant smoke and your eyes have given out  i bore myself i had a letter from tom yesterday said the sufferer returning to the question that his cousins obesity had diverted him from hes coming on in the summer  toms a lucky fellow said the cousin i wish you had insisted on my taking some of that stock of his when you bought in  yes you made a great mistake said the other with whimsical superiority you should have taken my advice you would now be rolling in riches as i am with a much better figure for it  the cousin smoked a while do you know i think toms about the best fellow i ever knew  hes a good boy said the other with the accent of a fathers pride and tenderness  going to bring his pretty chickens and their dam asked the cousin parting his coatskirts to the genial influence of the fire  no its a short visit theyre going into the virginia mountains for the summer a manservant came in and said something in a low voice heigh what why of course certainly by all means show him in come in parson come in called the host to his yet unseen visitor and he held out his hand for sewell to take when he appeared at the door glad to see you i cant get upa little gouty todaybut bellinghams on foot his difficulty is sitting down  bellingham gave the minister a nearsighted mans glare through his glasses and then came eagerly forward and shook hands oh mr sewell i hope youve come to put up some job on corey dont spare him with kanawha paint co at the present figures he merits any demand that christian charity can make upon him the mans prosperity is disgraceful  im glad to find you here mr bellingham said sewell sitting down  oh is it doublebarrelled pleaded bellingham  i dont know that its a deadly weapon of any kind returned the minister but if one of you cant help me perhaps the other can  well let us know what the job is said corey we refuse to commit ourselves beforehand  i shall have to begin at the beginning said sewell warningly and the beginning is a long way off  no matter said bellingham adventurously the further off the better ive been dining with coreyhe gives you a very good dinner now corey doesand im just in the mood for a deserving case  the trouble with sewell is said corey that he doesnt always take the trouble to have them deserving i hope this is interesting at least  i suspect youll find it more interesting than i shall said the minister inwardly preparing himself for the amusement which lemuels history always created in his hearers it seemed to him as he began that he was always telling this story and that his part in the affair was always becoming less and less respectable no point was lost upon his hearers they laughed till the ladies in the drawingroom above wondered what the joke could be  at any rate said bellingham the fellow behaved magnificently at the fire i read the accounts of it  i think his exploits owe something to the imagination of the reporters said sewell he tells a different story himself  oh of course said bellingham  well and what else asked corey  there isnt any more simply hes out of work and wants something to doanything to doanything that isnt menial  ah thats a queer start of his said bellingham thoughtfully i dont know but i like that  and do you come to such effete posterity as we are for help in a case like that demanded corey why the boys an ancestor  so he is why so he isso he is said bellingham with delight in the discovery of course he is  all you have to do pursued corey is to give him time and hell found a fortune and a family and his childrens children will be cutting ours in society half of our great people have come up in that way look at the bluebook where our nobility is enrolled its the apotheosis of farmboys mechanics insidemen and i dont know what  but in the meantime this ancestor is now so remote that he has nothing to do suggested sewell if you give him time you kill him  well what do you want me to do mrs corey is thinking of setting up a buttons but you say this boy has a soul above buttons and besides hes too old  yes  look here bromfield said bellingham why dont you get him to read to you  corey glanced from his cousin to the minister whose face betrayed that this was precisely what he had had in his own mind  is that the job asked corey  sewell nodded boldly  he would read through his nose wouldnt he i couldnt stand that ive stopped talking through mine you know  why look here bromfield said bellingham for the second time why dont you let me manage this affair for you im not of much use in the world but from time to time i like to do my poor best and this is just one of the kind of things i think im fitted for i should like to see this young man when i read in the newspapers of some fellow who has done a fine thing i always want to see what manner of man he is and im glad of any chance that throws him in my way  your foibles notorious charles but i dont see why you keep my cigars all to yourself said corey  my dear fellow said bellingham making a hospitable offer of the cigarbox from the mantel you said theyd cut you off  ah so they have i forgot well whats your plan  my plan said bellingham is to have him to breakfast with me and interview him generally and get him to read me a few passages without rousing his suspicions heigh  i dont know that i believe much in your plan said corey i should like to hear what my spiritual adviser has to say  i shouldnt know what to advise exactly said sewell but i wont reject any plan that gives my client a chance  isnt client rather euphuistic asked corey  it is rather but ive got into the habit of handling barker very delicately even in thought im not sure hell come added sewell turning to bellingham  oh yes he will said bellingham tell him its business there wont be anybody there will nine be too late for him  i imagine hes more accustomed to halfpast five at home and seven here  well well say nine anyway i cant imagine the cause that would get me up earlier here he turned to the mantel and wrote an invitation upon his card and handed it to sewell please give him that from me and beg him to come i really want to see him and if he cant read well enough for this fastidious old gentleman well see what else he can do corey tells me he expects tom on this summer he concluded in dismissal of lemuel as a topic  ah said sewell putting the card in his pocket im very glad to hear that  he had something but not so much of the difficulty in overcoming lemuels reluctance that he had feared and on the morning named lemuel presented himself at the address on bellinghams card exactly at nine he had the card in his hand and he gave it to the man who opened the street door of the bachelors apartment house where bellingham lived the man read it carefully over and then said oh yes second floor and handing it back left lemuel to wander upstairs alone he was going to offer the card again at bellinghams door but he had a dawning misgiving bellingham had opened the door himself and feigning to regard the card as offered by way of introduction he gave his hand cordially and led him into the cozy room where the table was already laid for breakfast  glad to see you glad to see you mr barker give me your coat ah i see you scorn the effeminacy of halfseason things put your hat anywhere the advantage of bachelors quarters is that you can put anything anywhere we havent a woman on the premises and you can fancy how unmolested we are  lemuel had caught sight of one over the mantel who had nothing but her watercolours on and was called an etude but he no longer trembled for evil or for good in such presences thats one of those romanospanish things said bellingham catching the direction of his eye i forget the fellows name but it isnt bad were pretty snug here he added throwing open two doors in succession to show the extent of his apartment  here you have the diningroom and drawingroom and library in one and heres my bedroom and heres my bath  he pulled an easychair up toward the low fire for lemuel but perhaps youre hot from walking sit wherever you like  lemuel chose to sit by the window its very mild out he said and bellingham did not exact anything more of him he talked at him and left lemuel to make his mental inventory of the dense turkey rugs on the slippery hardwood floor the pictures on the avails the deep leatherlined seats the bricabrac on the mantel the tall coloured chests of drawers in two corners the delicate china and quaint silver on the table  presently steps were heard outside and bellingham threw open the door as he had to lemuel and gave a hand to each of the two guests whom he met on his threshold  ah meredith good morning venerable father he drew them in let me introduce you to mr barker mr meredith mr barker the rev mr seyton you fellows are pretty prompt  were pretty hungry said mr meredith i dont know that we should have got here if we hadnt leaned up against each other as we came along several policemen regarded us suspiciously but seytons cloth protected us  it was terrible coming up beacon street with an old offender like meredith at what he considered the dead hour of the night said mr seyton i dont know what i should have done if any one had been awake to see us  you shall have breakfast instantly said bellingham touching an annunciator and awakening a distant electric titter somewhere  mr seyton came toward lemuel who took the young ritualist for a catholic priest but was not proof against the sweet friendliness which charmed every one with him and was soon talking at more ease than he had felt from all bellinghams cordial intention he was put at his hosts right hand when they sat down and mr seyton was given the foot so that they continued their talk  mr bellingham tells me you know my friend sewell said the clergyman  lemuels face kindled oh yes do you know him too  yes ive known him a long time hes a capital fellow sewell is  i think hes a great preacher ventured lemuel  ahwellyes is he ive never heard him lecture said mr seyton looking down at his bread  i swear seyton said meredith across the table when you put on that ecclesiastical superciliousness of yours i want to cuff you  ive no doubt hed receive it in a proper spirit said bellingham who was eating himself hot and red from the planked shad before him but you mustnt do it here  of course said mr seyton sewell is a very able man and no end of a good fellow but you cant expect me to admit hes a priest  he smiled in sweet enjoyment of his friends wrath lemuel observed that he spoke with an accent different from the others which he thought very pleasant but he did not know it for that neat utterance which the anglican church bestows upon its servants  hes no jesuit growled meredith  im bound to say hes not a pagan either laughed the clergyman  these gentlemen exchange these little knocks bellingham explained to lemuels somewhat puzzled look because they were boys together at school and college and cant realise that theyve grown up to be lights of the bar and the pulpit he looked round at the different plates have some more shad no one wanted more it seemed and bellingham sent it away by the man who replaced it with broiled chicken before bellingham and lamb chops in front of mr seyton this is all there is the host said  its enough for me said meredith if no one else takes anything  but in fact there was also an omelet and bread and butter delicious beyond anything that lemuel had tasted and there was a bouquet of pink radishes with fragments of ice dropped among olives and other facts of a polite breakfast at the close came a dish of what bellingham called premature strawberries  why theyre actually sweet said meredith and theyre as natural as emerybags  yes theyre all you say said bellingham you can have strawberries any time nowadays after new years if you send far enough for them but to get them ripe and sound or distinguishable from small turnips in taste is another thing  lemuel had never imagined a breakfast like that he wondered at himself for having respected the cuisine of the st albans it seemed to him that he and the person he had beenthe farmboy the captive of the police the guest of the wayfarers lodge the servant of miss vane and the headwaiter at the hotelcould not be the same person he fell into a strange reverie while the talk in which he had shared so little took a range far beyond him then he looked up and found all the others eyes upon him and heard bellingham saying i fancy mr barker can tell us something about that and at lemuels mystified stare he added about the amount of smoke at a fire that a man could fight through mr seyton was speaking of the train that was caught in the forest fires down in maine the other day how was it with you at the st albans  lemuel blushed it was clear that mr bellingham had been reading that ridiculous newspaper version of his exploit there was hardly any smoke at all where i was it didnt seem to have got into the upper entries much  thats just what i was saying triumphed bellingham if a man has anything to do he can get on thats the way with the firemen its the ratinatrap idea that paralyses do you remember your sensations at all when you were coming through the fire those things are very curious sometimes bellingham suggested  there was no fire where i was said lemuel stoutly but helpless to make a more comprehensive disclaimer  i imagine you wouldnt notice that any more than the smoke said bellingham with a look of satisfaction in his hero for his other guests its a sort of ecstasy do you remember that fellow of bret hartes in how christmas came to simpsons bar who gets a shot in his leg or something when hes riding to get the sick boy a christmas present and doesnt know it till he drops off his horse in a faint when he gets back he jumped actively up from the table and found the book on his shelf there he fumbled for his glasses without finding them will you be kind enough to read the passage mr barker i think ive found the page its marked he sat down again and the others waited  lemuel read as he needs must and he did his best  ah thats very nice glad you didnt dramatise it the drama ought to be in the words not the reader i like your quiet way  harte seems to have been about the last of the storytellers to give us the great simple heroes said seyton  when the others were gone and lemuel who had been afraid to go first rose to take himself away bellingham shook his hand cordially and said i hope you werent bored the fact is i rather promised myself a têteàtête with you and i told mr sewell so but i fell in with seyton and meredith yesterdayyou cant help falling in with one when you fall in with the other theyre inseparable when seytons in town and i couldnt resist the temptation to ask them  oh no i wasnt bored at all said lemuel  im very glad butsit down a moment i want to speak to you about a little matter of business mr sewell was telling us something of you the other night at my cousin bromfield coreys and it occurred to me that you might be willing to come and read to him his eyes seem to be on the wane some way and hes rather sleepless hed give you a bed and sometimes youd have to read to him in the night youd take your meals where you like how does it strike you supposing the harnsome pittance can be arranged  why if you think i can do it began lemuel  of course i do you dont happen to read french  lemuel shook his head hopelessly i studied latin some at school  ah well i dont think hed care for latin i think wed better stick to english for the present  bellingham arranged for lemuel to go with him that afternoon to his cousins and make as he phrased it a stagger at the job     xxvi   the stagger seemed to be sufficiently satisfactory corey could not repress some twinges at certain characteristics of lemuels accent but he seemed in a critical way to take a fancy to him and he was conditionally installed for a week  corey was pleased from the beginning with lemuels good looks and justified himself to his wife with an italian proverb novanta su cento chi è bello difuori ê buono di dentro she had heard that proverb before and she had always considered it shocking but he insisted that most people married upon no better grounds and that what sufficed in the choice of a husband or wife was enough for the choice of an intellectual nurse he corrected lemuels pronunciation where he found it faulty and amused himself with lemuels struggles to conceal his hurt vanity and his final good sense in profiting by the correction but lemuels reading was really very good it was what even more than his writing had given him a literary reputation in willoughby pastures and the old man made him exercise it in widely different directions chiefly however it was novels that he read which indeed are the chief reading of most people in our time and as they were necessarily the novels of our language his elder was not obliged to use that care in choosing them which he must have exacted of himself in the fiction of other tongues he liked to hear lemuel talk and he used the art of getting at the boys life by being frank with his own experience but this was not always successful and he was interested to find lemuel keeping doors that sewells narrative had opened carefully closed against him he betrayed no consciousness that they existed and lemuel maintained intact the dignity and pride which come from the sense of ignominy well hidden  the week of probation had passed without interrupting their relation and lemuel was regularly installed and began to lead a life which was so cut off from his past in most things that it seemed to belie it he found himself dropped in the midst of luxury stranger to him than the things they read of in those innumerable novels the dull rich colours in the walls and the heavily rugged floors and darkwooded leathern seats of the library where he read to the old man the beautiful forms of the famous bronzes and the italian saints and martyrs in their baroque or gothic frames of dim gold the low shelves with their ranks of luxurious bindings and all the seriously elegant keeping of the place flattered him out of his strangeness and the footing on which he was received in this house the lowvoiced respect with which the manservant treated him the masters light cordial frankness the distant graciousness of the mistress and the unembarrassed unembarrassing kindliness of the young ladies both so much older than himself contributed to an effect that afterwards deepened more and more and became a vital part of the struggle which he was finally to hold with himself the first two or three days he saw no one but mr corey and but for the womens voices in the other parts of the house he might have supposed himself in another bachelors apartments finer and grander than bellinghams he was presented to mrs corey when she came into the library but he did not see the daughters of the house till he was installed in it after that his acquaintance with them seemed to go no further they were all polite and kind when they met him in the library or on the stairs but they showed no curiosity about him and his never meeting them at table helped to keep him a stranger to them under the same roof he ate at a boardinghouse in a neighbouring street but he slept at the coreys after he had read their father asleep and then going out to his late breakfast he did not return till mr corey had eaten his own much later  he wondered at first that neither of those young ladies read to their father not knowing the disability for mutual help that riches bring later he saw how much miss lily corey was engrossed with charity and art and how constantly miss nannie corey was occupied with social cares and was perpetually going and coming in their performance then he saw that they could not have rendered nor their father have received from his family the duty which he was paid to do as they must have done if they had been poorer but they were all fond of one another and the father had a way of joking with his daughters especially the youngest and they talked with a freedom of themselves which puzzled lemuel it appeared from what they said at different times that they had not always been so rich or that they had once had money and then less and now much more it appeared also that their prosperity was due to a piece of luck and that the young mr corey whom they expected in the summer had brought it about his father was very proud of him and getting more and more used to lemuels companionship he talked a great deal about his tom as he called him and about toms wife and his wifes family who were somehow lemuel inferred not all that his own family could wish them but very good people once when mr corey was talking of them mrs corey came in upon them and seemed to be uneasy as if she thought he was saying too much but the daughters did not seem to care especially the youngest  he found out that mr corey used to be a painter and had lived a long time in italy when he was young and he recalled with a voluptuous thrill of secrecy that williams had once been in italy mr corey seemed to think better of it than williams he liked to talk of rome and florence and of venice which williams had said was a kind of hole the old man said this or that picture was of this or that school and vague lights of knowledge and senses of difference that flattered lemuels intellectual vanity stole in upon him he began to feel that the things mr corey had lived for were the great and high objects of life  he now perceived how far from really fine or fashionable anything at the st albans had been and that the simplicity of miss vanes little house which the splendour of the hotel had eclipsed in his crude fancy was much more in harmony with the richness of mr coreys he oriented himself anew and got another view of the world which he had dropped into occasionally he had glimpses of people who came to see the coreys and it puzzled him that this family which he knew so kind and good took with others the tone hard and even cynical which seemed the prevailing tone of society when their acquaintances went away they dropped back as if with relief into their sincere and amiable fashions of speech lemuel asked himself if every one in the world was playing a part it did not seem to him that miss carver had been she was always the same and always herself to be onesself appeared to him the best thing in the world and he longed for it the more as he felt that he too was insensibly beginning to play a part being so much in this beautiful and luxurious house where every one was so well dressed and well mannered and well kept in body and mind and passing from his amazement at all its appointments into the habit of its comfortable beauty he forgot more and more the humility and the humiliations of his past he did not forget its claims upon him he sent home every week the greater part of his earnings and he wrote often to his mother but now when he could have got the time to go home and see her he did not go in the exquisite taste of his present environment he could scarcely believe in that figure grizzled leathern and gaunt and costumed in a grotesque unlikeness to either sex sometimes he played with the fantastic supposition of some other origin for himself romantic and involved like that of some of the heroes he was always reading of which excluded her  another effect of this multifarious literature through which his duties led him was the awakening of the ambition to write stunned by his first disastrous adventures in boston and dormant almost ever since except as it had stirred under the promptings of evanss kindly interest but now it did not take the form of verse he began to write moralistic essays never finished but full of severe comment on the folly of the world as he saw it sometimes they were examinations of himself and his ideas and principles his doctrines and practice penetrating quests such as the theologians of an earlier day used to address to their consciences  meantime the deeply underlying mass of his rustic crudity and raw youth took on a far higher polish than it had yet worn words dropped at random in the talk he now heard supplied him with motives and shaped his actions once mr bellingham came in laughing about a sign which he saw in a back street of misfit parlours and lemuel spent the next weeks salary for a suit at a large clothing store to replace the dress sewell had thought him so well in he began insensibly to ape the manners of those about him  it drew near the time when the ladies of the corey family were to leave town where they had lingered much longer than they meant in the hope that mr corey might be so much better or so much worse that he would consent to go to the shore with them but his disabilities remained much the same and his inveterate habits indomitable by this time that trust in lemuel which never failed to grow up in those near him reconciled the ladies to the obstinate resolution of the master of the house to stay in it as usual they gave up the notion of a cottage and they were not going far away nor for long at any one time in fact one or other of them was always in the house mrs corey had grown into the habit of confidence with lemuel concerning her husbands whims and foibles and this motherly frankness from a lady so stately and distant at first was a flattery more poisonous to his soul than any other circumstance of his changed life  it came july and even sewell went away then he went with a mind at rest concerning lemuels material prospects and his unquestionable usefulness and acceptability but something at the bottom of his satisfaction teased him still a dumb fear that the boy was extravagant a sense that he was somehow different and not wholly for the better from what he had been he had seen perhaps nothing worse in him than that growth of manner which amused corey  he is putting us on he said to bellingham one day and making us fit as well as he can i dont think were altogether becoming but thats our fault probably i cant help thinking that if we were of better cut and material we should show to better effect upon that granite soul i wish tom were here ive an idea that tom would fit him like a glove charles why dont you pose as a model for barker  i dont see why im not a very good model without posing said bellingham what do you want me to do for him take him to the club barkers not very conversational  you dont take him on the right topics said corey not minding that he had left the point i assure you that barker on any serious question that comes up in our reading has a clear head and an apt tongue of his own it isnt our manners alone that he emulates i cant find that any of us ever dropped an idea or suggestion of value that barker didnt pick it up and turn it to much more account than the owner hes as true as a tuscan peasant as proud as an indian and as quick as a yankee  ah i hoped you wouldnt go abroad for that last said bellingham  no and its delightful seeing the great variety of human nature there is in every human being here our life isnt stratified perhaps it never will be at any rate for the present were all in vertical sections but i always go back to my first notion of barker hes ancestral and he makes me feel like degenerate posterity ive had the same sensation with tom but barker seems to go a little further back i suppose theres such a thing as getting too far back in these origin of species days but he isnt excessive in that or in anything hes confoundedly temperate in fact and hes reticent he doesnt allow any unseemly intimacy hes always turning me outofdoors  of course but what can we old fellows hope to know of whats going on in any young one talk of strangeness id undertake to find more in common with a florid old fellow of fifty from the red planet mars than with any young bostonian of twenty  yes but its the youth of my sires that i find so strange in barker only theoretically theres no puritanism hes a thorough believer in sewell i suspect he could formulate sewells theology a great deal better than sewell could     xxvii   statira and manda grier had given up their plan of getting places in a summer hotel when lemuel absolutely refused to take part in it and were working through the summer in the boxfactory lemuel came less regularly to see them now for his sunday nights had to be at mr coreys disposition but statira was always happy in his coming and made him more excuses than he had thought of if he had let a longer interval than usual pass he could not help feeling the loveliness of her patience the sweetness of her constancy but he disliked manda grier more and more and she grew stiffer and sharper with him sometimes the aimlessness of his relation to statira hung round him like a cloud which he could not see beyond when he was with her he contented himself with the pleasure he felt in her devotion and the tenderness this awakened in his own heart but when he was away from her there was a strange disgust and bitterness in these  sometimes when statira and manda grier took a saturday afternoon off he went with them into the country on one of the horsecar lines or else to some matinee at a gardentheatre in the suburbs statira liked the theatre better than anything else and she used to meet other girls whom she knew there and had a gay time she introduced lemuel to them and after a few moments of high civility and distance they treated him familiarly as statiras beau their talk after that he was now used to was flat and foolish and their pert ease incensed him he came away bruised and burning and feeling himself unfit to breathe the refined and gentle air to which he returned in mr coreys presence then he would vow in his heart never to expose himself to such things again but he could not tell statira that he despised the friends she was happy with he could only go with a reluctance it was not easy to hide and atone by greater tenderness for a manner that wounded her one day toward the end of august when they were together at a suburban theatre statira wandered off to a pond there was in the grounds with some other girls who had asked him to go and row them and had called him a bear for refusing and told him to look out for barnum they left him sitting alone with manda grier at a table where they had all been having icecream at his expense and though it was no longer any pleasure to be with her it was better than to be with them for she was not a fool at any rate statira turned round at a little distance to mock them with a gesture and a laugh and the laugh ended in a cough long and shattering so that one of her companions had to stop with her and put her arm round her till she could recover herself and go on  it sent a cold thrill through lemuel and then he turned angry what is it statira does to keep taking more cold  oh i guess taint ny more cold said manda grier  what do you mean  i guess f you cared a great deal youd noticed that cough f hers before now taint done it any too much good workin in that arsenic paper all summer long  manda grier talked with her face turned away from him  it provoked him more and more i do care he retorted eager to quarrel and you know it who got her into the box factory i should like to know  i did said manda grier turning sharply on him and you kept her there and between us weve killed her  how have i kept her there i should like to know  f youd dones she wanted you should she might a been at some pleasant place in the countrythe mountns or somewhere t shed been ovr her cough by this time but no you was too nasty proud for that lemuel barker  a heavy load of guilt dropped upon lemuels heart but he flung it off and he retorted furiously  you ought to have been ashamed of yourself to ever want her to take a servants place  oh a servants place if shed been ashamed of a servant when you came meechin round her whered you been i shd like to know and now i wish she had n if she want such a little fool n all wrapped in you the way t she is i could wish t shed never set eyes on you again servant or no servant but i presume its too late now and i presume shes got to go on suffrin for you and wonderin what shes done to offend you when you dont come and what shes done when you do with your stuckup masterful airs and your doublefaced ways but dont you try to pretend to me lemuel barker t you care the least mite for her any more f you ever did because it wont go down n if stira want such a perfect little blind fool she could see t you didnt care for her any more than the ground t you walk on n t youd be glad enough if she was under it if you couldnt be rid of her any other way manda grier pulled her handkerchief out and began to cry into it  lemuel was powerfully shaken by this attack he did feel responsible for statiras staying in town all summer but the spectacle of manda grier publicly crying at his side in a place like that helped to counteract the effect of her words sh dont cry he began looking fearfully round him everybody ll see you  i dont care let them sobbed the girl if they knowed what i know and could see you not cryin i guess theyd think you looked worse than i do  you dont understandi can explain  no you cant explain mr barker said manda grier whipping down her handkerchief and fiercely confronting him across the table you cant explain anything so s to blind me any longer i was a big fool to ever suppose you had any heart in you but when you came round at first and was so meek you couldnt say your soul was your own and was so glad if stira spoke to you or looked at you that you was ready to go crazy i did suppose there was some little something to you and yes i helped you on all i could and helped you to fool that poor thing that you aint worthy to kiss the ground she walks on lord forgive me for it but its all changed now you seem to think its the greatest favour if you come round once a fortnight and set and let her talk to you and show you how she dotes upon you the poor little silly coot and if you ever speak a word its like the lord unto moses its so grand but i understand youve got other friends now you after that artstudent oh you can blush and try to turn it off ive seen you blush before and i know you and i know youre in love with that girl and youre just waitin to break off with stira but you haint got the spirit to up and do it like a man you want to let it lag along and lag along and see f something wont happen to get you out of it you waitin for her to die well you wont have to wait long but if i was a man id spoil your beauty for you first  the torrent of her words rolled him on bruising and tearing his soul which their truth pierced like jagged points from time to time he opened his lips to protest or deny but no words came and in his silence a fury of scorn for the poor faithful scolding thing so just so wildly unjust gathered head in him  be still he ground between his teeth be still you he stopped for the word and that saved him from the outrage he had meant to pay her back with he rose from the table you can tell statira what youve said to me im going home  he rushed away the anger was like strong drink in his brain he was like one drunk all the way back to the city in the car  he could not go to mr coreys at once he felt as if physically besmeared with shame he could not go to his boardinghouse it would have been as if he had shown himself there in a coat of tar and feathers those insolent true degrading words hissed in his ears and stung him incessantly they accused they condemned with pitiless iteration and yet there were instants when he knew himself guiltless of all the wrong of which in another sense he knew himself guilty in his room he renewed the battle within himself that he had fought so long in his wanderings up and down the street and he conquered himself at last into the theory that statira had authorised or permitted manda grier to talk to him in that way this simplified the whole affair it offered him the release which he now knew he had longed for as he stretched himself in the sheets at daybreak he told himself that he need never see either of them again he was free     xxviii   lemuel went through the next day in that licence of revolt which every human soul has experienced in some measure at some time we look back at it afterwards and see it a hideous bondage but for the moment lemuel rejoiced in it and he abandoned himself boldly to thoughts that had hitherto been a furtive and trembling rapture  in the afternoon when he was most at leisure he walked down to the public garden and found a seat on a bench near the fountain where the venus had shocked his inexperience the first time he saw her he remembered that simple boy with a smile of pity and then went back into his cloud of reverie there safely hid from trouble and wrong he told his ideal how dear she was to him and how she had shaped and governed his life and made it better and nobler from the first moment they had met the fumes of the romances which he had read mixed with the loveborn delirium in his brain he was no longer low but a hero of lofty line kept from his rightful place by machinations that had failed at last and now he was leading her his bride into the ancient halls which were to be their home and the source of beneficence and hope to all the poor and humblyborn around them his eyes were so full of this fantastic vision the soul of his youth dwelt so deeply within this dreambuilt tabernacle that it was with a shock of anguish he saw coming up the walk towards him the young girl herself his airy structure fell in ruins around him he was again common and immeasurably beneath her she was again in her own world where if she thought of him at all it must be as a squalid vagabond and the accomplice of a thief if he could have escaped he would but he could not move he sat still and waited with fallen eyes for her to pass him  at sight of him she hesitated and wavered then she came towards him and at a second impulse held out her hand smiling with a radiant pleasure  i didnt know it was you at first she said it seems so strange to see any one that i know  i didnt expect to see you either he stammered out getting somehow upon his feet and taking her hand while his face burned and he could not keep his eyes on hers ididnt know you were here  ive only been here a few days im drawing at the museum ive just got back have you been here all summer  yesall summer i hope youve been welli suppose youve been away  yes ive just got back she repeated  oh yes i meant that  she smiled at his confusion as kindly as the ideal of his daydream ive been spending the summer with madeline and ive spent most of it outofdoors sketching have you been well  yesnot very oh yes im well she had begun to move forward with the last question and he found himself walking with her did shehas miss swan come back with you he asked looking her in the eyes with more question than he had put into his words  no i dont think shell come back this winter said the girl you know she went on colouring a little that shes married now  no said lemuel  yes to mr berry and i have a letter from him for you  was he there with you this summer asked lemuel ignoring alike berrys marriage and the letter from him  oh yes of course and i liked him better than i used to he is very good and if madeline didnt have to go so far west to live he will know how to appreciate her and there are not many who can do that her father thinks he has a great deal of ability yes if madeline had to get married  she talked as if convincing and consoling herself and there was an accent of loneliness in it all that pierced lemuels preoccupation he had hardly noted how almost pathetically glad she was to see him youll miss her here he ventured  oh i dont dare to think of it cried the girl i dont know what i shall do when i first saw you just now it brought up madeline and last winter so that it seemed too much to bear  they had walked out of the garden across charles street and were climbing the slope of beacon street mall in the common i suppose she continued the only way will be to work harder and try to forget it they wanted me to go out and stay with them but of course i couldnt i shall work and i shall read i shall not find another madeline swan you must have been reading a great deal this summer mr barker she said in turning upon him from her bereavement have you seen any of the old boarders or mrs harmon i shall never have another winter like that at the poor old st albans  lemuel made what answer he could there was happiness enough in merely being with her to have counterbalanced all the pain he was suffering and when she made him partner of her interests and associations and appealed to their common memories in confidence of his sympathy his heavy heart stirred with strange joy he had supposed that berry must have warned her against him but she was treating him as if he had not perhaps he had not and perhaps he had done so and this was her way of showing that she did not believe it he tried to think so he knew it was a subterfuge but he lingered in it with a fleeting fearful pleasure they had crossed from the common and were walking up under the lindens of chestnut street and from time to time they stopped in the earnestness of their parley and stood talking and then loitered on again in the summer security from oversight which they were too rapt to recognise they reached the top of the hill and came to a door where she stopped he fell back a pace goodbye it was eternal loss but it was escape  she smiled in timorous hesitation wont you come in and i will get mr berrys letter  she opened the door with a latchkey and he followed her within a servantgirl came halfway up the basement stairs to see who it was and then went down she left him in the dim parlour a moment while she went to get the letter when she returned i have a little room for my work at the top of the house she said but it will never be like the st albans theres no one else here yet and its pretty lonesomewithout madeline  she sank into a chair but he remained standing and seemed not to heed her when she asked him to sit down he put berrys letter into his pocket without looking at it and she rose again  she must have thought he was going and she said with a smile of gentle trust its been like having last winter back again to see you we thought you must have gone home right after the fire we didnt see anything of you again we went ourselves in about a week  then she did not know and he must tell her himself  did mr berry say anything about meat the firethat last day he began bluntly  no she said looking at him with surprise there was a new sound in his voice he had no need to say anything i wanted to tell youto write and tell youhow much i honoured you for ithow ashamed i was for misunderstanding you just before when  he knew that she meant when they all pitied him for a coward  her voice trembled he could tell that the tears were in her eyes he tried to put the sweetness of her praise from him oh it wasnt that that i meant he groaned and he wrenched the words out that fellow who said he was a friend of mine and got into the house that way was a thief and mr berry caught him robbing his room the day of the fire and treated me as if i knew it and was helping him on  oh cried the girl how cruel how could he do that  lemuel could not suffer himself to take refuge in her generous faith now  when i first came to boston i had my money stolen and there were two days when i had nothing to eat and then i was arrested by mistake for stealing a girls satchel and when i was acquitted i slept the next night in the tramps lodginghouse and that fellow was there and when he came to the st albans i was ashamed to tell where i had known him and so i let him pass himself off for my friend  he kept his eyes fixed on hers but he could not see them change from their pity of him or light up with a sense of any squalor in his history  and i used to think that my life had been hard she cried oh how much you have been through  and after that he pursued mr sewell got me a place a sort of servants place and when i lost that i came to be the manofall work at the st albans  in her eyes the pity was changing to admiration his confession which he had meant to be so abject had kindled her fancy like a boastful tale  how little we know about people and what they have suffered but i thank you for telling me thisoh yesand i shall always think of myself with contempt how easy and pleasant my life has been and you  she stopped and he stood helpless against her misconception he told her about the poverty he had left at home and the wretched circumstance of his life but she could not see it as anything but honourable to his present endeavour she listened with breathless interest to it all and well she sighed at last it will always be something for you to look back to and be proud of and that girldid she never say or do anything to show that she was sorry for that cruel mistake did you ever see her afterwards  yes said lemuel sick at heart and feeling how much more triumphantly he could have borne ignominy and rejection than this sweet sympathy  she seemed to think he would say something more but he turned away from her and after a little silence of expectance she let him go with promises to come again which she seemed to win from him for his own sake  in the street he took out berrys letter and read it  dear old manive been trying to get off a letter to you almost any time the last three months but ive been round so much and upside down so much since i saw youout to w t and on my head in western massthat ive not been able to fetch it i dont know as i could fetch it now if it wasnt for the prospective mrs a w b jr standing over me with a revolver and waiting to see me do it ive just been telling her about that little interview of ours with williams that day and she thinks i ought to be man enough to write and say that i guess i was all wrong about you i had a sneaking idea of the kind from the start almost but if a fellows proud at all hes proud of his mistakes and he hates to give them up im pretty badly balled up now and i cant seem to get the right words about remorse and so forth but you know how it is yourself i am sorry theres no two ways about that but ive kept my suspicions as well as my regrets to myself and now i do the best thing i can by way of reparation i send this letter by miss carver she hasnt read it and she dont know what its all about but i guess youd better tell her dont spare yours truly a w berry jr  the letter did not soften lemuel at all towards berry and he was bitterly proud that he had spoken without this bidding though he had seemed to speak to no end that he had expected after a while he lost himself in his daydreams again and in the fantastic future which he built up this became a great source of comfort to him and to his ideal now he parted with her in sublime renunciation and now he triumphed over all the obstacles between them but whatever turn he willed his fortunes to take she still praised him and he prided himself that he had shown himself at his worst to her of his own free impulse sewell praised him for it in his reverie mr corey and mr bellingham both made him delicate compliments upon his noble behaviour which he feigned had somehow become known to them     xxix   at the usual hour he was at mr coreys house where he arrived footsore and empty from supperless wanderings but not hungry and not weary the servingman at the door met him with the message that mr corey had gone to dine at his club and would not be at home till late he gave lemuel a letter which had all the greater effect from being presented to him on the little silver tray employed to bring up the cards and notes of the visitors and correspondents of the family the envelope was stamped in that ephemeral taste which configured the stationery of a few years ago with the lines of alligator leather and it exhaled a perfume so characteristic that it seemed to breathe statira visibly before him he knew this far better than the poor scrawly uncultivated handwriting which he had seen so little he took the letter and turning from the door read it by the light of the next street lamp  dear lemuelmanda grier has told me what she said to you and ime about crazy about it dear lem i want you should come and see mee o lem you dont suppose i could of let manda grier talk to you that way if i had of none it but of course you dident only do say so i give her a real good goen over and she says shes sory she done it i dont want any body should care for mee without itse there free will but i shall alwayes care for you if you dont care for me dont come but if you do care i want you should come as soon as ever you can i can explane everything manda grier dident mean anything but for the best but sometimes she dont know what she is sayin o lem you mussent be mad but if you are and you dont want to come ennymore dont come but o i hope you wouldent let such a thing set you againste mee recollect that i never done or said anything to set you against me  statira  a cruel disgust mingled with the remorse that this letter brought him its illiteracy made him ashamed and the helpless fondness it expressed was like a millstone hanged about his neck he felt the deadly burden of it drag him down  a passerby on the other side of the street coughed slightly in the night air and a thought flashed through lemuel from which he cowered as if he had found himself lifting his hand against anothers life  his impulse was to turn and run but there was no escape on any side it seemed to him that he was like that prisoner he had read of who saw the walls of his cell slowly closing together upon him and drawing nearer and nearer till they should crush him between them the inexperience of youth denies it perspective in that season of fleeting and unsubstantial joys of feverish hopes despair wholly darkens a world which after years find full of chances and expedients  if mr sewell had been in town there might have been some hope through him or if mr evans were there or even if berry were at hand it would be some one to advise with to open his heart to in his extremity he walked down into bolingbroke street knowing well that mr sewell was not at home but pretending to himself after the fashion of the young that if he should see a light in his house it would be a sign that all should come out right with him and if not it would come out wrong he would not let himself lift his eyes to the house front till he arrived before it when he looked his heart stood still a light streamed bright and strong from the drawingroom window  he hurried across the street and rang and after some delay in which the person coming to the door took time to light the gas in the hall mr sewell himself opened to him they stood confronted in mutual amazement and then sewell said with a cordiality which he did not keep free from reluctance ohmr barker come in come in but after they had shaken hands and lemuel had come in he stood there in the hall with him and did not offer to take him up to his study im so glad to have this glimpse of you how in the world did you happen to come  i was passing and saw the light said lemuel  sewell laughed to be sure we never have any idea how far our little candle throws its beams im just here for the night on my way from the mountains to the sea im to be the supply in a friends pulpit at new bedford and im here quite alone in the house scrambling a sermon together but im so glad to see you youre well i hope youre looking a little thin but thats no harm do you enjoy your life with mr corey i was sure you would when you come to know him you will find him one of the best of menkindly thoughtful and sympathetic ive felt very comfortable about your being with him whenever ive thought of you and you may be sure that ive thought of you often what about our friends of the st albans do you see mrs harmon you knew the evanses had gone to europe  yes i got a letter from him yesterday  he didnt pick up so fast as they hoped and he concluded to try the voyage i hear very good accounts of him he said he was going to write you well and mr corey is well he smiled more beamingly upon lemuel who felt that he wished him to go and stood haplessly trying to get away  in the midst of his own uneasiness sewell noted lemuels is there anythingsomethingyou wished to speak with me about  no no not anything in particular i just saw the light and  sewell took his hand and wrung it with affection  it was so good of you to run in and see me dont fancy its been any disturbance id got into rather a dim place in my work but since ive been standing here with youha ha ha those things do happen so curiouslythe whole thing has become perfectly luminous im delighted youre getting on so nicely give my love to mr corey i shall see you soon again we shall all be back in a little over a fortnight glad of this moment with you if its only a moment goodbye  he wrung lemuels hand again this time in perfect sincerity and eagerly shut him out into the night  the dim place had not become so luminous to him as it had to the minister a darkness which the obscurity of the night faintly typified closed round him pierced by one ray only and from this he tried to turn his face it was the gleam that lights up every labyrinth where our feet wander and stumble but it is not always easy to know it from those false lights of feeblehearted pity of mocksacrifice of sick conscience which dance before us to betray to worse misery yet  some sense of this broken and faltering reached lemuel where he stood and tried to deal faithfully with his problem in that one steadfast ray he saw that whatever he did he must not do it for himself but what his duty was he could not make out he knew now if he had not known before that whatever his feeling for statira was he had not released himself from her and it seemed to him that he could not release himself by any concern for his own advantage that notion with which he had so long played her insufficiency for his life now and for the needs of his mind hereafter revealed itself in its real cruelty the things that mr sewell had said that his mother had said that berry had said in what seemed a fatal succession and all to the same effect against throwing himself away upon some one inadequate to him at his best fell to the ground like withered leaves and the fire of that steadfast ray consumed them  but whom to turn to for counsel now the one friend in whom he had trusted to whom he had just gone ready to fling down his whole heart before him had failed him failed him unwittingly unwillingly as he had failed him once before but this time in infinitely greater stress he did not blame him now fiercely proudly as he had once blamed him but again he wandered up and down the city streets famished and outcast through his defection  it was late when he went home but mr corey had not yet returned and he had time to sit down and write the letter which he had decided to send to statira instead of going to see her it was not easy to write but after many attempts he wrote it  dear statirayou must not be troubled at what amanda said to me i assure you that although i was angry at first i am entirely willing to overlook it at your request she probably spoke hastily and i am now convinced that she spoke without your authority you must not think that i am provoked at you  i received your letter this evening and i will come to see you very soon lemuel barker  the letter was colder than he meant to make it but he felt that he must above all be honest and he did not see how he could honestly make it less cold when it came to statiras hands she read it silently to herself over and over again while her tears dripped upon it  manda grier was by and she watched her till she could bear the sight no longer she snatched the letter from the girls hands and ran it through and then she flung it on the ground nasty coldhearted stuckup shameless thing  oh dont manda dont manda sobbed statira and she plunged her face into the pillows of the bed where she sat  shameless coldhearted stuckup nasty thing said manda grier varying her denunciation in the repetition and apparently getting fresh satisfaction out of it in that way dont stira dudley if you was a womanif you was half a womanyoud never speak to that little corpseonice again  o manda dont call him names i cant bear to have you  names if you was anybody at all you wouldnt look at him you wouldnt think of him  o manda manda you know i cant let you talk so moaned statira  talk i could talk my head off you must not think i was provoked with you she mimicked lemuels dignity of diction in mincing falsetto i will come to see you very soon miserable worthless conceited whippersnapper  o manda youll break my heart if you go on so  well then give him up hes goin to give you up  oh he aint you know he aint hes just busy and i know hell come ill bet you hell be here tomorrow itll kill me to give him up  she had lifted herself from the pillow and she began to cough  hell kill you anyway cried manda grier in a passion of pity and remorse she ran across the room to get the medicine which statira had to take in these paroxysms there there take it i shant say anything more about him  and do you take it all back gasped statira holding the proffered spoon away  yes yes but do take your medcine stira f you dont want to die where you set  and do you think hell come  yes hell come  do you say it just to get me to take the medicine  no i really do believe hell come  o manda manda statira took her medicine and then wildly flung her arms round manda griers neck and began to sob and to cry there oh how hard i am with you manda i should think if i was as hard with everybody else theyd perfectly hate me  you hard  yes and thats why he hate me he does hate me you said he did  no stira i didnt you never was hard to anybody and the meanest old iceberg in creation couldnt hate you  then you think he does care for me  yes  and you know hell come soon  yes  tomorrow  yes tomorrow  omanda omanda     xxx   lemuel had promised himself that if he could gain a little time he should be able better to decide what it was right for him to do his heart lifted as he dropped the letter into the box and he went through the chapters which mr corey asked him to read after he came in with an ease incredible to himself in the morning he woke with a mind that was almost cheerful he had been honest in writing that letter and so far he had done right he should keep his word about going soon to see statira and that would be honest too he did not look beyond this decision and he felt as we all do more or less vaguely when we have resolved to do right that he had the merit of a good action  statira showed herself so glad to see him that he could not do less than seem to share her joy in their makingup as she called it though he insisted that there had been no quarrel between them and now there began for him a strange double life the fact of which each reader must reject or accept according to the witness of his own knowledge  he renewed as far as he could the old warmth of his feeling for statira and in his compunction experienced a tenderness for her that he had not known before the strange tenderness that some spirits feel for those they injure he went oftener than ever to see her he was very good to her and cheered her with his interest in all her little interests he petted her and comforted her but he escaped from her as soon as he could and when he shut her door behind him he shut her within it he made haste to forget her and to lose himself in thoughts that were never wholly absent even in her presence sometimes he went directly from her to jessie whose innocent bohemianism kept later hours and who was always glad to see him whenever he came she welcomed him with talk that they thought related wholly to the books they had been reading and to the things of deep psychological import which they suggested he seldom came to her without the excuse of a book to be lent or borrowed and he never quitted her without feeling inspired with the wish to know more and to be more he seemed to be lifted to purer and clearer regions of thought she received him in the parlour but their evenings commonly ended in her little studio whither some errand took them or some intrusion of the other boarders banished them there he read to her poems or long chapters out of the essayists or romancers or else they sat and talked about the strange things they had noticed in themselves that were like the things they found in their books once when they had talked a long while in this strain he told how when he first saw her he thought she was very proud and cold  she laughed gaily and i used to be afraid of you she said you used to be always reading there in your little office do you think im very proud now  are you very much afraid of me now he retorted  they laughed together  isnt it strange she said how little we really know about people in the world  yes he answered i wonder if it will ever be different ive been wrong about nearly every one ive met since i came to boston  and i have too she cried with that delight in the coincidence of experience which the young feel so keenly  he had got the habit with his growing ease in her presence of walking up and down the room while she sat with her arms lifted and clasped above her head forgetful of everything but the things they were saying and followed him with her eyes as he turned about in his walk he saw how pretty she was with her slender form cased in the black silk she wore and thrown into full relief by the lifted arms he saw the little hands knit above her head and white as flowers on her dark hair her eyes were very bright and her soft lips small and fine were red  he faltered and lost the thread of his speech i forgot what i was going to say  she took down her hands to clasp them over her laughing face a moment and i dont remember what you were saying they both laughed a long time at this it seemed incomparably droll and they became better comrades  they spent the rest of the evening in laughing and joking  i didnt know you were so fond of laughing he said when he went away  and i always supposed you were very solemn she replied  this again seemed the drollest thing in the world well i always was he said  and i dont know when ive laughed so much before she stood at the head of the stairs and held her lamp up for him to find his way down  again looking back he saw her in the undefended grace that had bewildered him before  when he came next they met very seriously but before the evening was past they were laughing together and so it happened now whenever he came they both said how strange it was that laughing with any one seemed to make you feel so much better acquainted she told of a girl at school that she had always disliked till one day something made them laugh and after that they became the greatest friends  he tried to think of some experience to match this but he could not he asked her if she did not think that you always felt a little gloomy after you had been laughing a great deal she said yes after that first night when they laughed so she felt so depressed that she was sure she was going to have bad news from madeline then she said she had received a letter from madeline that morning and she and mr berry had both wished her to give him their regards if she ever saw him this when she had said it seemed a very good joke too and they laughed at it a little consciously till he boldly bade her tell them he came so very seldom that she did not know when she could deliver their message  she answered that she was afraid madeline would not believe that and then it came out that he had never replied to berrys letter  she said oh is that the way you treat your correspondents and he was ashamed to confess that he had not forgiven berry  i will write to him tonight if you say so he answered hardily  oh you must do what you think best she said lightly refusing the responsibility  whatever you say will be best he said with a sudden passionate fervour that surprised himself  she tried to escape from it am i so infallible as that  you are for me he retorted  a silence followed which she endeavoured to break but she sat still across the little table from him where the shaded lamp spread its glow leaving the rest of the room with its red curtains and its sketches pinned about in a warm luxurious shadow her eyes fell and she did not speak  it must sound very strange to you i know he went on and its strange to me too but it seems to me that there isnt anything ive done without my thinking whether you would like me to do it  she rose involuntarily you make me ashamed to think that youre so much mistaken about me i know how we all influence each otheri know i always try to be what i think people expect me to bei cant be myselfi know what you mean but youyou must be yourself and not let she stopped in her wandering speech in strange agitation and he rose too  i hope youre not offended with me  offended why why do yougo so soon  i thought you were going he answered stupidly  why im at home  they looked at each other and then they broke into a happy laugh  sit down again i dont know what i got up for it must have been to make some tea did you know madeline had bequeathed me her tea kettlethe one we had at the st albans she bustled about and lit the spiritlamp under the kettle  blow out that match he cried youll set your dress on fire he caught her hand which she was holding with the lighted match in it at her side after the manner of women with lighted matches and blew it out himself  oh thank you she said indifferently can you take it without milk  yes i like it so  she got out two of the cups he remembered and he said how much like last winter that seems  and yes doesnt it she sighed  the lamp purred and fretted under the kettle and in the silence in which they waited the elm tree that rose from the pavement outside seemed to look in consciously upon them  when the kettle began to sing she poured out the two cups of tea and in handing him his their fingers touched and she gave a little outcry oh madelines precious cup i thought it was going to drop  the soft nightwind blew in through the elm leaves and their rustling seemed the expression of a profound repose an endless content     xxxi   the next night lemuel went to see statira without promising himself what he should say or do but if he were to tell her everything he felt that she would forgive him more easily than manda grier he was aware that manda always lay in wait for him to pierce him at every undefended hint of conscience since the first break with her there had never been peace between them and perhaps not kindness for long before that whether or not she felt responsible for having promoted statiras affair with him and therefore bound to guard her to the utmost from suffering by it she seemed always to be on the alert to seize any advantage against him sometimes statira accused her of trying to act so hatefully to him that he would never come any more she wildly blamed her but the faithful creature was none the less constant and vigilant on that account she took patiently the unjust reproaches which statira heaped upon her like a wayward child and remitted nothing of her suspicion or enmity towards lemuel once when she had been very bitter with him so bitter that it had ended in an open quarrel between them statira sided with him against her and when manda grier flounced out of the room she offered him if he wished to break with her and never to speak to her again or have anything more to do with such a person but at this his anger somehow fell and he said no she must not think of such a thing that manda grier had been her friend long before he was and that whatever she said to him she was always good and true to her then statira fell upon his neck and cried and praised him and said he was a million times more to her than manda grier but she would do whatever he said and he went away sick at heart  when he came now with his thoughts clinging to jessie manda grier hardly gave him time for the decencies of greeting she was in a high nervous exaltation and statira looked as if she had been crying  whats become o them artstudents you used to have t the st albans she began her whopperjaw twitching with excitement and her eyes glaring vindictively upon lemuel  he had sat down near statira on the lounge but she drew a little away from him in a provisional fashion as if she would first see what came of manda griers inquisition  artstudents he repeated aimlessly while he felt his colour go  yes she snapped them girls t used to be t the st albans t you thought so wonderful  i didnt know i thought they were very wonderful  cant you answer a civil question she demanded raising her voice  i havent heard any said lemuel with sullen scorn  oh well she sneered i forgot that youve ben used to goin with such fine folks that you cant bear to be spoken to in plain english  manda began statira with an incipient whimper  you be still stira dudley mr barker said the poor foolish thing in the mincing falsetto which she thought so cutting have you any idea whats become of your young lady artist friendsthem that took your portrait as a roman youth you know  lemuel made no answer whatever for a time then whether he judged it best to do so or was goaded to the defiance by manda griers manner he replied miss swan and miss carver miss swan is married and lives in wyoming territory now before he had reached the close of the sentence he had controlled himself sufficiently to be speaking quite calmly  oh indeed mr barker and may i ask where miss carver is she merried and living in wyoming territory too  no said lemuel quietly shes not married shes in boston  indeed then it was her i see in the garden today stira she ben back long mr barker  about a month i think said lemuel  quite a spell you seen her mr barker  yes quite often  i want to know she still paintin roman boys mr barker didnt seem to make any great out at it last winter but practice makes perfect they say i spose you seen her in the garden too  i usually see her at home said lemuel you probably receive your friends on the benches in the garden but young ladies prefer to have them call at their residences he astonished himself by this brutality he who was all gentleness with miss carver  very well mr barker thats all right thats all i wanted to know never mind about where i meet my friends wherever it is theyre gentlemen and they aint generally goin with three or four girls t the same time  no one like you would be enough retorted lemuel  statira sat cowering away from the quarrel and making little ineffectual starts as if to stay it heretofore their enmity had been covert if not tacit in her presence  lemuel saw her wavering and the wish to show manda his superior power triumphed over every other interest and impulse in him he got upon his feet there is no use in this sort of thing going on any longer i came here because i thought i was wanted if its a mistake its easy enough to mend it and its easy not to make it again i wish you good evening  statira sprang from the lounge and flung her arms around his neck no no you shant go you mustnt go lem i know your all right and i wont have you talked to so i aint a bit jealous lem indeed i aint i know you wouldnt fool with me any more than i would with you and thats what i tell manda grier ill leave it to her if i dont i dont care who you go with and i haint never since that first time i know you aint goin to do anything underhanded dont go lem oh dont go  he was pulling towards the door her trust her fond generosity drove him more than manda griers cutting tongue that hurt his pride his vanity but this pierced his soul he had only a blind stupid will to escape from it  statira was crying she began to cough she released his neck from her clasp and reeled backward to the lounge where she would have fallen if manda grier had not caught her the paroxysm grew more violent a bright stream of blood sprang from her lips  run run for the doctor quick lemuel oh quick implored manda grier forgetting all enmity in her terror  statiras arms wavered towards him as if to keep him but he turned and ran from the house cowed and consciencestricken by the sight of that blood as if he had shed it  he did not expect to see statira alive when he came back with the doctor whom he found at the next apothecarys she was lying on the lounge white as death but breathing quietly and her eyes sought him with an eagerness that turned to a look of tender gratitude at the look they found in his  the doctor bent over her for her pulse and her respiration then when he turned to examine the crimson handkerchief which manda grier showed him lemuel dropped on his knees beside her and put his face down to hers  with her lips against his cheek she made dont go  and he whispered no ill not leave you now  the doctor looked round with the handkerchief still in his hand as if doubting whether to order him away from her then he mutely questioned manda grier with a glance which her glance answered he shrugged his shoulders with a puzzled sigh an expression of pity crossed his face which he hardened into one of purely professional interest and he went on questioning manda grier in a low tone  statira had slipped her hand into lemuels and she held it fast as if in that clasp she were holding on to her chance of life     xxxii   sewell returned to town for the last time in the third week of september bringing his family with him  this was before the greater part of his oddly assorted congregation had thought of leaving the country either the rich cottagers whose family tradition or liberal opinions kept them in his church or the boarding and camping elements who were uniting a love of cheapness with a love of nature in their prolonged sojourn among the woods and fields certain families perhaps half of his parish in all were returning because the schools were opening and they must put their children into them and it was both to minister to the spiritual needs of these and to get his own children back to their studies that the minister was at home so early  it was as i have hinted already a difficult and laborious season with him he himself was always a little rusty in his vocation after his summers outing and felt weakened rather than strengthened by his rest the domestic machine started reluctantly there was a new cook to be got in and mrs sewell had to fight a battle with herself in which she invited him to share before she could settle down for the winter to the cares of housekeeping the wide skies the dim mountain slopes the long delicious drives the fresh mornings the sweet silvery afternoons of their idle country life haunted their nerves and enfeebled their wills  one evening in the first days of this moral disability while sewell sat at his desk trying to get himself together for a sermon barkers name was brought up to him  really said his wife who had transmitted it from the maid i think its time you protected yourself david you cant let this go on for ever he has been in boston nearly two years now he has regular employment where if theres anything in him at all he ought to prosper and improve without coming to you every other night what can he want now  im sure i dont know said the minister leaning back in his chair and passing his hand wearily over his forehead  then send down and excuse yourself tell him youre busy and ask him to come another time  ah you know i cant do that my dear  very well then i will go down and see him you shant be interrupted  would you my dear that would be very kind of you do get me off some way tell him im coming to see him very soon he went stupidly back to his writing without looking to see whether his wife had meant all she said and after a moments hesitation she descended in fulfilment of her promise or perhaps rather it was a threat  she met lemuel not unkindly for she was a kindhearted woman but she placed duty before charity even and she could not help making him feel that she was there in the discharge of a duty she explained that mr sewell was very unusually busy that evening and had sent her in his place and hoped soon to see him she bade lemuel sit down and he obeyed answering all the questions as to the summer and his occupations and health and his mothers health which she put to him in proof of her interest in him in further evidence of it she gave him an account of the sewell familys doings since they last met he did not stay long and she returned slowly and pensively to her husband  well he asked without looking round  well its all right she answered with rather a deep breath he didnt seem to have come for anything in particular i told him that if he wished specially to speak with you you would come down  sewell went on with his writing and after a moment his wife said but you must go and see him very soon david you must go to morrow  why  he looks wretchedly though he says hes very well it made my heart ache he looks perfectly wan and haggard i wish she burst out i wish i had let you go down and see him  whywhy what was the matter asked sewell turning about now did you think he had something on his mind  no but he looked fairly sick oh i wish he had never come into our lives  im afraid he hasnt got much good from us sighed the minister but ill go round and look him up in the morning his trouble will keep overnight if its a real trouble theres that comfort at least and now do go away my dear and leave me to my writing  mrs sewell looked at him but turned and left him apparently reserving whatever sermon she might have in her mind till he should have finished his  the next morning he went to inquire for lemuel at mr coreys the man was sending him away from the door with the fact merely that lemuel was not then in the house when the voice of mr corey descending the stairs called from within is that you sewell dont go away come in  the old gentleman took him into the library and confessed in a bit of new slang which he said was delightful that he was all balled up by lemuels leaving him and asked sewell what he supposed it meant  left you meant echoed sewell  when they got at each other it was understood that lemuel the day before had given up his employment with mr corey expressing a fit sense of all his kindness and a fit regret at leaving him but alleging no reasons for his course and that this was the first that sewell knew of the affair  it must have been that which he came to see me about last night he said with a sort of anticipative remorse mrs sewell saw him i was busy  well get him to come back sewell said mr corey with his whimsical imperiousness i cant get on without him all my moral and intellectual being has stopped like a watch  sewell went to the boardinghouse where lemuel took his meals but found that he no longer came there and had left no other address he knew nowhere else to ask and he went home to a day of latent trouble of mind which whenever it came to the light defined itself as helpless question and selfreproach in regard to barker  that evening as he sat at tea the maid came with the announcement that there was a person in the receptionroom who would not send in any name but wished to see mr sewell and would wait  sewell threw down his napkin and said ill bring him in to tea  mrs sewell did not resist she bade the girl lay another plate  sewell was so sure of finding lemuel in the receptionroom that he recoiled in dismay from the girlish figure that turned timidly from the window to meet him with a face thickly veiled he was vexed too here he knew from the mystery put on was one of those cases of feminine trouble real or unreal which he most disliked to meddle with  will you sit down he said as kindly as he could and the girl obeyed  i thought they would let me wait i didnt mean to interrupt you she began in a voice singularly gentle and unaffected  oh no matter cried sewell im very glad to see you  i thought you could help me im in great troubledoubt  the voice was almost childlike in its appealing innocence sewell sat down opposite the girl and bent sympathetically forward well  she waited a moment then i dont know how to begin she said hoarsely and stopped again  sewell was touched he forgot lemuel he forgot everything but the heartache which he divined before him and his christderived office his holy privilege of helping any in want of comfort or guidance perhaps he said in his loveliest waythe way that had won his wifes heart and that still provoked her severest criticism for its insincerity it was so purely impersonal perhaps that isnt necessary if you mean beginning at the beginning if youve any trouble that you think i can advise you in perhaps its better for both of us that i shouldnt know very much of it  yes murmured the girl questioningly  i mean that if you tell me much you will go away feeling that you have somehow parted with yourself that youre no longer in your own keeping but in mine and you know that in everything our help must really come from within our own free consciences  yes said the girl again from behind the veil which completely hid her face she now hesitated a long time she put her handkerchief under her veil and at last she said i know what you mean her voice quivered pathetically she tried to control it perhaps she whispered huskily after another interval i can put it in the form of a question  that would be best said sewell  she hesitated the tears fell down upon her hands behind her veil she no longer wiped them its because ive oftenheard you because i know you will tell me whats true and right  your own heart must do that said the minister but i will gladly help you all i can  she did not heed him now but continued as if rapt quite away from him  if there was some onesomethingif there was something that it would be right for you to doto have if there was no one else but if there were some else that had a right first she broke off and asked abruptly dont you think it is always right to prefer anotherthe interest of another to your own  sewell could not help smiling there is only one thing for us to do when we are in any doubt or perplexity he said cheerily and that is the unselfish thing  yes she gasped she seemed to be speaking to herself i saw it i knew it even if it kills us we must do it nothing ought to weigh against it oh i thank you  sewell was puzzled he felt dimly that she was thanking him for anguish and despair im afraid that i dont quite understand you  i thought i told you she answered with a certain reproach and a fall of courage in view of the fresh effort she must make it was some moments before she could say if you knew that some onesome one who waseverything to youand that you knewbelieved  at fifty it is hard to be serious about these things and it was well for the girl that she was no longer conscious of sewells mood  cared for you and if you knew that before he had cared for you there had been some elsesome else that he was as much to as he was to you and that couldnt give him up whatshould you  sewell fetched a long sigh of relief he had been afraid of a much darker problem than this he almost smiled  my dear childshe seemed but a child there before the mature man with her poor little lovetrouble so intricate and hopeless to her so simple and easy to himthat depends upon a great many circumstances  he could feel through her veil the surprise with which she turned to him you said whenever we are in doubt we must act unselfishly  yes i said that but you must first be sure what is really selfish  i know what is selfish in this case said the girl with a sublimity which if foolish was still sublimity she is sickit will kill her to lose himyou have said what i expected and i thank you thank you thank you and i will do it oh dont fear now but i shall i have done it no matter she went on in her exaltation no matter how much we care for each other now  no said sewell decidedly that doesnt follow i have thought of such things there was such a case within my experience oncehe could not help alleging this case in which he had long triumphed and i have always felt that i did right in advising against a romantic notion of selfsacrifice in such matters you may commit a greater wrong in that than in an act of apparent selfinterest you have not put the case fully before me and it isnt necessary that you should but if you contemplate any rash sacrifice i warn you against it  you said that we ought to act unselfishly  yes but you must beware of the refined selfishness which shrinks from righteous selfassertion because it is painful you must make sure of your real motive you must consider whether your sacrifice is not going to do more harm than good but why do you come to me with your trouble why dont you go to your fatheryour mother  i have none  ah  she had risen and pushed by him to the outer door though he tried to keep her dont be rash he urged i advise you to take time to think of this  she did not answer she seemed now only to wish to escape as if in terror of him  she pulled open the door and was gone  sewell went back to his tea bewildered confounded  whats the matter why didnt he come in to tea with you asked his wife  who  barker  what barker  david what is the matter  sewell started from his daze and glanced at his children ill tell you by and by lucy     xxxiii   a month passed and sewell heard nothing of lemuel his charge always elusive and evanescent had now completely vanished and he could find no trace of him mr corey suggested advertising bellingham said why not put it in the hands of a detective he said he had never helped work anything up with a detective he rather thought he should like to do it sewell thought of writing to barkers mother at willoughby pastures but he postponed it perhaps it would alarm her if barker were not there sewell had many other cares and duties lemuel became more and more a good intention of the indefinite future after all he had always shown the ability to take care of himself and except that he had mysteriously disappeared there was no reason for anxiety about him  one night his name came up at a moment when sewell was least prepared by interest or expectation to see him he smiled to himself in running downstairs at the reflection that he never seemed quite ready for barker but it was a relief to have him turn up again there was no question of that and sewell showed him a face of welcome that dropped at sight of him he scarcely new the gaunt careworn face or the shabby figure before him in place of the handsome welldressed young fellow whom he had come to greet there seemed a sort of reversion in barkers whole presence to the time when sewell first found him in that room and in whatever trouble he now was the effect was that of his original rustic constraint  trouble there was of some kind sewell could see at a glance and his kind heart prompted him to take lemuels hand between both of his why my dear boy he began but he stopped and made lemuel sit down waited for him to speak without further question or comment  mr sewell the young man said abruptly you told me once you that you sometimes had money put into your hands that you could lend  yes replied sewell with eager cordiality  could i borrow about seventyfive dollars of you  why certainly barker sewell had not so much of what he called his flyingcharity fund by him but he instantly resolved to advance the difference out of his own pocket  its to get me an outfit for horsecar conductor said lemuel i can have the place if i can get the outfit  horsecar conductor reverberated sewell what in the world for  its work i can do answered lemuel briefly but not resentfully  but there are so many other thingsbetterfittermore profitable why did you leave mr corey i assure you that you have been a great loss to himin every way you dont know how much he valued you personally he will be only too glad to have you come back  i cant go back said lemuel im going to get married  married cried sewell in consternation  mythe lady that im going to marryhas been sick ever since the first of october and i havent had a chance to look up any kind of work but shes better now and ive heard of this place i can get i dont like to trouble you buteverythings goneive got my mother down here helping take care of her and i must do something i dont know just when i can pay you back but ill do it sometime  oh im sure of that said sewell from the abyss of hopeless conjecture into which these facts had plunged him his wandering fancy was dominated by the presence of lemuels mother with her bloomers in boston ii hope theres nothing serious the trouble with yourthe lady he said rubbing away with his hand the smile that came to his lips in spite of him  its lung trouble said lemuel quietly  oh responded sewell well well he shook himself together and wondered what had become of the impulse he had felt to scold barker for the idea of getting married but such a course now seemed not only far beyond his provincehe heard himself saying that to mrs sewell in selfdefence when she should censure him for not doing itbut utterly useless in view of the further complications well this is great news you tell mea great surprise youre youre going to take an important stepyouyouof course of course you must have a great many demands upon you under the circumstances yes yes and im very glad you came to me if your mind is quite made up about  yes ive thought it over said lemuel the lady has had to work all her life and sheshe isnt used to what i thoughtwhat i intendedany other kind of people and its better for us both that i should get some kind of work that wont take me away from her too much he dropped his head and sewell with a flash of intelligence felt a thrill of compassionate admiration for the poor foolish generous creature for so lemuel complexly appeared to him  again he forbore question or comment  wellwell we must look you up mrs sewell and i we must come to see yourthe lady he found himself falling helplessly into lemuels way of describing her just write me your address here he put a scrap of paper before lemuel on the davenportand ill go and get you the money  he brought it back in an envelope which held a very little more than lemuel had asked forsewell had not dared to add muchand lemuel put it in his pocket  he tried to say something he could only make a husky noise in his throat  good night said sewell pressing his hand with both of his again at the door we shall come very soon  married said mrs sewell when he returned to her and then she suffered a silence to ensue in which it seemed to sewell that his inculpation was visibly accumulating mountains vast and high what did you say  nothing he answered almost gaily the case was so far beyond despair what should you have said     xxxiv   lemuel got a conductors overcoat and cap at halfprice from a man who had been discharged and put by the money saved to return to sewell when he should come he entered upon his duties the next morning under the instruction of an old conductor who said haint i seen you someres before and he worked all day taking money and tickets registering fares helping ladies on and off the car and monotonously journeying back and forth over his route he went on duty at six oclock in the morning after an early breakfast that manda grier and his mother got him for statira was not strong enough yet to do much and he was to be relieved at eight at nightfall after two halfhour respites for dinner and tea he was so tired that he could scarcely stand  well how do you like it as furs youve gone asked the instructing conductor in whom lemuel had recognised an old acquaintance sweet life aint it there that switch haint worked again jump off young man and put your shoulder to the wheel  the car had failed to take the righthand turn where the line divided it had to be pushed back and while the driver tugged and swore under his breath at his horses lemuel set himself to push the car  s no use said the driver finally i got to hitch em on at the other end and pull her back  he uncoupled the team from the front of the car and swung round with it lemuel felt something strike him on the leg and he fell down he scrambled to his feet again but his left leg doubled under him it went through his mind that one of the horses must have lashed out and broken it then everything seemed to stop  the world began again for him in the apothecarys shop where he had been carried and from which he was put into an ambulance by a policeman it stopped again as he whirled away it renewed itself in anguish and ceased in bliss as he fainted from the pain or came to  they lifted him up some steps at last and carried him into a high bright room where there were two or three cots and a long glass case full of surgical instruments they laid him on a cot and some one swiftly and skilfully undressed him a surgeon had come in and now he examined lemuels leg he looked once or twice at his face  this is a pretty bad job i cant tell how bad till you have had the ether will you leave it with me  yes but do the best you can for me  you may be sure i will  lemuel believed that they meant to cut off his leg he knew that he had a right to refuse and to take the consequences but he would not he had no right to choose death when he had others to live for  he woke deathly sick at first and found himself lying in bed one of the two rows in a long room where there were some quiet women in neat caps and seersucker dresses going about with bowls of food and bottles of medicine  lemuel still felt his leg and the pain in it but he had heard how mutilated men felt their lost limbs all their lives and he was afraid to make sure by the touch of his hand  a nurse who saw his eyes open came to him he turned them upon her but he could not speak she must have understood the doctor thinks he can save your leg for you but its a bad fracture you must be careful to keep very still  he fell asleep and life began again for him in the midst of suffering and death he saw every day broken and mangled men drunk with ether brought up as he had been and laid in beds he saw the priest of the religion to which most of the poor and lowly still belong go and come among the cots and stand by the pillows where the sick feebly followed him in the mystical gestures which he made on his brow and breast he learned to know the use of the white linen screen which was drawn about a bed to hide the passing of a soul he became familiar with the helpless sympathy the despair of the friends who came to visit the sick and dying  he had not lacked for more attention and interest from his own than the rules of the hospital allowed his mother and manda grier came first and then statira when they would let her she thought it hard that she was not suffered to do the least thing for him she wished to take him away to their own rooms where she could nurse him twice as well at first she cried whenever she saw him and lamented over him so that the head nurse was obliged to explain to her that she disturbed the patients and could not come any more unless she controlled herself she promised and kept her word she sat quietly by his pillow and held his hand when she came except when she put up her own to hide the cough which she could not always restrain the nurse told her that of course she was not accountable for the cough but she had better try to check it statira brought troches with her and held them in her mouth for this purpose  lemuels family was taken care of in this time of disaster the newspapers had made his accident promptly known and not only sewell but miss vane and mrs corey had come to see if they could be of any use  one day a young girl brought a bouquet of flowers and set it by lemuels bed when he seemed asleep he suddenly opened his eyes and saw sybil vane for the first time since their quarrel  she put her finger to her lip and smiled with the air of a lady benefactress then with a few words of official sympathy she encouraged him to get well and flitted to the next bed where she bestowed a jacqueminot rosebud on a chinaman dying of cancer  sewell came often to see him at first in the teeth of his mothers obvious hostility but with her greater and greater relenting nothing seemed gloomier than the outlook for lemuel but sewell had lived too long not to know that the gloom of an outlook has nothing to do with a mans real future it was impossible of course for lemuel to go back to mr coreys now with a sick wife who would need so much of his care besides he did not think it desirable on other accounts he recurred to what lemuel had said about getting work that should not take him too far away from the kind of people his betrothed was used to and he felt a pity and respect for the boy whom life had already taught this wisdom this resignation he could see that before his last calamity had come upon him barker was trying to adjust his ambition to his next duty or rather to subordinate it and the conviction that he was right gave sewell courage to think that he would yet somehow succeed it also gave him courage to resist on barkers behalf the generous importunities of some who would have befriended him mr corey and charles bellingham drove up to the hospital one day to see lemuel and when sewell met them the same evening they were full of enthusiasm corey said that the effect of the hospital with its wards branching from the classistic building in the centre was delightfully italian it was like st peters on a small scale and he had no idea how interesting the south end was it was quite a bit of foreign travel to go up there bellingham had explored the hospital throughout he said he had found it the thing to doit was a thing for everybody to do he was astonished that he had never done it before they united in praising barker and they asked what could be done for him corey was strenuous for his coming back to him at any rate they must find something for him bellingham favoured the notion of doing something for his education a fellow like that could come to almost anything  sewell shook his head all thats impossible now with that girl  oh confound her cried bellingham  i was rather disappointed at not seeing his mother said corey i had counted a good deal i find upon mrs barkers bloomers  with a girl like that for his wife pursued sewell the conditions are all changed he must cleave to her in mind as well as body and he must seek the kind of life that will unite them more and more not less and less in fact he was instinctively doing so when this accident happened thats what marriage means  oh not always suggested corey  he must go back to willoughby pastures sewell concluded to his farm  oh come now said bellingham with disgust  if that sort of thing is to go on said corey what is to become of the ancestry of the future élite of boston i counted upon barker to found one of our first families besides any irishman could take his farm and do better with it the farm would be meat to the irishman and poison to barker now that hes once tasted town  yes i know all that said sewell sadly i once thought the greatest possible good i could do barker after getting him to boston was to get him back to willoughby pastures but if that was ever true the time is past now it merely seems the only thing possible when he gets well he will still have an invalid wife on his hands he must provide her a home she could have helped him once and would have done so ive no doubt but now she must be taken care of  look here said bellingham whats the reason these things cant be managed as they are in the novels in any wellregulated romance that cough of hers would run into quick consumption and carry barkers fiancee off in six weeks and then he could resume his career of usefulness and prosperity here dont you know he could marry some one else and found that family that corey wants  they all laughed sewell ruefully  as it is said corey i suppose shell go on having hemorrhages to a good old age and outlive him after being a clog and burden to him all his life poor devil what in the world possesses him to want to marry her but i suppose the usual thing  this gave sewell greater discomfort than the question of lemuels material future he said listlessly oh i suppose so but he was far from thinking precisely that he had seen lemuel and the young girl together a great deal and a painful misgiving had grown up in his mind it seemed to him that while he had seen no want of patience and kindness towards her in lemuel he had not seen the return of her fondness which silly as it was in some of its manifestations he thought he should be glad of in him yet he was not sure barker was always so selfcontained that he might very well feel more love for her than he showed and after all sewell rather weakly asked himself was the love so absolutely necessary  when he repeated this question in his wifes presence she told him she was astonished at him  you know that it is vitally necessary its all the more necessary if hes so superior to her as you say i cant think whats become of your principles my dear  i do youve got them said sewell  i really believe i have said his wife with that full conviction of righteousness which her sex alone can feel i have always heard you say that marriage without love was not only sinful in itself but the beginning of sorrow why do you think now that it makes no difference  i suppose i was trying to adapt myself to circumstances answered sewell frankly at least lets hope that my facts are as wrong as my conclusions im not sure of either i suppose if i saw him idolising so slight and light a person as she seems to be i should be more disheartened about his future than i am now if he overvalued her it would only drag him lower down  oh his future drag him down why dont you think of her going up there to that dismal wilderness to spend her days in toil and poverty with a halfcrazy motherinlaw and a rheumatic brother inlaw in such a looking hovel mrs sewell did not group these disadvantages conventionally but they were effective you have allowed your feelings about that baffling creature to blind you to everything else david why should you care so much for his future and nothing for hers is that so very bright  i dont think that either is dazzling sighed the minister yet barkers grew a little lighter as he familiarised himself with it or rather with barker he found that he had a plan for getting a teachers place in the academy if they reopened it at willoughby pastures as they talked of doing under the impulse of such a course in one of the neighbouring towns and that he was going home in fancy at least with purposes of enlightenment and elevation which would go far to console him under such measure of disappointment as they must bring sewell hinted to barker that he must not be too confident of remodelling willoughby pastures upon the pattern of boston  oh no i dont expect that said lemuel what i mean is that i shall always try to remember myself what ive learnt herefrom the kind of men ive seen and the things that i know people are all the time doing for others i told you once that they havent got any idea of that in the country i dont expect to preach it into them they wouldnt like it if i did and theyd make fun of it but if i could try to live it  yes said sewell touched by this young enthusiasm  i dont know as i can all the time said lemuel but it seems to me that thats what ive learnt here if ive learnt anything i think the worlds a good deal better than i used to  do you indeed my dear boy asked sewell greatly interested its a pretty wellmeaning worldi hope it is  yes thats what i mean said lemuel i presume it aint perfectisnt i should say and sewell smiled mr corey was always correcting me on that but if i were to do nothing but pass along the good thats been done me since i came here i should be kept busy the rest of my life  sewell knew that this emotion was largely the physical optimism of convalescence but he could not refuse the comfort it gave him to find barker in such a mood and he did not conceive it his duty to discourage it lofty ideals if not indulged at the expense of lowly realities he had never found hurtful to any and it was certainly better for barker to think too well than too ill of boston if it furnished him incentives to unselfish living he could think of enough things in the city to warrant a different judgment but if barkers lesson from his experience there was this sewell was not the person to weaken its force with him he said with a smile of reserved comment well perhaps youll be coming back to us some day  i dont look forward to that said lemuel soberly and then his face took a sterner cast as if from the force of his resolution the first thing ive got to do after ive made a home for her is to get statira away from the town where she can have some better air and see if she cant get her health back itll be time enough to talk of boston again when shes fit to live here  the ministers sympathetic spirit sank again but his final parting with barker was not unhopeful lemuel consented to accept from him a small loan to the compass of which he reduced the eager bounty of miss vane and mr corey representing that more would be a burden and an offence to barker statira and his mother came with him to take leave of the sewells  they dismounted from the horsecar at the ministers door and he saw with sensibility the two women helping lemuel off he walked with a cane and they went carefully on either side of him sewell hastened to meet them at the door himself and he was so much interested in the spectacle of this mutual affection that he failed at first to observe that mrs barker wore the skirts of occidental civilisation instead of the bloomers which he had identified her with  she says shes goin to put em on again as soon as she gets back to willoughby the younger woman explained to mrs sewell in an aside while the minister was engaged with lemuel and his mother but i tell her as long as it aint the fashion in boston i guess she hadnt better heeere statira had got on her genteel prolongation of her last syllables again i guess i shall get along with her shes kind of queer when you first get acquainted but shes real goodhearteed she was herself very prettily dressed and though she looked thin and at times gave a deep dismal cough she was so bright and gay that it was impossible not to feel hopeful about her she became very confidential with mrs sewell whom she apparently brevetted lemuels best friend and obliged to a greater show of interest in him than she had ever felt she told her the whole history of her love affair and of how much manda grier had done to help it on at first and then how she had wanted her to break off with lemuel but she concluded i think were goin to get along real nice together i dont know as we shall live all in the same hououse i guess itll be the best thing for lem and i if we can board till we get some little of our health back im more scared for him than what i am for myseelf i dont presume but what we shall both miss the city some but he might be out of a job all winter in town i shouldnt want he should go back on them caars most i hate is leavin manda grier she is the one that ive roomed with ever since i first came to boston but lem and her dont get on very well they haint really either of em got anything against each other now but they dont like very weell and of course i got to have the friends that he wants me to have and thats what manda grier says tooo and so its just as well were goin to be where they wont claash  she talked to mrs sewell in a low voice but she kept her eyes upon lemuel all the time and when sewell took him and his mother the length of the front drawingroom away she was quite distraught and answered at random till he came back  sewell did not know what to think would this dependence warm her betrothed to greater tenderness than he now showed or would its excess disgust him he was not afraid that lemuel would ever be unkind to her but he knew that in marriage kindness was not enough he looked at lemuel serious thoughtful refined in his beauty by suffering and then his eye wandered to statiras delicate prettiness so sweet so full of amiable cheerfulness so undeniably light and silly what chiefly comforted him was the fact of an ally whom the young thing had apparently found in lemuels mother whether that grim personages ignorant pride in her son had been satisfied with a girl of statiras style and fashion and proven capableness in housekeeping or whether some fancy for butterfly prettiness lurking in the fastnesses of the old womans rugged nature had been snared by the gay face and dancing eyes it was apparent that she at least was in love with statira she allowed herself to be poked about and rearranged as to her shawl and the narrowbrimmed youthful hat which she wore on the peak of her skull and she softened to something like a smile at the touch of statiras quick hands  they had all come rather early to make their parting visit at the sewells for the barkers were going to take the two oclock train for willoughby pastures while statira was to remain in boston till he could make a home for her lemuel promised to write as soon as he should be settled and tell sewell about his life and his work and sewell beyond earshot of his wife told him he might certainly count upon seeing them at willoughby in the course of the next summer they all shook hands several times lemuels mother gave her hand from under the fringe of her shawl standing bolt upright at armslength off and sewell said it felt like a collection of corn cobs     xxxv   well said sewells wife when they were gone  well he responded and after a moment he said theres this comfort about it which we dont always have in such cases there doesnt seem to be anybody else it would be indefinitely worse if there were  why of course what in the world are you thinking about  about that foolish girl who came to me with her miserable love trouble i declare i cant get rid of it i feel morally certain that she went away from me and dismissed the poor fellow who was looking to her love to save him  at the cost of some other poor creature whod trusted and believed in him till his silly fancy changed i hope for the credit of women that she did but you may be morally certain she did nothing of the kind girls dont give up all their hopes in life so easily as that she might think she would do it because she had read of such things and thought it was fine but when it came to the pinch she wouldnt  i hope not if she did she would commit a great error a criminal error  well you neednt be afraid look at mrs tom corey and that was her own sister  that was different corey had never thought of her sister much less made love to her or promised to marry her besides mrs corey had her father and mother to advise her and support her in behaving sensibly and this poor creature had nothing but her own novel fed fancies and her crazy conscience she thought that because she inflicted suffering upon herself she was acting unselfishly really the fakirs of india and the penitentes of new mexico are more harmless for they dont hurt any one else if she has forced some poor fellow into a marriage like this of barkers shes committed a deadly sin shed better driven him to suicide than condemned him to live a lie to the end of his days no doubt she regarded it as a momentary act of expiation thats the way her romances taught her to look at loveless marriageas something spectacular transitory instead of the enduring degrading squalor that it is  what in the world are you talking about david i should think you were a novelist yourself by the wild way you go on you have no proof whatever that barker isnt happily engaged im sure hes got a much better girl than he deserves and one thats fully his equal shes only too fond of that dry stick such a girl as the one you describedlike that mysterious visitor of yourswhat possible relation could she have with him she was a lady  yes yes of course its absurd but everybody seems to be tangled up with everybody else my dear will you give me a cup of tea i think ill go to writing at once  before she left her husband to order his tea mrs sewell asked and do you think you have got through with him now  i have just begun with him replied sewell  his mind naturally enough in connection with lemuel was running upon his friend evans and the subject they had once talked of in that room it was primarily in thinking of him that he begun to write his sermon on complicity which made a great impression at the time and had a more lasting effect as enlarged from the newspaper reports and reprinted in pamphlet form his evolution from the text remember them that are in bonds as bound with them of a complete philosophy of life was humorously treated by some of his critics as a phase of darwinism but upon the whole the sermon met with great favour it not only strengthened sewells hold upon the affections of his own congregation but carried his name beyond boston and made him the topic of editorials in the sunday editions of leading newspapers as far off as chicago it struck one of those popular moods of intelligent sympathy when the failure of a large class of underpaid and worthy workers to assert their right to a living wage against a powerful monopoly had sent a thrill of respectful pity through every generous heart in the country and it was largely supposed that sewells sermon referred indirectly to the telegraphers strike those who were aware of his habit of seeking to produce a personal rather than a general effect of his belief that you can have a righteous public only by the slow process of having righteous men and women knew that he meant something much nearer home to each of his hearers when he preached the old christ humanity to them and enforced again the lessons that no one for good or for evil for sorrow or joy for sickness or health stood apart from his fellows but each was bound to the highest and the lowest by ties that centred in the hand of god no man he said sinned or suffered to himself alone his error and his pain darkened and afflicted men who never heard of his name if a community was corrupt if an age was immoral it was not because of the vicious but the virtuous who fancied themselves indifferent spectators it was not the tyrant who oppressed it was the wickedness that had made him possible the gospelchristgod so far as men had imagined himwas but a lesson a type a witness from everlasting to everlasting of the spiritual unity of man as we grew in grace in humanity in civilisation our recognition of this truth would be transfigured from a duty to a privilege a joy a heavenly rapture many men might go through life harmlessly without realising this perhaps but sterilely only those who had had the care of others laid upon them lived usefully fruitfully let no one shrink from such a burden or seek to rid himself of it rather let him bind it fast upon his neck and rejoice in it the wretched the foolish the ignorant whom we found at every turn were something more they were the messengers of god sent to tell his secret to any that would hear it happy he in whose ears their cry for help was a perpetual voice for that man whatever his creed knew god and could never forget him in his responsibility for his weaker brethren he was godlike for god was but the impersonation of loving responsibility of infinite and neverceasing care for us all  when sewell came down from his pulpit many people came up to speak to him of his sermon some of the womens faces showed the traces of tears and each person had made its application to himself there were two or three who had heard between the words old bromfield corey who was coming a good deal more to church since his eyes began to fail him because it was a change and a sort of relief from being read to said  i didnt know that they had translated it barker in the revised version well you must let me know how hes getting on sewell and give me a chance at the revelation too if he ever gets troublesome to you again  miss vane was standing at the door with his wife when sewell came out she took his hand and pressed it  do you think i threw away my chance she demanded she had her veil down and at first sewell thought it was laughter that shook her voice but it was not that  he did not know quite what to say but he did say he was sent to me  as they walked off alone his wife said  well david i hope you havent preached away all your truth and righteousness  i know what you mean my dear answered sewell humbly he added you shall remind me if i seem likely to forget but he concluded seriously if i thought i could never do anything more for barker i should be very unhappy i should take it as a sign that i had been recreant to my charge     xxxvi   the minister heard directly from barker two or three times during the winter and as often through statira who came to see mrs sewell barker had not got the place he had hoped for at once but he had got a school in the country a little way off and he was doing something and he expected to do better  the winter proved a very severe one i guess its just as well i stayed in town said statira the last time she came with a resignation which mrs sewell fond of the ideal in others as most ladies are did not like manda grier says twould killed me up there and i d know but what it would i done so well here since the cold weather set in that manda grier she thinks i hadnt better get married right away well not till it comes summer anyway i tell her i guess she dont want i should get married at all after all she done to help it along first off her and mr barker dont seem to get along very well  now that statira felt a little better acquainted with mrs sewell she dropped the genteel elongation of her final syllables and used such vernacular forms of speech as came first to her the name of manda grier seemed to come in at every fourth word with her and she tired mrs sewell with visits which she appeared unable to bring to a close of herself  a long relief from them ended in an alarm for her health with mrs sewell who went to find her she found her still better than before and statira frankly accounted for her absence by saying that manda thought she had better not come any more till mrs sewell returned some of her calls she laughed and then she said  i dont know as youd found me here if youd come much later manda grier dont want i should be here in the east winds now its coming spring so soon and shes heard of a chance at a box factory in philadelphia she wants i should go there with her and i dont know but what it would be about the best thing  mrs sewell could not deny the good sense of the plan though she was sensible of liking statira less and less for it  the girl continued lemmr barker i should saywants i should come up there out the east winds but manda grier shes opposed to it she thinks id ought to have more of a mild climate and he better come down there and get a school if he wants me too statira broke into an impartial little titter im sure i dont know which of em ll win the day  mrs sewells report of this speech brought a radiant smile of relief to sewells face ah well then that settles it i feel perfectly sure that manda grier will win the day that poor sick flimsy little statira is completely under manda griers thumb and will do just what she says now that theres no direct appeal from her will to barkers they will never be married dont you see that it was manda griers romance in the beginning and that when she came to distrust to dislike barker she came to dislike her romance tooto hate it  well dont you romance him david said mrs sewell only conditionally accepting his theory  yet it may be offered to the reader as founded in probability and human nature in fact he may be assured here that the marriage which eventually took place was not that of lemuel with statira though how the union which was not only happiness for those it joined but whatever is worthier and better in life than happiness came about it is aside from the purpose of this story to tell and must be left for some future inquiry     the end
