32710844	twice told tales                       the tollgatherers day                     a sketch of transitory life                        by nathaniel hawthorne    methinks for a person whose instinct bids him  rather to pore over the current of life than to  plunge into its tumultuous waves no undesirable retreat were a tollhouse beside some thronged thoroughfare of the land  in youth perhaps it is good for  the observer to run about the earth to leave the track  of his footsteps far and wideto mingle himself with  the action of numberless vicissitudesand finally in  some calm solitude to feed a musing spirit on all that lie has seen and felt  but there are natures too indolent  or too sensitive to endure the dust the sunshine or the  rain the turmoil of moral and physical elements to which  all the wayfarers of the world expose themselves  for  such a mail how pleasant a miracle could life be made  to roll its variegated length by the threshold of his own hermitage and the great globe as it were perform its  revolutions and shift its thousand scenes before his eyes  without whirling him onward in its course  if any mortal be favored with a lot analogous to this it is the  tollgatherer  so at least have i often fancied while  lounging on a bench at the door of a small square edifice which stands between shore and shore in the midst of a long bridge  beneath the timbers ebbs and flows an arm of the sea while above like the lifeblood through a great artery the travel of the north and east is continually throbbing sitting on the aforesaid bench i amuse myself with a conception illustrated by numerous pencilsketches in the air of the tollgatherers day  in the morningdim gray dewy summers morn the distant roll of ponderous wheels begins to mingle with my old friends slumbers creaking more and more harshly through the midst of his dream and gradually replacing it with realities  hardly conscious of the change from sleep to wakefulness he finds himself partly clad and throwing wide the tollgates for the passage of a fragrant load of hay  the timbers groan beneath the slowrevolving wheels one sturdy yeoman stalks beside the oxen and peering from the summit of the hay by the glimmer of the halfextinguished lantern over the tollhouse is seen the drowsy visage of his comrade who has enjoyed a nap some ten miles long  the toll is paidcreak creak again go the wheels and the huge haymow vanishes into the morning mist  as yet nature is but half awake and familiar objects appear visionary  but yonder dashing from the shore with a rattling thunder of the wheels and a confused clatter of hoofs comes the nevertiring mail which has hurried onward at the same headlong restless rate all through the quiet night  the bridge resounds in one continued peal as the coach rolls on without a pause merely affording the tollgatherer a glimpse at the sleepy passengers who now bestir their torpid limbs and snuff a cordial in the briny air  the morn breathes upon them and blushes and they forget how wearily the darkness toiled away  and behold now the fervid day in his bright chariot glittering aslant over the waves nor scorning to throw a tribute of his golden beams on the tollgatherers little hermitage  the old man looks eastward and for he is a moralizer frames a simile of the stage coach and the sun while the world is rousing itself we may glance slightly at the scene of our sketch  it sits above the bosom of the broad flood a spot not of earth but in the midst of waters which rush with a murmuring sound among the massive beams beneath  over the door is a weatherbeaten board inscribed with the rates of toll in letters so nearly effaced that the gilding of the sunshine can hardly make them legible  beneath the window is a wooden bench on which a long succession of weary wayfarers have reposed themselves  peeping within doors we perceive the whitewashed walls bedecked with sundry lithographic prints and advertisements of various import and the immense showbill of a wandering caravan  and there sits our good old tollgatherer glorified by the early sunbeams  he is a man as his aspect may announce of quiet soul and thoughtful shrewd yet simple mind who of the wisdom which the passing world scatters along the wayside has gathered a reasonable store  now the sun smiles upon the landscape and earth smiles back again upon the sky  frequent now are the travellers  the tollgatherers practised ear can distinguish the weight of every vehicle the number of its wheels and how many horses beat the resounding timbers with their iron tramp  here in a substantial family chaise setting forth betimes to take advantage of the dewy road come a gentleman and his wife with their rosycheeked little girl sitting gladsomely between them  the bottom of the chaise is heaped with multifarious bandboxes and carpetbags and beneath the axle swings a leathern trunk dusty with yesterdays journey  next appears a fourwheeled carryall peopled with a round halfdozen of pretty girls all drawn by a single horse and driven by a single gentleman  luckless wight doomed through a whole summer day to be the butt of mirth and mischief among the frolicsome maidens  bolt upright in a sulky rides a thin sourvisaged man who as he pays his toll hands the tollgatherer a printed card to stick upon the wall  the vinegarfaced traveller proves to be a manufacturer of pickles  now paces slowly from timber to timber a horseman clad in black with a meditative brow as of one who whithersoever his steed might bear him would still journey through a mist of brooding thought  he is a country preacher going to labor at a protracted meeting  the next object passing townward is a butchers cart canopied with its arch of snowwhite cotton  behind comes a sauceman driving a wagon full of new potatoes green ears of corn beets carrots turnips and summersquashes and next two wrinkled withered witchlooking old gossips in an antediluvian chaise drawn by a horse of former generations and going to peddle out a lot of huckleberries  see there a man trundling a wheelbarrowload of lobsters  and now a milkcart rattles briskly onward covered with green canvas and conveying the contributions of a whole herd of cows in large tin canisters  but let all these pay their toll and pass  here comes a spectacle that causes the old tollgatherer to smile benignantly as if the travellers brought sunshine with them and lavished its gladsome influence all along the road  it is a harouche of the newest style the varnished panels of which reflect the whole moving panorama of the landscape and show a picture likewise of our friend with his visage broadened so that his meditative smile is transformed to grotesque merriment  within sits a youth fresh as the summer morn and beside him a young lady in white with white gloves upon her slender bands and a white veil flowing down over her face  but methinks her blushing cheek burns through the snowy veil  another whiterobed virgin sits in front  and who are these on whom and on all that appertains to them the dust of earth seems never to have settled  two lovers whom the priest has blessed this blessed morn and sent them forth with one of the bridemaids on the matrimonial tour  take my blessing too ye happy ones  may the sky not frown upon you nor clouds bedew you with their chill and sullen rain  may the hot sun kindle no fever in your hearts  may your whole lifes pilgrimage be as blissful as this first days journey and its close be gladdened with even brighter anticipations than those which hallow your bridal night  they pass and ere the reflection of their joy has faded from his face another spectacle throws a melancholy shadow over the spirit of the observing man  in a close carriage sits a fragile figure muffled carefully and shrinking even from the mild breath of summer  she leans against a manly form and his arm infolds her as if to guard his treasure from some enemy  let but a few weeks pass and when he shall strive to embrace that loved one he will press only desolation to his heart  and now has morning gathered up her dewy pearls and fled away  the sun rolls blazing through the sky and cannot find a cloud to cool his face with  the horses toil sluggishly along the bridge and heave their glistening sides in short quick pantings when the reins are tightened at the tollhouse  glisten too the faces of the travellers  their garments are thickly bestrewn with dust their whiskers and hair look hoary their throats are choked with the dusty atmosphere which they have left behind them  no air is stirring on the road  nature dares draw no breath lest she should inhale a stifling cloud of dust  a hot and dusty day cry the poor pilgrims as they wipe their begrimed foreheads and woo the doubtful breeze which the river bears along with it  awful hot  dreadful dusty answers the sympathetic tollgatherer  they start again to pass through the fiery furnace while he reenters his cool hermitage and besprinkles it with a pail of briny water from the stream beneath  he thinks within himself that the sun is not so fierce here as elsewhere and that the gentle air does not forget him in these sultry days  yes old friend and a quiet heart will make a dogday temperate he hears a weary footstep and perceives a traveller with pack and staff who sits down upon the hospitable bench and removes the hat from his wet brow the tollgatherer administers a cup of cold water and discovering his guest to be a man of homely sense he engages him in profitable talk uttering the maxims of a philosophy which he has found in his own soul but knows not how it came there  and as the wayfarer makes ready to resume his journey he tells him a sovereign remedy for blistered feet now comes the noontide hourof all the hours nearest akin to midnight for each has its own calmness and repose  soon however the world begins to turn again upon its axis and it seems the busiest epoch of the day when an accident impedes the march of sublunary things  the draw being lifted to permit the passage of a schooner laden with wood from the eastern forests she sticks immovably right athwart the bridge meanwhile on both sides of the chasm a throng of impatient travellers fret and fume  here are two sailors in a gig with the top thrown back both puffing cigars and swearing all sorts of forecastle oaths there in a smart chaise a dashingly dressed gentleman and lady he from a tailors shopboard and she from a milliners hack roomthe aristocrats of a summer afternoon  and what are the haughtiest of us but the ephemeral aristocrats of a summers day  here is a tinpeddler whose glittering ware bedazzles all beholders like a travelling meteor or opposition sun and on the other side a seller of sprucebeer which brisk liquor is confined in several dozen of stone bottles  here comes a party of ladies on horseback in green ridinghabits and gentlemen attendant and there a flock of sheep for the market pattering over the bridge with a multitudinous clatter of their little hoofs  here a frenchman with a handorgan on his shoulder and there an itinerant swiss jeweller  on this side heralded by a blast of clarions and bugles appears a train of wagons conveying all the wild beasts of a caravan and on that a company of summer soldiers marching from village to village on a festival campaign attended by the brass band  now look at the scene and it presents an emblem of the mysterious confusion the apparently insolvable riddle in which individuals or the great world itself seem often to be involved  what miracle shall set all things right again  but see the schooner has thrust her bulky carcass through the chasm the draw descends horse and foot pass onward and leave the bridge vacant from end to end  and thus muses the tollgatherer have i found it with all stoppages even though the universe seemed to be at a stand the sage old man  far westward now the reddening sun throws a broad sheet of splendor across the flood and to the eyes of distant boatmen gleams brightly among the timbers of the bridge  strollers come from the town to quaff the freshening breeze  one or two let down long lines and haul up flapping flounders  or cunners or small cod or perhaps an eel others and fair girls among them with the flush of the hot day still on their cheeks bend over the railing and watch the heaps of seaweed floating upward with the flowing tide  the horses now tramp heavily along the bridge and wistfully bethink them of their stables  rest rest thou weary world  for tomorrows round of toil and pleasure will be as wearisome as todays has been yet both shall bear thee onward a days march of eternity  now the old tollgatherer looks seaward and discerns the lighthouse kindling on a far island and the stars too kindling in the sky as if but a little way beyond and mingling reveries of heaven with remembrances of earth the whole procession of mortal travellers all the dusty pilgrimage which he has witnessed seems like a flitting show of phantoms for his thoughtful soul to muse upon
