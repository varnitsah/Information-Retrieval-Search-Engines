pioneers    they rise to mastery of wind and snow     they go like soldiers grimly into strife   to colonize the plain they plough and sow     and fertilize the sod with their own life   as did the indian and the buffalo  settlers    above them soars a dazzling sky     in winter blue and clear as steel   in summer like an arctic sea     wherein vast icebergs drift and reel   and melt like sudden sorcery    beneath them plains stretch far and fair     rich with sunlight and with rain   vast harvests ripen with their care     and fill with overplus of grain   their square great bins    yet still they strive i see them rise     at dawnlight going forth to toil   the same salt sweat has filled my eyes     my feet have trod the selfsame soil   behind the snarling plough    preface  nearly all the stories in this volume were written at the same time and under the same impulse as those which compose its companion volume maintravelled roadsand the entire series was the result of a summervacation visit to my old home in iowa to my fathers farm in dakota and last of all to my birthplace in wisconsin this happened in 1887 i was living at the time in boston and had not seen the west for several years and my return to the scenes of my boyhood started me upon a series of stories delineative of farm and village life as i knew it and had lived it i wrote busily during the two years that followed and in this revised definitive edition of maintravelled roads and its companion volume other maintravelled roads compiled from other volumes which now go out of print the reader will find all of the short stories which came from my pen between 1887 and 1889  it remains to say that though conditions have changed somewhat since that time yet for the hired man and the renter farm life in the west is still a stern round of drudgery my pages present itnot as the summer boarder or the young lady novelist sees itbut as the working farmer endures it  not all the scenes of other maintravelled roads are of farm life though rural subjects predominate and the village life touched upon will be found less forbidding in color in this i am persuaded my view is sound for no matter how hard the villager works he is not lonely he suffers in company with his fellows so much may be called a gain then too i admit youth and love are able to transform a bleak prairie town into a poem and to make of a barbedwire lane a highway of romance                                                          hamlin garland    contents

and brown and only here and there in a corner or on the north side of the fence did the sullen drifts remain and they were so dark and low that they hardly appeared to break the mellow brown of the fields  there passed also an occasional flock of geese cheerful harbingers of spring and the prairiechickens had set up their morning symphony wideswelling wonderful with its prophecy of the new birth of grass and grain and the springing life of all breathing things the crow passed now and then uttering his resonant croak but the crane had not yet sent forth his bugle note  lyman gilman rested on his axehelve at the woodpile of farmer bacon to listen to the music around him in a vague way he was powerfully moved by it he heard the hens singing their weird raucous monotonous song and saw them burrowing in the dry chipdust near him he saw the young colts and cattle frisking in the sunny space around the strawstacks absorbed through his bare arms and uncovered head the heat of the sun and felt the soft wooing of the air so deeply that he broke into an unwonted exclamation  glory well be seeding by friday sure  this short and disappointing soliloquy was after all an expression of deep emotion to the western farmer the very word seeding is a poem and these few words coming from lyman gilman meant more and expressed more than many a large and ambitious springtime song  but the glory of all the slumbrous landscape the stately beauty of the sky with its masses of fleecy vapor were swept away by the sound of a girls voice humming come to the saviour while she bustled about the kitchen near by the windows were open ah what suggestion to these dwellers in a rigorous climate was in the first unsealing of the windows how sweet it was to the pale and weary women after their long imprisonment  as lyman sat down on his maple log to hear better a plump face appeared at the window and a clear girlvoice said  smell anything lime  he snuffed the air cookies by the great horn spoons he yelled leaping up bring me some an see me eat itll do ye good  come an get m laughed the face at the window  oh its nicer out here merry etty whats the rush bring me out some an set down on this log  with a nod marietta disappeared and soon came out with a plate of cookies in one hand and a cup of milk in the other  poor little man hes all tired out aint he  lime taking the cue collapsed in a heap and said feebly bread bread  wont milk an cookies do as well  he brushed off the log and motioned her to sit down beside him but she hesitated a little and colored a little  oh lime spose somebody should see us  let em what in thunder do we care sit down an gimme a holt o them cakes im just about done up i couldnt a stood it another minute  she sat down beside him with a laugh and a pretty blush she was in her apron and the sleeves of her dress were rolled to her elbows displaying the strong round arms wholesome and sweet she looked and smelled the scent of the cooking round her lyman munched a couple of the cookies and gulped a pint of milk before he spoke  whadda we care who sees us sittin side b side aint we goin t be married soon  oh them cookies in the oven she shrieked leaping up and running to the house she looked back as she reached the kitchen door however and smiled with a flushed face lime slapped his knee and roared with laughter at his bold stroke  ho ho he laughed didnt i do it slick aint nothin green in my eye i guess in an intense and pleasurable abstraction he finished the cookies and the milk then he yelled  hey merrymerry etty  whadda ye want sang the girl from the window her face still rosy with confusion  come out here and git these things  the girl shook her head with a laugh  come out an git m r by jingo ill throw em at ye come on now  the girl looked at the huge handsome fellow the sun falling on his golden hair and beard and came slowly out to himcame creeping along with her hand outstretched for the plate which lime with a laugh in his sunny blue eyes extended at the full length of his bare arm the girl made a snatch at it but his left hand caught her by the wrist and away went cup and plate as he drew her to him and kissed her in spite of her struggles  my aint you strong she said half ruefully and half admiringly as she shrugged her shoulders if youd use a little more o that choppin wood dad wouldnt a lost s much money by yeh  lime grew grave  theres the hog in the fence merry whats yer dad goin t say  about what  about our gittn married this spring  i guess youd better find out what im agoin t say lime gilman fore you pitch into dad  i know what youre agoin t say  no y dont  yes but i do though  well ask me and see if you think youre so smart jest as like s not youll slip up  all right here goes marietty bacon aint you an lime gilman goin t be married  no sir we aint laughed the girl snatching up the plate and darting away to the house where she struck up weevily wheat and went busily on about her cooking lime threw a kiss at her and fell to work on his log with startling energy  lyman looked forward to his interview with the old man with as much trepidation as he had ever known though commonly he had little fear of anythingbut a girl  marietta was not only the old mans only child but his housekeeper his wife having at last succumbed to the ferocious toil of the farm it was reasonable to suppose therefore that he would surrender his claim on the girl reluctantly rough as he was he loved marietta strongly and would find it exceedingly hard to get along without her  lyman mused on these things as he drove the gleaming axe into the huge maple logs he was something more than the usual hired man being a lumberman from the wisconsin pineries where he had sold out his interest in a camp not three weeks before the day he began work for bacon he had a nice little wad o money when he left the camp and started for la crosse but he had been robbed in his hotel the first night in the city and was left nearly penniless it was a great blow to him for as he said every cent of that money stood fer hard knocks an poor feed when i smelt of it i could jest see the cold frosty mornins and the late nights i could feel the hot sun on my back like it was when i worked in the harvestfield by jingo it kind o made my toes curl up  but he went resolutely out to work again and here he was chopping wood in old man bacons yard thinking busily on the talk which had just passed between marietta and himself  by jingo he said all at once stopping short with the axe on his shoulder if i hadnt a been robbed i wouldnt a come herei neverd met merry thunder and jimson root wasnt that a narrow escape  and then he laughed so heartily that the girl looked out of the window again to see what in the world he was doing he had his hat in his hand and was whacking his thigh with it  lyman gilman what in the world ails you today its perfectly ridiculous the way you yell and talk t yrself out there on the chips you beat the hens i declare if you dont  lime put on his hat and walked up to the window and resting his great bare arms on the sill and his chin on his arms said  merry im goin to tackle dad this afternoon hell be sittin up the new seeder and im goin t climb right on the back of his neck hes jest got t give me a chance  marietta looked sober in sympathy  well praps its best to have it over with lime but someway i feel kind o scary about it  lime stood for a long time looking in at the window watching the lightfooted girl as she set the table in the middle of the sunlighted kitchen floor the kettle hissed the meat sizzled sending up a delicious odor a hen stood in the open door and sang a sort of cheery halfhuman song while to and fro moved the sweetfaced lithe and powerful girl followed by the smiling eyes at the window  merry you look purty as a picture you look just like the wife i ben ahuntin for all these years sures shootin  marietta colored with pleasure  does dad pay you to stand an look at me an say pretty things t the cook  no he dont but im willin t do it without pay i could just stand here till kingdom come an look at you hello i hear a wagon i guess i better hump into that woodpile  i think so too dinners most ready and dad ll be here soon  lime was driving away furiously at a tough elm log when farmer bacon drove into the yard with a new seeder in his wagon lime whacked away busily while bacon stabled the team and in a short time marietta called in a longdrawn musical fashion  dinnerrr  after sozzling their faces at the well the two men went in and sat down at the table bacon was not much of a talker at any time and at mealtime in seeding eating was the main business in hand therefore the meal was a silent one marietta and lime not caring to talk on general topics the hour was an anxious one for her and an important one for him  wal now lime seedun s the nex thing said bacon as he shoved back his chair and glared around from under his bushy eyebrows we cant do too much this afternoon that seeders got t be set up an a lot o seedwheat cleaned up you unload the machine while i feed the pigs  lime sat still till the old man was heard outside calling ooee pooee to the pigs in the yard then he smiled at marietta but she said  hes got on one of his fits lime i dont blieve youd better tackle him tday  dont you worry ill fix him come now give me a kiss  why you great thing youtook  i know but i want you to give em to me just walk right up to me an give me a smack t bind the bargain  i aint made any bargain laughed the girl then feeling the force of his tender tone she added will you behave and go right off to your work  jest like a little manhope t die  lime roared the old man from the barn  hello replied lime grinning joyously and winking at the girl as much as to say this would paralyze the old man if he saw it  he went out to the shed where bacon was at work as serene as if he had not a fearful task on hand he was apprehensive that the father might gig back unless rightly approached and so he awaited a good opportunity  the right moment seemed to present itself along about the middle of the afternoon bacon was down on the ground under the machine tightening some burrs this was a good chance for two reasons in the first place the keen almost savage eyes were no longer where they could glare on him and in spite of his cool exterior lime had just as soon not have the old man looking at him  besides the old farmer had been telling about his river eighty which was without a tenant the man who had taken it having lost his wife had grown disheartened and had given it up  its an almighty good chance for a man with a small family good house an barn good land a likely young feller with a team an a woman could do tiptop on that eighty if he wanted more id let him have an eighty jinun  id like t try that mself said lime as a feeler the old fellow said nothing in reply for a moment  ef you had a team an tools an a woman id jest as lief youd have it as anybody  sell me your blacks and ill pay half downthe balance in the fall i can pick up some tools and as for a woman merry etty an me have talked that over today shes ready toready to marry me whenever you say go  there was an ominous silence under the seeder as if the father could not believe his ears  whatswhats that he stuttered whod you say what about merry etty  shes agreed to marry me  the hell you say roared bacon as the truth burst upon him so thats what you do when i go off to town and leave you to chop wood so youre goun to git married hey  he was now where lime could see him glaring up into his smiling blue eyes lime stood his ground  yes sir thats the calculation  well i guess ill have somethin t say about that said bacon nodding his head violently  i rather expected y would blaze away your privilegemy bad luck sail in ol man whats yr objection to me fer a soninlaw  dont you worry young feller ill come at it soon enough went on bacon as he turned up another burr in a very awkward corner in his nervous excitement the wrench slipped banging his knuckle  ouch thundermmm howled and snarled the wounded man  whats the matter bark yr knuckle queried lime feeling a mighty impulse to laugh but when he saw the old savage straighten up and glare at him he sobered bacon was now in a frightful temper the veins in his great bare weatherbeaten neck swelled dangerously  jest let me say right here that ive had enough o you you cant live on the same acre with my girl another day  what makes ye think i cant it was now the young mans turn to draw himself up and as he faced the old man his arms folded and each vast hand grasping an elbow he looked like a statue of red granite and the hands resembled the paws of a crouching lion but his eyes smiled  i dont think i know ye wont  whats the objection to me  objection hell whats the inducement my hired man an not three shirts to yer back  thats another ive got four say old man did you ever work out for a living  thats none o your business growled bacon a little taken down ive worked an scraped an got tgether a little propty here an they aint no sucker like you goun to come long here an live off me an spend my propty after im dead you can jest bet high on that  whos goin t live on ye  youre aimun to  i aint neither  yes yare youve loafed on me ever since i hired ye  thats a lime checked himself for mariettas sake and the enraged father went on  i hired ye t cut wood an youve gone an fooled my daughter away from me now you just figger up what i owe ye and git out o here ye cant go too soon t suit me  bacon was renowned as the hardest man to handle in cedar county and though he was getting old he was still a terror to his neighbors when roused he was honest temperate and a good neighbor until something carried him off his balance then he became as cruel as a panther and as savage as a grisly all this lime knew but it did not keep his anger down so much as did the thought of marietta his silence infuriated bacon who yelled hoarsely  git out o this  dont be in a rush ol man  bacon hurled himself upon lime who threw out one hand and stopped him while he said in a low voice  stay right where you are ol man im dangerous its for merrys sake  the infuriated old man struck at him lime warded off the blow and with a sudden wrench and twist threw him to the ground with frightful force before bacon could rise marietta who had witnessed the scene came flying from the house  lime father what are you doing  icouldnt help it merry it was him r me said lime almost sadly  dad aint you got no sense what re you thinking of you jest stop right now i wont have it  he rose while she clung to him he seemed a little dazed it was the first time he had ever been thrown and he could not but feel a certain respect for his opponent but he could not give way  pack up yer duds he snarled an git offn my land ill have the money fer ye when ye come back ill give ye jest five minutes to git clear o here merry you stay here  the young man saw it was useless to remain as it would only excite the old man and so with a look of apology not without humor at marietta he went to the house to get his valise the girl wept silently while the father raged up and down his mood frightened her  i thought ye had more sense than t take up with such a dirty houn  he aint a houn she blazed forth and hes just as good and clean as you are  shut up dont let me hear another word out o your head im boss here yet i reckon  lime came out with his valise in his hand  goodby merry he said cheerily she started to go to him but her fathers rough grasp held her  set down an stay there  lime was going out of the gate  here come and get yr money yelled the old man extending some bills heres twenty  go to thunder with your money retorted lime ive had my pay for my months work as he said that he thought of the sunny kitchen and the merry girl and his throat choked goodby to the sweet girl whose smile was so much to him and to the happy noons and nights her eyes had made for him he waved his hat at her as he stood in the open gate and the sun lighted his handsome head into a sort of glory in her eyes then he turned and walked rapidly off down the road not looking back  the girl when she could no longer see him dashed away and sobbing violently entered the house   ii   there was just a suspicion of light in the east a mere hint of a glow when lyman walked cautiously around the corner of the house and tapped at mariettas window she was sleeping soundly and did not hear for she had been restless during the first part of the night he tapped again and the girl woke without knowing what woke her  lyman put the blade of his pocketknife under the window and raised it a little and then placed his lips to the crack and spoke in a sepulchral tone half groan half whisper  merry merry etty  the dazed girl sat up in bed and listened while her heart almost stood still  merry its melime come to the winder the girl hesitated and lyman spoke again  come i haint got much time this is your last chance t see me its now r never  the girl slipped out of bed and wrapping herself in a shawl crept to the window  boost on that winder commanded lyman she raised it enough to admit his head which came just above the sill then she knelt on the floor by the window  her eyes stared wide and dark  lime what in the world do you mean  i mean business he replied i aint no last years chicken i know when the old man sleeps the soundest he chuckled pleasantly  how d y fool old rove  never mind about that now theys something more important on hand youve got t go with me  she drew back oh lime i cant  he thrust a great arm in and caught her by the wrist  yes y can this is yr last chance if i go off without ye tnight i never come back what makes ye gig back are ye fraid o me  nno butbut  but what merry etty  it aint right to go an leave dad all alone where y goin t take me anyhow  milt jennings let me have his horse an buggy theyre down the road a piece an well go right down to rock river and be married by sunup  the girl still hesitated her firm boyish will unwontedly befogged resolute as she was she could not at once accede to his demand  come make up your mind soon the old man ll fill me with buckshot if he catches sight o me he drew her arm out of the window and laid his bearded cheek to it come little one were made for each other god knows it come its him r me  the girls head dropped consented  thats right now a kiss to bind the bargain there what cryin no more o that little one now ill give you jest five minutes to git on your sundaygotmeetin cloes quick there goes a rooster its gittin white in the east  the man turned his back to the window and gazed at the western sky with a wealth of unuttered and unutterable exultation in his heart far off a rooster gave a long clear blastwould it be answered in the barn yes some wakeful ear had caught it and now the answer came faint muffled and drowsy the dog at his feet whined uneasily as if suspecting something wrong the wind from the south was full of the wonderful odor of springing grass warm brown earth and oozing sap overhead to the west the stars were shining in the cloudless sky dimmed a little in brightness by the faint silvery veil of moisture in the air the mans soul grew very tender as he stood waiting for his bride he was rough illiterate yet there was something fine about him after all a kind of simplicity and a gigantic leonine tenderness  he heard his sweetheart moving about inside and mused the old man wont hold out when he finds were married he cant get along without her if he does why ill rent a farm here and well go to work housekeepin i can git the money she shant always be poor he ended and the thought was a vow  the window was raised again and the girls voice was heard low and tremulous  lime im ready but i wish we didnt  he put his arm around her waist and helped her out and did not put her down till they reached the road she was completely dressed even to her hat and shoes but she mourned  my hair is everywhichway lime how can i be married so  they were nearing the horse and buggy now and lime laughed oh well stop at jenningss and fix up milt knows whats up and has told his mother by this time so just laugh as jolly as you can  soon they were in the buggy the impatient horse swung into the road at a rattling pace and as marietta leaned back in the seat thinking of what she had done she cried lamentably in spite of all the caresses and pleadings of her lover  but the sun burst up from the plain the prairiechickens took up their mighty chorus on the hills robins met them on the way flocks of wild geese honking cheerily drove far overhead toward the north and with these sounds of a golden spring day in her ears the bride grew cheerful and laughed   iii   at about the time the sun was rising farmer bacon roused from his sleep by the crowing of the chickens on the dry knolls in the fields as well as by those in the barnyard rolled out of bed wearily wondering why he should feel so drowsy then he remembered the row with lime and his subsequent inability to sleep with thinking over it there was a dull pain in his breast which made him uncomfortable  as was his usual custom he went out into the kitchen and built the fire for marietta filled the teakettle with water and filled the waterbucket in the sink then he went to her bedroom door and knocked with his knuckles as he had done for years in precisely the same fashion  rapraprap hello merry time t git up broad daylight an birds asingun  without waiting for an answer he went out to the barn and worked away at his chores he took such delight in the glorious morning and the turbulent life of the farmyard that his heart grew light and he hummed a tune which sounded like the merry growl of a lion pooee pooee he called to the pigs as they swarmed across the yard  ahrr you big fat rascals them hams o yourn is clear money one of ye shall go t buy merry a new dress he said as he glanced at the house and saw the smoke pouring out the stovepipe merrys a good girl shes stood by her old pap when other girls ud a gone back on im  while currying horses he went all over the ground of the quarrel yesterday and he began to see it in a different light he began to see that lyman was a good man and an able man and that his own course was a foolish one  when i git mad he confessed to himself i dont know any thin but i wont give her up she aint old nough t marry yetand besides i need her  after finishing his chores as usual he went to the well and washed his face and hands then entered the kitchento find the teakettle boiling over and no signs of breakfast anywhere and no sign of the girl  well i guess she felt sleepy this mornin poor gal mebbe she cried half the night  merry he called gently at the door  merry m gal pap needs his breakfast  there was no reply and the old mans face stiffened into a wild surprise he knocked heavily again and got no reply and with a white face and shaking hand he flung the door open and gazed at the empty bed his hand dropped to his side his head turned slowly from the bed to the open window he rushed forward and looked out on the ground where he saw the tracks of a man  he fell heavily into the chair by the bed while a deep groan broke from his stiff and twitching lips  shes left me shes left me  for a long halfhour the ironmuscled old man sat there motionless hearing not the songs of the hens or the birds far out in the brilliant sunshine he had lost sight of his farm his days work and felt no hunger for food he did not doubt that her going was final he felt that she was gone from him forever if she ever came back it would not be as his daughter but as the wife of gilman she had deserted him fled in the night like a thief his heart began to harden again and he rose stiffly his native stubbornness began to assert itself the first great shock over and he went out to the kitchen and prepared as best he could a breakfast and sat down to it in some way his appetite failed him and he fell to thinking over his past life of the death of his wife and the early death of his only boy he was still trying to think what his life would be in the future without his girl when two carriages drove into the yard it was about the middle of the forenoon and the prairiechickens had ceased to boom and squawk in fact that was why he knew for he had been sitting two hours at the table before he could rise he heard swift feet and a merry voice and marietta burst through the door  hello pap how you makin out with break she saw a look on his face that went to her heart like a knife she saw a lonely and deserted old man sitting at his cold and cheerless breakfast and with a remorseful cry she ran across the floor and took him in her arms kissing him again and again while mr john jennings and his wife stood in the door  poor ol pap merry couldnt leave you shes come back to stay as long as he lives  the old man remained cold and stern his deep voice had a relentless note in it as he pushed her away from him noticing no one else  but how do you come back t me  the girl grew rosy but she stood proudly up  i come back the wife of a man pap a wife like my mother an this t hang beside hers and she laid down a rolled piece of parchment  take it an go growled he take yer lazy lubber an git out o my sight i raised ye took keer o ye when ye was little sent ye t school bought ye

brought her away out here among the wolves an indians ive heard you an her say a hundred times that you didnt have a chair in the house now why do you talk so t me when i want t gitwhen lime comes and asks for me  the old man was staggered he looked at the smiling face of john jennings and the tearful eyes of mrs jennings who had returned with lyman but his heart hardened again as he caught sight of lime looking in at him his absurd pride would not let him relent lime saw it and stepped forward  ol man i want t take a little inning now im a fair square man i asked ye fer merry as a man should

this house ll bubble over with noise and young ones now is short and forevers a long time to feel sorry in  the old man at the table knitted his eyebrows and a distorted quivering ghastly smile broke

horses what in thunder you foolun round about hyere in seedn come hustle all o ye  and they all shouted in laughter while the old man strode unsteadily but resolutely out toward the barn followed by

time n i have t go t church were obleeged to do bout all we cn stand t pay our debts let alone tryun to support a preacher and the old man shut the pinchers up on a barb with a vicious grip  easygoing mr jennings laughed in his silent way i guess youll help when the time comes he said and clucking to his team drove off  i guess i wont muttered the grizzled old giant as he went on with his work bacon was what is called land poor in the west that is he had more land than money still he was able to give if he felt disposed it remains to say that he was not disposed being a sceptic and a scoffer it angered him to have jennings predict so confidently that he would help  the sun was striking redly through a rift in the clouds about three oclock in the afternoon when he saw a man coming up the lane walking on the grass at the side of the road and whistling merrily the old man looked at him from under his huge eyebrows with some curiosity as he drew near the pedestrian ceased to whistle and just as the farmer expected him to pass he stopped and said in a free and easy style  how de do give me a chaw tbaccer im pill the new minister i take finecut when i can get it he said as bacon put his hand into his pocket much obliged how goes it  tollable tollable said the astounded farmer looking hard at pill as he flung a handful of tobacco into his mouth  yes im the new minister sent around here to keep you fellows in the traces and out of hellfire have y fled from the wrath he asked in a perfunctory way  you are eh said bacon referring back to his profession  i am just how do you like that style of barb fence aint the twisted wire better  i spose they be but they cost more  yes costs more to go to heaven than to hell youll think so after i board with you a week narrow the road that leads to light and broad the way that leadshows your soul anyway brother  souls all right i find more trouble to keep m body gon  give us your hand so do i all the same we must prepare for the next world were gettin old lay not up your treasures where moth and rust corrupt and thieves break through and steal  bacon was thoroughly interested in the preacher and was studying him carefully he was tall straight and superbly proportioned broadshouldered widelunged and thewed like a chippewa his rather small steelblue eyes twinkled and his shrewd face and small head set well back completed a remarkable figure he wore his reddish beard in the usual way of western clergymen with mustache chopped close  bacon spoke slowly  you look like a good husky man to pitch in the barnyard youve too much muscle fr preachun  come and hear me next sunday and if you say so then ill quit replied mr pill quietly i give ye my word for it i believe in preachers havin a little of the flesh and the devil they can sympathize better with the rest of ye the sarcasm was lost on bacon who continued to look at him suddenly he said as if with an involuntary determination  where ye gon to stay tnight  i dont know do you was the quick reply  i reckon ye can hang out with me f ye feel like ut we aint very purty at our house but we eat you go along down the road and tell em i sent yeh yell find an ol dusty bible round somersi spose ye spend yr spare time readn about joshua an danl  i spend more time reading men well im off im hungrier n a gray wolf in a beartrap and off he went as he came but he did not whistle he chewed  bacon felt as if he had made too much of a concession and had a strong inclination to shout after him and retract his invitation but he did not only worked on with an occasional bearlike grin there was something captivating in this fellows free and easy way  when he came up to the house an hour or two later in singular good humor for him he found the elder in the creamery with his niece eldora who was not more won by him than was his sister jane buttles he was so genial and put on so few religious frills  mrs buttles never put on frills of any kind she was a most frightful toiler only excelled if excelled at all by her brother unlovely at her best when about her work in her faded calico gown and flat shoes hair wisped into a slovenly knot she was depressing but she was a good woman of sterling integrity and ambitious for her girl she was very glad of the chance to take charge of her brothers household after marietta married  eldora was as attractive as her mother was depressing she was very young at this time and had the physical perfectionat least as regards bodythat her parents must have had in youth she was above the average height of woman with strong swell of bosom and glorious erect carriage of head her features were coarse but regular and pleasing and her manner boyish  elder pill was on the best terms with them as he watched the milk being skimmed out of the submerged cans ready for the caaves and hawgs as mrs buttles called them  uncle told you t come here nd stay t supper did he whats come over him said the girl with a sort of audacious humor  bill has an awful grutch agin preachers said mrs buttles as she wiped her hands on her apron i declare i dont see how  some preachers not all preachers laughed pill in his mellow nasal there are preachers and then again preachers im one o the tother kind  i shd think y was laughed the girl  now eldory you run right t the pigpen with that milk whilst i go in an set the tea on  mr pill seized the can of milk saying with a twang show me the way that i may walk therein and accompanied by the laughing girl made rapid way to the pigpen just as the old man set up a ferocious shout to call the hired hand out of the cornfield  howd y come to send him here asked mrs buttles nodding toward pill  damfino i kind o liked himno nonsense about him answered bacon going into temporary eclipse behind his hands as he washed his face at the cistern  at the supper table pill was easy as an old shoe ate with his knife talked about fatting hogs suggested a few points on raising clover told of pioneer experiences in michigan and soon won themhired man and allto a most favorable opinion of himself but he did not trench on religious matters at all  the hired man in his shirtsleeves and smelling frightfully of tobacco and sweat as did bacon sat with open mouth at times forgetting to eat in his absorbing interest in the ministers yarns  yes ive got a family too much of a family in factthat is i think so sometimes when im pinched our western people are so indigentin plain terms poorthey cant do any better than they do but we pull throughwe pull through john you look like a stout fellow but ill bet a hat i can down you three out of five  i bet you cant grinned the hired man it was the climax of all that bet  ill take y in hand an flop y both roared bacon from his lionlike throat his eyes glistening with rare goodnature from the shadow of his gray brows but he admired the ministers broad shoulders at the same time if this fellow panned out as he promised he was a rare specimen  after supper the elder played a masterly game of croquet with eldora beating her with ease then he wandered out to the barn and talked horses with the hired man and finished by stripping off his coat and putting on one of mrs buttless aprons to help milk the cows  but at breakfast the next morning when the family were about pitching into their food as usual without ceremony the visitor spoke in an imperious tone and with lifted hand wait let us look to the lord for his blessing  they waited till the grace was said but it threw a depressing atmosphere over the group evidently they considered the trouble begun at the end of the meal the minister asked  have you a bible in the house  i reckon theres one around somewhere elly go n see f y cant raise one said mrs buttles indifferently  have you any objection to family devotion asked pill as the book was placed in his hands by the girl  no have all you want said bacon as he rose from the table and passed out the door  i guess ill see the thing through said the hand  it aint just square to leave the women folks to bear the brunt of it  it was shortly after breakfast that the elder concluded hed walk up to brother jenningss and see about church matters  i shall expect you brother bacon to be at the service at 230  all right go ahead expectun responded bacon with an inscrutable sidewise glance  you promised you remember  thedevili did the old man snarled  the elder looked back with a smile and went off whistling in the warm bright morning   ii   the schoolhouse down on the creek was known as hells corners all through the county because of the frequent rows that took place therein at corkuses and the like and also because of the number of teachers that had been ousted by the boys in fact it was one of those places still to be found occasionally in the west far from railroads and schools where the primitive ignorance and ferocity of men still prowl like the panthers which are also found sometimes in the deeps of the iowa timber lands  the most of this ignorance and ferocity however was centred in the family of dixons a darkskinned unsavory group of missourians it consisted of old man dixon and wife and six sons all mangrown great gaunt sinewy fellows with no education but superstitious as savages if anything went wrong in hells corners everybody knew that the dixons were on the rampage again the schoolteachers were warned against the dixons and the preachers were besought to convert the dixons  in fact john jennings as he drove pill to the schoolhouse next day said  if you can convert the dixon boys elder ill give you the best horse in my barn  i work not for such hire said mr pill with a look of deep solemnity on his face belied indeed by a twinkle in his small keen eyea twinkle which made milton jennings laugh candidly  there was considerable curiosity expressed by a murmur of lips and voices as the ministers tall figure entered the door and stood for a moment in a study of the scene before him it was a characteristically western scene the women sat on one side of the schoolroom the men on the other the front seats were occupied by squirming boys and girls in their sunday splendor  on the back to the right were the young men in their best vests with paper collars and butterfly neckties with their coats unbuttoned their hair plastered down in a fascinating wave on their brown foreheads not a few were in their shirtsleeves the older men sat immediately between the youths and boys talking in hoarse whispers across the aisles about the state of the crops and the county ticket while the women in much the same way conversed about the children and raising onions and strawberries it was their main recreation this sunday meeting  brethren rang out the imperious voice of the minister let us pray  the audience thoroughly enjoyed the elders prayer he was certainly gifted in that direction and his petition grew genuinely eloquent as his desires embraced the ends of the earth and the uttermst parts of the seas thereof but in the midst of it a clatter was heard and five or six strapping fellows filed in with loud thumpings of their brogans  shortly after they had settled themselves with elaborate impudence on the back seat the singing began just as they were singing the last verse every individual voice wavered and all but died out in astonishment to see william bacon come inan unheardof thing and with a clean shirt too bacon to tell the truth was feeling as much out of place as a cat in a bathtub and looked uncomfortable even shamefaced as he sidled in his shapeless hat gripped nervously in both hands coatless and collarless his shirt open at his massive throat the girls tittered of course and the boys hammered each others ribs moved by the unusual sight milton jennings sitting beside bettie moss said  well may i jump straight up and never come down  and shep watson said may i never see the back o my neck which pleased bettie so much that she grew quite purple with efforts to conceal her laughter she always enjoyed a joke on her father  but all things have an end and at last the room became quiet as mr pill began to read the scripture wondering a little at the commotion he suspected that those darkskinned grinning fellows on the back seat were the dixon boys and knew they were bent on fun the physique of the minister being carefully studied the boys began whispering among themselves and at last just as the sermon opened they began to push the line of young men on the long seat over toward the girls side squeezing milton against bettie this pleasantry encouraged one of them to whack his neighbor over the head with his soft hat causing great laughter and disturbance the preacher stopped his cool penetrating voice sounded strangely unclerical as he said  there are some fellows here today to have fun with me if they dont keep quiet theyll have more fun than they can hold at this point a green crabapple bounded up the aisle im not to be bulldozed  he pulled off his coat and laid it on the table before him and amid a wondering silence took off his cuffs and collar saying  i can preach the word of the lord just as well without my coat and i can throw rowdies out the door a little better in my shirtsleeves  had the dixon boys been a little shrewder as readers of human character or if they had known why old william bacon was there they would have kept quiet but it was not long before they began to push again and at last one of them gave a squeak and a tussle took place the preacher was in the midst of a sentence  an evil deed brethren is like unto a grain of mustard seed it is small but it grows steadily absorbing its like from the earth and air sending out roots and branches till at last  there was a scuffle and a snicker mr pill paused and gazed intently at tom dixon who was the most impudent and strongest of the gang then he moved slowly down on the astonished young savage as he came his eyes seemed to expand like those of an eagle in battle steady remorseless unwavering at the same time that his brows shut down over thema glance that hushed every breath the awed and astonished ruffians sat as if paralyzed by the unuttered yet terribly ferocious determination of the preachers eyes his right hand was raised the other was clenched at his waist there was a sort of solemnity in his approach like a tiger creeping upon a foe  at last after what seemed minutes to the silent motionless congregation his raised hand came down on the shoulder of the leader with the exact resistless precision of the tigers paw and the ruffian was snatched from his seat to the floor sprawling before he could rise the steellike grip of the roused preacher sent him halfway to the door and then out into the dirt of the road  turning pill strode down the aisle once more the halfrisen congregation made way for him curiously when he came within reach of dick the fellow struck savagely out at the preacher only to have his blow avoided by a lithe lightningswift movement of the body above the hips a trained boxers trick and to find himself lying bruised and dazed on the floor  by this time the other brothers had recovered from their stupor and with wild curses leaped over the benches toward the fearless preacher  but now a new voice was heard in the sudden uproara new but familiar voice it was the mighty voice of william bacon known far and wide as a terrible antagonist a man who had never been whipped he was like a wild beast excited to primitive savagery by the smell of blood  stand back you hellhounds he said leaping between them and the preacher you know me lay another hand on that man an by the livun god you answer t me back thear  some of the men cheered most stood irresolute the women crowded together the children began to scream with terror while through it all pill dragged his last assailant toward the door  bacon made his way down to where the dixons had halted undecided what to do if the preacher had the air and action of the tiger bacon looked the grisly bearhis eyebrows working up and down his hands clenched into frightful bludgeons his breath rushing through his hairy nostrils  git out o hyare he growled youve run things here jest about long enough git out  his hands were now on the necks of two of the boys and he was hustling them toward the door  if you want o whip the preacher meet him in the public roadone at a time hell take care o himself out with ye he ended kicking them out show your faces here agin an ill break ye in two  the noncombative farmers now began to see the humor of the whole transaction and began to laugh but they were cut short by the calm voice of the preacher at his desk  but a good deed brethren is like unto a grain of wheat planted in good earth that bringeth forth fruit in due season an hundred fold   iii   mr pill with all his seeming levity was a powerful hand at revivals as was developed at the protracted meetings at the grove during december indeed such was the pitiless intensity of his zeal that a gloom was cast over the whole township the ordinary festivities stopped or did not begin at all  the lyceum which usually began by the first week in december was put entirely out of the question as were the spellingschools and exhibitions the boys it is true still drove the girls to meeting in the usual manner but they all wore a furtive uneasy air and their laughter was not quite genuine at its best and died away altogether when they came near the schoolhouse and they hardly recovered from the effects of the preaching till a mile or two had been spun behind the shining runners it took all the magic of the jingle of the bells and the musical creak of the polished steel on the snow to win them back to laughter  as for elder pill he was as a man transformed he grew more intense each night and strode back and forth behind his desk and pounded the bible like an assassin no more games with the boys no more poking the girls under the chin when he asked for a chew of tobacco now it was with an air which said i ask it as sustenance that will give me strength for the lords service as if the demands of the flesh had weakened the spirit  old man bacon overtook milton jennings early one monday morning as milton was marching down toward the seminary at rock river it was intensely cold and still so cold and still that the ring of the cold steel of the heavy sleigh the snort of the horses and the old mans voice came with astonishing distinctness to the ears of the hurrying youth and it seemed a very long time before the old man came up  climb on he yelled out of his frosty beard he was seated on the hind bob of a woodsleigh on a couple of blankets milton clambered on knowing well hed freeze to death there  reckon i heerd you prowlun around the front door with my girl last night bacon said at length the way you both tend out t meetun ought o sanctify yeh must a stayed to the aftermeetun didnt yeh  nope the front part was enough for  danged if i was any more fooled with a man in m life i blieve the whole thing is a little scheme on the bretheren t raise a dollar  why so  waal y see pill aint got much out o the appintment thus fur and he aint likely to if he dont shake em up a leetle borrud ten dollars o me tother day  well thought milton whatever his real motive is elder pill is earning all he gets standing for two or three hours in his place night after night arguing pleading even commanding them to be saved  milton was describing the scenes of the meeting to bradley talcott and douglas radbourn the next day and radbourn a young law student said  id like to see him he must be a character  lets make up a party and go out said milton eagerly  all right ill speak to lily graham  accordingly that evening a party of students in a large sleigh drove out toward the schoolhouse along the drifted lanes and through the beautiful aisles of the snowy woods a merry party of young people who had no sense of sin to weigh them down even radbourn and lily joined in the songs which they sang to the swift clanging of the bells until the lights of the schoolhouse burned redly through the frosty air  not a few of the older people present felt scandalized by the singing and by the dancing of the town girls who could not for the life of them take the thing seriously the room was so little and hot and smoky and the men looked so queer in their rough coats and hair everywhichway  but they took their seats demurely on the back seat and joined in the opening songs and listened to the halting prayers of the brethren and the sonorous prayers of the elder with commendable gravity miss graham was a devout congregationalist and hushed the others into gravity when their eyes began to dance dangerously  however as mr pill warmed to his work the girls grew sober enough he awed them and frightened them with the savagery of his voice and manner his small gray eyes were like daggers unsheathed and his small round head took on a catlike ferocity as he strode to and fro hurling out his warnings and commands in a hoarse howl that terrified the sinner and drew amens of admiration from the saints  atavism he has gone back to the era of the medicine man radbourn murmured  as the speaker went on foam came upon his thin lips his lifted hand had prophecy and threatening in it his eyes reflected flames his voice had now the tone of the implacable vindictive judge he gloated on the pictures that his words called up by the power of his imagination the walls widened the floor was no longer felt the crowded room grew still as death every eye fixed on the speakers face  i tell you you must repent or die i can see the great judgment angel now he said stopping suddenly and pointing above the stovepipe i can see him as he stands weighing your souls as a man ud weigh wheat and chaff wheat goes into the fathers garner chaff is blown to hells devouring flame i can see him now he seizes a poor damned struggling soul by the neck he holds him over the flaming forge of hell till his bones melt like wax he shrivels like thread in the flame of a candle he is nothing but a charred husk and the angel flings him back into outer darkness life was not in him  it was this astonishing figure powerfully acted that scared poor tom dixon into crying out for mercy the effect upon others was painful to see so great a sinner fall terrorstricken seemed like a providential stroke of confirmatory evidence and nearly a dozen other young people fell crying whereat the old people burst out into amens of spasmodic fervor while the preacher the wild light still in his eyes tore up and down crying above the tumult  the lord is come with power his hand is visible here shout aloud and spare not fall before him as dust to his feet hypocrites vipers scoffers the lash o the lord is on ye  in the intense pause which followed as he waited with expectant uplifted facea pause so deep even the sobbing sinners held their breatha dry drawling utterly matteroffact voice broke the intense hush  say pill aint you abearun down on the boys a leetle too hard  the preachers extended arm fell as if life had gone out of it his face flushed and paled the people laughed hysterically some of them with the tears of terror still on their cheeks but radbourn said bravo bacon  pill recovered himself  not hard enough for you neighbor bacon  bacon rose retaining the same dry prosaic tone  i aint bitin that kind of a hook an i aint goin to be yanked into heaven when i cn slide into hell waal i must be goin ive got a newmilks cow that needs tendin to  the effect of all this was very great from being at the very mouth of the furnace quivering with fear and captive to morbid imaginings bacons dry intonation brought them all back to earth again they perceived something of the absurdity of the whole situation  pill was beaten for the first time in his life he had been struck below the belt by a goodnatured giant the best he could do as bacon shuffled calmly out was to stammer will some one please sing and while they sang he stood in deep thought just as the last verse was quivering into silence the full deep tones of radbourns voice rose above the bustle of feet and clatter of seats  and all that he preaches in the name of him who came bringing peace and goodwill to men  radbourns tone had in it reproach and a noble suggestion the people looked at him curiously the deacons nodded their heads together in counsel and when they turned to the desk pill was gone  gee whittaker that was tough said milton to radbourn knocked the wind out o him like a cannonball whatll he do now  he cant do anything but acknowledge his foolishness  you no business t come here an sturb the lords meetin cried old daddy brown to radbourn youre a sinner and a scoffer  i thought bacon was the disturbing ele  youre just as bad  hes all right said william councill ive got sick mself of bein scared into religion i never was so fooled in a man in my life if id tell you what pill said to me the other day when we was in robies store youd fall in a fit an to hear him talkin here tnight is enough to make a horse laugh  youre all in league with the devil said the old man wildly and so the battle raged on  milton and radbourn escaped from it and got out into the clear cold untainted night  the heat of the furnace doesnt reach as far as the horses radbourn moralized as he aided in unhitching the shivering team in the vast calm spaces of the stars among the animals such scenes as we have just seen are impossible he lifted his hand in a lofty gesture the light fell on his pale face and dark eyes the girls were a little indignant and disposed to take the preachers part they thought bacon had no right to speak out that way and miss graham uttered her protest as they whirled away on the homeward ride with pleasant jangle of bells  but the secret of it all was said radbourn in answer pill knew he was acting a part i dont mean that he meant to deceive but he got excited and his audience responded as an audience does to an actor of the first class and he was for the time in earnest his imagination did see those horrorshe was swept away by his own words but when bacon spoke his dry tone and homely words brought everybody preacher and all back to the earth with a thump everybody saw that after weeping and wailing there for an hour theyd go home feed the calves hang up the lantern put out the cat wind the clock and go to bed in other words they all came back out of their barbaric powwow to their natural modern selves  this explanation had palpable truth but lily perceived that it had wider application than to the meeting they had just left  theyll be music around this clearing tomorrow said milton with a sigh wish i was at home this week  but whatll become of mr pill  oh hell come out all right radbourn assured her and miltons clear tenor rang out as he drew eileen closer to his side    o silver moon o silver moon   you set you set too soon   the morrow day is far away   the night is but begun   iv   the news grotesquely exaggerated flew about the next day and at night though it was very cold and windy the house was jammed to suffocation on these lonely prairies life is so devoid of anything but work dramatic entertainments are so few and appetite so keen that a temperature of twenty degrees below zero is no bar to a trip of ten miles the protracted meeting was the only recreation for many of them the gossip before and after service was a delight not to be lost and this last sensation was dramatic enough to bring out old men and women who had not dared to go to church in winter for ten years  long before seven oclock the schoolhouse blazed with light and buzzed with curious speech team after team drove up to the door and as the drivers leaped out to receive the women they said in low but eager tones to the bystanders  meeting begun yet  nope  what kind of a time y havin over here any way  a mighty solumn time somebody would reply with a low laugh  by seven oclock every inch of space was occupied the air was frightful the kerosene lamps gave off gas and smoke the huge stove roared itself into an angry red on its jackoak grubs and still people crowded in at the door  discussion waxed hot as the stove two or three universalists boldly attacked everybody who came their way a tall man stood on a bench in the corner and thumping his bible wildly with his fist exclaimed at the top of his voice  there is no hell at all the bible says the wicked perish utterly they are consumed as ashes when they die they perish as dogs  what kind o docterin is that asked a short man of councill  i dknow its ol sam richards calls himself a christianchristadelphian r some newfangled name  at last people began to inquire well aint he comin  most time fr the elder to come aint it  oh i guess hes preparin a sermon  john jennings pushed anxiously to daddy brown  aint the elder comin  i dknow he didnt stay at my house  he didnt  no thought he went home with you  i aint see im t all ill ask councill brother councill seen anything of the elder  no didnt he go home with bensen  i dn know ill see  this was enough to start the news that pill had skipped  this the deacons denied saying hed come or send word  outside on the leeward side of the house the young men who couldnt get in stood restlessly now dancing a jig now kicking their huge boots against the underpinning to warm their toes they talked spasmodically as they swung their arms about their chests speaking from behind their huge buffalocoat collars  the wind roared through the creaking oaks the horses stirred complainingly the bells on their backs crying out querulously the heads of the fortunates inside were shadowed outside on the snow and the restless young men amused themselves betting on which head was bensen and which councill  at last some one pounded on the desk inside the suffocating but lively crowd turned with painful adjustment toward the desk from whence deacon bensens high smooth voice sounded  brethren an sisters elder pill haint comeand as its about eight oclock he probably wont come tonight after the disturbances last night itsaawere all the more determined totheaneed of reforming grace is more felt than ever let us hope nothing has happened to the elder ill go see tomorrow and if he is unable to comeill see brother wheat of cresco after prayer by brother jennings we will adjourn till tomorrow night brother jennings will you lead us in prayer some one snickered i hope the disgracefulascenes of last night will not be repeated  wheres pill demanded a voice in the back part of the room thats what i want to know  hes a bad pill said another repeating a pun already old  i guess so he borrowed twenty dollars o me last week said the first voice  he owes me for a pig shouted a short man excitedly i believe hes skipped to get rid o his debts  so do i i allus said he was a mighty queer preacher  hed bear watchin was my idee fust time i ever see him  careful brethrencareful he may come at any minute  i dont care if he does id bone him fr pay fr that shote preacher r no preacher said bartlett a little nervously  high words followed this and there was prospect of a fight the pressure of the crowd however was so great it was wellnigh impossible for two belligerents to get at each other the meeting broke up at last and the people chilly soured and disappointed at the lack of developments went home saying pill was scaly no preacher who chawed terbacker was to be trusted and when it was learned that the horse and buggy he drove he owed jennings and bensen for everybody said hes a fraud   v   in the meantime andrew pill was undergoing the most singular and awful mental revolution  when he leaped blindly into his cutter and gave his horse the rein he was wild with rage and shame and a sort of fear as he sat with bent head he did not hear the tread of the horse and did not see the trees glide past the rabbit leaped away under the shadow of the thick groves of young oaks the owl scared from its perch went fluttering off into the cold crisp air but he saw only the contemptuous quizzical face of old william baconone shaggy eyebrow lifted a smile showing through his shapeless beard  he saw the colorless handsome face of radbourn and his look of reproach and note of suggestionradbourn one of the best thinkers in rock river and the most generally admired young man in rock county  when he saw and heard bacon his hurt pride flamed up in wrath but the calm voice of radbourn and the look in his stern accusing eyes made his head fall in thought as he rode things grew clearer as a matter of fact his whole system of religious thought was like the side of a shelving sandbankin unstable equilibriumneeding only a touch to send it slipping into a shapeless pile at the rivers edge that touch had been given and he was now in the midst of the motion of his falling faith he didnt know how much would stand when the sloughing ended  andrew pill had been a variety of things a farmer a drygoods merchant and a travelling salesman but in a revival quite like this of his own he had been converted and his life changed he now desired to help his fellowmen to a better life and willingly went out among the farmers where pay was small it was not true therefore that he had gone into it because there was little work and good pay he was really an able man and would have been a success in almost anything he undertook but his reading and thought his easy intercourse with men like bacon and radbourn had long since undermined any real faith in the current doctrine of retribution and tonight as he rode into the night he was feeling it all and suffering it all forced to acknowledge at last what had been long moving  the horse took the wrong road and plodded along steadily carrying him away from his home but he did not know it for a long time when at last he looked up and saw the road leading out upon the wide plain between the belts of timber leading away to rock river he gave a sigh of relief he could not meet his wife then he must have a chance to think  over him the glittering infinite sky of winter midnight soared passionless yet accusing in its calmness sweetness and majesty what was he that he could dogmatize on eternal life and the will of the being who stood behind that veil and then would come rushing back that scene in the schoolhouse the smell of the steaming garments the gases from the lamps the roar of the stove the sound of his own voice strident dominating so alien to his present mood he could only shudder at it  he was worn out with thinking when he drove into the stable at the merchants house and roused up the sleeping hostler who looked at him suspiciously and demanded pay in advance this seemed right in his present mood he was not to be trusted  when he flung himself face downward on his bed the turmoil in his brain was still going on he couldnt hold one thought or feeling long all seemed slipping like water from his hands  he had in him great capacity for change for growth circumstances had been against his development thus far but the time had come when growth seemed to be defeat and failure   vi   radbourn was thinking about him two days after as he sat in his friend judge browns law office poring over a volume of law he saw that bacons treatment had been heroic he couldnt get the pitiful confusion of the preachers face out of his mind but after all bacons seizing of just that instant was a stroke of genius  some one touched him on the arm and he turned  whyeldermr pill how de do sit down draw up a chair  there was trouble in the preachers face can i see you radbourn alone  certainly come right into this room no one will disturb us there  now what can i do for you he said as they sat down  i want to talk to you aboutabout religion said pill with a little timid pause in his voice  radbourn looked grave im afraid youve come to a dangerous man  i want you to tell me what you think i know youre a student i want to talk about my case pursued the preacher with a curious hesitancy i want to ask a few questions on things  very well sail in ill do the best i can said radbourn  ive been thinking a good deal since that night ive come to the conclusion that i dont believe what ive been preaching i thought i did but i didnt i dont know what i believe seems as if the land had slid from under my feet what am i to do  say so replied radbourn his eyes kindling say so and get out of it theres nothing worse than staying where you are what have you saved from the general landslide  pill smiled a little i dont know  want me to crossexamine you and see eh very well here goes he settled back with a smile you believe in square dealing between man and man  certainly  you believe in good deeds candor and steadfastness  i do  you believe in justice equality of opportunity and in liberty  certainly i do  you believe in short that a man should do unto others as hed have others do unto him think right and live out his thoughts  all that i steadfastly believe  well i guess your landslide was mostly imaginary the face of the eternal rock is laid bare you didnt recognize it at first thats all one question more you believe in getting at truth  certainly  well truth is only found from the generalizations of facts before calling a thing true study carefully all accessible facts make your religion practical the matteroffact tone of bacon would have had no force if you had been preaching an earnest morality in place of an antiquated terrorism  i know it i know it sighed pill looking down  well now go back and tell em so and then if you cant keep your place preaching what you do believe get into something else for the sake of all morality and manhood dont go on cursing yourself with hypocrisy  mr pill took a chew of tobacco rather distractedly and said  id like to ask you a few questions  no not now you think out your present position yourself find out just what you have saved from your landslide  the elder man rose he hardly seemed the same man who had dominated his people a few days before he turned with still greater embarrassment  i want to ask a favor im going back to my family im going to say something of what youve said to my congregationbutim in debtand the moment they know im a backslider theyre going to bear down on me pretty heavy id like to be independent  i see how much do you need mused radbourn  i guess two hundred would stave off the worst of them  i guess brown and i can fix that come in again tonight or no ill bring it round to you  the two men parted with a silent pressure of the hand that meant more than any words  when mr pill told his wife that he could preach no more she cried and gasped and scolded till she was in danger of losing her breath entirely a guineahen sort of a woman councill called her she can talk more an say less n any woman i ever see was bacons verdict after she had been at dinner at his house she was a perpetual irritant  mr pill silenced her at last with a note of impatience approaching a threat and drove away to the corners to make his confession without her it was saturday night and elder wheat was preaching as he entered the crowded room a buzz and mumble of surprise stopped the orator for a few moments and he shook hands with mr pill dubiously not knowing what to think of it all but as he was in the midst of a very effective oratorical scene he went on  the silent man at his side felt as if he were witnessing a burlesque of himself as he listened to the pitiless and lurid description of torment which elder wheat poured forththe same figures and threats he had used a hundred times he stirred uneasily in his seat while the audience paid so little attention that the perspiring little orator finally called for a hymn saying  elder pill has returned from his unexpected absence and will exhort in his proper place  when the singing ended mr pill rose looking more like himself than since the previous sunday a quiet resolution was in his eyes and voice as he said  elder wheat has more right here than i have i want o say that im going to give up my church in douglass and a murmur broke out which he silenced with his raised hand i find i dont believe any longer what ive been believing and preaching hold on let me go on i dont quite know where ill bring up but i think my religion will simmer down finally to about this a full halfbushel to the halfbushel and sixteen ounces to the pound here two or three cheered do unto others as youd have others do unto you applause from several quickly suppressed as the speaker went on elder wheat listening as if petrified with his mouth open  im going out of preaching at least for the present after things get into shape with me again i may set up to teach people how to live but just now i cant do it ive got all i can do to instruct myself just one thing more i owe two or three of you here ive got the money for william bacon james bartlett and john jennings i turn the mare and cutter over to jacob bensen for the note he holds i haint got much religion left but ive got some morality thats all i want to say now  when he sat down there was a profound hush then bacon arose  thats mans talk that is an i jest want o say andrew pill that you kin jest forgit you owe me anything an if ye want any help come to me yre jest gittun ready to preach n im ready to give ye my support  thats the talk said councill im with ye on that  pill shook his head the painful silence which followed was broken by the effusive voice of wheat  let us prayand remember our lost brother                                       the urgings of the people were of no avail mr pill settled up his affairs and moved to cresco where he went back into trade with a friend and for three years attended silently to his customers lived down their curiosity and studied anew the problem of life then he moved away and no one knew whither  one day last year bacon met jennings on the road  heerd anything o pill lately  no have you  waal yes brown told me he ran acrost him down in eelinoy doun well too  in dry goods  no preachun  preachun  so brown said kind of a freefrall church i reckon from what jedge told me built a new church fills it twice a sunday id like to hear him but hes got t be too big a gun fr us ben studyun they say went t school  jennings drove sadly and thoughtfully on  rather stumps brother jennings laughed bacon in a goodhumored growl     a day of grace   sunday is the day for courtship on the prairie it has also the piety of cleanliness it allows the young man to get back to a selfrespecting sweetness of person and enables the girls to look as nature intended dainty and sweet as posies  the change from everyday clothing on the part of young workmen like ben griswold was more than change it approached transformation it took more than courage to go through the changeit required love  ben arose a little later on sunday morning than on weekdays but there were the chores to do as usual the horses must be watered fed and curried and the cows were to milk but after breakfast ben threw off the cares of the hired hand when he came down from the little garret into which the hot august sun streamed redly he was a changed creature clean from tip to toe newly shaven wearing a crackling white shirt a linen collar and a new suit of store clothes he felt himself a man again fit to meet maidens  his partner being a married man was slouching around in his tattered and greasy brown denim overalls he looked at ben and grinned  got a tag on yrself  no why  nobody know ye if anything happened on the road theres thirty dollars gone to the dogs he sighed oh well youll get over that just as i did  i hope i wont get over liking to be clean ben said a little sourly i wont be back to milk  didnt expect ye thats the very time o day the girls are purtiestjust about sundown better take rock i may want the old team myself  ben hitched up and drove off in the warm bright morning with wonderful elation clean and selfrespecting once more his freshly shaven face felt cool and his new suit fitted him well his heart took on a great resolution which was to call upon grace  the thought of her made his brown hands shake and he remembered how many times he had sworn to visit her but had failed of courage though it seemed she had invited him by word and look to do so  he overtook milton jennings on his way along the poplarlined lane  hello milt where you bound  milton glanced up with a curious look in his laughing eyes from the pockets of his long linen duster he drew a handful of beautiful scarlet and yellow siberian crabapples  see them crabs  yes i see em  milton drew a similar handful out of his left pocket see those  what y going to do with em  take em home again  something in miltons voice led him to ask soberly  what did you intend doing with em  present em to miss cole  well why didnt y do it  milton showed his white teeth in a smile that was frankly derisive of himself  well when i got over there i found young conleys sorrel hitched to one post and walt browns gray hitched to the other i went in but i didnt stay long in fact i didnt sit down i was afraid those infernal apples would roll out o my pockets i was afraid theyd find out i brought em over there for miss cole like the darn fool i was  they both laughed heartily milton was always as severe upon himself as upon any one else  thats tough said ben but climb in and lets go to sundayschool  milton got in and they ate the apples as they rode along  the grove schoolhouse was the largest in the township and was the only one with a touch of redeeming grace it was in a lovely spot great oaks stood all about and back of it the woods grew thick and a clear creek gurgled over its limestone bed not far away  to ben and milton there was a wondrous charm about the grove schoolhouse it was the one place where the boys and girls met in garments disassociated from toil sundays in summer and on winter nights at lyceums or protracted meetings the boys came to see the girls in their bright dresses with their clear and so it seemed scornful bright eyes  all through the service ben sat where he could see grace by turning his head but he had not the courage to do so once or twice he caught a glimpse of the curve of her cheek and the delicate lines of her ear and a suffocating throb came into his throat  he wanted to ask her to go with him down to cedarville to the methodist campmeeting but he knew it was impossible he could not even say good day when she took pains to pass near him after church he nodded like a great idiot all ease and dignity lost his throat too dry and hot to utter a sound  he cursed his shyness as he went out after his horse he saw her picking her dainty way up the road with conrad sieger walking by her side what made it worse for ben was a dim feeling that she liked him and would go with him if he had the courage to ask her  well ben said milton its settled we go to rock river tonight to the campmeeting did you ask grace  no shes going with con its just my blasted luck  thats too bad well come with us take maud  as he rode away ben passed grace on the road  going to the campmeeting con asked milton in merry voice  i guess so said conrad a handsome but slowwitted german  as they went on ben could have wept his keener perception told him there was a look of appeal in graces upturned eyes  he made a poor companion at dinner and poor plain maud knew his mind was elsewhere she was used to that and accepted it with a pathetic attempt to color it differently  they got away about five oclock  ben drove the team driving took his mind off his weakness and failure while milton in the seclusion of the back seat of the carryall was happy with amelia turner  it was growing dark as they entered upon the curving road along the river which was a relief from the rectangular and sunsmitten roads of the prairie they lingered under the great oaks and elms which shaded them it would have been perfect ben thought if grace had been beside him in mauds place  he wondered how he should manage to speak to grace there was a time when it seemed easier now the consciousness of his love made the simplest question seem like the great question of all  other teams were on the road some returning some going a campmeeting had come to be an annual amusement like a circus and young people from all over the country drove down on sundays as if to some celebration with fireworks  theres the lane said milton see that team goin in  ben pulled up and they looked at it doubtfully it looked dangerously miry it was quite dark now and ben said  thats a scaly piece of road  oh thats all right hark  as they listened they could hear the voice of the exhorter nearly a mile away it pushed across the cool spaces with a wild and savage sound the young people thrilled with excitement  insects were singing in the grass frogs with deepening chorus seemed to announce the coming of night and above these peaceful sounds came the wild shouts of the faroff preacher echoing through the cool green arches of the splendid grove  the girls became silent as the voice grew louder  lights appeared ahead and the road led up a slight hill to a gate ben drove on under a grove of oaks past dimly lighted tents whose open flaps showed tumbled beds and tables laden with crockery heavy women were moving about inside their shadows showing against the tent walls like figures in a pantomime  the young people alighted in curious silence as they stood a moment tying the team the preacher lifted his voice in a brazen clanging monotonous reiteration of worn phrases  come to the lord come now come to the light jesus will give it now is the appointed timecome to the light  from a tent near by arose the groaning gasping gurgling scream of a woman in mortal agony  o my god  it was charged with the most piercing distress it cut to the hearts palpitating centre like a poniard thrust it had murder and outrage in it  the girls clutched ben and milton oh lets go home  no lets go and see what it all is  the girls hung close to the arms of the young men and they went down to the tent and looked in  it was filled with a motley throng of people most of them seated on circling benches a fringe of careless or scoffing onlookers stood back against the tent wall many of them were strangers to ben  occasionally a norwegian farmhand or a bevy of young people from some near district lifted the flap and entered with curious or laughing or insolent faces  the tent was lighted dimly by kerosene lamps hung in brackets against the poles and by stable lanterns set here and there upon the benches  ben and milton ushered the girls in and seated them a little way back the girls smiled but only faintly the undertone of womens cries moved them in spite of their scorn of it all  what cursed foolishness said ben to milton  milton smiled but did not reply he only nodded toward the exhorter a man with a puffy jumble of features and the form of a gladiator who was uttering wild and explosive phrases  oh my friends i bless the lord for the shall in the word you shall get light you shall be saved oh the shall in the word you shall be redeemed  as he grew more excited his hoarse voice rose in furious screams as if he were defying hells legions foam lay on his lips and flew from his mouth at every repetition of the word shall he struck the desk a resounding blow with his great palm  hes a hard hitter said milton  at length he leaped apparently in uncontrollable excitement upon the mourners bench and ran up and down close to the listening moaning audience he walked with a furious rhythmic stamping action like a sioux in the war dance wild cries burst from his audience antiphonal with his own  he shall send light  send thy arrows o lord  o god come  he shall keep his word  one old negro woman fat powerful and gloomy suddenly arose and uttered a scream that had the dignity and savagery of a mountain lions cry it rang far out into the night  the exhorter continued his mad furious thumping barbaric walk  behind him a row of other exhorters sat a relay ready to leap to his aid they urged on the tumult with wild cries  amen brother  yes brother yes clapping their hands in rhythm  the exhorter redoubled his fury he was like a jaded actor rising at applause carried out of his selfcommand  out of the obscure tumult of faces and tossing hands there came at last certain recognizable features the people were mainly farming folks of the more ignorant sort rude in dress and bearing hard and bent with toil they were recognizably of a class subject to these low forms of religious excitement which were once wellnigh universal  the outer fringe continued to smile scornfully and to jest yet they were awed in a way by this suddenly revealed deep of barbaric emotion  the girls were appalled by the increasing clangor milton was amused but ben grew bitter something strong came out in him too his lip curled in disgust  suddenly out of the level space of bowed shoulders tossing hands and frenzied upturned faces a young girl leaped erect she was strong and handsome powerful in the waist and shoulders her hair was braided like a childs and fell down her back in a single strand her head was girlish but her face looked old and drawn and tortured  she moaned pitifully she clapped her hands with wild gestures ending in a quivering motion the action grew to lightninglike quickness her head seemed to set in its socket her whole body stiffened gasping moans came from her clenched teeth as she fell to the ground and rolled under the seats wallowing in the muddy straw and beating her feet upon the ground like a dying partridge  the people crowded about her but the preacher roared above the tumult  si down never mind that party shes all right shes in the hands of the lord  the people settled into their seats and the wild tumult went on again ben rose to go over where the girl was and the others followed  a young man seated by the struggling sinner held her hand and fanned her with his hat while some girl friends scared and sobbing kept the tossing limbs covered she rolled from side to side restlessly thrusting forth her tongue as if her throat were dry she looked like a dying animal  maud clung to milton  oh cant something be done  her soul is burdened for you cried a wild old woman to the impassive youth who clung to the frenzied girls hand  a moment later as the demoniacal chorus of yells songs incantations shrieks groans and prayers swelled high a farmers wife on the left uttered a hoarse cry and stiffened and fell backward upon the ground she rolled her head from side to side her eyes turned in her lips wore a maniacs laugh and her troubled brow made her look like the death mask of a tortured murderer the hell horror frozen on it  she sank at last into a hideous calm with her strained and stiffened hands pointing weirdly up she was like marble she did not move a hairs breadth during the next two hours  over to the left a young man leaped to his feet with a scream  jesus jesus jesus  the great negress caught him in her arms as he fell and laid him down then leaped up and down shrieking  o jesus come come gods lamb  around her a dozen women took up her cry most of them had no voices their horrifying screams had become hoarse hisses yet still they strove scores of voices were mixed in the pandemonium of prayer  all order was lost three of the preachers now stood shouting before the mourners bench two were in the aisles  one came down the aisle toward the girl with the braided hair as he came he prayed foam was on his lips but his eyes were cool and calculating they betrayed him  as he came he fixed his gaze upon a woman seated near the prostrate girl and with a horrible outcry the victim leaped into the air and stiffened as if smitten with epilepsy she fell against some scared boys who let her fall striking her head against the seats she too rolled down upon the straw and lay beside her sister both had round pretty but childish faces  miltons party retreated they smiled no more they were horrorstricken  squads of workers now moved down the aisles in one they surrounded two people a tall fair girl and a young man  why its grace exclaimed maud  ben turned quickly where  they pointed her out  she cant get away see oh boys dont let them  ben pushed his way toward her his face set in a fierce frown bitter desperate  grace stood silently beside one of the elders a woman exhorter stood before her conrad overawed had fallen into a trembling stupor grace was defenseless  the elders hand hovered over her head on her face a deadly pallor had settled her eyes were cast down she breathed painfully and trembled from head to foot she was about to fall when ben set his eyes upon her  get out o my way he shouted shouldering up the aisle his words had oaths his fists were like mauls  grace he cried and she heard she looked up and saw him coming the red flamed over her face  the power of the preacher was gone  let me go she cried trying to wring herself loose  you are going to hell you are lost if you do not  god damn ye get out o way ill kill ye if you lay a hand on her  with one thrust ben cleared her tormentor from her arm for one moment the wordless young man looked into her eyes then she staggered toward him he faced the preacher  id smash hell out o you for a leather cent he said in the tumult his words were lost but the look on his face was enough the exhorter fell away  their retreat was unnoted in the tumult at the door they looked back for an instant at the scene  at the mourners bench were six victims in all stages of induced catalepsy one man with head flung back one with his hands pointing fixed in furious appeal another with bowed head was being worked upon by a brother of hypnotic appeal he struck with downward positive gestures on either side of the victims head  over another the negress towered screaming with pantherlike ferocity  git under de blood git under de blood  as she screamed she struck down at the mourner with her clenched fist on her face was the grin of a wildcat  out under the cool lofty oaks the outcry was more inexpressibly hellish because overhead the wind rustled the sweet green leaves crickets were chirping and the scent of flowering fields of buckwheat was in the air  grace grew calmer but she clung with strange weakness to her lover she felt he had saved her from something she did not know what but it was something terrifying to look back upon  conrad was forgottenset aside ben bundled him into the carryall and took his place with grace he no longer hesitated argued or apologized he had claimed his own  on the long ride home grace lay within his right arm and the young mans tongue was unchained he talked and his spirit grew tender and manly and husbandlike as he told his plans and his hopes hell was very far away and heaven was very near     lucretia burns  i   lucretia burns had never been handsome even in her days of early girlhood and now she was middleaged distorted with work and childbearing and looking faded and worn as one of the boulders that lay beside the pasture fence near where she sat milking a large white cow  she had no shawl or hat and no shoes for it was still muddy in the little yard where the cattle stood patiently fighting the flies and mosquitoes swarming into their skins already wet with blood the evening was oppressive with its heat and a ring of justseen thunderheads gave premonitions of an approaching storm  she rose from the cows side at last and taking her pails of foaming milk staggered toward the gate the two pails hung from her lean arms her bare feet slipped on the filthy ground her greasy and faded calico dress showed her tired and swollen ankles and the mosquitoes swarmed mercilessly on her neck and bedded themselves in her colorless hair  the children were quarrelling at the well and the sound of blows could be heard calves were querulously calling for their milk and little turkeys lost in a tangle of grass were piping plaintively  the sun just setting struck through a long low rift like a boy peeping beneath the eaves of a huge roof its light brought out lucretias face as she leaned her sallow forehead on the top bar of the gate and looked toward the west  it was a pitifully worn almost tragic facelong thin sallow holloweyed the mouth had long since lost the power to shape itself into a kiss and had a droop at the corners which seemed to announce a breakingdown at any moment into a despairing wail the collarless neck and sharp shoulders showed painfully  she felt vaguely that the night was beautiful the setting sun the noise of frogs the nocturnal insects beginning to pipeall in some way called her girlhood back to her though there was little in her girlhood to give her pleasure her large gray eyes grew round deep and wistful as she saw the illimitable craggy clouds grow crimson roll slowly up and fire at the top a childish scream recalled her  oh my soul she half groaned half swore as she lifted her milk and hurried to the well arriving there she cuffed the children right and left with all her remaining strength saying in justification  my soul cant youyou younguns give me a minutes peace land knows im almost gone up washin an milkin six cows and tendin you and cookin fr him ought o be enough fr one day sadie you let him drink now r ill slap your head off you hateful thing why cant you behave when you know im jest about dead she was weeping now with nervous weakness wheres yr pa she asked after a moment wiping her eyes with her apron  one of the group the one cuffed last sniffed out in rage and grief  hes in the cornfield whered ye spose he was  good land why dont the man work all night sile you put that dipper in that milk agin an ill whack you till your headll swim sadie le go pet an go n get them turkeys out of the grass fore it gits dark bob you go tell yr dad if he wants the rest o them cows milked hes got o do it himself i jest cant and whats more i wont she ended rebelliously  having strained the milk and fed the children she took some skimmed milk from the cans and started to feed the calves bawling strenuously behind the barn the eager and unruly brutes pushed and struggled to get into the pails all at once and in consequence spilt nearly all of the milk on the ground this was the last trial the woman fell down on the damp grass and moaned and sobbed like a crazed thing the children came to seek her and stood around like little partridges looking at her in scared silence till at last the little one began to wail then the mother rose wearily to her feet and walked slowly back toward the house  she heard burns threshing his team at the well with the sound of oaths he was tired hungry and illtempered but she was too desperate to care his poor overworked team did not move quickly enough for him and his extra long turn in the corn had made him dangerous his eyes gleamed wrathfully from his dustlaid face  supper ready he growled  yes two hours ago  well i cant help it he said understanding her reproach that devilish corn is gettin too tall to plough again and ive got o go through it tomorrow or not at all cows milked  part of em  how many left  three  hell which three  spot and brin and cherry  of course left the three worst ones ill be damned if i milk a cow tonight i dont see why you play out jest the nights i need ye most here he kicked a child out of the way git out o that haint you got no sense ill learn ye  stop that sim burns cried the woman snatching up the child youre a reglar ol hyenythats what you are she added defiantly roused at last from her lethargy  youre abeauty thats what you are he said pitilessly keep your brats out fum under my feet and he strode off to the barn after his team leaving her with a fierce hate in her heart she heard him yelling at his team in their stalls git around there damn yeh  the children had had their supper so she took them to bed she was unusually tender to them for she wanted to make up in some way for her previous harshness the ferocity of her husband had shown up her own petulant temper hideously and she sat and sobbed in the darkness a long time beside the cradle where little pet slept  she heard burns come growling in and tramp about but she did not rise the supper was on the table he could wait on himself there was an awful feeling at her heart as she sat there and the house grew quiet she thought of suicide in a vague way of somehow taking her children in her arms and sinking into a lake somewhere where she would never more be troubled where she could sleep forever without toil or hunger  then she thought of the little turkeys wandering in the grass of the children sleeping at last of the quiet wonderful stars then she thought of the cows left unmilked and listened to them stirring uneasily in the yard she rose at last and stole forth she could not rid herself of the thought that they would suffer she knew what the dull ache in the full breasts of a mother was and she could not let them stand at the bars all night moaning for relief  the mosquitoes had gone but the frogs and katydids still sang while over in the west venus shone she was a long time milking the cows her hands were so tired she had often to stop and rest them while the tears fell unheeded into the pail she saw and felt little of the external as she sat there she thought in vague retrospect of how sweet it seemed the first time sim came to see her of the many rides to town with him when he was an accepted lover of the few things he had given hera coral breastpin and a ring  she felt no shame at her present miserable appearance she was past personal pride she hardly felt as if the tall strong girl attractive with health and hope could be the same soul as the woman who now sat in utter despair listening to the heavy breathing of the happy cows grateful for the relief from their burden of milk  she contrasted her lot with that of two or three women that she knew not a very high standard who kept hired help and who had fine houses of four or five rooms even the neighbors were better off than she for they didnt have such quarrels but she wasnt to blamesim didntthen her mind changed to a dull resentment against things everything seemed against her  she rose at last and carried her second load of milk to the well strained it washed out the pails and after bathing her tired feet in a tub that stood there she put on a pair of horrible shoes without stockings and crept stealthily into the house sim did not hear her as she slipped up the stairs to the little low unfinished chamber beside her oldest children she could not bear to sleep near him that nightshe wanted a chance to sob herself to quiet  as for sim he was a little disturbed but would as soon have cut off his head as acknowledged himself in the wrong as he went to bed and found her still away he yelled up the stairway  say old woman aint ye comin to bed upon receiving no answer he rolled his aching body into the creaking bed do as y damn please about it if y want to sulk y can and in such wise the family grew quiet in sleep while the moist warm air pulsed with the ceaseless chime of the crickets   ii   when sim burns woke the next morning he felt a sharper twinge of remorse it was not a broad or welldefined feelingjust a sense that he had been unduly irritable not that on the whole he was not in the right little pet lay with the warm june sunshine filling his baby eyes curiously content in striking at flies that buzzed around his little mouth  the man thrust his dirty naked feet into his huge boots and without washing his face or combing his hair went out to the barn to do his chores  he was a type of the average prairie farmer and his whole surrounding was typical of the time he had a quartersection of fine level land bought with incredible toil but his house was a little boxlike structure costing perhaps five hundred dollars it had three rooms and the everpresent summer kitchen at the back it was unpainted and had no touch of beautya mere box  his stable was built of slabs and banked and covered with straw it looked like a den was low and long and had but one door in the end the cowyard held ten or fifteen cattle of various kinds while a few calves were bawling from a pen near by behind the barn on the west and north was a fringe of willows forming a windbreak a few broken and discouraged fruit trees standing here and there among the weeds formed the garden in short he was spoken of by his neighbors as a hardworking cuss and tolably well fixed  no grace had come or ever could come into his life back of him were generations of men like himself whose main business had been to work hard live miserably and beget children to take their places when they died  his courtship had been delayed so long on account of poverty that it brought little of humanizing emotion into his life he never mentioned his lovelife now or if he did it was only to sneer obscenely at it he had long since ceased to kiss his wife or even speak kindly to her there was no longer any sanctity to life or love he chewed tobacco and toiled on from year to year without any very clearly defined idea of the future his life was mainly regulated from without  he was tall dark and strong in a flatchested slouching sort of way and had grown neglectful of even decency in his dress he wore the american farmers customary outfit of rough brown pants hickory shirt and greasy wool hat it differed from his neighbors mainly in being a little dirtier and more ragged his grimy hands were broad and strong as the clutch of a bear and he was a terrible feller to turn off work as councill said id ruther have sim burns work for me one day than some men three hes a linger he worked with unusual speed this morning and ended by milking all the cows himself as a sort of savage penance for his misdeeds the previous evening muttering in selfdefence  seems s if ever cussid thing piles on to me at once that corn the roadtax and hayin comin on and now she gits her back up  when he went back to the well he sloshed himself thoroughly in the horsetrough and went to the house he found breakfast ready but his wife was not in sight the older children were clamoring around the uninviting breakfast table spread with cheap ware and with boiled potatoes and fried salt pork as the principal dishes  wheres yr ma he asked with a threatening note in his voice as he sat down by the table  shes in the bedroom  he rose and pushed open the door the mother sat with the babe in her lap looking out of the window down across the superb field of timothy moving like a lake of purple water she did not look around she only grew rigid her thin neck throbbed with the pulsing of blood to her head  whats got into you now he said brutally dont be a fool come out and eat breakfast with me an take care o yr young ones  she neither moved nor made a sound with an oath he turned on his heel and went out to the table eating his breakfast in his usual wolfish fashion he went out into the hot sun with his team and ridingplough not a little disturbed by this new phase of his wifes cantankerousness he ploughed steadily and sullenly all the forenoon in the terrific heat and dust the air was full of tempestuous threats still and sultry one of those days when work is a punishment when he came in at noon he found things the samedinner on the table but his wife out in the garden with the youngest child  i cn stand it as long as she can he said to himself in the hearing of the children as he pushed back from the table and went back to work  when he had finished the field of corn it was after sundown and he came up to the house hot dusty his shirt wringing wet with sweat and his neck aching with the work of looking down all day at the cornrows his mood was still stern the multitudinous lift and stir and sheen of the wide green field had been lost upon him  i wonder if shes milked them cows he muttered to himself he gave a sigh of relief to find she had but she had done so not for his sake but for the sake of the poor patient dumb brutes  when he went to the bedroom after supper he found that the cradle and his wifes few little boxes and parcelspoor pathetic propertieshad been removed to the garret which they called a chamber and he knew he was to sleep alone again  shell git over it i guess he was very tired but he didnt feel quite comfortable enough to sleep the air was oppressive his shirt wet in places and stiff with dust in other places oppressed him more than usual so he rose and removed it getting a clean one out of a drawer this was an unusual thing for him for he usually slept in the same shirt which he wore in his days work but it was saturday night and he felt justified in the extravagance                                       in the meanwhile poor lucretia was brooding over her life in a most dangerous fashion all she had done and suffered for simeon burns came back to her till she wondered how she had endured it all all day long in the midst of the glorious summer landscape she brooded  i hate him she thought with a fierce blazing up through the murk of her musing i hate t live but they aint no hope im tied down i cant leave the children and i aint got no money i couldnt make a living out in the world i aint never seen anything an dont know anything  she was too simple and too unknowing to speculate on the loss of her beauty which would have brought her competency onceif sold in the right market as she lay in her little attic bed she was still sullenly thinking wearily thinking of her life she thought of a poor old horse which sim had bought once years before and put to the plough when it was too old and weak to work she could see her again as in a vision that poor old mare with sad head drooping toiling toiling till at last she could no longer move and lying down under the harness in the furrow groaned under the whipand died  then she wondered if her own numbness and despair meant death and she held her breath to think harder upon it she concluded at last grimly that she didnt careonly for the children  the air was frightfully close in the little attic and she heard the low mutter of the rising storm in the west she forgot her troubles a little listening to the faroff gigantic footsteps of the tempest  boom boom boom it broke nearer and nearer as if a vast cordon of cannon was being drawn around the horizon yet she was conscious only of pleasure she had no fear at last came the sweep of cool fragrant stormwind a short and sudden dash of rain and then in the cool sweet hush which followed the worn and weary woman fell into a deep sleep   iii   when she woke the younger children were playing about on the floor in their nightclothes and little pet was sitting in a square of sunshine intent on one of his shoes he was too young to know how poor and squalid his surroundings werethe patch of sunshine flung on the floor glorified it all helittle animalwas happy  the poor of the western prairies lie almost as unhealthily close together as do the poor of the city tenements in the small hut of the peasant there is as little chance to escape close and tainting contact as in the coops and dens of the north end of proud boston in the midst of oceans of land floods of sunshine and gulfs of verdure the farmer lives in two or three small rooms povertys eternal cordon is ever round the poor  ma why didnt you sleep with pap last night asked bob the sevenyearold when he saw she was awake at last she flushed a dull red  you hush will yeh becauseiit was too warmand there was a storm comin you never mind askin such questions is he gone out  yup i heerd him callin the pigs its sunday aint it ma  the fact seemed to startle her  why yes so it is wal now sadie you jump up an dress quick s y can an bob an sile you run down an bring sm water she commanded in nervous haste beginning to dress in the middle of the room there was scarce space to stand beneath the rafters  when sim came in for his breakfast he found it on the table but his wife was absent  wheres yr ma he asked with a little less of the growl in his voice  shes upstairs with pet  the man ate his breakfast in dead silence till at last bob ventured to say  what makes ma ac so  shut up was the brutal reply the children began to take sides with the motherall but the oldest girl who was ten years old to her the father turned now for certain things to be done treating her in his rough fashion as a housekeeper and the girl felt flattered and docile accordingly  they were pitiably clad like many farmchildren indeed they could hardly be said to be clad at all sadie had on but two garments a sort of undershirt of cotton and a faded calico dress out of which her bare yellow little legs protruded lamentably dirty and covered with scratches  the boys also had two garments a hickory shirt and a pair of pants like their fathers made out of brown denim by the mothers neverresting handshands that in sleep still sewed and skimmed and baked and churned the boys had gone to bed without washing their feet which now looked like toads calloused brown and chapped  part of this the mother saw with her dull eyes as she came down after seeing the departure of sim up the road with the cows it was a beautiful sunday morning and the woman might have sung like a bird if men had been as kind to her as nature but she looked dully out upon the seas of ripe grasses tangled and flashing with dew out of which the bobolinks and larks sprang the glorious winds brought her no melody no perfume no respite from toil and care  she thought of the children she saw in the townchildren of the merchant and banker clean as little dolls the boys in knickerbocker suits the girls in dainty white dressesand a vengeful bitterness sprang up in her heart she soon put the dishes away but felt too tired and listless to do more  tawbaywies pet want taawbaywies cried the little one tugging at her dress  listlessly mechanically she took him in her arms and went out into the garden which was fragrant and sweet with dew and sun after picking some berries for him she sat down on the grass under the row of cottonwoods and sank into a kind of lethargy a kingbird chattered and shrieked overhead the grasshoppers buzzed in the grasses strange insects with ventriloquistic voices sang all about hershe could not tell where  ma cant i put on my clean dress insisted sadie  i dont care said the brooding woman darkly leave me alone  oh if she could only lie here forever escaping all pain and weariness the wind sang in her ears the great clouds beautiful as heavenly ships floated far above in the vast dazzling deeps of blue sky the birds rustled and chirped around her leaping insects buzzed and clattered in the grass and in the vines and bushes the goodness and glory of god was in the very air the bitterness and oppression of man in every line of her face  but her quiet was broken by sadie who came leaping like a fawn down through the grass  oh ma aunt maria and uncle william are coming theyve jest turned in  i dont care if they be she answered in the same dully irritated way whatre they comin here today for i wan to know she stayed there immovably till mrs councill came down to see her piloted by two or three of the children mrs councill a jolly largeframed woman smiled brightly and greeted her in a loud jovial voice she made the mistake of taking the whole matter lightly her tone amounted to ridicule  sim says youve been having a tantrum creeshy dont know what for he says  he dont said the wife with a sullen flash in her eyes he dont know why well then you just tell him what i say ive lived in hell long enough im done ive slaved here day in and day out fr twelve years without paynot even a decent word ive worked like no nigger ever worked r could work and live ive given him all i had r ever expect to have im wore out my strength is gone my patience is gone im done with itthats a part of whats the matter  my sakes lucreeshy you mustnt talk that way  but i will said the woman as she supported herself on one palm and raised the other ive got to talk that way she was ripe for an explosion like this she seized upon it with eagerness they aint no use o livin this way anyway id take poison if it want fr the young ones  lucreeshy burns  oh i mean it  land sakes alive i blieve youre goin crazy  i shouldnt wonder if i was ive had enough t drive an indian crazy now you jest go off an leave me lone i aint no mind to visitthey aint no way out of it and im tired o trying to find a way go off an let me be  her tone was so bitterly hopeless that the great jolly face of mrs councill stiffened into a look of horror such as she had not known for years the children in two separate groups could be heard rioting bees were humming around the clover in the grass and the kingbird chattered ceaselessly from the lombardy poplar tip both women felt all this peace and beauty of the morning dimly and it disturbed mrs councill because the other was so impassive under it all at last after a long and thoughtful pause mrs councill asked a question whose answer she knew would decide it allasked it very kindly and softly  creeshy are you comin in  no was the short and sullenly decisive answer mrs councill knew that was the end and so rose with a sigh and went away  wal goodby she said simply  looking back she saw lucretia lying at length with closed eyes and hollow cheeks she seemed to be sleeping half buried in the grass she did not look up nor reply to her sisterinlaw whose life was one of toil and trouble also but not so hard and helpless as lucretias by contrast with most of her neighbors she seemed comfortable  sim burns what you ben doin to that woman she burst out as she waddled up to where the two men were sitting under a cottonwood tree talking and whittling after the manner of farmers  nawthin s fur s i know answered burns not quite honestly and looking uneasy  you neednt try t git out of it like that sim burns replied his sister that woman never got into that fit fr nawthin  wal if you know more about it than i do whadgy ask me fur he replied angrily  tut tut put in councill hold yr horses dont git on yr ear children keep cool and dont spile yr shirts most likely youre all t blame keep cool an swear less  wal ill bet sims more to blame than she is why they aint a harderworkin woman in the hull state of ioway than she is  except marm councill  except nobody look at her jest skin and bones  councill chuckled in his vast way thats so mother measured in that way she leads over you you git fat on it  she smiled a little her indignation oozing away she never could stay mad her children were accustomed to tell her burns refused to talk any more about the matter and the visitors gave it up and got out their team and started for home mrs councill firing this parting shot  the best thing you can do today is t let her alone mebbe the children ll bring her round agin if she does come round you see t you treat her a little more s y did when you was acourtin her  this way roared councill putting his arm around his wifes waist she boxed his ears while he guffawed and clucked at his team  burns took a measure of salt and went out into the pasture to salt the cows on the sunlit slope of the field where the cattle came running and bawling to meet him he threw down the salt in handfuls and then lay down to watch them as they eagerly licked it up even gnawing a bare spot in the sod in their eagerness to get it all  burns was not a drinking man he was hardworking frugal in fact he had no extravagances except his tobacco his clothes he wore until they all but dropped from him and he worked in rain and mud as well as dust and sun it was this suffering and toiling all to no purpose that made him sour and irritable he didnt see why he should have so little after so much hard work  he was puzzled to account for it all his mindthe average mindwas weary with trying to solve an insoluble problem his neighbors who had got along a little better than himself were free with advice and suggestion as to the cause of his persistent poverty  old man bacon the hardestworking man in the county laid it to burnss lack of management jim butler who owned a dozen farms which he had taken on mortgages and who had got rich by buying land at government price and holding for a rise laid all such cases as burnss to lack of enterprise foresight  but the larger number feeling themselves in the same boat with burns said  i d know seems as if things get worse an worse corn an wheat gittin cheaper n cheaper machinery eatin up profitsgot to have machinery to harvest the cheap grain an then the machinery eats up profits taxes goin up devil to pay all round i d know what in thunder is the matter  the democrats said protection was killing the farmers the republicans said no the grangers growled about the middlemen the greenbackers said there wasnt circulating medium enough and in the midst of it all hardworking discouraged farmers like simeon burns worked on unable to find out what really was the matter  and there on this beautiful sabbath morning sim sat and thought and thought till he rose with an oath and gave it up   iv   it was hot and brilliant again the next morning as douglas radbourn drove up the road with lily graham the teacher of the school in the little white schoolhouse it was blazing hot even though not yet nine oclock and the young farmers ploughing beside the fence looked longingly and somewhat bitterly at radbourn seated in a fine topbuggy beside a beautiful creature in lace and cambric  very beautiful the townbred schoolmaam looked to those grimy sweaty fellows superb fellows too physically with bare red arms and leathercolored faces she was as if builded of the pink and white clouds soaring far up there in the morning sky so cool and sweet and dainty  as she came in sight their dusty and sweaty shirts grew biting as the poisoned shirt of the norse myth their bare feet in the brown dirt grew distressingly flat and hooflike and their huge dirty brown chapped and swollen hands grew so repulsive that the mere remote possibility of some time in the far future standing a chance of having an introduction to her caused them to wipe their palms on their trousers legs stealthily  lycurgus banks swore when he saw radbourn that cuss thinks hes ol hell this morning he dont earn his living but hes just the kind of cuss to get holt of all the purty girls  others gazed with simple sad wistfulness upon the slender figure pale sweet face and dark eyes of the young girl feeling that to have talk with such a fairylike creature was a happiness too great to ever be their lot and when she had passed they went back to work with a sigh and feeling of loss  as for lily she felt a pang of pity for these people she looked at this peculiar form of poverty and hardship much as the fragile tender girl of the city looks upon the men laying a gasmain in the streets she felt sympathetically the heat and grime and though but the faintest idea of what it meant to wear such clothing came to her she shuddered her eyes had been opened to these things by radbourn a classmate at the seminary  the young fellow knew that lily was in love with him and made distinct effort to keep the talk upon impersonal subjects he liked her very much probably because she listened so well  poor fellows sighed lily almost unconsciously i hate to see them working there in the dirt and hot sun it seems a hopeless sort of life doesnt it  oh but this is the most beautiful part of the year said radbourn think of them in the mud in the sleet think of them husking corn in the snow a bitter wind blowing think of them a month later in the harvest think of them imprisoned here in winter  yes its dreadful but i never felt it so keenly before you have opened my eyes to it of course ive been on a farm but not to live there  writers and orators have lied so long about the idyllic in farm life and said so much about the independent american farmer that he himself has remained blind to the fact that hes one of the hardestworking and poorestpaid men in america see the houses they live inhovels  yes yes i know said lily a look of deeper pain swept over her face and the fate of the poor women oh the fate of the women  yes its a matter of statistics went on radbourn pitilessly that the wives of the american farmers fill our insane asylums see what a life they lead most of them no music no books seventeen hours a day in a couple of small roomsdens now there is sim burns what a travesty of a home yet there are a dozen just as bad in sight he works like a fiendso does his wifeand what is their reward simply a hole to hibernate in and to sleep and eat in in summer a dreary present and a wellnigh hopeless future no they have a future if they knew it and we must tell them  i know mrs burns lily said after a pause she sends several children to my school poor pathetic little things halfclad and wistfuleyed they make my heart ache they are so hungry for love and so quick to learn  as they passed the burns farm they looked for the wife but she was not to be seen the children had evidently gone up to the little white schoolhouse at the head of the lane radbourn let the reins fall slack as he talked on he did not look at the girl his eyebrows were drawn into a look of gloomy pain  it isnt so much the grime that i abhor nor the labor that crooks their backs and makes their hands bludgeons its the horrible waste of life involved in it all i dont believe god intended a man to be bent to ploughhandles like that but that isnt the worst of it the worst of it is these people live lives approaching automata they become machines to serve others more lucky or more unscrupulous than themselves what is the world of art of music of literature to these poor devilsto sim burns and his wife there for example or even to the best of these farmers  the girl looked away over the shimmering lake of yellowgreen corn a choking came into her throat her gloved hand trembled  what is such a life worth its all very comfortable for us to say they dont feel it how do we know what they feel what do we know of their capacity for enjoyment of art and music they never have leisure or opportunity the master is very glad to be taught by preacher and lawyer and novelist that his slaves are contented and never feel any longings for a higher life these people live lives but little higher than their cattleare forced to live so their hopes and aspirations are crushed out their souls are twisted and deformed just as toil twists and deforms their bodies they are on the same level as the city laborer the very religion they hear is a soporific they are taught to be content here that they may be happy hereafter suppose there isnt any hereafter  oh dont say that please lily cried  but i dont know that there is he went on remorselessly and i do know that these people are being robbed of something more than money of all that makes life worth living the promise of milk and honey in canaan is all very well but i prefer to have mine here then im sure of it  what can we do murmured the girl  do rouse these people for one thing preach discontent a noble discontent  it will only make them unhappy  no it wont not if you show them the way out if it does its better to be unhappy striving for higher things like a man than to be content in a wallow like swine  but what is the way out  this was sufficient to set radbourn upon his hobbyhorse he outlined his plan of action the abolition of all indirect taxes the state control of all privileges the private ownership of which interfered with the equal rights of all he would utterly destroy speculative holdings of the earth he would have land everywhere brought to its best use by appropriating all ground rents to the use of the state etc etc to which the girl listened with eager interest but with only partial comprehension  as they neared the little schoolhouse a swarm of midgets in pink dresses pink sunbonnets and brown legs came rushing to meet their teacher with that peculiar devotion the children in the country develop for a refined teacher  radbourn helped lily out into the midst of the eager little scholars who swarmed upon her like bees on a lump of sugar till even radbourns gravity gave way and he smiled into her lifted eyesan unusual smile that strangely enough stopped the smile on her own lips filling her face with a wistful shadow and her breath came hard for a moment and she trembled  she loved that cold stern face oh so much and to have him smile was a pleasure that made her heart leap till she suffered a smothering pain she turned to him to say  i am very thankful mr radbourn for another pleasant ride adding in a lower tone it was a very great pleasure you always give me so much i feel stronger and more hopeful  im glad you feel so i was afraid i was prosy with my land doctrine  oh no indeed no you have given me a new hope i am exalted with the thought i shall try to think it all out and apply it  and so they parted the children looking on and slyly whispering among themselves radbourn looked back after a while but the bare white hive had absorbed its little group and was standing bleak as a tombstone and hot as a furnace on the naked plain in the blazing sun  americas pitiful boast said the young radical looking back at it only a miserable hint of what it might be  all that forenoon as lily faced her noisy group of barefooted children she was thinking of radbourn of his almost fierce sympathy for these poor supine farmers hopeless and in some cases content in their narrow lives the children almost worshipped the beautiful girl who came to them as a revelation of exquisite neatness and tastewhose very voice and intonation awed them  they noted unconsciously of course every detail snowy linen touches of soft color graceful lines of bust and side the slender fingers that could almost speak so beautifully flexile were they lily herself sometimes when she shook the calloused knotted stiffened hands of the women shuddered with sympathetic pain to think that the crowning wonder and beauty of gods world should be so maimed and distorted from its true purpose  even in the children before her she could see the inherited results of fruitless labor and more pitiful yet in the bent shoulders of the older ones she could see the beginnings of deformity that would soon be permanent and as these thoughts came to her she clasped the wondering children to her side with a convulsive wish to make life a little brighter for them  how is your mother today she asked of sadie burns as she was eating her luncheon on the drabcolored table near the open window  purty well said sadie in a hesitating way  lily was looking out and listening to the gophers whistling as they raced to and fro she could see bob burns lying at length on the grass in the pasture over the fence his heels waving in the air his hands holding a string which formed a snare it was like fishing to young izaak walton  it was very still and hot and the cheep and trill of the gophers and the chatter of the kingbirds alone broke the silence a cloud of butterflies were fluttering about a pool near a couple of big flies buzzed and mumbled on the pane  what ails your mother lily asked recovering herself and looking at sadie who was distinctly ill at ease  oh i dunno sadie replied putting one bare foot across the other  lily insisted  she n pas had an awful row  sadie said the teacher warningly what language  i mean they quarrelled an she dont speak to him any more  why how dreadful  an pa hes awful cross and she wont eat when he does an i haf to wait on table  i believe ill go down and see her this noon said lily to herself as she divined a little of the state of affairs in the burns family   v   sim was mending the pasture fence as lily came down the road toward him he had delayed going to dinner to finish his task and was just about ready to go when lily spoke to him  good morning mr burns i am just going down to see mrs burns it must be time to go to dinnerarent you ready to go i want to talk with you  ordinarily he would have been delighted with the idea of walking down the road with the schoolmaam but there was something in her look which seemed to tell him that she knew all about his trouble and besides he was not in good humor  yes in a minnitsoons i fix up this hole them shotes i blieve would go through a keyhole if they could once get their snoots in  he expanded on this idea as he nailed away anxious to gain time he foresaw trouble for himself he couldnt be rude to this sweet and fragile girl if a man had dared to attack him on his domestic shortcomings he could have fought the girl stood waiting for him her large steady eyes full of thought gazing down at him from the shadow of her broadbrimmed hat  the world is so full of misery anyway that we ought to do the best we can to make it less she said at last in a musing tone as if her thoughts had unconsciously taken on speech she had always appealed to him strongly and never more so than in this softly uttered abstractionthat it was an abstraction added to its power with him  he could find no words for reply but picked up his hammer and nailbox and slouched along the road by her side listening without a word to her talk  christ was patient and bore with his enemies surely we ought to bear with ourfriends she went on adapting her steps to his he took off his torn straw hat and wiped his face on his sleeve being much embarrassed and ashamed not knowing how to meet such argument he kept silent  how is mrs burns said lily at length determined to make him speak the delicate meaning in the emphasis laid on is did not escape him  oh shes all righti mean shes done her work jest the same as ever i dont see her much  i didnt knowi was afraid she was sick sadie said she was acting strangely  no shes well enoughbut  but what is the trouble wont you let me help you wont you she pleaded  cant anybody help us weve got o fight it out i spose he replied a gloomy note of resentment creeping into his voice shes ben in a devil of a temper fr a week  havent you been in the same kind of a temper too demanded lily firmly but kindly i think most troubles of this kind come from bad temper on both sides dont you have you done your share at being kind and patient  they had reached the gate now and she laid her hand on his arm to stop him he looked down at the slender gloved hand on his arm feeling as if a giant had grasped him then he raised his eyes to her face flushing a purplish red as he remembered his grossness it seemed monstrous in the presence of this girladvocate her face was like silver her eyes seemed pools of tears  i dont spose i have he said at last pushing by her he could not have faced her glance another moment his whole air conveyed the impression of destructive admission lily did not comprehend the extent of her advantage or she would have pursued it further as it was she felt a little hurt as she entered the house the table was set but mrs burns was nowhere to be seen calling her softly the young girl passed through the shabby little livingroom to the ovenlike bedroom which opened off it but no one was about she stood for a moment shuddering at the wretchedness of the room  going back to the kitchen she found sim about beginning on his dinner little pet was with him the rest of the children were at the schoolhouse  where is she  i d know out in the garden i expect she dont eat with me now i never see her she dont come near me i aint seen her since saturday  lily was shocked inexpressibly and began to see more clearly the magnitude of the task she had set herself to do but it must be done she felt that a tragedy was not far off it must be averted  mr burns what have you done what have you done she asked in terror and horror  dont lay it all to me she haint done nawthin but complain fr ten years i couldnt do nothin to suit her she was always naggin me  i dont think lucretia burns would nag anybody i dont say youre all to blame but im afraid you havent acknowledged you were any to blame im afraid youve not been patient with her im going out to bring her in if she comes will you say you were part to blame you neednt beg her pardonjust say youll try to be better will you do it think how much she has done for you will you  he remained silent and looked discouragingly rude his sweaty dirty shirt was open at the neck his arms were bare his scraggly teeth were yellow with tobacco and his uncombed hair lay tumbled about on his high narrow head his clumsy unsteady hands played with the dishes on the table his pride was struggling with his sense of justice he knew he ought to consent and yet it was so hard to acknowledge himself to blame the girl went on in a voice piercingly sweet trembling with pity and pleading  what word can i carry to her from you im going to go and see her if i could take a word from you i know she would come back to the table shall i tell her you feel to blame  the answer was a long time coming at last the man nodded an assent the sweat pouring from his purple face she had set him thinking her victory was sure  lily almost ran out into the garden and to the strawberry patch where she found lucretia in her familiar colorless shapeless dress picking berries in the hot sun the mosquitoes biting her neck and hands  poor pathetic dumb sufferer the girl thought as she ran up to her  she dropped her dish as she heard lily coming and gazed up into the tender pitying face not a word was spoken but something she saw there made her eyes fill with tears and her throat swell it was pure sympathy she put her arms around the girls neck and sobbed for the first time since friday night then they sat down on the grass under the hedge and she told her story interspersed with lilys horrified comments  when it was all told the girl still sat listening she heard radbourns calm slow voice again it helped her not to hate burns it helped her to pity and understand him  you must remember that such toil brutalizes a man it makes him callous selfish unfeeling necessarily a fine nature must either adapt itself to its hard surroundings or die men who toil terribly in filthy garments day after day and year after year cannot easily keep gentle the frost and grime the heat and cold will soon or late enter into their souls the case is not all in favor of the suffering wives and against the brutal husbands if the farmers wife is dulled and crazed by her routine the farmer himself is degraded and brutalized  as well as she could lily explained all this to the woman who lay with her face buried in the girls lap lilys arms were about her thin shoulders in an agony of pity  its hard lucretia i knowmore than you can bearbut you mustnt forget what sim endures too he goes out in the storms and in the heat and dust his boots are hard and see how his hands are all bruised and broken by his work he was tired and hungry when he said thathe didnt really mean it  the wife remained silent  mr radbourn says work as things go now does degrade a man in spite of himself he says men get coarse and violent in spite of themselves just as women do when everything goes wrong in the housewhen the flies are thick and the fire wont burn and the irons stick to the clothes you see you both suffer dont lay up this fit of temper against simwill you  the wife lifted her head and looked away her face was full of hopeless weariness  it aint this once it aint that t all its having no letup just goin the same thing right over n overno hope of anything better  if you had hope of another world  dont talk that i dont want that kind o comfert i want a decent chance here i want o rest an be happy now lilys big eyes were streaming with tears what should she say to the desperate woman whats the use we might jest as well dieall of us  the womans livid face appalled the girl she was gaunt heavyeyed nerveless her faded dress settled down over her limbs showing the swollen knees and thin calves her hands with distorted joints protruded painfully from her sleeves all about her was the ever recurring wealth and cheer of nature that knows no favorthe bees and flies buzzing in the sun the jay and the kingbird in the poplars the smell of strawberries the motion of lush grass the shimmer of cornblades tossed gayly as banners in a conquering army  like a flash of keener light a sentence shot across the girls mind nature knows no titledeed the bounty of her mighty hands falls as the sunlight falls copious impartial her seas carry all ships her air is for all lips her lands for all feet  poverty and suffering such as yours will not last there was something in the girls voice that roused the woman she turned her dull eyes upon the youthful face  lily took her hand in both hers as if by a caress she could impart her own faith  look up dear when nature is so good and generous man must come to be better surely come go in the house again sim is there he expects you he told me to tell you he was sorry lucretias face twitched a little at that but her head was bent come you cant live this way there isnt any other place to go to  no that was the bitterest truth where on this wide earth with its forthshooting fruits and grains its fragrant lands and shining seas could this dwarfed bent broken middleaged woman go nobody wanted her nobody cared for her but the wind kissed her drawn lips as readily as those of the girl and the blooms of clover nodded to her as if to a queen  lily had said all she could her heart ached with unspeakable pity and a sort of terror  dont give up lucretia this may be the worst hour of your life live and bear with it all for christs sakefor your childrens sake sim told me to tell you he was to blame if you will only see that you are both to blame and yet neither to blame then you can rise above it try dear  something that was in the girl imparted itself to the wife electrically she pulled herself together rose silently and started toward the house her face was rigid but no longer sullen lily followed her slowly wonderingly  as she neared the kitchen door she saw sim still sitting at the table his face was unusually grave and soft she saw him start and shove back his chair saw lucretia go to the stove and lift the teapot and heard her say as she took her seat beside the baby  want some more tea  she had become a wife and mother again but in what spirit the puzzled girl could not say     daddy deering  i   they were threshing on farmer jenningss place when daddy made his very characteristic appearance milton a boy of thirteen was gloomily holding sacks for the measurer and the glory of the october day was dimmed by the suffocating dust and poisoned by the smarting beards and chaff which had worked their way down his neck the bitterness of the dreaded task was deepened also by contrast with the gambols of his cousin billy who was hunting rats with growler amid the last sheaves of the stack bottom the piercing shrieks of billy as he clapped his hands in murderous glee mingled now and again with the barking of the dog  the machine seemed to fill the world with its snarling boom which became a deafening yell when the cylinder ran empty for a moment it was nearly noon and the men were working silently with occasional glances toward the sun to see how near dinnertime it was the horses dripping with sweat and with patches of foam under their harness moved round and round steadily to the cheery whistle of the driver  the wild imperious song of the bellmetal cogwheel had sung into miltons ears till it had become a torture and every time he lifted his eyes to the beautiful faroff sky where the clouds floated like ships a lump of rebellious anger rose in his throat why should he work in this choking dust and deafening noise while the hawks could sail and sweep from hill to hill with nothing to do but play  occasionally his uncle the feeder smiled down upon him his face black as a negro great goggles of glass and wirecloth covering his merry eyes his great goodnature shone out in the flash of his white teeth behind his dusky beard and he tried to encourage milton with his smile he seemed tireless to the other hands he was so big and strong he had always been miltons boyish hero so milton crowded back the tears that came into his eyes and would not let his uncle see how childish he was  a spectator riding along the road would have remarked upon the lovely setting for this picturesque scenethe low swells of prairie shrouded with faint misty light from the unclouded sky the flaming colors of the trees the faint sound of cowbells and the cheery sound of the machine but to be a tourist and to be a toiler in a scene like this are quite different things  they were anxious to finish the setting by noon and so the feeder was crowding the cylinder to its limit rolling the grain in with slow and apparently effortless swaying from side to side half buried in the loose yellow straw but about eleven oclock the machine came to a stand to wait while a broken tooth was being replaced and milton fled from the terrible dust beside the measuring spout and was shaking the chaff out of his clothing when he heard a high snappy nasal voice call down from the strawpile a tall man with a face completely masked in dust was speaking to mr jennings  say young man i guess youll haf to send another man up here its poorty stiff work fr two yes sir poorty stiff  there there i thought youd cry cavy laughed mr jennings i told you it wasnt the place for an old man  old man snarled the figure in the straw i aint so old but i can daown you siryessir condemmit yessir  im your man replied jennings smiling up at him  the man rolled down the side of the stack disappearing in a cloud of dust and chaff when he came to light milton saw a tall gaunt old man of sixty years of age or older nothing could be seen but a dusty expanse of face ragged beard and twinkling sharp little eyes his color was lost his eyes half hid without waiting for ceremony the men clenched the crowd roared with laughter for though jennings was the younger the older man was a giant still and the struggle lasted for some time he made a gallant fight but his breath gave out and he lay at last flat on his back  i wish i was your age young man he said ruefully as he rose id knock the heads o these young scamps tgetheryessiri could do it too  talks a good dog uncle said a young man  the old man turned on him so ferociously that he fled  run condemn yeh i own y can beat me at that  his face was not unpleasant though his teeth were mainly gone and his skin the color of leather and wrinkled as a pan of cream his eyes had a certain sparkle of fun that belied his rasping voice which seemed to have the power to lift a boy clean off his feet his frame was bent and thin but of great height and breadth bony and tough as hickory at some far time vast muscles must have rolled on those giant limbs but toil had bent and stiffened him  never been sick a day n my life no sir he said in his rapid rasping emphatic way as they were riding across the stubble to dinner and by gol i cn stand as long at the tail of a stacker as any man sir dummed if i turn my hand for any man in the state no sir no sir but if i do two mens works i am goin to have two mens paythats all sir  jennings laughed and said all right uncle ill send another man up there this afternoon  the old man seemed to take a morbid delight in the hard and dirty places and his endurance was marvellous he could stand all day at the tail of a stacker tirelessly pushing the straw away with an indifferent air as if it were all mere play  he measured the grain the next day because it promised to be a noisier and dustier job than working in the straw and it was in this capacity that milton came to know and to hate him and to associate him with that most hated of all tasks the holding of sacks to a twelveyearold boy it seems to be the worst job in the world  all day while the hawks wheel and dip in the glorious air and the trees glow like banks of roses all day while the younger boys are tumbling about the sunlit straw to be forced to stand holding sacks like a convict was maddening daddy whose rugged features bent shoulders and ragged cap loomed through the suffocating blinding dust necessarily came to seem like the jailer who held the door to freedom  and when the dust and noise and monotony seemed the very hardest to bear the old mans cackling laugh was sure to rise above the howl of the cylinder  nem mind sonny chaff aint pizen dust wont hurt ye a mite and when milton was unable to laugh the old man tweaked his ear with his leathery thumb and finger  then he shouted long disconnected yarns to which milton could make neither head nor tail and which grew at last to be inaudible to him just as the steady boom and snarl of the great machine did then he fell to studying the old mans clothes which were a wonder to him he spent a good deal of time trying to discover which were the original sections of the coat and especially of the vest which was ragged and yellow with age with the cotton batting working out and yet daddy took the greatest care of it folding it carefully and putting it away during the heat of the day out of reach of the crickets  one of his peculiarities as mrs jennings learned on the second day was his habit of coming to breakfast but he always earned all he got and more too and as it was probable that his living at home was frugal mrs jennings smiled at his thrift and quietly gave him his breakfast if he arrived late which was not often  he had bought a little farm not far away and settled down into a mode of life which he never afterward changed as he was leaving at the end of the third day he said  now sir if you want any bootcherin done im yr man i dont turn m hand over fr any man in the state no sir i cn git a hawg on the gambrils jest a leetle quickern any other man i ever see yes sir by gum  all right uncle ill send for you when im ready to kill   ii   hogkilling was one of the events of a boys life on a western farm and daddy was destined to be associated in the minds of shep and milton with another disagreeable job that of building the fire and carrying water  it was very early on a keen biting morning in november when daddy came driving into the yard with his rude longrunnered sled one horse half his length behind the other in spite of the drivers clucking he was delighted to catch the boys behind in the preparation  aahhrrhh he rasped out you lazy vagabons why aint you got that fire blazin what the devil do y mean you rascals here it is broad daylight and that fire not built i vum sir you need a thrashin the whole kit an bilun of ye yessir come come come hustle now stir your boots hustle yr bootsha ha ha  it was of no use to plead cold weather and damp chips  what has that got to do with it sir i vum sir when i was your age i could make a fire of green redoak yessir dont talk to me of colds stir your stumps and get warm sir  the old man put up his horses and fed them generously with oats and then went to the house to ask for a leetle something hotmince pie or sassidge his request was very modest but as a matter of fact he sat down and ate a very hearty breakfast while the boys worked away at the fire under the big kettle  the hired man under daddys direction drew the bobsleighs into position on the sunny side of the corncrib and arranged the barrel at the proper slant while the old man ground his knives milton turning the grindstoneanother hateful task which daddys stories could not alleviate  daddy never finished a story if he started in to tell about a horse trade it infallibly reminded him of a cattle trade and talking of cattle switched him off upon logging and logging reminded him of some heavy snowstorm he had known each parenthesis outgrew its proper limits till he forgot what should have been the main story his stories had some compensation for when he stopped to try to recollect where he was the pressure on the grindstone was released  at last the water was hot and the time came to seize the hogs this was the old mans great moment he stood in the pen and shrieked with laughter while the hired men went rolling one after the other upon the ground or were bruised against the fence by the rush of the burly swine  youre a fine lot he laughed now then sir grab im why dont ye nail im i vum sir if i couldnt do bettern that sir id sell out i would sir by gol get out o the way  with a lofty scorn he waved aside all help and stalked like a gladiator toward the pigs huddled in one corner of the pen and when the selected victim was rushing by him his long arm and great bony hand swept out caught him by the ear and flung him upon his side squealing with deafening shrillness but in spite of his smiling concealment of effort daddy had to lean against the fence and catch his breath even while he boasted  im an old codger sir but im wortha dozen o youspindlelegged chaps dum me if i aint sir  his pride in his ability to catch and properly kill a hog was as genuine as the old knighterrants pride in his ability to stick a knife into another steelclothed brigand like himself when the slain shote was swung upon the planking on the sled before the barrel daddy rested while the boys filled the barrel with water from the kettle  there was always a weird charm about this stage of the work to the boys the sun shone warm and bright in the lee of the corncrib the steam rose up white and voluminous from the barrel the eaves dropped steadily the hens ventured near nervously but full of curiosity while the men laughed and joked with daddy starting him off on long stories and winking at each other when his back was turned  at last he mounted his planking selecting mr jennings to pull upon the other handle of the hoghook he considered he conferred a distinct honor in this selection  the times been sir when i wouldnt thank any man for his help no sir wouldnt thank im  what do you do with these things asked one of the men kicking two iron candlesticks which the old man laid conveniently near  scrape a hawg with them sir what do y spose you numskull  well i never saw anything  youll have a chance mighty quick sir grab ahold sir swing im aroundthere now easy easy now then one two one twothats right  while he dipped the porker in the water pulling with his companion rhythmically upon the hook he talked incessantly mixing up scraps of stories and boastings of what he could do with commands of what he wanted the other man to do  the best man i ever worked with now turn im turn im he yelled reaching over jenningss wrist grab under my wrist there wont ye never learn how to turn a hawg now out with im was his next wild yell as the steaming hog was jerked out of the water upon the planking now try the hair on them ears beautiful scald he said clutching his hand full of bristles and beaming with pride never see anything finer here bub a pail of hot water quick try one of them candlesticks they aint no better scraper than the bottom of an old iron candlestick no sir dum your newfangled scrapers i made a bet once with old jake ridgeway that i could scrape the hair offn two hawgs by gum quickern he could one jake was blowin about a new scraper he had  yes yes yes dump it right into the barrel condemmit aint you got no gumption so sim smith he held the watch sim was a mighty good hand t work with he was about the only man i ever sawed with who didnt ride the saw he could jerk a crosscut saw now let him in again now heho once again rool him over now that foreleg needs a tech o water now out with him again thats right thats right by gol a beautiful scald as ever i see  milton standing near caught his eye again clean that ear sir what the devil you standin there for he returned to his story after a pause and jake he scraped awayhyare he shouted suddenly dont ruggle the skin like that cant you see the way i do it leave it smooth as a baby siryessir  he worked on in this way all day talking unceasingly never shirking a hard job and scarcely showing fatigue at any moment  im short o breath a leetle thats all never git tired but my wind gives out dum cold got on me too  he ate a huge supper of liver and potatoes still working away hard at an ancient horse trade and when he drove off at night he had not yet finished a single one of the dozen stories he had begun   iii   but pitching grain and hogkilling were on the lower levels of his art for above all else daddy loved to be called upon to play the fiddle for dances he officiated for the first time at a dance given by one of the younger mcturgs they were all fiddlers themselveshad been for three generationsbut they seized the opportunity of helping daddy and at the same time of relieving themselves of the trouble of furnishing the music while the rest danced  milton attended this dance and saw daddy for the first time earning his money pleasantly from that time on the associations around his personality were less severe and they came to like him better he came early with his old fiddle in a timeworn whitepine box his hair was neatly combed to the top of his long narrow head and his face was very clean the boys all greeted him with great pleasure and asked him where he would sit  right on that table sir put a chair up there  he took his chair on the kitchentable as if it were a throne he wore huge moccasins of moosehide on his feet and for special occasions like this added a paper collar to his red woollen shirt he took off his coat and laid it across his chair for a cushion it was all very funny to the young people but they obeyed him laughingly and while they formed on he sawed his violin and coaxed it up to concert pitch and twanged it and banged it into proper tunefulness  aaall ready there he rasped out with prodigious force everybody git into his place then lifting one huge foot he put the fiddle under his chin and raising his bow till his knuckles touched the strings he yelled already glang and brought his foot down with a startling bang on the first note rye doodle duo doodle doo  as he went on and the dancers fell into rhythm the clatter of heavy boots seemed to thrill him with oldtime memories and he kept boisterous time with his foot while his high rasping nasal rang high above the confusion of tongues and heels and swaying forms  ladies gran change four hands round balance all ellyman left back to playcis  his eyes closed in a sort of intoxication of pleasure but he saw all that went on in some miraculous way  first lady lead to the righttoodle rum rum gent foller after step along thar four hands round  the boys were immensely pleased with him they delighted in his antics rather than in his tunes which were exceedingly few and simple they seemed never to be able to get enough of one tune which he called honest john and which he played in his own way accompanied by a chant which he meant without a doubt to be musical  honers tew your pardnerstee teedle deedle dee dee dee dee stand up straight an put on your style right an left four  the hat was passed by the floormanager during the evening and daddy got nearly three dollars which delighted milton very much  at supper he insisted on his prerogative which was to take the prettiest girl out to supper  lookahere daddy aint that crowdin the mourners objected the others  what do you mean by that sir no sir always done it in michigan and yark state both yes sir  he put on his coat ceremoniously while the tittering girls stood about the room waiting he did not delay his keen eyes had made selection long before and approaching rose watson with oldfashioned elaborate gallantry he said may i have the pleasure and marched out triumphantly amidst shouts of laughter  his shrill laugh rang high above the rest at the table as he said im the youngest man in this crowd sir demmit i bet a hat i cn dance down any man in this crowd yes sir the old man can do it yet  they all took sides in order to please him  ill bet he can said hugh mcturg ill bet a dollar on daddy  ill take the bet said joe randall and with great noise the match was arranged to come the first thing after supper  all right sir any time sir ill let you know the old man is on earth yet  while the girls were putting away the supper dishes the young man lured daddy out into the yard for a wrestlingmatch but some others objected  oh now that wont do if daddy was a young man  what do you mean sir i am young enough for you sir just let me get ahold o you sir and ill show you you young rascal you dem jackanapes he ended almost shrieking with rage as he shook his fist in the face of his grinning tormentors  his friends held him back with much apparent alarm and ordered the other fellows away  there there daddy i wouldnt mind him i wouldnt dirty my hands on him he aint worth it just come inside and well have that dancingmatch now  daddy reluctantly returned to the house and having surrendered his violin to hugh mcturg was ready for the contest as he stepped into the middle of the room he was not altogether ludicrous his rusty trousers were bagged at the knee and his red woollen stockings showed between the tops of his moccasins and his pantaloon legs and his coat utterly characterless as to color and cut added to the stoop in his shoulders and yet there was a rude sort of grace and a certain dignity about his bearing which kept down laughter they were to have a square dance of the oldfashioned sort  farrm on he cried and the fiddler struck up the first note of the virginia reel daddy led out rose and the dance began he straightened up till his tall form towered above the rest of the boys like a weatherbeaten pine tree as he balanced and swung and led and called off the changes with a voice full of imperious command  the fiddler took a malicious delight toward the last in quickening the time of the good old dance and that put the old man on his mettle  go it ye young rascal he yelled he danced like a boy and yelled like a demon catching a laggard here and there and hurling them into place like tops while he kicked and stamped wound in and out and waved his hands in the air with a gesture which must have dated back to the days of washington at last flushed breathless but triumphant he danced a final breakdown to the tune of leather breeches to show he was unsubdued   iv   but these rare days passed away as the country grew older it lost the wholesome simplicity of pioneer days and daddy got a chance to play but seldom he no longer pleased the boys and girlshis music was too monotonous and too simple he felt this very deeply once in a while he broke forth in protest against the changes  the boys i used to trot on m knee are gittin too hightoned they wouldnt be found dead with old deering and then the preachers are gittin thick and howlin agin dancin and the countrys filling up with dutchmen sot im left out  as a matter of fact there were few homes now where daddy could sit on the table in his ragged vest and rusty pantaloons and play honest john while the boys thumped about the floor there were few homes where the old man was even a welcome visitor and he felt this rejection keenly the women got tired of seeing him about because of his uncleanly habits of spitting and his tiresome stories many of the old neighbors died or moved away and the young people went west or to the cities men began to pity him rather than laugh at him which hurt him more than their ridicule they began to favor him at threshing or at the fall hogkilling  oh youre getting old daddy youll have to give up this heavy work of course if you feel able to do it why all right like to have you do it but i guess well have to have a man to do the heavy lifting i spose  i spose not sir i am jest as able to yank a hawg as ever sir yes sir demmitdemmit do you think ive got one foot in the grave  nevertheless daddy often failed to come to time on appointed days and it was painful to hear him trying to explain trying to make light of it all  m caugh wouldnt let me sleep last night a goldum leetle nasty ticklin caugh too but it kept me awake fact was anwell m wife she said i hadnt better come but dont you worry sir it wont happen again sir no sir  his hands got stiffer year by year and his simple tunes became practically a series of squeaks and squalls there came a time when the fiddle was laid away almost altogether for his left hand got caught in the cogwheels of the horsepower and all four of the fingers on that hand were crushed thereafter he could only twang a little on the strings it was not long after this that he struck his foot with the axe and lamed himself for life  as he lay groaning in bed mr jennings went in to see him and tried to relieve the old mans feelings by telling him the number of times he had practically cut his feet off and said he knew it was a terrible hard thing to put up with  gol dummit it aint the pain the old sufferer yelled its the dum awkwardness ive chopped all my life i can let an axe in up to the makers name and hew to a hairline yes sir it was jest them dum new mittens my wife made they was s slippery he ended with a groan  as a matter of fact the one accident hinged upon the other it was the failure of his left hand with its useless fingers to do its duty that brought the axe down upon his foot the pain was not so much physical as mental to think that he who could hew to a hairline right and left hand should cut his own foot like a tenyearold boythat scared him it brought age and decay close to him for the first time in his life he felt that he was fighting a losing battle  a man like this lives so much in the flesh that when his limbs begin to fail him everything else seems slipping away he had gloried in his strength he had exulted in the thrill of his lifeblood and in the swell of his vast muscles he had clung to the idea that he was strong as ever till this last blow came upon him and then he began to think and to tremble  when he was able to crawl about again he was a different man he was gloomy and morose snapping and snarling at all that came near him like a wounded bear he was alone a great deal of the time during the winter following his hurt neighbors seldom went in and for weeks he saw no one but his hired hand and the faithful dumb little old woman his wife who moved about without any apparent concern or sympathy for his suffering the hired hand whenever he called upon the neighbors or whenever questions were asked said that daddy hung around over the stove most of the time paying no attention to any one or anything he aint dangerous t all he said meaning that daddy was not dangerously ill  milton rode out from school one winter day with bill the hand and was so much impressed with his story of daddys condition that he rode home with him he found the old man sitting bent above the stove wrapped in a quilt shivering and muttering to himself he hardly looked up when milton spoke to him and seemed scarcely to comprehend what he said  milton was much alarmed at the terrible change for the last time he had seen him he had towered above him laughingly threatening to warm his jacket and now here he sat a great hulk of flesh his mind flickering and flaring under every wind of suggestion soon to go out altogether  in reply to questions he only muttered with a trace of his old spirit im all right jest as good a man as i ever was only im cold ill be all right when spring comes so t i cn git outdoors somethin to warm me up yessir im cold thats all  the young fellow sat in awe before him but the old wife and bill moved about the room taking very little interest in what the old man said or did bill at last took down the violin ill wake him up he said this always fetches the old feller now watch im  oh dont do that milton said in horror but bill drew the bow across the strings with the same stroke that daddy always used when tuning up  he lifted his head as bill dashed into honest john in spite of miltons protest he trotted his feet after a little and drummed with his hands on the arms of his chair then smiled a little in a pitiful way finally he reached out his right hand for the violin and took it into his lap he tried to hold the neck with his poor old mutilated left hand and burst into tears  dont you do that again bill milton said its better for him to forget that now you take the best care of him you can tonight i dont think hes going to live long i think you ought to go for the doctor right off  oh hes been like this for the last two weeks he aint sick hes jest old thats all replied bill brutally  and the old lady moving about without passion and without speech seemed to confirm this and yet milton was unable to get the picture of the old man out of his mind he went home with a great lump in his throat                                       the next morning while they were at breakfast bill burst wildly into the room  come over there all of you we want you  they all looked up much scared whats the matter bill  daddys killed himself said bill and turned to rush back followed by mr jennings and milton  while on the way across the field bill told how it all happened  he wouldnt go to bed the old lady couldnt make him and when i got up this morning i didnt think nothin about it i sposed of course hed gone to bed all right but when i was going out to the barn i stumbled across something in the snow and i felt around and there he was he got hold of my revolver someway it was on the shelf by the washstand and i spose he went out there so t we wouldnt hear him i dassnt touch him he said with a shiver and the old woman she jest slumped down in a chair an set therewouldnt do a thingso i come over to see you  miltons heart swelled with remorse he felt guilty because he had not gone directly for the doctor to think that the old sufferer had killed himself was horrible and seemed impossible  the wind was blowing the snow cold and dry across the yard but the sun shone brilliantly upon the figure in the snow as they came up to it there daddy lay the snow was in his scant hair and in the hollow of his wide halfnaked chest a pistol was in his hand but there was no mark upon him and miltons heart leaped with quick relief it was delirium not suicide  there was a sort of majesty in the figure half buried in the snow his hands were clenched and there was a frown of resolution on his face as if he had fancied death coming and had gone defiantly forth to meet him   a stopover at tyre  i   albert lohr was studying the motion of the ropes and lamps and listening to the rumble of the wheels and the roar of the ferocious wind against the pane of glass that his head touched it was the midnight train from marion rushing toward warsaw like some savage thing unchained creaking shrieking and clattering through the wild storm which possessed the whole mississippi valley  albert lost sight of the lamps at last and began to wonder what his future would be first i must go through the university at madison then ill study law go into politics and perhaps some time i may go to washington  in imagination he saw that wonderful city as a western boy boston to him was historic new york was the great metropolis but washington was the great american city and political greatness the only fame  the car was nearly empty save here and there the wideawake western drummer and a woman with four fretful children the train was as deserted as it was frightfully cold the engine shrieked warningly at intervals the train rumbled hollowly over short bridges and across pikes swung round the hills and plunged with wild warnings past little towns hid in the snow with only here and there a light shining dimly  one of the drummers now and then rose up from his cramped bed on the seats and swore cordially at the railway company for not heating the cars the woman with the children inquired for the tenth time is the next station lodi  yes maam it is snarled the drummer as he jerked viciously at the strap on his valise and darned glad i am too i can tell yeh ill be stiff as a carpin if i stay in this infernal icechest another hour i wonder what the company think  at lodi several people got on among them a fat man with a pretty daughter who appeared to be abnormally wide awakeconsidering the time of night she saw albert for the same reason that he saw herthey were both young and goodlooking  the student began his musings again modified by this girls face he had left out the feminine element obviously he must recapitulate hed study law yes but that would not prevent going to sociables and church fairs and at these fairs the chances were good for a meeting with a girl her father must be influentialcounty judge or district attorney marriage would open new avenues  he was roused by the sound of his own name  is albert lohr in this car shouted the brakeman coming in enveloped in a cloud of fine snow  yes here called albert  heres a telegram for you  albert snatched the envelope with a sudden fear of disaster at home but it was dated tyre             get off at tyre ill be there                                               hartley  well now thats fun said albert looking at the brakeman when do we reach there  about 220  well by thunder a pretty time o night  the brakeman grinned sympathetically any answer he asked at length  no that is none that will do the matter justice  hartley friend o yours  yes know him  yes he boarded where i did in warsaw  when he came back again the brakeman said to albert in a hesitating way  aint going t stop off long i spose  may an may not depends on hartley why  well ive got an aunt there that keeps boarders and i kind o like t send her one when i can if you should happen to stay a few days go an see her she sets up firstclass grub an it wouldnt kill anybody anyhow if you went up an called  course not if i stay long enough to make it pay ill look her up sure im no vanderbilt i cant afford to stop at twodollaraday hotels  the brakeman sat down opposite encouraged by alberts smile  y see my division ends at warsaw and i run back and forth here every other day but i dont get much chance to see them and i aint worth a cuss fr letterwritin y see shes only aunt by marriage but i like her an i guess shes got about all she can stand up under an so i like t help her a little when i can the old man died owning nothing but the house an that left the old lady t rustle fr her livin dummed if she aint sandy as old sand theyre gittn along purty  the whistle blew for brakes and seizing his lantern the brakeman slammed out on the platform  tough night for twisting brakes suggested albert when he came in again  yeson the freight  good heavens i should say so they dont run freight such nights as this  dont they well i guess they dont stop for a storm like this if theys any money to be made by sending her through manys the night ive broke all night on top of the old wooden cars when the wind was sharp enough to shear the hair off a castiron mulewoooo theres where you need grit old man he ended dropping into familiar speech  yes or need a job awful bad  the brakeman was struck with this idea theres where youre right a fellow dont take that kind of a job for the fun of it not much he takes it because hes got to thats as sures youre a foot high i tell you a fellers got t rustle these days if he gits any kind of a job  toot tooooot toot  the station passed the brakeman did not return perhaps because he found some other listener perhaps because he was afraid of boring this pleasant young fellow  albert shuddered with a sympathetic pain as he thought of the heroic fellows on the tops of icy cars with hands straining at frosty brakes the wind cutting their faces like a sandblast oh those tireless hands at the wheel and throttle  he looked at his watch it was two oclock the next station was tyre as he began to get his things together the brakeman again addressed him  oh i forgot to say that the old ladys name is welshmrs robert welsh say i sent yeh and itll be all right  sure ill try her in the morningthat is if i find out im going to stay  albert clutched his valise and pulled his cap firmly down on his head  here goes he muttered  hold yr breath shouted the brakeman albert swung himself to the platform before the stationa platform of planks along which the snow was streaming like water  goodnight shouted the brakeman  goodnight  alll aboooard called the conductor somewhere in the storm the brakeman swung his lantern the train drew off into the blinding whirl and its lights were soon lost in the clouds of snow  no more desolate place could well be imagined a level plain apparently bare of houses swept by a ferocious wind a dingy little den called a stationno other shelter in sight no sign of life save the dull glare of two windows to the left alternately lost and found in the storm  alberts heart contracted with a sudden fear the outlook was appalling  wheres the town he asked of a dimly seen figure with a lanterna man evidently locking the station door his only refuge  over there was the surly reply  how far  bout a mile  a mile  thats what i saida mile  well ill be blanked  well y better be doing something besides standing here r y ll freeze t death id go over to the arteeshun house an go t bed if i was in your fix  well where is the artesian house  see them lights  i see them lights  well theyre it  oh wouldnt your grammar make old grammaticuss curl up though  what say queried the man bending his head toward albert his form being almost lost in the snow that streamed against them both  i said i guessed id try it grinned the youth invisibly  well i would if i was in your fix keep right close after me theys some ditches here and the footbridges are none too wide  the artesian is owned by the railway eh  yup  and youre the clerk  yup nice little scheme aint it  well itll do replied albert  the man laughed without looking around  in the little barroom lighted by a vilely smelling kerosene lamp the clerk hitherto a shadow and a voice came to light as a middleaged man with a sullen face slightly belied by a sly twinkle in his eyes  this beats all the winters i ever did see it dont do nawthin but blow blow want to go to bed i spose well come along  he took up one of the absurd little lamps and tried to get more light out of it  dummed if a white bean wouldnt be better  spit on it suggested albert  id throw the whole business out o the window for a cent growled the man  heres yr cent said the boy  youre mighty frisky fr a feller gittn offn a midnight train replied the man as he tramped along a narrow hallway he spoke in a voice loud enough to awaken every sleeper in the house  have t be or thered be a pair of us  youll laugh out o the other side o yr mouth when you saw away on one o the bellcollar steaks this house puts up ended the clerk as he put the lamp down  sufficient unto the morn is the evil thereof called albert after him  he was awakened the next morning by the cooks pounding steak down in the kitchen and wrangling over some division of duty it was a vile place at any time but on a morning like this it was appalling the water was frozen the floor like ice the sevenbynine glass frosted so that he couldnt see to comb his hair  all that got me out of bed he remarked to the clerk was the thought of leaving  the breakfast was incredibly badso much worse than he expected that albert was forced to admit he had never seen its like he fled from the place without a glance behind and took passage in an omnibus for the town a mile away it was terribly cold the thermometer registering twenty below zero but the sun was very brilliant and the air still  the driver pulled up before a very ambitious wooden hotel entitled the eldorado and albert dashed in at the door and up to the stove with both hands covering his ears  as he stood there frantic with pain kicking his toes and rubbing his hands he heard a chucklea slow sly insulting chuckleturned and saw hartley standing in the doorway visibly exulting over his misery  hello bert that you  whats left of me say youre a good one you are why didnt you telegraph me at marion a deuce of a night ive had of it  do ye good laughed hartley a tall alert handsome fellow nearly thirty years of age  after a short and vigorous blowing up albert asked well now whats the meaning of all this anyhow why this change from racine  well you see i got wind of another fellow going to

can work in a couple o books on the bill  well i dont know about that but im going to look up a place a brakeman gave me a pointer on  all right here goes  scarcely any one was stirring on the streets the wind was pitilessly cold though not strong the snow under their feet cried out with a note like glass and steel the windows of the stores were thick with frost and albert shivered with a sense of homelessness he had never experienced anything like this before i dont want much of this he muttered through his scarf  mrs welsh lived in a large frame house standing on the edge of a bank and as the young men waited at the door they could look down on the meadowland where the river lay blue and hard as steel  a pale little girl ten or twelve years of age opened the door  is this where mrs welsh lives  yes sir  will you ask her to come here a moment  yes sir piped the little one wont you come in and sit down by the fire she added with a quaint air of hospitality  the room was the usual village sittingroom a cylinder heater full of wood stood at one side of it a rag carpet much faded covered the floor the paper on the wall was like striped candy and the chairs were nondescript but everything was cleanworn more with brushing than with use  a slim woman of fifty with hollow eyes and a patient smile came in wiping her hands on her apron  how dye do did you want to see me  yes said hartley smiling the fact is were book agents and looking for a place to board  wellaiyes i keep boarders  i was sent here by a brakeman on the midnight express put in bert  oh tom said the woman her

four dollars  eight dollars fr the two of us all right well be with you a week or two if we have luck  mrs welsh smiled excuse me wont you ive got to be at my baking make yrselves at home  bert remarked how much she looked like his own mother in the back she had the same tired droop in the shoulders the same colorless dress characterless with much washing  certainly i feel at home already replied bert now jim he said after she left the room im going t stay right here while you go and order our trunks aroundjust t pay you off fr last night  all right said hartley cheerily going out  after getting warm bert returned to the sittingroom and sat down at the parlor organ and played a gospel hymn or two from the moody and sankey hymnal he was in the midst of the chorus of let your lower lights etc when a young woman entered the room she had a whiskbroom in her hand and stood a picture of gentle surprise bert wheeled about on his stool  i thought it was stella she began  im a book agent bert explained i might as well out with it there are two of us come here to board  oh said the girl with some relief she was very fair and very slight almost frail her eyes were of the sunniest blue her face pale and somewhat thin but her lips showed scarlet and her teeth were fine bert liked her and smiled  a book agent is the next thing to a burglar i know but still  oh i didnt mean that but i was surprised when did you come  just a few moments ago am i in your way he inquired with elaborate solicitude  oh no please go on you play very well it is seldom young men play at all  i had to at college the other fellows all wanted to sing you play of course  when i have time she sighed there was a weary droop in her voice she seemed aware of it and said more brightly  you mean madison i suppose  yes im in my second year  i went there two years then i had to quit and come home to help mother  did you thats why im out here on this infernal book businessto get money to go on with  she looked at him with interest now noticing his fine eyes and waving brown hair  its dreadful isnt it but youve got a hope to go back i havent she ended with a sigh a faroff expression in her eyes it almost killed me to give it up i dont spose id know any of the scholars you know even the teachers are not the same oh yessarah shaw i think shes back for the normal course  oh yes exclaimed bert i know sarah we boarded on the same street used t go home together after class an awful nice girl too  shes a worker she teaches school i cant do that for mother needs me at home there was another pause broken by the little girl who called  maud mamma wants you  maud rose and went out with a tired smile on her face that emphasized her resemblance to her mother bert couldnt forget that smile and he was still thinking about the girl and what her life must be when hartley came in  by jinks its snifty as dad used to say you cant draw a long breath through your nostrils without freezing yr nose solid as a bottle he announced throwing off his coat bytheway ive just found out why you was so anxious to get into this house another case o girl hey  bert blushed he couldnt help it notwithstanding his innocence in this case i didnt know it myself till about ten minutes ago he protested  hartley winked prodigiously  dont tell me is she pretty  the girl returned at this moment with an armful of wood  let me put it in cried hartley springing up excuse me my name is hartley book agent blaines twenty years plain cloth sprinkled edges three dollars half calf three fifty this is my friend mr lohr of marion german extraction soph at the university  the girl bowed and smiled and pushed by him toward the door of the parlor hartley followed her in and bert could hear them rattling away at the stove  wont you sit down and play for us asked hartley after they returned to the sittingroom the persuasive music of the book agent was in his fine voice  oh no its nearly dinnertime and i must help about the table  now make yourselves at home said mrs welsh appearing at the door leading to the kitchen if you want anything just let me know  all right we will replied hartley  by the time the dinnerbell rang they were feeling at home in their new quarters at the table they met the usual group of village boarders the brann brothers newsdealers old man troutt who ran the liverystableand smelled of it and a small dark and wizened woman who kept the millinery store the others who came in late were clerks in the stores near by  maud served the dinner while stella and her mother waited upon the table albert admired the hands of the girl which no amount of work could quite rob of their essential shapeliness she was not more than twenty he decided but she looked older so wistful was her face  theys one thing agin yeh troutt the liveryman remarked to hartley weve jest been worked for one o the goldingedest schemes you ever see bout six munce ago sm fellers come all through here claimin t be after information about the county and the leadin citizens wanted t write a history an wanted all the pitchers of the leading men old settlers an so on you paid ten dollars an you had a book an your pitcher in it  i know the scheme grinned hartley  wal sir i spose them fellers roped in every man in this town i dont spose they got out with a cent lessn one thousand dollars an when the book comewal here he stopped to roar i dont spose you ever see a madder lot o men in your life in the first place they got the names and the pitchers mixed so that i was judge ricker an judge ricker was ol man daggett didnt the judge swearoh it was awful  i should say so  an the pitchers that want mixed was so goldinged black you couldnt tell em from niggers you know how kind o lilylivered lawyer ransom is wal he looked like ol black joe he was the maddest man of the hull bilin he throwed the book in the fire and tromped around like a blind bull  it wasnt a success i take it then why i should a thought theyd a nabbed the fellows  not much they was too keen for that they didnt deliver the books theirselves they hired dick bascom to do it fr them course dick want t blame  no i never tried it before albert was saying to maud at their end of the table hartley offered me a job and as i needed money i came i dont know what hes going to do with me now im here  albert did not go out after dinner with hartley it was too cold he had brought his books with him planning to keep up with his class if possible and was deep in cæsar when a timid knock came upon the door  come he called student fashion  maud entered her face aglow  how natural that sounds she said  albert sprang up to take the wood from her arms i wish youd let me do that he said pleadingly as she refused his aid  i wasnt sure you were in were you reading  cæsar he replied holding up the book i am conditioned on latin im going over the commentaries again  i thought i knew the book she laughed  you read latin  yes a littlevergil  maybe you can help me out on these oratia obliqua they bother me yet i hate these cæsar saids i like vergil better  she stood at his shoulder while he pointed out the knotty passage she read it easily and he thanked her it was amazing how well acquainted they felt after this  the wind roared outside in the bare maples and the fire boomed in its pent place within but these young people had forgotten time and place the girl sank into a chair almost unconsciously as they talked of madisona great city to themof the capitol building of the splendid campus of the lakes and the gay sailing there in summer and iceboating in winter  oh it makes me homesick cried the girl with a deep sigh it was the happiest sunniest time of all my life oh those walks and talks those recitations in the dear chalky old rooms oh how i would like to go back over that hollow doorstone again  she broke off with tears in her eyes and he was obliged to cough two or three times before he could break the silence  i know just how you feel the first spring when i went back on the farm it seemed as if i couldnt stand it i thought id go crazy the days seemed fortyeight hours long it was so lonesome and so dreary on rainy days but of course i expected to go back thats what kept me up i dont think i could have stood it if i hadnt had hope  ive given it up now she said plaintively its no use hoping  why dont you teach he asked deeply affected by her voice and manner  i did teach here for a year but i couldnt endure the strain im not very strong and the boys were so rude if i could teach in a seminaryteach latin and englishi should be happy i think but i cant leave mother now  she was a wholly different girl in alberts eyes as she said this her cheap dress her check apron could not hide the pure intellectual flame of her spirit her large blue eyes were deep with thought and the pale face lighted by the glow of the fire was as lovely as a rose almost before he knew it he was telling her of his life  i dont see how i endured it as long as i did he went on it was nothing but work work and dust or mud the whole year round farmlife especially on a dairy farm is slavery  yes she agreed that is true father was a carpenter and ive always lived here but we have people who are farmers and i know how it is with them  why when i think of it now it makes me crawl to think of getting up in the morning before daylight and going out to the barn to do chores to get ready to go into the field to work working wasting yr life on dirt waiting and tending on cows seven hundred times a year goin round and round in a circle and never getting out you neednt talk to me of the poetry of a farmers life  its just the same for us women she corroborated think of us going around the house day after day and doing just the same things over an over year after year thats the whole of most womens lives dishwashing almost drives me crazy  i know it said albert but somebody has t do it and if a fellows folks are workin hard why of course he cant lay around and study theyre not to blame i dont know that anybodys to blame  i dont suppose anybody is but it makes me sad to see mother going around as she does day after day she wont let me do as much as i would the girl looked at her slender hands you see im not very strong it makes my heart ache to see her going around in that quiet patient way shes so good  i know i know ive felt just like that about my mother and father too  there was a long pause full of deep feeling and then the girl continued in a low hesitating voice  mothers had an awful hard time since father died we had to go to keeping boarders which was hardvery hard for mother the boy felt a sympathetic lump in his throat as the girl went on again but she doesnt complain and she didnt want me to come home from school but of course i couldnt do anything else  it didnt occur to either of them that any other course was open nor that there was any special heroism or selfsacrifice in the act it was simply right  well im not going to drudge all my life said albert at last i know its kind o selfish but i cant live on a farm ive made up my mind to study law and enter the bar lawyers manage to get hold of enough to live on decently and thats more than you can say of the farmers and they live in town where something is going on once in a while anyway  in the pause which followed footsteps were heard on the walk outside and the girl sprang up with a beautiful blush  my stars i didnt thinki forgoti must go  hartley burst into the room shortly after she left it in his usual breeze  hullo still at the latin hey  yes said bert with ease how goes it  oh im whooping er up im getting started in great shape been up to the courthouse and roped in three of the county officials in these small towns the big man is the politician or the clergyman ive nailed the politicians through the ear now you must go for the ministers to head the listthats your layout  how m i t do it asked bert in an anxious tone i cant sell books if they dont want em  why cert thats the trick offer a big discount say full calf two fifty morocco two ninety regular discount to the clergy ye know oh theyre on to that little racketno trouble if you can get a few of these leaders of the flock the rest will follow like lambs to the slaughter tralalawhoooish whish  albert laughed at hartley as he plunged his face into the icecold water puffing and wheezing  jeemimy crickets but aint that water cold i worked rock river this way last month and made a boomin success if you take hold here in the  oh im all ready to stand anything short of being kicked out  no danger of that if youre a real book agent its the snide that gets kicked youve got t have some savvy in this just like any other business he stopped in his dressing to say weve struck a great boardingplace hey  looks like it  i begin t cotton to the old lady aready good eal like mother used t be fore she broke down didnt the old lady have a time of it raisin me phewee patient job wasnt a patchin but the test is goin t come on the biscuit if her biscuit comes up t mothers im hern till death  he broke off to comb his hair a very nice bit of work in his case   ii   there was no discernible reason why the little town should have been called tyre and yet its name was as characteristically american as its architecture it had the usual main street lined with low brick or wooden storesa street which developed into a road running back up a wide sandy valley away from the river being a county town it had a courthouse in a yard near the centre of the town and a big summer hotel curiously shaped and oddly distributed hills rose abruptly out of the valley sand forming a sort of amphitheatre in which the village lay these squaretopped hills ended at a common level showing that they were not the result of an upheaval but were the remains of the original stratification formations left standing after the scooping action of the postglacial floods had ceased  some of them looked like ruined walls of castles ancient as hills on whose massive tops time had sown sturdy oaks and cedars they lent a distinct air of romance to the landscape at all times but when in summer graceful vines clambered over their rugged sides and underbrush softened their broken lines it was not at all difficult to imagine them the remains of an unrecorded and very warlike people  even now in winter with yellowbrown and green cedars standing starkly upon their summits these towers possessed a distinct charm and in the early morning when the trees glistened with frost or at evening when the white light of the sun was softened and violet shadows lay along the snow the whole valley was a delight to the eye full of distinct and lasting charm  in the campaign which hartley began albert did his best and his best was done unconsciously for the simplicity of his mannerall unknown to himselfwas the most potent factor in securing consideration  im not a book agent he said to one of the clergymen to whom he first appealed im a student trying to sell a good book and make a little money to help me to complete my course at the university  in this way he secured three clergymen to head the list much to the delight and admiration of hartley  good now corral the alumni of the place work the fraternal racket to the bitter end oh say theres a sociable tomorrow night i guess wed better go hadnt we  go alone  alone no take some girls im going to take neighbor picketts daughter shes homely as a hedge fence but ill take her for business reasons  hartley youre an infernal fraud  nothing of the kindim a salesman ended hartley with a laugh  after supper the following day as albert was still lingering at the table with the girls and mrs welsh he said to maud  are you going to the sociable  no i guess not  would you go if i asked you  try me and see answered the girl with a laugh her color rising  all right miss welsh will you attend the festivity of the evening under my guidance and protection  yes thank you but i must wash the dishes first  ill wash the dishes you go get ready said mrs welsh  albert felt that he had one of the loveliest girls in the room as he led maud down the floor of the vestry of the church her cheeks were glowing and her eyes shining with maidenly delight as they took seats at the table to sip a little coffee and nibble a bit of cake  maud introduced him to a number of young people who had been students at the university they received him cordially and in a very short time he was enjoying himself very well indeed he was reminded rather disagreeably of his office however by seeing hartley surrounded by a laughing crowd of the more frolicsome young people he winked at albert as much as to say good stroke of business  the evening passed away with songs games and recitations and it was nearly eleven oclock when the young people began to wander off toward home in pairs albert and maud were among the first of the young folks to bid the rest goodnight  the night was clear and keen but perfectly still and the young people arm in arm walked slowly homeward under the bare maples in delicious companionship albert held mauds arm close to his side  are you cold he asked in a low voice  no thank you the night is lovely she replied then added with a sigh i dont like sociables so well as i used tothey tire me out  we stayed too long  it wasnt that im getting so they seem kind o silly  well i feel a little that way myself he confessed  but there is so little to see here in tyre at any timeno music no theatres i like theatres dont you  i cant go half enough  but nothing worth seeing ever comes into these little townsand then were all so poor anyway  the lamp turned low was emitting a terrible odor as they entered the sittingroom  my goodness its almost twelve oclock goodnight she held out her hand  goodnight he said taking it and giving it a cordial pressure which she remembered long  goodnight she repeated softly going up the stairs  hartley who came in a few minutes later found his partner sitting thoughtfully by the fire with his coat and shoes off evidently in deep abstraction  well i got away at lastmuch as ever great scheme that sociable eh i saw your little girl introducing you right and left  say hartley i wish youd leave her out of this thing i dont like the way you speak of her when  phew you dont oh all right im mum as an oysteronly keep it up get into all the church sociables you can theres nothing like it                                       hartley soon had canvassers out along the country roads and was working every house in town the campaign promised to lengthen into a monthperhaps longer albert especially became a great favorite every one declared there had never been such book agents in the town theyre such gentlemanly fellows they dont press anybody to buy they dont rush about and poke their noses where theyre not wanted they are more like merchants with books to sell the only person who failed to see the attraction in them was ed brann who was popularly supposed to be engaged to maud he grew daily more sullen and repellent toward albert noticeably so  one evening about six after coming in from a long walk about town albert entered his room without lighting his lamp lay down on the bed and fell asleep he had been out late the night before with maud at a party and slumber came almost instantly  maud came in shortly hearing no response to her knock and after hanging some towels on the rack went out without seeing the sleeper in the sittingroom she met ed brann he was a stalwart young man with curling black hair and a heavy face at its best but set and sullen now his first words held a menace  say maud i want t talk to you  very well what is it ed replied the girl quietly  i want to know how often youre going to be out till twelve oclock with this book agent  perhaps it was the derisive inflection on book agent that woke albert branns tone was brutalmore brutal even than his words and the girl turned pale and her breath quickened  why ed whats the matter  matter is just this you aint got any business goin around with that feller with my ring on your finger thats all he ended with an unmistakable threat in his voice  very well said the girl after a pause curiously quiet then i wont heres your ring  the mans bluster disappeared instantly bert could tell by the change in his voice which was incredibly great as he pleaded  oh dont do that maud i didnt mean to say that i was madim sorry  im glad you did it now so i can know you take your ring ed i never ll wear it again  albert had heard all this but he did not know how the girl looked as she faced the man in the silence which followed she scornfully passed him and went out into the kitchen brann went out and did not return at supper  young people of this sort are not selfanalysts and maud did not examine closely into causes she was astonished to find herself more indignant than grieved she broke into an angry wail as she went to her mothers bosom  mother mother  why whats the matter maudie tell me there there dont cry pet whos been hurtin my poor little bird  ed has he saidhe said  there there poor child have you been quarrelling again never mind itll come out all right  no it wontnot the way you mean the girl declared ive given him back his ring and ill never wear it again  the mother could not understand with what wounding brutality the mans tone had fallen upon the girls spirit and maud could not explain sufficiently to justify herself mrs welsh consoled herself with the idea that it was only a lovers quarrelone of the little jars sure to come when two natures are settling togetherand that all would be mended in a day or two  albert being no more of a selfanalyst than maud simply said served him right and dwelt no more upon it for the time  at supper however he was extravagantly gay and to himself unaccountably so he joked troutt till maud begged him to stop and after the rest had gone he remained seated at the table enjoying the indignant color in her face and the flash of her infrequent smile which it was such a pleasure to provoke he volunteered to help wash the dishes  thank you but im afraid youd be more bother than help she replied  thank you but you dont know me i aint so green as i look by no manner o means ive been doing my own housekeeping for four terms  i know all about that laughed the girl you young men rooming do precious little cooking and no dishwashing at all  thats a base calumny i made it a point to wash every dish in the house except the spider once a week had a regular cleaningup day  and about the spider  i wiped that out nicely with a newspaper every time i wanted to use it  oh horrorsmother listen to that  why what more could you ask you wouldnt have me wipe it six times a day would you  i wonder it didnt poison you commented mrs welsh  takes moren that to poison a student laughed albert as he went out  the next afternoon he came bursting into the kitchen where maud stood with her sleeves rolled up deep in the dishpan  dont you want a sleighride he asked boyishly eager  she looked up with shining eyes  oh wouldnt i can you get along mother  certainly child go on the air will do you good  wy maud said the little girl you said you didnt want to when ed  mrs welsh silenced her and said  run right along dear its just the nicest time o day are there many teams out  theyre just beginning to come out said albert ill have a cutter around here in about two jiffies be on hand sure  troutt was standing in the sunny doorway of his stable when the young fellow dashed up to him  hullo uncle troutt harness your fastest nag into your swellest outfit instanter  aha goin t take yr girl out hey  yes and i want to do it in style  i guess ol dans the horse for you gentle as a kitten and as knowin as a fox drive him with one handleft hand the old man laughed till his long faded beard flapped up and down and quivered with the stress of his enjoyment of his joke he ended by hitching a viciouslooking sorrel to a gay duckbellied cutter saying as he gave up the reins  now be keerful dans foxy hes all right when he sees youve got the reins but dont drop em  dont you worry about me i grew up with horses said the overconfident youth leaping into the sleigh and gathering up the lines stand aside my lord and let the cortége pass hoopla  the brute gave a tearing lunge and was out of the doorway before the old man could utter another word albert thrilled with pleasure as he felt the reins stiffen in his hands and saw the traces swing slack beside the thills  if he keeps this up hell do he said aloud  as he turned up at the gate maud came gayly down the path muffled to the eyes  oh what a nice cutter but the horseis he gentle she asked as she climbed in  as a cow albert repliedgit out o this bones  the main street was already filled with wood sleighs bobsleds filled with children and men in light cutters out for a race laughter was on the air and the jinglejangle of bells the sun was dazzling in its brightness and the gay wraps and scarfs lighted up the scene with flecks of color loafers on the sidewalks fired familiar phrases at the teams as they passed  step up bones  let er go gallagher  get there eli and the like  but what cared the drivers if the shouts were insolent they laid them to envy and if they were pleasant they smiled in reply  albert and maud had made two easy turns up and down the street when a man driving a span of large black hawk horses dashed up a side street and whirled in just before them the man was a superb driver and sat with the reins held carelessly but securely in his left hand guiding the team more by his voice than by the bit  hello cried bert that looks like brann  it is said maud  cracky thats a fine teamblack hawks both of them i wonder if ol sorrel can pass em  oh please dont try pleaded the girl  why not  becausebecause im afraid  afraid of what  afraid something ll happen  something is sure to happen im goin to pass him if old bones has any git to him  itll make him mad  who mad brann  yes  well spose it does who cares  there were a dozen similar rigs moving up or down the street and greetings passed from sleigh to sleigh everybody except brann welcomed albert with sincere pleasure and exchanged rustic jokes with him as they slowed up at the upper end of the street and began to turn a man on the sidewalk said confidentially  say cap if you handle that old rack o bones just right hell distance anything on this road when you want him to do his best let him have the rein dont pull a pound i used to own imi know im  the old sorrel came round gauming his ugly head thrown up his great red mouth open his ears laid back brann and the young doctor of the place were turning together a little farther up the street the blacks responding to their drivers word came down with flying hoofs their great glossy breasts flecked with foam their jaws champing  come on crowbait yelled brann insultingly as he came down past the doctor and seemed about to pass albert and maud there was hate in the glare of his eyes  but he did not pass the old sorrel seemed to lengthen to the spectators his nose appeared to be glued to the glossy side of branns off black  see them blacks trot shouted albert in ungrammatical enthusiasm  see that old sorrel shake himself yelled the loafers  the doctor came tearing down with a spirited bay a magnificent stepper as he drew along so that bert could catch a glimpse of the mares neck he thrilled with delight there was the thoroughbreds lacing of veins the proud fling of her knees and the swell of her neck showed that she was far from doing her best there was a wild light in her eyes  these were the fast teams of the town all interest was centred in them  clear the track yelled the loafers  the docs good fr em  if she dont break  albert was pulling at the sorrel heavily absorbed in seeing as well as he could for the flung snowballs the doctors mare draw slowly foot by foot past the blacks suddenly brann gave a shrill yell and stood up in his sleigh the gallant little bay broke and fell behind brann laughed the blacks trotted on their splendid pace unchanged  let the sorrel out yelled somebody  let him loose yelled troutt on the corner quivering with excitement let him go  albert remembering what the fellow had said let the reins loose the old sorrels teeth came together with a snap his head lowered and his tail rose he shot abreast of the blacks maud frightened into silence covered her head with the robe to escape the flying snow the sorrel drew steadily ahead and was passing the blacks when brann turned  durn yr old horse he yelled through his shut teeth and laid the whip across the sorrels hips the blacks broke wildly but strange to say the old sorrel increased his speed again brann struck but the lash fell on berts outstretched wrists he did not see that the blacks were crowding him to the gutter but he heard a warning cry  look out there  before he could turn to look the cutter seemed to be blown up by a bomb he rose in the air like a vaulter and when he fell the light went out  the next that he heard was a curious soft murmur of voices out of which a sweet agonized girlvoice broke  oh wheres the doctor hes deadoh hes dead cant you hurry  next came a quick authoritative voice still far away and a hush followed it then an imperative order  stand out o the way what do you think you can do by crowding on top of him  stand back stand back other voices called  then he felt something cold on his scalp they were taking his cap off and putting snow on his head then the doctorhe knew him nowsaid  let me take him  a dull throbbing ache came into his head and as this grew the noise of voices became more distinct and he could hear sobbing then he opened his lids but the glare of the sunlight struck them shut again he saw only mauds face agonized white and wet with tears looking down into his  they raised him a little more and he again opened his eyes on the circle of hushed and excited men thronging about him he saw brann with wild scared face standing in his cutter and peering over the heads of the crowd  how do you feel now asked the doctor  can you hear us albert do you know me called the girl  his lips moved stiffly but he smiled a little and at length whispered slowly yes i guessim allright  put him into my cutter maud get in here too the doctor commanded the crowd opened as the doctor and troutt helped the wounded man into the sleigh the pain in his head grew worse but alberts perception of things sharpened in proportion he closed his eyes to the sun but in the shadow of mauds breast opened them again and looked up at her he felt a vague childlike pleasure in knowing that she was holding him in her arms he thought of his motherhow it would frighten her if she knew  hello called a breathless hearty voice what the deuce y been doing with my pardner bert old fellow are you there hartley asked clinging to the edge of the moving cutter and peering into his friends face albert smiled  im herewhat there is left of me he replied faintly  glory how did it happen he asked of the girl  i dont knowi couldnt seewe ran into a culvert replied maud  werent you hurt  not a bit i stayed in the cutter  albert groaned and tried to rise but the girl gently yet firmly restrained him hartley was walking beside the doctor talking loudly it was a devilish thing to do the scoundrel ought to be jugged  albert tried again to rise im bleeding yet im soaking you let me get up  the girl shuddered but remained firm  no were most home  she felt no shame but a certain exaltation as she looked into the faces about her she gazed unrecognizingly upon her nearest girl friends and they gazing upon her white face and unresponsive eyes spoke in awed whispers  at the gate the crowd gathered and waited with deepest interest it was enthralling romance to them  ed brann done it said one  how asked another  with the butt end of his whip  thats a lie his team ran into lohrs rig  not much ed crowded him into the ditch  what fer  cause bert cut him out with maud  come get out of the way dont stand there gabbing yelled hartley as he took albert in his arms and together with the doctor lifted him out of the sleigh  goodness sakes alive aint it terrible how is he asked an old lady peering at him as he passed  on the porch stood mrs welsh supported by ed brann  shes all right i tell you he aint hurt much either just stunned a little thats all  maud child cried the mother as maud appeared followed by a bevy of girls  im all right mother she said running into the trembling arms outstretched toward her but oh poor albert  after the wounded man disappeared into the house the crowd dispersed brann went off by the way of the alley he was not prepared to meet the questions of his accusers  now what in  you been up to was the greeting of his brother as he reentered the shop  nothing  welting a man on the head with a whipstock aint anything hey  i didnt touch him we was racing and he run into the culvert  hank says he saw you strike him  he lies i was strikin the horse to make him break  oh yeh was sneered the older man well i hope you understand that thisll ruin you in this town if you didnt strike him theyll say you run him into the culvert n every man woman n childll be down on you and me fr bein related to you they all know how you feel toward him for cuttin you out with maud welsh  oh dont bear down on him too hard joe he didnt mean t do any harm said troutt who had followed ed down to the store i guess the young feller ll come out all right just go kind o easy till we see how he turns out if he dies why itll haf t be looked into  ed turned pale and swallowed hastily if he should die ill be a murderer he thought he acknowledged that hate was in his heart and he shivered as he remembered the mans white face with the bright red stream flowing down behind his ear and over his cheek it almost seemed to him that he had struck him so close had the accident followed upon the fall of his whip   iii   albert sank into a feverish sleep that night with a vague perception of four figures in the roommaud her mother hartley and the young doctor when he awoke fully in the morning his head felt prodigiously hot and heavy  it was early dawn and the lamp was burning brightly outside a mans feet could be heard on the squealing snowa sound which told how still and cold it was a team passed with a jingle of bells  albert raised his head and looked about hartley was lying on the sofa rolled up in his overcoat and some extra quilts he had lain down at last worn with watching albert felt a little weak and fell back on his pillow thinking about the strange night he had passeda night more filled with strange happenings than the afternoon  as the light grew in the room his mind cleared and lifting his muscular arm he opened and shut his hand saying aloud in his old boyish manner  i guess im all here  whats that called hartley rolling out of bed did you ask for anything  give me some water jim my mouth is dry as a powdermill  how yeh feelin anyway pardner said hartley as he brought the water  firstrate jim i guess ill be all right  well i guess youd better keep quiet  he threw on his coat next and went out into the kitchen returning soon with some hot water with which he began to bathe his partners face and hands as tenderly as a woman  there now i guess youre in shape fr grubfeel any like grubcome in he called in answer to a knock on the door  mrs welsh entered  how is he she whispered anxiously  oh im all right replied albert  im glad to find you so much better she said going to his bedside ive hardly slep i was so much worried about you your breakfast is ready mr hartley ive got something special for albert  a few minutes later maud entered with a platter followed closely by her mother  the girl came forward timidly but when albert turned his eyes on her and called cheerily good morning she flamed out in rosy color and recoiled she had expected to see him pale dulleyed and with a weak voice but there was little to indicate invalidism in his firm greeting she gave place to mrs welsh who prepared his breakfast she was smitten dumb by his tone and hardly dared look at him as he sat propped up in bed  however though he was feeling absurdly well there was a good deal of bravado in his tone and manner for he ate but little and soon sank back on the bed  i feel better when my head is low he explained in a faint voice  cant i do something asked the girl her courage reviving as she perceived how ill and faint he really was  i guess you better write to his folks said mrs welsh  no dont do that he protested opening his eyes it will only worry them and do me no good ill be all right in a few days you neednt waste your time on me hartley will wait on me  dont mind him said mrs welsh im his mother now and hes goin to do just as i tell him toarent you albert  he dropped his eyelids in assent and went off into a doze it was all very pleasant to be thus waited upon hartley was devotion itself and the doctor removed his bandages with the care and deliberation of a man with a moderate practice besides he considered albert a personal friend  hartley after the doctor had gone said with some hesitation  well now pard i ought to go out and see a couple o fellows i promised t meet this morning  all right jim all right you go right ahead on business im goin t sleep anyway and ill be all right in a day or two  well i will but ill run in every hour r two and see if you dont want something youre in good hands anyway when im gone                                       wont you read to me pleaded albert one afternoon when maud came in with her mother to brush up the room its getting rather slow business layin here like this  shall i mother  why of course maud  so maud got a book and sat down over by the stove quite distant from the bed and read to him from the lady of the lake while the mother like a piece of tireless machinery moved about the house at the neverending succession of petty drudgeries which wear the heart and soul out of so many wives and mothers making life to them a pilgrimage from stove to pantry from pantry to cellar and from cellar to garreta life that deadens and destroys coarsens and narrows till the flesh and bones are warped to the expression of the wronged and cheated soul  alberts selfishness was in a way excusable he enjoyed beyond measure the sound of the girls soft voice and the sight of her graceful head bent over the page he lay looking and listening dreamily till the voice and the sunlit head were lost in a deep sweet sleep  the girl sat with closed book looking at his face as he slept it was a curious study to her a young manthis young man asleep his brown lashes lay on his cheek as placid as those of a child as she looked she gained courage to go over softly and peer down on him how boyish he seemed how little to be feared a boy outside uttered a shout and she hurried away pale and breathless as she paused in the door and looked back at the undisturbed sleeper she smiled and the pink came back into her thin face  alberts superb young blood began to assert itself and on the afternoon of the fifth day he was able to sit in his rockingchair before the fire and read a little though he professed that his eyes were not strong in order that maud should read for him this she did as often as she could leave her other work which was not half often enough the invalid grumbled  more than you deserve she found courage to say  hartley let nothing interfere with the book business you take it easy he repeated dont you worryyour pay goes on just the same youre doing well right where you are by jinks biggest piece o luck he went on half in earnest why i cant turn around without taking an orderfact turned in a book on the livery bill so thats all fixed well make a clear hundred dollars out o that little bump o yours  little bump say now thats  keep it upput it on dont hurry about getting well i dont need you to canvass and i guess you enjoy being waited on he ended with a sly wink and cough  yes convalescence was delicious with maud reading to him bringing his food and singing for him all that marred his peace was the stream of people who came to inquire how he was getting along the sympathy was largely genuine as hartley could attest but it bored the invalid he had rather be left in quiet with walter scott and maud in the light of common day the accident was hurrying to be a dream  at the end of a week he was quite himself again though he still had difficulty in wearing his hat it was not till the second sunday after the accident that he appeared in the diningroom for the first time with a large travellingcap concealing the suggestive bandages he looked pale and thin but his eyes danced with joy  mauds eyes dilated with instant solicitude the rest sprang up in surprise with shouts of delight as hearty as brethren  ginger im glad t see yeh said troutt so sincerely that he looked almost winning to the boy the rest crowded around shaking hands  oh im on deck again  ed brann came in a moment later with his brother and there was a significant little pausea pause which grew painful till albert turned and saw brann and called out  hello ed how are you didnt know you were here  as he held out his hand brann his face purple with shame and embarrassment lumbered heavily across the room and took it muttering some poor apology  hope y dont blame me  of course notfortunes o war nobody to blame just my carelessnessyes ill take turkey he said to maud as he sank into the seat of honor  the rest laughed but brann remained standing near alberts chair he had not finished yet  im mighty glad you dont lay it up against me lohr an i want to say the doctors bill is all right you unerstand its all right  albert looked at him a moment in surprise he understood that this coming from a man like brann meant more than a thousand prayers from a ready apologist it was a terrible victory and he was disposed to make it as easy for his rival as he could  oh all right ed only id calculated to cheat him out o part of itid planned to turn in a couple o blaines twenty years on the bill  hartley roared and the rest joined in but not even albert perceived all that it meant it meant that the young savage had surrendered his claim in favor of the man he had all but killed the struggle had been prodigious but he had snatched victory out of defeat his better nature had conquered  no one ever gave him credit for it and when he went west in the spring people said his passion for maud had been superficial in truth he had loved the girl as sincerely as he had hated his rival that he could rise out of the barbaric in his love and his hate was heroic  when albert went to ride again it was on melting snow with the slowest horse troutt had maud was happier than she had been since she left school and fuller of color and singing she dared not let a golden moment pass now without hearing it ring full and she dared not think how short this day of happiness might be   iv   at the end of the fifth week of their stay in tyre a suspicion of spring was in the wind as it swept the southern exposure of the valley march was drawing to a close and there was more than a suggestion of april in the rapidly melting snow which still lay on the hills and under the cedars and tamaracks in the swamps patches of green grass appearing on the sunny side of the road where the snow had melted led to predictions of spring from the loafers beginning to sun themselves on the saltbarrels and shoeboxes outside the stores  a group sitting about the blacksmith shop were discussing it  its an early seedinnow mark my words said troutt as he threw his knife into the soft ground at his feet the sun is crossing the line earlier this spring than it did last  yes an i heard a crow today makin that kind of aa spring noise that sort oi d know whatkind o goes all through a feller  and theres uncle sweeney an that settles it springs comin sure said troutt pointing at an old man much bent hobbling down the street when he gits out the frogs aint fur behind  well be gittin on to the ground by next monday said sam dingley to a crowd who were seated on the newly painted harrows and seeders which svend  johnson had got out ready for the spring trade svend  johnsons agricultural implement depot was on the north side of the street and on a spring day the yard was one of the pleasantest loafingplaces that could be imagined especially if one wished company  albert wished to be alone something in the touch and tone of this spring afternoon made him restless and inclined to strange thoughts he took his way out along the road which followed the riverbank and in the outskirts of the village threw himself down on a bank of grass which the snows had protected and which had already a tinge of green because of its wealth of sun  the willows had thrown out their tiny lightgreen flags though their roots were under the ice and some of the hardwood twigs were tinged with red there was a faint but magical odor of uncovered earth in the air and the touch of the wind was like a caress from a moist magnetic hand  the boy absorbed the light and heat of the sun as some wild thing might with his hat over his face his hands folded on his breast he lay as still as a statue he did not listen at first he only felt but at length he rose on his elbow and listened the ice cracked and fell along the bank with a long hollow booming crash a crow cawed and a jay answered it from the willows below a flight of sparrows passed twittering innumerably the boy shuddered with a strange wistful longing and a realization of the flight of time  he could have wept he could have sung but he only shuddered and lay silent under the stress of that strange sweet passion which quickened his heart deepened his eyes and made his breath come and go with a quivering sound across the dazzling blue arch of the sky the crow flapped sending down his prophetic jubilant note the breeze as soft and sweet as april stirred in his hair the hills deep in their dusky blue seemed miles away and the voices of the carefree skaters on the melting ice of the river below came to the ear subdued to a unity with the scene  suddenly a fear seized upon the boya horror life life was passing life that can be lived only once and lost is lost forever life that fatal gift of the invisible powers to mana path with youth and joy and hope at its eastern gate and despair regret and death at its low western portal  the boy caught a momentary glimpse of his real significance i am only a gnat a speck in the sun a youth facing the millions of great and wise and wealthy he leaped up in a frenzy oh i mustnt stay here i must get back to my studies life is slipping by me and i am doing nothing being nothing  his face as pale as death shone with passionate resolution and his hands were clinched in silent vow  but on his way back he met the jocund party of skaters going home from the river and with the easy shift and change of youth joined in their ringing laughter the weird power of the winds voice was gone and he sank to the level of the unthinking boy again however the problem was only put off not solved  that night hartley said well pardner were getting most ready to pull out someways i always get restless when these warm days begin this was as sentimental as hartley ever got or if he ever felt more sentiment he concealed it carefully  i spose it must a been in spring that those old chaps on their steeds and in their steel shirts started out for to rescue some damsel hey he ended with a grin now thats the way i feeljust like striking out for say oshkosh that little piece of lofty tumbling of yours was a big boom and no mistake why your share o this campaign will be a hundred and twenty dollars sure  moren ive earned replied bert  no it aint youve done your duty like a man done as much in your way as i have now if you want to try another county with me say so ill make a thousand dollars this year out o this thing  i guess ill go back to school  all right i dont blame you for wanting to do that  i guess with what i can earn for father i can pull through the year i must get back im awfully obliged to you jim  thatll do on that said hartley shortly you dont owe me anything well finish delivery tomorrow and be ready to pull out on friday or sat  there was an acute pain in alberts breast somewhere he had not analyzed his case at all and did not now but the idea of going affected him strongly it had been so pleasant that daily return to a lovely girlish presence  yes sir hartley was going on im going to just quietly leave a book on her centretable i dont know as itll interest her much but itll show we appreciate the grub and so on by jinks you dont seem to realize what a worker that woman is up five oclock in the morningbytheway youve been going around with the girl a good deal and shes introduced you to some firstrate sales now if you want to leave her a little something make it a morocco copy and charge it to the firm  albeit knew that he meant well but he couldnt somehow help saying ironically  thanks but i guess one copy of blaines twenty years will be enough in the house especially  well give her anything you please and charge it up to the firm i dont insist on blaine only suggested that because  i guess i can stand the expense of a present  i didnt say you couldnt man but i want a hand in this thing dont be so turrible keen t snap a feller up complained hartley turning on him what the thunder is the matter of you anyway i like the girl and shes been good to us all round she tended you like an angel  there there thats enough o that put in albert hastily for gods sake dont whang away on that string forever as if i didnt know it  hartley stared at him as he turned away  well by jinks what is the matter o you  he was too busy to dwell upon it much but concluded his partner was homesick  albert was beginning to have a vague underconsciousness of his real feeling toward the girl but he fought off the acknowledgment of it as long as possible his mind moved in a circle coming back to the one point ceaselesslya dreary prospect in which that slender girlfigure had no placeand each time the prospect grew more intolerably blank and the pain in his heart more acute and throbbing  when he faced her that night after they had returned from a final walk down by the river he was as far from a solution as ever he had avoided all reference to their separation and now he stood as a man might at the parting of the ways saying i will not choose i cannot choose i will wait for some sign some chance thing to direct me  they stood opposite each other each feeling that there was more to be said the girl tender her eyes cast down holding her hands to the fire he shivering but not with cold he had a vague knowledge of the vast importance of the moment and he hesitated to speak  its almost spring again isnt it and youve been hereshe paused and looked up with a daring smileseems as if youd been here always  it was about halfpast eight mrs welsh was setting her bread in the kitchen they could hear her moving about hartley was downtown finishing up his business they were almost alone in the house alberts throat grew dry and his limbs trembled his pause was ominous the girls smile died away as he took a seat without looking at her  well maud i suppose you knowwere going away tomorrow  oh must you but youll come back  i dont expect toi dont see how i can i may never see you again  oh dont say that cried the girl her face as white as silver her clasped hands straining  i must goi must he muttered not daring to look upon her face  oh what can i dowe dowithout you i cant bear it  she stopped and sank back into a chair her breath coming heavily from her twitching lips the unnoticed tears falling from her staring pitiful wild appealing eyes her hands nervously twisting her gloves  there was a long silence each was undergoing a selfrevelation each was trying to face a future without the other  i must go he repeated aimlessly mechanically what can i do here  the girls heavy breathing deepened into a wild little moaning sound inexpressibly pitiful her hungry eyes fixed on his face she gave way first and flung herself down upon her knees at his side her hands seeking his neck  albert i cant live without you now take me with you dont leave me  he stooped suddenly and took her in his arms raised her and kissed her hair  i didnt mean it maud ill never leave younever dont cry  she drew his head down and kissed his lips then turned her face to his breastthen joy and confidence came back to her  i know now what you meant she cried gayly raising herself and looking into his face you were trying to scare me trying to make me show how much icared for youfirst there was a soft smile on her lips and a tender light in her eyes but i dont mind it  i guess i didnt know myself what i meant he answered with a grave smile  when mrs welsh came in they were sitting on the sofa talking in low voices of their future he was grave and subdued while she was radiant with love and hope the future had no terrors for her but the boy unconsciously felt the gravity of life somehow deepened by the revelation of her love  why maud mrs welsh exclaimed what are you doing  oh mother im so happyjust as happy as a bird she cried rushing into her mothers arms  why whywhat is it youre crying dear  no im not im laughingsee  mrs welsh turned her dim eyes on the girl who shook the tears from her lashes with the action of a bird shaking water from its wings she seemed to shake off her trouble at the same moment  mrs welsh understood perfectly im very glad too dearie she said simply looking at the young man with motherly love irradiating her worn face albert went to her and she kissed him while the happy girl put her arms about them both in an ecstatic hug  now youve got a son mother  but ive lost a daughtermy firstborn  oh wait till you hear our plans hes going to settle down herearent you albert  then she went away and left the young people alone they had a sweet intimate talk of an hour full of plans and hopes and confidences and then he kissed his radiant love goodnight and going into his own room sat down by the stove and there pondered on the change that had come into his life  already he sighed with the stress of care the press of thought which came upon him the longing uneasiness of the boy had given place to another unrestthe unrest of the man who must face the world in earnest now planning for food and shelter to go back to school was out of the question to expect help from his father overworked and burdened with debt was impossible he must go to work and go to work to aid her a living must be wrung from this town all the home and all the property mrs welsh had were here and wherever maud went the mother must follow  he was in the midst of his mental turmoil when hartley came in humming the mulligan guards  in the dark hey  completely in the dark  well light up light up  im trying to  what the deuce do you mean by that tone whats been going on here since my absence  albert did not reply and hartley shuffled about after a match lighted the lamp threw his coat and hat in the corner and then said  well ive got everything straightened up been freezing out old daggett the old skeesix has been promisin fr a week and i just said old man ill camp right down with you here till you fork over and he did bytheway everybody i talked with today about leaving said whats lohr going to do with that girl i told em i didnt know do you it seems youve been thickern i supposed  im going to marry her said albert calmly but his voice sounded strained and hoarse  whats that yelled hartley  sh dont raise the neighbors im going to marry her  well by jinks when say looky here well i swanny exclaimed hartley helplessly when  right away some time this summerjune maybe  hartley thrust his hands into his trousers pockets stretched out his legs and stared at his friend in vast amaze  youre givin me guff  im in dead earnest  i thought you was going through college all so fast  well ive made up my mind it isnt any use to try replied albert listlessly  what y goin t do here or are y goin t take the girl away with yeh  she cant leave her mother well run this boardinghouse for the present ill try for the principalship of the school here raff is going to resign they say if i cant get that ill go into a law office dont worry about me  but why go into this so quick why not put it off fifteen or twenty years asked hartley trying to get back to cheerful voice  what would be the use at the end of a year id be just about as poor as i am now  cant yr father step in and help you  no there are three boys and two girls all younger than i to be looked out for and he has all he can carry besides she needs me right here and right now and if i can do anything to make life easier for her im going t do it besides he ended in a peculiar tone we dont feel as if we could live apart much longer  but great scott man you cant  now hold on jim ive thought this thing all over and ive made up my mind it aint any use to go on talking about it what good would it do me to go to school another year id come out without a dollar and no more fitted for earning a living for her than i am now and besides all that i couldnt draw a free breath thinking of her workin away here to keep things moving liable at any minute to break down  hartley gazed at him in despair and with something like awe it was a tremendous transformation in the young ambitious student  like most men in america and especially western men he still clung to the idea that a man was entirely responsible for his success or failure in life he had not admitted that conditions of society might be so adverse that only men of most exceptional endowments and willing and able to master many of the best and deepest and most sacred of their inspirations and impulses could succeed  of the score of specially promising young fellows who had been with him at school seventeen had dropped out and down most of them had married and gone back to farming or to earn a precarious living in the small dull towns where farmers trade and traders farm conditions were too adverse they simply weakened and slipped slowly back into dulness and an oxlike or else a fretful patience thinking of these men and thinking their failure due to themselves alone hartley could not endure the idea of his friend adding one more to the list of failures he sprang up at last  say bert you might just as well hang yrself and done with it why its suicide i cant allow it i started in at college bravely and failed because id let it go too long i couldnt studycouldnt get down to it but youwhy old man id bet on you he had a tremor in his voice i hate like thunder to see you give up your plans say you cant afford to do this its too much to pay  no it isnt  i say it isand besides youd get over this in a week  jim called albert warningly sharply  all right said jim in the tone of a man who knows its all wrongall right but the time ll come when youll wish idyou aint doin the girl enough good to make up for the harm youre doin yourself he broke off again and said in a tone of finality im done im all through and i cn see youre through with jim hartley all right  darn curious he muttered to himself that boy should get caught just at this time and not with some o those girls in marion well its none o my funeral he ended with a sigh for it had stirred him to the bottom of his sunny nature after all a dozen times as he lay there beside his equally sleepless companion he started to say something more in deprecation of the step but each time stifled the opening word into a groan  it would not be true to say that love had come to albert lohr as a relaxing influence but it had changed the direction of his energies so radically as to make his whole life seem weaker and lower as long as his lovedreams went out toward a vague and ideal woman supposedly higher and grander than himself he was spurred on to face the terrible sheer escarpment of social eminence but when he met by accident the actual woman who was to inspire his future efforts the difficulties he faced took on solid reality his aspirations fell to the earth their wings clipped and became perforce submissive beasts at the plough the force that moved so much of his thought was transformed into other energy  the table was very gay at dinner next day maud was standing at the highest point of her girlhood dreams her flushed cheeks and shining eyes made her seem almost a child and hartley wondered at her and relented a little in the face of such happiness  theyre gay as larks now thought hartley to himself as he joined in the laughter but that wont help em any ten years from now  he could hardly speak next day as he shook hands at the station with his friend  goodby ol man i hope itll come out all right but im afraidbut there i promised not to say anything about it goodby till we meet in congress he ended in a resolute attempt to conceal his dismay  cant you come to the wedding jim weve decided on june you see they need a man around the house so weyoull come wont you old fellow and dont mind my being a little crusty last night  oh yes ill come jim said in a tone which concealed a desire to utter one more protest but to himself he said  that ends him hes jumped into a hole and pulled the hole in after him a man cant marry a family like that at his age and pull out of it he may but i doubt it well as i remarked before its none o my funeral so long as hes satisfied  but he said it with a painful lump in his throat and he could not bring himself to feel that alberts course was right and felt himself to be somehow culpable in the case     a division in the coolly   a funeral is a depressing affair under the best circumstances but a funeral in a lonely farmhouse in march the roads full of slush the ragged gray clouds leaping the sullen hills like eagles is tragic  the teams arrived splashed with mud the women blue with cold under their scanty cottonquilt lap robes their hats set awry by the wind they scurried into the house to sit and shiver in the best room where all the chairs that could contrive to stand erect and all of any sort that could be borrowed were crammed in together to seat the women folks  the men drove out to the barn and having blanketed their teams with lap robes picked their way through the slush of the yard over to the lee side of the haystack where the pale sun occasionally shone  they spoke of diseased williams as if diseased were his christian name they whittled shingles or stalks of straw as they talked  sooner or later after each new arrival they branched off upon politics and the mckinley bill was handled gingerly if any one in his zeal raised his voice above a certain pitch some one said hish and the newcomers voice sank again to that abnormal quiet which falls now and again on these loudvoiced folk of the wind and open spaces  the boys hung around the kitchen and smokehouse playing sly jokes upon each other in order to provoke that explosion of laughter so thoroughly enjoyed by those who can laugh noiselessly  a snort of this sort brought deacon williams out to reprimand them boys boys you should have more respect for the dead  the preacher came the choir raised a wailing chant for the dead but the group by the haystack did not move  occasionally they came back after talking about seeding and the price of hogs to the discussion of the dead mans affairs  i spose his property will go to emmy and serry half and half  i expec so he always said so an john want a man to whiffle about every day  well emmy wont make no fuss but if ike dont git moren his half ill eat the greaser  whos executor  deacon williams i expect  well the deacons a slick one some one observed as if that were an excellent quality in an executor  they aint no love lost between bill gray and harkey i dont expect  no i dont think they is  ike dont seem to please people its queer too he tries awful hard  the voice of the preacher within raised to a wild shout interrupted them  the elders gettin warmed up said one of the storytellers pausing in his talk and so i told bill if he wanted the cordwood  the sun shone warmer and the chickens cawcawed feebly the colts whinnied and a couple of dogs rolled and tumbled in wild frolic while the voice of the preacher sounded dolefully or in humming monotone  meanwhile in the house in the best room and in the best seats near the coffin the women in their black worn dresses with wrinkled sallow faces and gnarled hands sat shivering theirs was to be the luxury of the ceremony  the carpet was damp and muddy the house was chill and the damp wind filled them all with ague but they had so much to see and talk about that time passed rapidly each one entering was studied critically to see whether dress and deportment were proper to the occasion or not and if one of the girls smiled a little as she entered some one was sure to whisper  heartless thing how can she  there were a few young men only enough to help out on the singing and they remained mainly in the kitchen where they were seen occasionally in anxious consultation with deacon williams  the girls looked serious but a little sly as if they could smile if the boys looked their way or if one of the old women should cough her store teeth out  upstairs the family were seated in solemn silence the two nieces emma and sarah and emmas husband harkey and sarahs childrendeceased williams had no wife these people sat in stony immobility except when harkey looked at his watch and said  seem slow gitten here  occasionally women came up the stairway and flung themselves upon the necks of the mourning nieces who submitted to it without apparent disgust or astonishment and sank back into the same icy calm after their visitors had straightened their things and retired to the reserved seats below  deacon williams small quick with sunny bluegray eyes belying the gloomy curve of his mouth was everywhere arranging for bearers selecting hymns conferring with the family keeping abstracted old women off the seats reserved for the mourners and maintaining an anxious lookout for the minister  the deacon was a distant relative of the dead man and it was generally admitted that he would have a time of it in administering upon the estate  at last the word was whispered about that the elder was coming word was sent to the smokehouse and to the haystack to call the stragglers in they came slowly and finding the rooms all filled considered themselves absolved from a disagreeable duty and went back to the sunny side of the haystack where they smoked their pipes in ruminative enjoyment  the elder upon entering took his place beside the coffin the foot of which he used for a pulpit on which to lay his bible and his hymnbook a noise of whispering rustling scraping of feet arose as some old men crowded in among the women and then the room became silent  the elder took his seat and glanced round upon them all with solemn unrecognizing severity while the mourners came down the creaking pine stairway in proper order of procedure  everybody noticed the luxury of new dresses on the nieces and the new suits on the children everybody knew the feeling which led to these extravagances death after all was a majestic visitor and money was not to stand in the way of a decent showing some of the girls smiled slyly at isaacs gloves which were too small and would go only halfway on a fact he tried to conceal by keeping his hands folded each boy was provided with a large new stiff cotton handkerchief which occupied immense space in outside pockets crumpled as they were into a rustling ball with cruel salient angles like a chinese puzzle  the elder had attended two funerals that week and like a jaded actor came lamely to his work his prayer was not entirely satisfactory to the older people they had expected a little more power  he was a thinfaced man with weak brown eyes and a mouth like a gopher that is with very prominent upper teeth his black coat was worn and shiny and hung limply as if at some other period he had been fatter or as if it had belonged to some other man  the choir with instinctive skill had selected a wailing hymn only slightly higher in development than the chant of the indians sweet plaintive at times barbaric in its moving cadences they sang it well in meditative march looking out of the windows during its interminable length  then the elder read some passages of the scripture in his funeral voice which was entirely different from his marriage voice and his sunday voice it had deep cadences in it and chanting inflections not unlike the negro preachers or the keeners at irish wakes  then he gave out the hymn which all joined in singing rising to their feet with much trouble after they had settled down again he took out a large carefully ironed handkerchief and laid it on the coffin as who should say if you have tears prepare to shed them now  the absurdity of all this did not appear to his listeners though they well knew he cared very little about the dead man who was a very retiring person  the elder on his part understood that his audience was before him for the pleasure of weeping for the delight of seeing agonized faces and hearing wild griefladen wailing they were there to feel the delicious creeping thrill of horror and fear roused by the presence of the corpse and the near shadow of the hovering angel of death  the elder led off by some purely perfunctory remarks about the deceased about his kindness and his honesty this caused the nieces to wipe away a sparse tear or two and he was encouraged as if by slight applause he developed as usual the idea that in the midst of life we are in death that no man can tell when his time will come he told two or three grewsome stories of sudden death his voice now rose in a wild chant now sank to a hoarse whisper  the blowing of noses low sobbings and fervent amens from the old men thickened encouragingly and he entered upon more impassioned flights his voice naturally sonorous deepened in powerful song till the men seated comfortably on their haunches out by the haystack could plainly hear his words oh my brethren what will you do in that last day  sarahs boys without in the least understanding what it all meant began to weep also and to use their handkerchiefs so smooth and shining they were useless as so much legalcap writing paper  their misery would have been enhanced had they known that out in the wagonshed under cover of the elders voice the other boys were having a game of mummelly peg in the warm dry ground their fresh young souls laughed at death as the early robins out in the hedge near by defied the winds of march  having harrowed the poor sensationloving souls as thoroughly as could be desired the elder began the process of letting them down easy he remembered that the lord was merciful that the deceased could approach him with confidence that there was a life beyond the tomb a life of eternal rest the allurement of all hardworking humanity  slowly the snuffling and sobbing ceased the handkerchiefs took longer and longer intervals of rest and when in conclusion the preacher said let us pray the old men looked at each other with fervent satisfaction its been a blessed timea blessed time  the pretty girl who sang the soprano looked very interesting with her wet eyelashes the tears stopped halfway in their course down her rounded cheek the closing hymn promised endless peace and rest but was voiced in the same tragic and hopeless music with which the service opened  deacon williams came out to say all parties desiring to view the remains will now have an opportunity he had the hospitable tone of a host inviting his guests in to dinner  viewing the remains was considered a religious duty and the men from outside and even the boys from behind the smokehouse felt constrained to come in and pass in shuddering horror before the still face whose breath did not dim the glass above it most of them hurried by the box with only a swift side glance down at the strange thing within  then the bearers lifted the coffin and slipped it into the platformspring wagon which was backed up to the door the other teams loaded up and the procession moved off down the perilously muddy road toward the village buryingground  in this way was john williams a hardworking honorable welshman buried his death furnished forth a sombre dramatic entertainment such as he himself had ceremoniously attended many times the funeral trotters whom he had seen at every funeral in the valley were now in at his death and would be at each others death until the black and yellow earth claimed them all  a ceremony almost as interesting to the gossips as the burial was the reading of the will to which only the family were invited after the return of emma her husband and sarah from the cemetery deacon williams read the dead mans bequests seated in the best room which was still littered with chairs and damp with mud  the will was simple and not a surprise to any one it gave equal division of all the property to the nieces  well now whenll we have the settlement asked the deacon  justs you say deacon said emma meekly  suit yourself said harkey only it ad better come soon sooner the betterseedins coming on  well tomorrow is friday why not saturday  all right saturday all agreed  as harkey drove off down the road he said to his wife the sooner we have it the fewer things ll git carried off the deacon dont favor me none and bill gray is sweet on serry and hell bear watchin  the deacon on his part took his chin in his fist and looked after harkey seemed a little bit anxious cordin to my notion he said with a smile   ii   saturday was deliciously warm and springlike the hens woke in the early dawn with a jocund note in their throats and the young cattle frisked about the barnyard moved to action by the electrical influences of the south wind  clear as a bell overhead deacon williams said  but jack dunlap sarahs hand said nobody travels that way  long before dawn the noise of the melting water could be heard running with musical tinkle under the ice the ponds crashed and boomed in long reverberating explosions as the sinking water heaved it up and let it fall with crackling roar flights of ducks flashed over cackling breathlessly as they scurried straight into the north  deacon and sarah arrived early and took possession for sarah was to have the eighty which included the house they were busy getting things ready for the partition the deacon assisted by jack the hired man was busy hauling the machinery out of the shed into the open air while sarah and a couple of neighbors girls with skirts tucked up and towels on their heads were scouring up pots and pans and dusting furniture in the kitchen  the girls strong and handsome in their unsapped animal vigor enjoyed the innocent display of their bare arms and petticoats  people from sand lake passing by wondered what was going on gideon turner had the courage to pull up and call out for the satisfaction of his wife  whats going on here this fine morning  oh were goin to settle up the estate said sarah why how de do mrs turner  wy its you is it serry  yes its mewhat they is left of me i been here sence six oclock im getting things ready for the division deacon williams is the executor you know  aha less see you divide equally i hear  nears we can get at it uncle left me the house eighty and the valley eighty to emmy deacons goin to parcel out the belongins  turner looked sly howd harkey feel  sarah smiled i dont know and care less hell make trouble if he can but i dont see how he can he agreed to have the deacon do the dividin and hell have to stand by it so far as i can see  mrs turner looked dubious well you know ike harkey he looks as though sugar wouldnt melt in his mouth but i tell you id hate to have dealins with him  turner broke in well we must be movin i spose youll move right in  yes just as soons as this things settled  well goodby come up  you come down  sarah was a heavy goodnatured woman a widow with a raft of children probably for that reason her uncle had left her the house which was large and comfortable as she stood looking down the road one of the girls came out to the gate she was a plump strong creature a neighbors girl who had volunteered to help  anybody coming  yes i guessno its going the other way aint it a nice day  that was as far as she could carry the utterance of her feeling but all the morning she had felt the wonderful power of the air the sun had risen incredibly warm the wind was in the south and the crackling booming roar of ice in the ponds and along the river was like winter letting go its iron grip upon the land even the old cows shook their horns and made comical attempts to frisk with the yearlings sarah knew it was foolish but she felt like a girl that morningand bill was coming up the road  in the midst of the joy of the spring day stood the house desolate and empty out of which its owner had been carried to a bed in the cold clinging clay of the little buryingground  the girls and sarah worked swiftly brushing cleaning setting aside giving little thought to even the beauty of the morning which entered their blood unconsciously  well how goes it asked a quick jovial voice  the girls gave screams of affected fright  why deacon you nearly scared the life out of us  deacon williams was always gallant  i didnt know i was given to scaring the ladies he said well whos here  nobody but us so far  haint seen nothing o harkey  not a thing he sent word hed be on hand though  m well weve got the machinery invoiced guess ill look around and kind o get the household things in my minds eye said the deacon taking on the air of a public functionary  all right well have everything ready here in a few minutes  they returned to work dusting and scrubbing the girls with their banter put death into the background as an obscure and infrequent incident of old age  sarah again studied the road down the coolly  well there i see a team coming up the coolly now wonder if its emmy  looks more like bill grays team said one of the girls looking slyly at sarah who grew very red  oh youre too sharp aint you  it was perfectly ridiculous to the young people to see these middleaged lovers courting like sixteenyearolds and they had no mercy on either bill or sarah  bill drove up in leisurely way his horses steaming his wagonwheels loaded with mud mrs gray was with him her jolly face shining like the morning sun  hello folkses are you all here  good morning mrs gray said the deacon approaching to help her out hello bill nice morning  bill looked at sarah for a moment bully good he said leaving his mother to scramble down the wagonwheel aloneat least so far as he was concerned but the deacon stood below courageously  mrs gray cried out in her loud good humor look out deacon dont git too near meif i should fall on you there wouldnt be a grease spot left there im all right now she said having reached ground without accident she shook her dress and looked briskly around wal what you done anyway emmys folks come yet  no but i guess thats them comin now i hope ike wont come though  mrs gray stared at the deacon why not  well hes just sure to make a fuss said jack hes so afraid he wont get his share  bill chewed on a straw and looked at sarah abstractedly  well whats t be done inquired mrs gray after a pause  cant do much till emmy gets here said sarah  oh i guess we can bill you put out yr team we wont get away fore dinner  the men drove off to the barn leaving the women to pick their way on chips and strips of board laid in the mud to the safety of the chippile and thence to the kitchen which was desolately littered with utensils  deacon assumed command with the same alertness and with the same sunny gleam in his eye with which he directed the funeral a few days before  now bill put out your team and help jack and me pen them hogs women folks ll git things ready here  emma came at last driven by harkeys brother and his hired man they were both brawny fellows rude and irritable and the deacon lifted his eyebrows and whistled when he saw them drive in with a lumber wagon  the women swarmed out to greet emma who was a thin irritable feeble woman  better late than never wheres ike inquired mrs gray  well hecouldnt git away very wellhes got t clean up some seedoats she answered nervously after the men drove off however she added he thought he hadnt ought to come he didnt want to cause no aidgewise feelins so he thought he hadnt better comehed just leave it to you deacon  the deacon said all right all right well fix it up but he didnt feel so sure of it after that though he set to work bravely  the sun growing warmer fell with pleasant gleam around the kitchen door and around the chippile where the hens were burrowing the men worked in their shirtsleeves  well now well share the furniture an stuff next said the deacon looking around upon his little interested semicircle of spectators now put emmys things over there and serrys things over here ill call em off and if theys no objection you girls can pass em over  he cleared his throat and began in the voice of one in authority  thirteen pans six to emmy seven to serry then hastened to add ill balance that by giving the biggest of the two kittles to emmy rollin pin and cake board to serry two flatirons to emmy small tub to emmy large one to serry balanced by the tin water pail dozen closepins half an half six o one halfdozen tother he said with a smile at his own joke while the others actively placed the articles in separate piles  stove to serry because she has the house bureau to emmy  at this point mrs gray said i guess that aint quite even deacon the bureau aint worth much  oh no no thats all right let her have it emma protested nervously  give her an extry tick anyway said sarah not to be outdone in magnanimity  settle that between ye said the deacon  he warmed to his work now and towels pans crockery brooms mirrors pillows and bedticks were rapidly set aside in two groups on the soft soil the poverty of the home could best be seen in the display of its pitiful furniture  the two nieces looked on impassively standing side by side the men came to move the bureau and other heavy things and looked on while the lighter things were being handed over by mrs gray and the girls  at noon they sat down in the empty kitchen and ate a cold snackat least the women took seats the men stood around and lunched on hunks of boiled beef and slices of bread there was an air of constraint upon the male portion of the party not shared by mrs gray and the girls  well that settles things in the house beamed the deacon as he came out with the women trailing behind him an now in about two jerks of a dead lambs tail well git at the things out in the barn  wal we dont know much about machines and things but i guess wed better go out and keep you men from fightin said mrs gray shaking with fun ike didnt come because he didnt want to make any trouble but i guess he might just as well a come as send two such critters as jim n hank  the women laughed at her frankness and in very good humor they all went out to the barnyard  now these things cant be laid out fast as i call em off but well do the best we can  lets try the stawk first said jim  the women stood around with shawls pinned over their heads while the division of the stock went forward the young men came often within chaffing distance of the girls  there were nine shotes nearly of a size and the deacon said ill give serry the odd shote  why so asked jim harkey a sullenfaced man of thirty  because a shote is hard to carry off and i can balance  well i guess you can balance fr em bout as well as fr serry  the deacon was willing to yield a point any objection bill if not why  nope let her go said bill  what ave you got to say bout it asked jim insolently  bill turned his slow bulk i guess ive a good eal to sayhavent i serry  sarah reddened but stood beside him bravely i guess you have bill about as much as i have there was a moment of dramatic tension and the girls tingled with sympathy  let er go said bill splitting a straw with his knife he had not proposed to sarah before and he felt an unusual exaltation to think it came so easy after all  when they reached the cattle jim objected to striking a balance with a farrer cow and threw the deacons nice calculation all out of joint  let it go jim pleaded emma  i wont do it ike saidi mean i know he dont want no farrer cow hes got two now  the deacon was a little nettled i guess thats going to stand he said sharply  jim swore a little but gave in and came back with an access of ill humor on a division of the horses  but ive give you the four heavy horses to balance the four others and the twoyearold said the deacon  ill be damned if i stand that said jim  i guess youll have to said the deacon  emma pleaded let it go jim dont make a fuss  jim raged on ill be cawndemmed if ill stand it i dontike dont want them spavined old crows theyre all ringboned and got the heaves his long repressed illnature broke out  toh toh said the deacon dont kick over the traces now well fix it up some way  emma tried to stop jim but he shook her off and continued to walk back and forth behind the horses munching on quietly unconscious of any dispute about their value  bill sat on the oat box in his hulking way his heels thumping a tune his small gray eyes watching the angry man  dont make a darn fool of yourself he said placidly  jim turned glad of the chance for a row you better keep out of this  bill continued to thump the palms of his big hands resting on the edge of the box im in it he said conclusively  well you git out of it i aint goin to be bulldozedthat aint what i come here for  no i see it aint said bill if youre after a row you can have it right here you wont find a better place  there there urged the deacon whats the use keep cool and dont tear your shirts  mrs gray went up to jim and took him by the arm you need a good spankin to make you goodnatured she said i think the deacon has done first rate and you ought o  let go o me he snarled raising his hand as if to strike her  bills big boot lunged out catching harkey in the ribs and if the deacon had not sprung to his assistance jim would have been trampled to pieces by the scared horse under whose feet he found himself he was wild with dizzy breathless rage  who hit me he demanded  bills shapeless hulk straightened up and stood beside him as if his pink flesh had suddenly turned to oak out of his fat cheeks his gray eyes glared  i did want another  the deacon and jack came between and prevented the encounter which would have immediately followed bill went on  they caint no man lay a hand on my mother and live long after it he was thoroughly awake now there was no slouch to his action at that moment and jim was secretly pleased to have the encounter go by  you come here for a fuss and you can have it both of you bill went on in unusual eloquence deacons tried to do the square thing emmys tried to do the square thing and serrys kep quiet but youve been sour and ugly the whole time and now its goin to stop  this aint the last of this thing said jim  you neverll have a better time said bill  mrs gray and the deacon turned in now to quiet bill and the settlement went on jim kept close watch on the proceedings and muttered his dissent to his friends but was careful not to provoke bill further  in dividing the harnesses they came upon a cowbell hanging on a nail the deacon jingled it as he passed goes with the bellcow he said and nothing further was said of it jim apparently did not consider it worth quarrelling about  at last the work was done a terribly hard days work the machines and utensils were piled in separate places the cattle separated and the grain measured as they were about to leave the deacon said finally  if theres any complaint to make lets have it right now i want this settlement to be a settlement is everybody satisfied  i am said emmy aint you serry  why of course said sarah who was a little slower of speech i think the deacon has done first rate i aint a word of fault to find have you bill  nope not an ioty said bill readily  jim did not agree in so many words but as he said nothing the deacon ended  well that settles it it aint goin to rain so you can leave these things right here till monday i guess ill be gettin out for home good evening everybody  emma drove away down the road with jim but sarah remained to straighten up the house harkeys hired hand went home with dade walker who considered that walk the pleasant finish to a very interesting days work she sympathized for the time with the harkey faction  sunday forenoon when bill and sarah drove up to the farm to put things in order in the house they found ike harkey walking around with that queer side glance he had studying the piles of furniture and mentally weighing the pigs  he greeted them smoothly yes yes im purrfickly satisfied purrfickly not a word to saybettern i expected he added  bill was not quite keen enough to perceive the insult which lay in that final clause and sarah dared not inform him for fear of trouble  as harkey drove away however bill had a dim feeling of dissatisfaction with him  hes too goldang polite that feller is i dont like such buttermouth chapstheyd steal the cents offn a dead niggers eyes   iii   the second sunday after the partition of goods the entire coolly turned out to church in spite of the muddy road the men after driving up to the door of the little white church and helping the women to alight drove out to the sheds along the fence and gathered in knots beside their wagons in the warm spring sun it was very pleasant there and the men leaned with relaxed muscles upon the wagonwheels or sat on the fence with jackknives in hand the horses weary with six days seeding slept with closed eyes and drooping lips generally the talk was upon spring work each man bragging of the number of acres he had sown during the week but this morning the talk was all about the division which had come between the nieces of deceased williams they discussed it slowly as one might eat a choice pudding in order to extract the flavor from each spoonful  what is it all about anyhow asked jim cranby i aint heard nothing about it he had stood in openmouthed perplexity trying to catch a clew coming late he found it baffling  that shows where he lives a man might as well live in a well as up in molasses gap said one of the younger men pointing up to the coolly why ike harkey is kicking about the six shotes the deacon put off on him  no it wasnt the shotes it was a farrer cow put in clint stone  well i heard it was a shote  so did i said another  well bill gray told jinks ike had stole a cowbell that belonged to the black farrer cow said another late comer  stole a cowbell and they all drew closer together this was really worth while  yes sir jinks told me he heard bill say so yesterday thats the way i heard it  well ill be cussed if that aint small business for ike harkey  how did it happen asked cranby with sharpened appetite  well i didnt hear no prticlars but it seems the bell was hangin on a peg in the barn and when they got home from church it was gone hide an hair bill is dead sure ike took it  say therell be fun over that yet wont they said one of the fellows with a grin  well ike better keep out of bills way thats all  welli aint takin sides some youngun may have took it  well lets go in boys i see the elders come by gum theres harkey they all looked toward harkey who had just driven up to the door  harkey came into church holding his smooth serious face a little one side in his usual way quiet and dignified as if he were living up to his sunday suit of clothes he seemed to be unconscious of the attitude in which he stood toward most of his neighbors  bill and sarah were not present and that gave additional color to the story of trouble between the sisters  after the sermon deacon harkey led the sunday school and the critics of his action were impressed more than usual with his smooth and quiet utterance emma seemed more than ordinarily worn and dispirited  it was perfectly natural that mrs gray should be the last person to know of the division which had slowly set in between the two sisters and their factions charitable and guileless herself it was difficult for her to conceive of slander and envy  nevertheless a division had come about slowly but decisively the entire coolly was involved in the discussion before mrs gray gave it any serious attention but one day when sarah came in upon her and poured out a mingled flood of sorrow and invective the good soul was aghast  well well i swan there there i wouldnt make so much fuss over it she said stripping her hands out of the biscuit dough in order to go over and pat sarah on the shoulder after all that todo gettin settled seems s if you ought o stay settled good land it aint anything to have a fuss over anyway  but it is our cowbell it belonged on the black farrer cow that jim turned his nose up at and he sneaked around and got it just to spite us  oh i guess not she replied incredulously  well he did and emmy put him up to it and i know she did said sarah in a lamentable voice  sary ann said mrs gray as sharply as any one ever heard her speak thats a pretty way to talk about your sister aint it  well mrs jim harkey said  you never mind what mrs jim harkey said shes a snoop and everybody knows it  but she wouldnt tell that if it werent so  well i tell you i wouldnt pay no attention to what she said and i wouldnt make such a fuss over an old cowbell anyway  but the cowbell is only the starting point she aint been near the house since and she says all kinds of mean nasty things about us  all comes through mrs jim i suppose said mrs gray with some sarcasm  no it dont she told dade walker that i got all the biggest flatirons when she knows i offered her the bureau i did everything i could to make her feel satisfied  i know you did and now you must just keep cool till i see emmy myself  when mrs gray started out on her mission of pacification she found it to be entirely out of her control the coolly was actively partisan one party stood by the harkeys and another took sarahs part while the tertium quid said it was all darn foolishness  mrs gray was appalled at the state of affairs but struggled to maintain a neutral position in may when bill and sarah were married things had reached such a stage that emma was not invited to the wedding supper nothing could have cut deeper than this neglect and thereafter adherents of the third remove declined to speak when passing some even refused to nod the harkey faction also condemned the early marriage of bill and sarah as unseemly  soon after emma came again to see mrs gray salty with tears and crushed with the slight sarah had put upon her she was a plain pale woman anyway and weeping made her pitiable she explained the situation with her head on mrs grays lap  she never has been to see me since that day andbut i hoped shed come and see me but she never sent me any invitation to her wedding she choked with sobs at the memory of it  mrs gray realized the enormity of the offence and she could only put her arms around emmas back and say there there i wouldnt take on so about it as a matter of fact she had striven to have bill send an invitation to his brotherinlaw but bill was inflexible on that point with the sound of the stolen cowbell ringing in his ears he could not bring himself to ask ike harkey into his house  after emma grew a little calmer mrs gray tried again to bridge the chasm now i just believe if you would go to sarah  i cant do that shed slam the door in my face jims wife says sarah said i shouldnt pick a single currant out of the garden this year  i dont go much on what jims wife says put in mrs gray guardedly she had begun to feel that jims wife was the main disturbing element  the sisters really suffered from their separation they had been so used to running in at all times of the day that each missed the other wofully it had been their habit whenever they needed each other to help cook or cut a dress to hang a cloth out of the chamber window a sign which was sure to bring help posthaste but now nothing would induce either of them to make the first concession  two or three times when emma feeling especially lonely was on the point of hanging out the signal she was prevented by the thought of some cruel message mrs jim had brought jim lived on ikes farm in a small house that had been emmas first home and mrs jim was almost as much in her house as in her own she had no children and was a mischiefmaker not so much from ill will as from a love of dramatic situations it was her life this dramatic play of loves and hates among her friends and neighbors  emma feared her husband too he was so selfcontained and so inexorably moral at least in appearance he sweetly said he bore no ill will toward the grays but he must insist that his wife should not visit them until they apologized he took the matter very serenely however  the sound of the cowbell was a constant daily irritation to bill he was slow to wrath but the bell seemed to rasp on his tenderest nerve it had a curiously exultant sound heard in the early morningit seemed to voice harkeys triumph bills friends were astonished at the change in him he grew dark and thunderous with wrath whenever harkeys name was mentioned  one day ikes cattle broke out of the pasture into bills young oats and though ike hurried after them it seemed to bill he might have got them out a little quicker than he did he said nothing then however but when a few days later they broke in again he went over there in very bad humor  i want this thing stopped he said  ike was mending the fence he smiled in his sweet way and said smoothly im sorry but when they once git a taste of grain its pretty hard to keep em  well there ought to be a new fence here said bill that fence is as rotten as a pumpkin  i spose they had yes sir thats so harkey assented quickly im ready to build my half you know he said any timeany time you are  well ill build mine tomorrow said bill i cant have your cattle pasturing on my oats  all right all right ill have mine done as quick as yourn  well seet you do i dont want my grain all tramped into the ground and i aint agoin to have it  harkey hastily gathered up his tools saying yes yes all right  you might send home that cowbell of mine while youre about it bill called after him but harkey did not reply or turn around   iv   the line fence ran up the bluff toward the summit of the ridge to the east on each side it was set with smooth green slopes of pasture and pleasant squares of wheat until it reached the woods and ran under the oaks and walnuts and birches to the cliffs of lichenspotted stone which topped the summit  bill walked the full length of the fence to see how much of the old material could be used he recognized the bell on one of harkeys cattle and he grew wrathful at the sight of another cow peacefully gnawing the fresh green grass with the bell which belonged to the black cow on her neck  it was midspring everywhere was the vivid green of the wisconsin landscape the slopes were like carefully tended lawns without stumps or stones the groves rose up the hills pink and gray and green in softly rounded billows of cherry bloom and tender oak and elm foliage here and there under the forest tender plants and flowers had sprung up slender and succulent like all productions of a rich and shadowed soil  early the next morning bill and his two hands began to work in the meadow working toward the ridge harkey and his brother and their hands began at the ridge and worked down toward the meadow each party could hear the axes of the other ringing in the still beautiful spring air  bills hired hand on his way to the spring about the middle of the forenoon met jim harkey who said wickedly in answer to a jocular greeting  dont give me none of your lip now well break your necks for two cents  the hand came to bill with the story bill theyre on the fight  oh i guess not  well they be we better not run up against them today if we dont want trouble  well i aint goin to dodge em said bill i aint in that business if they want fight well accommodate em with the best weve got in the shop  at noon harkeys gang went to dinner a little earlier and as they came down the path quite near jim said with a sneer  you managed to git the easiest half of the fence didnt yeh  we took the half that belongs to us said bill we dont take what dont belong to us  cowbells for instance put in bills hired hand with a provoking intonation  jim stopped and his face twisted with rage ike paused a little farther on down the path jim came closer  say i know what youre driving at and youre a liar and for a leather cent id lick you like hell  you cant do it you dont weigh enough  oh shut up jack called bill go about yr business he said to jim or ill take a hand  jims face flamed into a wild wrath his lips lifted at the corners like a wolfs as he leaped the fence with a wild spring and lunged against bills breast the larger man went down but his great arms closed about his assailants neck with a bearlike grip jim could neither rise nor strike with a fury no animal could equal he pressed his hands upon bills throat and thrust his elbow into his mouth in the attempt to strangle him he meant murder  jack faced the other men who came running up ike seized a stake and was about to leap over when jack raised an axe in the air  stand off he yelled and his voice rang through the woods he noticed how harsh and wild it sounded in the silence he heard a grunting sound and gave one glance at the two men writhing amid the ferns silent as grappling bulldogs  bill had fallen in the brake and seemed wedged in at last there came into his heart a terrible shiver a blind desperation that uncoiled all the strength in his great bulk then he seemed to bound from the ground as he twisted the other man under him and shook himself free  he dragged one great maul of a fist free and drove it at the face beneath him jim saw it coming and turned his head the blow fell on his neck and his carnivorous grin smoothed out as if sleep had suddenly fallen upon him he drew a long shuddering breath his muscles quivered and his clenched hands fell open  bill rose upon his knees and looked at him a deep awe fell upon him in the pause he heard the robins rioting from the trees in the lower valley and the woodpecker cried resoundingly  youve killed him cried ike as he climbed hastily over the fence  bill did not reply the men faced each other in solemn silence all wish for murder going out of their hearts the sobbing cry of the mourning dove which they had been hearing all day suddenly assumed new meaning  ah woe woe is me it cried  bring water shouted ike kneeling beside his brother  bill knelt there with him while the rest dashed water upon jims face  at last he began to breathe like a fretful waking child and looking up into the scared faces above him motioned the water away from him the angry look came back into his face but it was mixed with perplexity  he touched his hand to his face and brought it down covered with blood how much am i hurt he said fiercely  oh nothing much ike hastened to say its just a scratch  jim struggled to his elbow and looked around him it all seemed to come back to him did he do it fair he demanded of his companions  oh yes it was fair enough said ike  jim looked at jack that thing didnt hit me with his axe did he  jack grinned no but i was just agoin to when bill belted you one was the frank and convincing reply  jim got up slowly and faced bill well that settles it its all right youre a better man than i am thats all ive got to say  he climbed back over the fence and led the way down to dinner without looking back  what give ye that lick on the side o the head jim his wife asked when he sat down at the dinnertable  never you mind he replied surlily but he added ikes axe come off and give me a sidewinder  bill carefully removed all marks of his struggle and walked into dinner shamefacedly all muscle gone out of his bulk of fat his sudden return to primeval savagery grew monstrous in the cheerful kitchen with its noise of hearty children sizzling meat and the clatter of dishes  the stove was not drawing well and sarah did not notice anything out of the way with bill  i never see such a hateful thing in all my life she said referring to the stove that rhubarb duff wont be fit for a hog to eat the undercrust aint baked the least bit yet and i have had it in there since fifteen minutes after leven  bill said generously oh well never mind serry well worry it down some way   v   all through july and august mrs jim harkey seemed to renew her endeavors to keep the sisters apart she still carried spiteful tales to and fro amplifying them with an irresistible histronic tendency it had become a matter of selfexoneration with her then she could not stop now without seeming to admit she had been mischiefmaking in the past if the sisters should come together her lies would instantly appear  emma grew morose irritable and melancholy she was suffering for her sisters wholesome presence and yet being under the dominion of the mischiefmaker dared not send word or even mention the name of her sister in the presence of the harkeys  mrs jim came up to the house to stay as emma got too ill to work and took charge of the house the children hated her fiercely and there were noisy battles in the kitchen constantly wearing upon the nerves of the sick woman who lay in the restricted gloom of the sitting room bedchamber within hearing of every squall  there were moments of peace only when ike was in the house smooth as he was jims wife was afraid of him there was something compelling in his lowtoned voice his presence subdued but did not remove strife  his silencing of the tumult hardly arose out of any consideration for his wife but rather from his inability to enjoy his paper while the clamor of war was going on about him  he was not a tender man and yet he prided himself on being a very calm and eventempered man he kept out of bills way and considered himself entirely justified in his position regarding the cowbell it is doubtful if he would have accepted an apology  emma suffered acutely from mrs harkeys visits something mean and wearying went out from her presence and her sharp bold face was a constant irritation sometimes when she thought herself alone emma crawled to the window which looked up the coolly toward sarahs home and sat there silently longing to send out a cry for help but at the sound of jane harkeys step she fled back into bed like a frightened child  she became more and more childish and more flighty in her thoughts as her time of trial drew near and she became more subject to her jailer she grew morbidly silent and her large eyes were restless and full of pleading  one day she heard mrs smith talking out in the kitchen  how is emmy today mrs jim  well not extry she aint likely to come out as well as usual this time i dont think was the brutally incautious reply shes pretty well run down and i wouldnt be surprised if she had some trouble  i suppose sarah will be down to help you said mrs smith  well i guess notnot after what shes told  what has she told asked mrs smith in her sweet and friendly voice  why she said she wouldnt set foot in this house if we all died  i never heard her say that and i dont believe she ever did say it said mrs smith firmly  emmas heart glowed with a swift rush of affection toward her sister and mrs smith she wanted to cry out her faith in sarah but she dared not  mrs harkey slammed the oven door viciously well you can believe it or not just as you like i heard her say it  well i didnt so i cant believe it  when mrs smith came in emma was ready to weep so sweet and cheery was her visitors face  she found no chance to talk with her however for mrs harkey kept near them during her visit once while mrs jim ran out to look at the pies mrs smith whispered dont you believe what they say about sarah shes just as kind as can bei know she is shes looking down this way every day and i know shed come down instanter if youd send for her im going up that way and  she found no further chance to say anything but from that moment emma began to think of letting sarah know how much she needed her she planned to hang out the cloth as she used to she exaggerated its importance in the way of an invalid until it attained the significance of an act of treason she felt like a criminal even in thinking about it  several times in the night she dreamed she had put the cloth out and that jim and his wife had seen it and torn it down she awoke two or three times to find herself sitting up in bed staring out of the window through which the moon shone and the multitudinous sounds of the midsummer insects came sonorously  once her husband said whats the matter it seems to me youd rest better if youd lay down and keep quiet his voice was low enough but it had a peculiar inflection which made her sink back into bed by his side shivering with fear and weeping silently  the next day jim and her husband both went off to town and jims wife after about ten oclock said  now emmy im going down to smiths to get a dress pattern and i want you to keep quiet right here in bed ill be right back ill set some water here and i guess you wont want anything else until i get back ill run right down and right back  after hearing the door close emma lay for a few minutes listening waiting until she felt sure mrs harkey was well out of the yard then she crept out of bed and crawled to the window mrs jim was far down the road she could see her blue dress and her pink sunbonnet  the sick woman seized the sheet and pulled it from the bed the clothes came with it but she did not mind that she pulled herself painfully up the stairway and across the rough floor of the chamber to the window which looked toward her sisters house and with a wild exultation flung the sheet far out and dropped on her knees beside the open window  she moaned and cried wildly as she waved the sheet the note of a scared child was in her voice  oh serry come quick oh i need you serry i didnt mean to be mean i want to see you so oh dear oh dear oh serry come quick  then space and the world slipped away and she knew nothing of time again until she heard the anxious voice of sarah below  emmy where are you emmy  here i be serry  with swift heavy tread sarah hurried up the stairs and the dear old face shone upon her again those kind gray eyes full of anxiety and of love  emma looked up like a child entreating to be lifted her look so pitifully eager went to the younger sisters maternal heart  you poor dear soul why didnt you send for me before  oh serry dont leave me again will you  when mrs harkey returned she found sarah sitting by emmas side in the bedchamber sarah looked at her with all the grimness her jolly fat face could express  you aint needed here she said coldly if you want to do anything find a man and send him for the doctorquick if she dies youll be her murderer  mrs harkey was subdued by the bitterness of accusation in sarahs face as well as by emmas condition she hurried down the coolly and sent a boy wildly galloping toward the town then she went home and sat down by her own hearthstone feeling deeply injured  when the doctor came he found a poor little boy baby crying in sarahs arms it was emmas seventh child but the ever sufficing motherlove looked from her eyes undimmed limitless as the air  will it live doctor its so little she said with a sigh  oh yes i suppose so said the doctor as if its living were not entirely a blessing to itself or others yes ive seen lots of lusty children begin life like that but he said to sarah at the door she needs better care than the babe  shell git it said sarah with deep solemnity if i have to move over hereand live     a fair exile   the train was ambling across the hot russet plain the wind strong and warm and dry sweeping up from the south carried with it the subtle odor of september grass and gathered harvests out of the unfenced roads the dust arose in long lines like smoke from some hidden burning which the riven earth revealed the fields were tenanted with thrashing crews the men diminished by distance to pygmies the long belt of the engine flapping and shining like a ribbon in the flaming sunlight  the freightcars on the accommodation train jostled and rocked about and heaved up laterally till they resembled a long line of awkward frightened galloping buffaloes the one coach was scantily filled with passengers mainly poorly clothed farmers and their families  a young man seated well back in the coach was looking dreamily out of the window and the conductor a keeneyed young fellow after passing him several times said in a friendly way  going up to boomtown i imagine  yesif we ever get there  oh well get there we wont have much more switching weve only got an empty car or two to throw in at the junction  well im glad of that im a little impatient because ive got a case coming up in court and im not exactly fixed for it  your name is allen i believe  yes j h allen of sioux city  i thought so ive heard you speak  the young lawyer was a tall slender darkeyed man rather sombre in appearance he did not respond to the invitation in the conductors voice  when do you reach the junction  next stop were only a few minutes late expect to meet friends there  no thought id get a lunch thats all  at the junction the car became pretty well filled with people two or three norwegian families came clattering in the mothers clothed in heavy shawls and cheap straw hats the flaxenhaired children in faded cottonade and blue denims they filled nearly half the seats several drummers came in laughing loudly bearing heavy valises then allen heard above the noise the shrill but sweet voice of a girl and caught the odor of violets as two persons passed him and took a seat just before him  the man he knew by sight and reputation as a very brilliant young lawyeredward benson of heron lake the girl he knew instantly to be utterly alien to this land and people she was like a tropic bird seen amid the scant foliage of northern hills there was evidence of great care and taste in every fold of her modish dress her hat was simple but in the latest city fashion and her gloves were spotless she gave off an odor of cleanliness and beauty  she was very young and slender her face was piquant but not intellectual and scarcely beautiful it pleased rather by its life and motion and oddity than by its beauty she looked at her companion in a peculiar waytrustfully almost reverentlyand yet with a touch of coquetry which seemed perfectly native to every turn of her body or glance of her eyes  her companion was a fine western type of selfmade man he was tall and broadshouldered but walked a little stooping like a man of fifty he wore a long prince albert frockcoat hanging loosely from his rather square shoulders his white vest was noticeably soiled by his watch chain and his tie was disarranged  his face was very fine and good his eyes were grayblue deep and quiet but slightly smiling as were his lips which his goldenbrown mustache shaded but did not hide he was kept smiling in this quizzical way by the nervous chatter of the girl beside him his profile which was the view allen had of him was striking his strong straight nose and abrupt forehead formed a marked contrast to the rather characterless nose and retreating forehead of the girl  the first words that allen distinguished out of the merry war in which they seemed engaged were spoken in the tone of pretty petulance such women usea coquettes defence  you did you did you did now you know you did you told me that you told me you despised girls like me  i said i despised women who had no object in life but dress he replied rather soberly  but you were hopping on me you meant me now you cant deny it you despise me i know you do she challenged his flattery in her pouting selfdepreciation  the young man tried to stop her in her course to change her mood which was descending to real feeling his low words were lost in the rumble of the car  yes yes try to smooth it over but you cant fool me any more but i dont want you to flatter me and lie to me the way judge stearns did she added with a sudden change of manner i like you because youre straight  the phrase with which she ended seemed to take on a new meaning uttered by those red lips in childish pout  now why are you down on the judge i dont see said the man as if she had gone back to an old attack  well if youd seen what i have youd understand she turned away and looked out of the window oh this terrible country id die out here in six weeks i know i should  the young lawyer was not to be turned aside  of course im pleased to have you throw the judge over and employ me but all the same i think you do him an injustice hes a good square man  square man she said turning to him with a sudden fury in her eyes do you call it square for a manmarried and grayhaired tooto take up with a woman like mrs shellberg say do you now  well i dont quite believe  oh i lie do i she cried with another swift change to reproach you cant take my word for mrs shellbergs visits to his office  but he was her lawyer  but you know what kind of a woman she is she didnt need to go there every day or two did she what did he always receive her in his private office for come now tell me that  i dont know that he did persisted the lawyer  a sort of convulsion passed over her face her little hands clinched and the tears started into her eyes her voice was very quiet  you think i lie then  i think you are mistaken just as other jealous women have  you think im jealous do you  you act like a jeal  jealous of that grayhaired old wretch no sir ii she struggled to express herself i liked him and i hated to lose all my faith in men i thought he was good and honest when he prayedoh ive seen him pray in church the old hypocrite her fury returned at the recollection  her companions face grew grave the smile went out of his eyes leaving them dark and sorrowful  i understand you now he said at last she turned to look at him my practice in the divorce business out here has almost destroyed my faith in women if it werent for my wife and sister  she broke in eagerly now i know you know what i mean sometimes i think men aredevils she thrust this word forth and her little face grew dark and strained but the judge kept me from thinkingi never loved my father he didnt care for me all he wanted to do was to make ten thousand barrels of beer a year and sell it and the judge seemed like a father to me till she came and destroyed my faith in him  butwell let mrs s go there are lots of good men and pure women in the world its dangerous to think there arentespecially for a handsome young woman like you you cant afford to keep in that kind of a mood long  she looked at him curiously thats what i like about you she said soberly you talk to me as if i had some senseas if i were a human being if you were to flatter me now and make love to me i never would believe in any man again  he smiled again in his frank good way and drew a picture from his pocket it was a picture of a woman bending down over a laughing naked child sprawling frogwise in her lap the womans face was broad and intellectual and handsome the look of splendid maternity was in her eyes they both looked at the picture in silence the girl sighed  i wish i was as good as that woman looks  you can be if you try  not with a big chicago brewer for a father and a husband that beats you whenever the mood takes him  i admit thats hard i think the atmosphere of that heron lake hotel isnt any great help to you  oh theyre a gay lot there we fight like cats and dogs a look of slyness and boldness came over her face mrs shellberg hates me as hard as i do her she used to go around telling its very peculiar you knowshe imitated her rivals voicebut no matter which end of the diningroom i sit all the men look that way  the young lawyer laughed at her in spite of himself  and she went on but they dont now thats the reason she hates me she said in conclusion the men dont notice her when im around  to hear her fresh young lips utter those words with their vile inflections was like taking a sudden glimpse into the underworld where harlots dwell and the spirits of unrestrained lusts dance in the shadowy recesses of the human heart  allen hearing this fragmentary conversation fascinated yet uneasy looked at the pair with wonder they seemed quite unconscious of their public situation  the young lawyer looked straight before him while the girl swept on by her ignoble rage displayed still more of the moral ulceration which had been injected into her young life  i dont see what men find about her to likeunless it is her eyes shes got beautiful eyes but shes vulgarugh the stories she tellsright before men too shed kill any one that got ahead of her that woman would and yet shell come into my room and cry and cry and say dont take him away from me leave him to me ugh it makes me sick she stamped her foot then added irrelevantly she wears a wig too i suppose that old fool of a judge thinks its her own hair  the lawyer sat in stony silence his grave face was accusing in its set expression and she felt it and was spurred on to do still deeper injustice to herselfan insane perversity  not that i care a centim not jealous of her i aint so bad off for company as she is she cant take anybody away from me but she must go and break down my faith in the judge  she bit her lips to keep from crying out she looked out of the window again seeking control  the divorce colony never appeared more sickening in its inner corruptions than when delineated by this dainty young girl allen could see the swarming men about the hotels he could see their hot leering eyes and smell their liquorladen breaths as they named the latest addition to the colony or boasted of their associations with those already well known  the girl turned suddenly to her companion  how do those people live out here on their farms  she pointed at a small shanty where the whole family stood to watch the train go by  by eating boiled potatoes and salt pork  salt pork she echoed as if salt pork were old bootheels or bark or hay why it takes four hours for salt pork to digest  he laughed again at her childish irrelevancy so much the better for the poor whered you learn all that anyway  at school oh you neednt look so incredulous i went to boardingschool i learned a good deal more than you think  well so i see now i should have said pork digested in three hours speaking from experience  well it dont what do the women do out here  they work like the men only more so  do they have any new things  not very often im afraid  she sighed after a pause she said  you were raised on a farm  yes in minnesota  did you do work like that she pointed at a thrashingmachine in the field  yes i ploughed and sowed and reaped and mowed i wasnt on the farm for my health  youre very strong arent you she asked admiringly  in a slabsided kind of a wayyes  her eyes grew abstracted  i like strong men ollie was a little man not any taller than i am but when he was drunk he was what men call aa holy terror he struck me with the waterpitcher oncethat was just before baby was born i wish hed killed me she ended in a sudden reaction to hopeless bitterness it would have saved me all these months of life in this terrible country  it might have saved you from more than you think he said quietly tenderly  what do you mean  youve been brought up against women and men who have defiled you theyve made your future uncertain  do you think its so bad as that tell me she insisted seeing his hesitation  youre on the road to hell he said in a voice that was very low but it reached her it was full of pain and grave reprimand and gentleness youve been poisoned youre in need of a good mans help you need the companionship of good earnest women instead of painted harlots  her voice shook painfully as she replied  you dont think im all bad  youre not bad at allyoure simply reckless you are not to blame it depends upon yourself now though whether you keep a true woman or go to hell with mrs shellberg  the conductor eyed them as he passed with an unpleasant light in his eyes and the drummers a few seats ahead turned to look at them the tip had passed along from lip to lip they were like wild beasts roused by the presence of prey their eyes gleamed with relentless lust they eyed the little creature with ravening eyes her helplessness was their opportunity  allen sitting there entered into the terror and the tragedy of the girls life he imagined her reckless prodigal girlhood the coarse rich father the marriage when a thoughtless girl with a drunken dissolute boy the quarrels brutal beatings the haste to secure a divorce the contamination of the crowded hotels in heron lake where this slender young girlnaturally pure alert quick of impulsewas like a lamb among lustful wolves his heart ached for her  the deep slow voice of the lawyer sounded on his eyes turned toward her had no equivocal look he was a brother speaking to a younger sister the tears fell down her cheeks upon her folded hands her widely opened eyes seemed to look out into a night of storms  oh what shall i do she moaned i wish i was deadand baby too  live for the babylet him help you out  oh he cant i dont care enough for him i wish i was like other mothers but im not i cant shut myself up with a baby im too young  he saw that she was seeking the love of a man not the care of a child she had the wifely passion but not the mothers love he was silent the case baffled him  oh i wish you could help me i wish i had you to help me all the time i do i dont care what you thinki do i do  our home is open to you and baby too he said slowly my wife knows about you and  who told herdid you she flashed out again angrily jealously  yes my wife is my other self he replied quietly  she stared at him breathing heavily then looked out of the window again at last she turned to him she seemed to refer to his invitation  oh this terrible land oh i couldnt stay here id go insane perhaps im going insane anyway dont you think so  no i think youre a little nervous thats all  oh do you think ill get my divorce  certainly without question  can i wait and go back with you  i shall not return for several days perhaps you couldnt bear to wait in this little town its not much like the city  oh dear but i cant go about alone i hate these men they stare at me so i wish i was a man its awful to be a woman dont you think so please dont laugh  the young lawyer was far from laughing but this was her only way of defending herself these pert birdlike ways formed her shield against ridicule and misprision  he said slowly yes its an awful thing to be a woman but then its an awful responsibility to be a man  what do you mean  i mean that we are responsible as the dominant sex for every tragic incomplete womans life  dont you blame mrs shellberg she said forcing him to a concrete example with savage swiftness  no she had a poor father and a poor husband and she must earn her own living some way  she could cook or nurse or something like that  it isnt easy to find opportunity to cook or nurse if it were as easy to earn a living in a pure way as it is in a vicious way all men would be rich and virtuous but what had you planned to do after your divorce  oh im going to travel for two years then ill try to settle down  what you need is a good husband and a little cottage where youd have to cook your own foodand tend the baby  i wouldnt cook for any man living she broke in to express her bitterness that he could so coldly dispose of her future oh this terrible train cant it go faster if id realized what a trip this was i wouldnt have started  this is the route you all go he replied with grim humor and his words pictured a ceaseless stream of divorcées  she resented his classing her with the rest but she simply said you despise me dont you but what can we do you cant expect us to live with men we hate can you that would be worse than mrs shellberg  no i dont expect that of you id issue a divorce coupon with every marriage certificate and done with it he said in desperate disgust then this whole cursed business would be done away with it isnt a question of our laxity of divorce laws he said after a pause its a question of the senseless severity of the laws in other states thats what throws this demoralizing business into our hands here  it pays dont it i know ive paid for everything ive had  yes thats the demoralizing thing it draws a gang of conscienceless attorneys here and it draws us who belong here off into dirty work and it brings us into contact with men and womenim sick of the whole business  she had hardly followed him in his generalizations she brought him back to the personal  youre sick of me i know you are she leaned her head on the windowpane her eyes closed oh i wish my heart would stop beating she said in a tense profoundly significant tone  allen sitting so close behind them was forced to overhear so piercingly sweet was her voice he trembled for fear some one else might hear her it seemed like profanation that any one but god should listen to this outcry of a quivering writhing soul  she faced her companion again youre the only man i know now that i respect and you despise me  no i dont i pity you  thats worse i want you to help me oh if you could go with me or if i could be with you her gloved hands strained together in the agony of her desire  his calm lips did not waver he did not smile even about the eyes he knew her cry sprang from her need of a brother not from the passion of a woman  our home is yours just as long as you can bear the monotony of our simple lives he said in his quiet way but it was deepthroated and unmistakable in its sincerity  she laid her hand on his arm and clasped it hard then turned away her head and they rode in silence  after they left the car allen sat with savage eyes and grimly set mouth going over the problem again and again he saw that young and helpless creature walking the gantlet between endless ranks of lustful remorseless men snatching at her in selfish bestial desire  it made him bitter and despairing to think that women should be helplessthat they should need some man to protect them against some other man he cursed the laws and traditions that had kept women subordinate and trivial and deceptive and vacillating he wished they could be raised to the level of the brutes till like the tigress or shewolf they could not only defend themselves but their young  he tried to breathe a sigh of relief that she had gone out of his life but he could not it was not so easy to shake off the shadow of his responsibility he followed her in imagination on her downward path till he saw her stretching out her hands in pitiful need to casual acquaintancesalone and without hope still petite still dainty in spite of all still with flashes of wit and then  he shuddered o my god upon whom does the burden of guilt lie                                       on the night of his return he sat among his romping babes debating whether he should tell the story to his wife or not as the little ones grew weary the noise of the autumn windthe lonely woful moaning prairie windcame to his ears and he shuddered his wife observed it  what is it joe did you get a chill  oh no the wind sounds a little lonesome tonight thats all but he took his little girl into his arms and held her close     an alien in the pines  i   a man and a woman were pacing up and down the wintry station platform waiting for a train on every side the snow lay a stained and crumpled blanket with here and there a light or a chimney to show the village sleeping beneath  the sky was a purpleblack hemisphere out of which the stars glittered almost white the wind came out of the west cold but amiable the cracked bell of a switchengine gurgled querulously at intervals followed by the bumping of coupling freightcars roosters were crowing and sleepy trainmen were assembling in sullen silence  the couple walked with arms locked like lovers but the tones of their voices had the quality which comes after marriage they were man and wife  the womans clear voice arose oh ed isnt this delicious what one misses by not getting up early  sleep for instance laughed her husband  dont drag me down you know what i mean lets get up early every morning while were up here in the woods  shouldnt wonder if we had to therell be a lot to do and i want to get back to chicago by the 1st of february  this is an experience isnt it still when is our train due  due now i think that is our headlight up the track  as he spoke an engine added its voice to the growing noise of the station and drew solemnly down the frosty steel  an eruption of shapeless forms of men from the depot filled the one general coach of the train they nearly all were dressed in some sort of fur coat and all had the look of men accustomed to outdoor lifepowerful loudvoiced unrefined they were in fact travelling men business men the owners of mills or timber the stolid or patient oxlike faces of some norwegian workmen dressed in gay mackinac jackets were sprinkled about  the young wife was a fine type of woman anywhere but these surroundings made her seem very dainty and startlingly beautiful her husband had the fair skin of a city man but his powerful shoulders and firm step denoted health and wholesome living they were both good to look at  they soon felt the reaction to sleepiness which comes to those not accustomed to early rising and the wife soothed by the clank of the train leaned her head on her husbands shoulder and dozed he looked out upon the landscape glad that his wife was not observing it he did not know such desolation existed in wisconsin  on every side were the evidences of a ruined forest land a landscape of flat wastes of thinned and burned and uprooted trees a desolate and apparently useless land  here and there a sawmill stood gray and sagging surrounded by little cabins of unpainted wood to testify to the time when great pines stood all about and the ring of the swampers axe was heard in the intervals of silence between the howls of a saw  to the north the swells grew larger birch and tamarack swamps alternated with dry ridges on which an inferior pine still grew the swamps were dense tangles of broken and uprooted trees slender pikelike stumps of firedevastated firs rose here and there black and grim skeletons of trees  it was a land that had been sheared by the axe torn by the winds and blasted by fire  off to the west low blue ridges rose marking the boundaries of the valley which had been washed out ages ago by water after the floods pine forest had sprung up and these in their turn had been sheared away by man it lay now awaiting the plough and seeder of the intrepid pioneer  suddenly the wife awoke and sat up why we havent had any breakfast  he smiled at her childish look of bewilderment ive been painfully aware of it for some time back ive been suffering for food while you slept  why didnt you get into the basket  how could i with you on my manly bosom  she colored up a little they had not been married long evidently how considerate you are  they were soon eating a breakfast with the spirit of picnickers occasionally she looked out of the window  what a wild country she said he did not emphasize its qualities to her rather he distracted her attention from its desolation  the train roared round its curves conforming with the general course of the river on every hand were thickening signs of active lumber industry they flashed by freight trains loaded with logs or lumber or ties mills in operation grew thicker  the car echoed with the talk of lumber a brisk man with a red mustache was exhibiting a model of a machine to cut certain parts of machinery out of two by fours another was describing a new shinglemill he had just built  a couple of elderly men one a german were discussing the tariff on lumber the workmen mainly sat silent  its all so strange the young wife said again and again  yes it isnt exactly the lake shore drive  i like it i wish i could smell the pines  youll have all the pines you can stand before we get back to chicago  no sir im going to enjoy every moment of it and youre going to let me help you knowlook over papers and all that im the heiress you must remember she added wickedly  well we wont quarrel about that until we see how the legacy turns out it may not be worth my time up here i shall charge you roundly as your lawyer depend on that  the outlook grew more attractive as the train sped on old mosinee rose a fine rounded blue shape on the left  why theres a mountain i didnt know wisconsin had such a mountain as that  neither did i this valley is fine now if your uncles estates only included that hill  the valley made off to the northwest with a bold large and dignified movement the coloring blue and silver purplebrown and bronzegreen was harmonious with the grouping of lines it was all fresh and vital wholesome and very impressive  from this point the land grew wilderthat is to say more primeval there was more of nature and less of man the scar of the axe was here and there but the forest predominated the ridges of pine foliages broke against the sky miles and miles in splendid sweep  this must be lovely in summer the wife said again and again as they flashed by some lake set among the hills  its fine now he replied feeling the thrill of the sportsman id like to shoulder a rifle and plunge into those snowy vistas how it brings the wild spirit out in a man women never feel that delight  oh yes we do she replied glad that something remained yet unexplained between them we feel just like men only we havent the strength of mind to demand a share of it with you  yes you feel it at this distance youd come back mighty quick the second night out  she did not relish his laughter and so looked away out of the window just think of ituncle edwin lived here thirty years  he forebore to notice her inconsistency yes the wilderness is all right for a vacation but i prefer chicago for the year round  when they came upon ridgeley both cried out with delight  oh what a dear picturesque little town she said  well well i wonder how they came to build a town without a row of battlemented stores  it lay among and upon the sharp low stumpy pine ridges in haphazard fashion like a swiss village a small brook ran through it smothered here and there in snow a sawmill was the largest figure of the town and the railway station was the centre there was not an inch of painted board in the village everywhere the clear yellow of the pine flamed unstained by time lumber piles filled all the lower levels near the creek evidently the town had been built along logging roads and there was something grateful and admirable in its irregular arrangement the houses moreover were all modifications of the logging camps even the drug store stood with its side to the street all about were stumps and fringes of pines which the lumbermen for some good reason had passed by charred boles stood purpleblack out of the snow  it was all green and gray and blue and yellowwhite and stern the sky was not more illimitable than the rugged forest which extended on every hand  oh this is gloriousglorious said the wife do i own some of this town she asked as they rose to go out  i reckon you do  oh im so glad  as they stepped out on the platform a large man in corduroy and wolfskin faced them like a bandit  hello ed  hello jack well weve found you my wife mr ridgeley weve come up to find out how much youve embezzled he said as ridgeley pulled off an immense glove to shake hands all round  well come right over to the hotel it aint the auditorium but then again it aint like sleeping outdoors  as they moved along they heard the train go off and then the sound of the saw resumed its domination of the village noises  was the town named after you or you after the town asked field  named after me old man didnt want it named after him would kill it he said  mr and mrs field found the hotel quite comfortable and the dinner wholesome they beamed upon each other  its going to be delightful they said  ridgeley was a bachelor and made his home at the hotel also that night he said now well go over the papers and records of your uncles property and then well go out and see if the property is all there i imagine this is to be a searching investigation  you may well think it my wife is inexorable  as night fell the wife did not feel so safe and well pleased the loud talking in the office below and the occasional whooping of a crowd of millhands going by made her draw her chair nearer and lay her fingers in her husbands palm  he smiled indulgently dont be frightened my dear these men are not half so bad as they sound   ii   mrs field sat in the inner room of ridgeleys office waiting for the return of her husband with the team they were going out for a drive  ridgeley was working at his books and he had forgotten her presence  she could not but feel a deep admiration for his powerful frame and his quick absorbed action as he moved about from his safe to his desk he was a man of great force and ready decision  suddenly the door opened and a stranger entered he had a sullen and bitter look on his thin dark face ridgeleys quick eyes measured him and his hand softly turned the key in his money drawer and as he faced about he swung shut the door of the safe  the stranger saw all this with eyes as keen as ridgeleys a cheerless and strange smile came upon his face  dont be alarmed he said im low but i aint as low as that  well sir what can i do for you asked ridgeley mrs field half rose feeling something tense and menacing in the attitude of the two men  but the intruder quietly answered you can give me a job if you want to  ridgeley remained alert his eyes ran over the mans tall frame he looked strong and intelligent although his eyes were fevered and dull  what kind of a job  any kind that will take me out into the woods and keep me there  there was a selfaccusing tone in his voice that ridgeley felt  whats your object you look like a man who could do something else what brings you here  the man turned with a sudden resolution to punish himself his voice expressed a terrible loathing  whiskey thats what its a hell of a thing to say but i cant let liquor alone when i can smell it im no common hand or i wouldnt be if ibut let that go i can swing an axe and im ready to work thats enough now the question is can you find a place for me  ridgeley mused a little the young fellow stood there statuesque rebellious  then ridgeley said i guess i can help you out that much he picked up a card and a pencil what shall i call you  oh call me williams that aint my name but itll do  what you been doing  everything part of the time drinking the rest was in a liverystable down at wausau last week it came over me when i woke yesterday that i was gone to hell if i stayed in town so i struck out and i dont care for myself but ive got a woman to look out for he stopped abruptly his recklessness of mood had its limits after all  ridgeley pencilled on a card give this to the foreman of no 6 the men over at the mill will show you the teams  the man started toward the door with the card in his hand he turned suddenly  one thing more i want you to send ten dollars of my pay every two weeks to this address he took an envelope out of his pocket it dont matter what i say or do after this i want that money sent the rest will keep me in tobacco and clothing you understand  ridgeley nodded perfectly ive seen such cases before  the man went out and down the walk with a hurried determined air as if afraid to trust his own resolution  as ridgeley turned toward his desk he met mrs field who faced him with tears of fervent sympathy in her eyes  isnt it awful she said in a half whisper poor fellow what will become of him  oh i dont know hell get along some way such fellows do ive had em before they try it awhile here then they move i cant worry about them  mrs field was not listening to his shifty words and then think of his wifehow she must worry  ridgeley smiled perhaps its his mother or a sister  anyway its awful cant something be done for him  i guess weve done about all that can be done  oh i wish i could help him ill tell ed about him  dont worry about him mrs field he aint worth it  oh yes he is i feel hes been a fine fellow and then hes so selfaccusing  her own happiness was so complete she could not bear to think of others misery she told her husband about williams and ended by asking cant we do something to help the poor fellow  field was not deeply concerned no hes probably past help such men are so set in their habits nothing but a miracle or hypnotism can save them hell end up as a lumber jack as the townsmen call the hands in the camps  but he isnt that edward hes finer some way you feel he is ask mr ridgeley  ridgeley merely said yes he seemed to me to be more than a common hand but all the same it wont be two weeks before hell be in here as drunk as a wild cat wanting to shoot me for holding back his money  in this way williams came to be to mrs field a very important figure in the landscape of that region she often spoke of him and on the following saturday night when field came home she anxiously asked is williams in town  no he hasnt shown up yet  she clapped her hands in delight good good hes going to win his fight  field laughed dont bet on williams too soon well hear from him before the week is out  when are we going to visit the camp she asked changing the subject  as soon as it warms up a little it is too cold for you  she had a laugh at him you were the one who wanted to plunge into the snowy vistas  he evaded her joke on him by assuming a careless tone im not plunging as much as i was the snow is too deep  when you go i want to go with youi want to see williams  ha he snorted melodramatically she scorns me faithful heart she turns  mrs field smiled faintly dont joke about it ed i cant get that wife out of my mind   iii   a few very cold gray days followed and then the north wind cleared the sky and though it was still cold it was pleasant the sky had only a small white cloud here and there to make its blueness the more profound  ridgeley dashed up to the door with a hardy little pair of broncos hitched to a light pair of bobs and mrs field was tucked in like a babe in a cradle  almost the first thing she asked was how is williams  oh hes getting on nicely he refused to sleep with his bunkmate and finally had to lick him i understand to shut him up challenged the whole camp then to let him alone or take a licking they let him alone lawson says glang there you rats  mrs field said no more for the air was whizzing by her ears and she hardly dared look out so keen was the wind but as soon as they entered the deeps of the forest it was profoundly still  the ride that afternoon was a glory she never forgot everywhere yellowgreens and purple shadows the sun in a burnished blue sky flooded the forests with light striking down through even the thickest pines to lay in fleckings of radiant white and gold upon the snow  the trail it was not a road ran like a graceful furrow over the hills around little lakes covered deep with snow through tamarack swamps where the tracks of wild things thickened over ridges of tall pine clear of brush and curving everywhere amid stumps where dismantled old shanties marked the site of the older logging camps sometimes they met teams going to the store sometimes they crossed logging roadswide smooth tracks artificially iced down which mountainous loads of logs were slipping creaking and groaning sometimes they heard the dry clickclock of the woodsmens axes or the crash of falling trees deep in the wood when they reached the first camp ridgeley pulled up the steaming horses at the door and shouted hello the camp  a tall old man with a long red beard came out he held one bare red arm above his eyes he wore an apron  hello sandy  hello mr ridgeley  ready for company  am always ready for company he said with a scotch accent  well were coming in to get warm  vera weel  as they went in under the roofed shed between the cooks shanty and the other and larger shanty mrs field sniffed sandy led them past a large pyramid composed of the scraps of beef bones eggshells cans and tea grounds left over during the winter in the shed itself hung great slabs of beef  it was all as untidy and suggestive of slaughter as the nest of a brood of eagles  sandy was beginning dinner on a huge stove spotted with rust and pancake batter all about was the litter of his preparation beefbeef on all sides and tin dishes and bare benches and huge iron cookingpans  mrs field was glad to get out into the sunlight again what a horrible place are they all like that  no my camps are not like thator i should say our camps ridgeley added with a smile  not a gay place at all said field in exaggerated reserve  but mrs field found her own camps not much better true the refuse was not raised in pyramidal shape before the front door and the beef was a little more orderly but the low log huts the dim cold light the dingy walls and floors the lack of any womanly or home touch the tin dishes the wholesale cooking all struck upon her with terrible force  do human beings live here she asked ridgeley when he opened the door of the main shanty of no 6  forty creatures of the men kind sleep and house here he replied  to which the socks and things give evidence said field promptly pointing toward the huge stove which sat like a rustyred cheese in the centre of the room above it hung scores of ragged gray and red socks and mackinac boots and jackets which had been washed by the men themselves  around were the grimy bunks where the forty men slept like tramps in a steamers hold the quilts were grimy and the posts greasy and shining with the touch of hands there were no chairsonly a kind of rude stool made of boards there were benches near the stove nailed to the rough floor in each bunk hanging to a peg was the poor little imitationleather handbag which contained the whole wardrobe of each man exclusive of the tattered socks and shirts hanging over the stove  the room was chill and cold and gray it had only two small windows its doors were low even mrs field was forced to stoop in entering this helped to make it seem like a den there were rollertowels in the corner and washbasins and a grindstone which made it seem like a barn it was in fact more cheerless than a barn and less wholesome  doesnt that hay in the bunks get aasometimes asked field  well yes i shouldnt wonder though the men are pretty strict about that they keep pretty free from bugs i think however i shouldnt want to run no river chances on the thing myself ridgeley smiled at mrs fields shudder of horror  is this the place the men laughed she had asked that question so many times before  yes this is where mr williams hangs out say field youll need to make some new move to hold your end up against williams  mrs field felt hurt and angry at his rough joke in the dim corner a cough was heard and as a yellow head raised itself over the bunkboard a man presented a ghastly face his big blue eyes fixed themselves on the lovely woman with a look of childish wonder  hello gusdidnt see you whats the mattersick  yah ai baen hwick two days ai tank ai lack to hav doketer  all right ill send him up what seems the matter  as they talked mrs field again chilled with the cold gray comfortlessness of it all to be sick in such a place the silent appearance of the man out of his grim corner was startling she was glad when they drove out into the woods again where the clear sunshine fell and the pines stood against the blazing winter sky motionless as iron trees her pleasure in the ride was growing less to her delicate sense this life was sordid not picturesque she wondered how williams endured it they arrived at no 8 just as the men were trailing down the road to work after eating their dinner their gaycolored jackets of mackinac wool stood out like trumpet notes in the prevailing white and blue and bronzegreen  the boss and the sealer came out and met them and after introductions they went into the shanty to dinner the cook was a deft young norwegiana clean quick gentlemanly fellow with a fine brown mustache he cleared a place for them at one end of the long table and they sat down  it was a large camp but much like the others on the table were the same cheap iron forks the tin plates and the small tin basins for tea which made up the dinnerset basins of brown sugar stood about  good gracious do people still eat brown sugar why i havent seen any of that for ages cried mrs field  the stew was good and savory and the bread fair the tea was not all clover but it tasted of the tin mrs field said  beef beefeverywhere beef one might suppose a menagerie of desert animals ate here edward we must make things more comfortable for our men they must have cups to drink out of these basins are horrible  it was humorous to the men this housewifely suggestion  oh make it napkins allie  you can laugh but i shant rest after seeing this if you thought i was going to say oh how picturesque youre mistaken i think its barbarous  she was getting impatient of their patronizing laughter as if she were a child they changed their manner to one of acquiescence but thought of her as a child just the same  after dinner they all went out to see the crew working it was the biggest crew anywhere in the neighborhood ridgeley got out and hitched the team to a tree and took field up to the skidway mrs field remained in the sleigh  near her the swamping team a span of big deepred oxen came and went among the green tops of the fallen pines they crawled along their trails in the snow like some strange machinery and the boy in a blue jacket moved almost as listlessly somewhere in the tangle of refuse boughs the swampers axes clickclocked saws uttered their grating rhythmic snarl and great trees at intervals shivered groaned and fell with soft rushing cracking sweeps into the deep snow and the swampers swarmed upon them like lilliputians attacking a giant enemy  there was something splendid though tragic in the work but the thought of the homelessness of the men their terrible beds and their long hours of toil oppressed the delicate and refined woman she began to take on culpability she was partly in authority now and this system must be changed she was deep in plans for improvement in shanties and in sleepingplaces when the men returned  ridgeley was saying no we control about thirty thousand acres of pine as good as that it aint what it was twenty years ago but its worth money after all  it was getting near to dark as they reached no 6 again and ridgeley drew up and helped them out and into the cooks shanty  mrs field was introduced to the cook a short rather sullen but intelligent man he stood over the redhot stove laying great slices of beef in a huge drippingpan he had a taffler or assistant in the person of a halfgrown boy at whom he jerked rough orders like hunks of stove wood some hit the boy and produced noticeable effects others did not  meanwhile a triumphant sunset was making the west one splendor of purple and orange and crimson which came over the cool green rim of the pines like the valhalla march in wagner  mrs field sat there in the dim room by the window seeing that splendor flush and fade and thinking how dangerous it was to ask where ones wealth comes from in the world outside the voices of the men thickened they were dropping in by twos and fours with teams and on foot  the assistant arranged the basins in rows and put one of the iron forks and knives on either side of each plate and filled the sugarbasins and dumped in the cold beans and split the bread into slabs and put small pots of tea here and there ready for the hands of the men  at last when the big pans of toast the big plates of beef were placed steaming on the table the cook called field and ridgeley and said  set right here at the end he raised his arm to a ring which dangled on a wire now look out youll see em comesidewise he jerked the ring and disappeared into the kitchen  a sudden tumult shouts trampling laughter and the door burst open and they streamed in norwegians french halfbreedsdarkskinned fellows all of them save the norwegians they came like a flood but they fell silent at sight of a woman so beautiful and strange to them  all words ceased they sank into place beside the table with the thump of falling sandbags they were all in their shirtsleeves but with faces cleanly washed and the most of them had combed their hair but they seemed very wild and hairy to mrs field she looked at her husband and ridgeley with a grateful pleasure it was so restful to have them close beside her  the men ate like hungry dogs they gorged in silence nothing was heard but the clank of knives on tin plates the drop of heavy platters of food and the occasional muttered words of some one asking for the bread or the gravy  as they ate they furtively looked with great curiosity and admiration up at the dainty woman their eyes were bright and large and gleamed out of the obscure brown of their dimly lighted faces with savage intensityso it seemed to mrs field and she dropped her eyes before their glare  her husband and ridgeley tried to enter into conversation with those sitting near ridgeley seemed on good terms with them all and ventured a joke or word at which they laughed with terrific energy and fell as suddenly silent again  as mrs field looked up the second time she saw the dark strange face of williams a few places down and opposite her his eyes were fixed on her husbands hands with a singular intensity her eyes followed his and the beauty of her husbands hands came to her again with new force they were perfectly shaped supple warmcolored and strong their color and deftness stood out in vivid contrast to the heavy brown cracked and calloused pawlike hands of the workmen  why should williams study her husbands hands if he had looked at her she would not have been surprised the other men she could read they expressed either frank simple admiration or furtive desire but this man looked at her husband and his eyes fell often upon his own hands which trembled with fatigue he handled his knife clumsily and yet she could see he too had a fine handa slender powerful hand like that people call an artist handa craftsmanlike hand  he saw her looking at him and he flashed one enigmatical glance into her eyes and rose to go out  how you getting on williams ridgeley asked  williams resented his question oh im all right he said sullenly  the meal was all over in an incredibly short time one by one two by two they rose heavily and lumbered out with one last wistful look at mrs field she will never know how seraphic she seemed sitting there amid those rough surroundingsthe dim red light of the kerosene lamp falling across her clear pallor out of which her dark eyes shone with liquid softness made deeper and darker by her halfsorrowful tenderness for these homeless fellows  an hour later as they were standing at the door just ready to take to their sleigh they heard the scraping of a fiddle  oh some one is going to play mrs field cried with visions of the rollicking good times she had heard so much about and of which she had seen nothing so far cant i look in  ridgeley was dubious ill go and see he said and entered the door boys mrs field wants to look in a minute go on with your fiddling samonly i wanted to see that you werent sitting around in dishabill  this seemed a good joke and they all howled and hawhawed gleefully  so go right ahead with your evening prayers all butyou understand  all right captain said sam the man with the fiddle  when mrs field looked in two men were furiously grinding axes several were sewing on ragged garments all were smoking some were dressing chapped or bruised fingers the atmosphere was horrible the socks and shirts were steaming above the huge stove the smoke and stench for a moment were sickening but ridgeley pushed them just inside the door  its better out of the draught  sam jigged away on the violin the men kept time with the cranks of the grindstone and all faces turned with bashful smiles and bold grins at mrs field most of them shrank a little from her look like shy animals  ridgeley threw open the window in the old days he explained to mrs field we used a fireplace and that kept the air better  as her sense of smell became deadened the air seemed a little more tolerable to mrs field  oh we must change all this she said it is horrible  play us a tune said sam extending the violin to field he did not think field could play it was merely a shot in the dark on his part  field took it and looked at it and sounded it on every side the men turned face in eager expectancy  he can play that feller  ill bet he can he handles her as if he knew her  you bet your life tune up cap  williams came from the obscurity somewhere and looked over the shoulders of the men  down in front somebody called and the men took seats on the benches leaving field standing with the violin in hand he smiled around upon them in a frank pleased way quite ready to show his skill he played annie laurie and a storm of applause broke out  hooray bully for you  sam youre out of it  sam your name is mud  give us another cap  it aint the same fiddle  he played again some simple tune and he played it with the touch which showed the skilled amateur as he played mrs field noticed a growing restlessness on williams part he moved about uneasily he gnawed at his fingernails his eyes glowed with a singular fire his hands drummed and fingered at last he approached and said roughly  let me take that fiddle a minute  oh cheese it williams the men cried let the other man play  what do you want to do with the fiddlethink its a musicbox asked sam its owner  go to hell said williams as field gave the violin over to him his hands seemed to tremble with eagerness  he raised his bow and struck into an imposing brilliant strain and the men fell back in astonishment  well ill be damned gasped the owner of the violin  keep quiet sam  mrs field looked at her husband why ed he is playing sarasate  thats what he is he returned slangily too much astonished to do more than gaze williams played on  there was a faint defect in the high notes as if his fingers did not touch the strings properly but his bow action showed cultivation and breadth of feeling as he struck into one of those difficult octaveleaping movements his face became savage on the e string a squeal broke forth he flung the violin into sams lap with a ferocious curse and then extending his hands hard crooked to fit the axehelve calloused and chapped he said to field  look at my hands lovely things to play with arent they  his voice trembled with passion he turned and went outside as he passed mrs field his head was bowed and he was uttering a groaning cry like one suffering physical pain  thats what drink does for a man ridgeley said as they watched williams disappear down the swampers trail  that man has been a violinist said field whats he doing up here  came to get away from himself i guess ridgeley replied  im afraid hes failed said field as he put his arm about his wife and led her to the sleigh  the ride home was made mainly in silence oh the splendid stillness the woman kept saying in her heart oh the splendid moonlight the marvellous radiance everywhere a heavenly serenitynot a footstep not a bell not a cry not a cracking treenothing but vivid light white snow dappled and lined with shadows and trees etched against a starlit sky unutterable splendor of light and sheen and shadow wide wastes of snow so white the stumps stood like columns of charcoal a night of natures making when she is tired of noise and blare of color  and in the midst of it stood the camp with its reek of obscenity foul odors and tobacco smoke to which a tortured soul must return   iv   the following saturday afternoon as ridgeley and field entered the office williams rose to meet them he looked differentfiner some way field imagined at any rate he was perfectly sober he was freshly shaven and though his clothes were rough he appeared the man of education he really was his manner was cold and distant  id like to be paid off mr ridgeley he said i guess whats left of my pay will take me out of this  where do you propose to go ridgeley asked with kindly interest  williams must have perceived his kindliness for he answered im going home to my wife to my violin i am going to try living once more  after he had gone out field said i wonder if hell do it  oh i shouldnt wonder ive seen men brace up just as mysteriously as that and stay right by their resolutions i thought he didnt look like a common lumber jack when he came in  ed your playing did it mrs field cried when she heard of williams resolution oh how happy his wife will be shell save him yet  well i dont know depends on what kind of a woman she is     before the low green door   matilda bent was dying there was no doubt of that now if there had been before the gruff old physicianone of the many overworked and underpaid country doctorsshook his head and pushed by joe bent her husband as he passed through the room which served as diningroom sittingroom and parlor the poor fellow slouched back to his chair by the stove as if dazed and before he could speak again the doctor was gone  mrs ridings was just coming up the walk as the doctor stepped out of the door  oh doctor how is she  she is a dying woman madam  oh dont say that doctor whats the matter  cancer  then the news was true  i dont know anything of the news mrs ridings but mrs bent is dying from the effects of a cancer primarily which she has had for yearssince her last child which died in infancy you remember  but doctor she never told me  neither did she tell me but no matter now i have done all i can for her if you can make death any easier for her go and do it you will find some opiate powders there with directions keep the pain down at all hazards dont let her suffer that is useless she is likely to last a day or two but if any change comes tonight send for me  when the good matron entered the dowdy suffocating little room where matilda bent lay gasping for breath she was sick for a moment with sympathetic pain there the dying woman lay her world narrowed to four close walls propped up on the pillows near the one little window her eyes seemed very large and bright and the brow made prominent by the sinking away of the cheeks gave evidence that it was an uncommon woman who lay there quietly waiting the death angel  she smiled and lifted her eyebrows in a ghastly way  oh marthy she breathed  matildy i didnt know you was so bad or id a come before why didnt you let me know said mrs ridings kneeling by the bed and taking the ghostly hands of the sufferer in her own warm and soft palms she shuddered as she kissed the thin lips  i think youll soon be around agin she added in the customary mockery of an attempt at cheer the other woman started slightly turned her head and gazed on her old friend long and intently the hollowness of her neighbors words stung her  i hope not marthyim ready to go i want to go i dont care to live  the two women communed by looking for a long time in each others eyes as if to get at the very secretest desires and hopes of the heart tears fell from marthas eyes upon the cold and nerveless hands of her friendpoor faithful hands hacked and knotted and worn by thirty years of ceaseless daily toil they lay there motionless upon the coverlet pathetic protest for all the world to see  oh matildy i wish i could do something for you i want to help you so i feel so bad that i didnt come before aint they somethin  yes marthyjest set theretill i dieit wont be long whispered the pale lips the sufferer as usual was calmer than her visitor and her eyes were thoughtful  i will i will but oh must you go cant somethin be done dont yo want the minister to be sent for  no im all ready i aint afraid to die i aint worth savin now oh marthy i never thought id come to thisdid you i never thought id dieso early in lifeand dieunsatisfied  she lifted her head a little as she gasped out these words with an intensity of utterance that thrilled her hearera powerful penetrating earnestness that burned like fire  are you satisfied pursued the steady lips my lifes a failure marthyive known it all alongall but my children oh marthy whatll become o them this is a hard world  the amazed martha could only chafe the hands and note sorrowfully the frightful changes in the face of her friend the weirdly calm slow voice began to shake a little  im dyin marthy without ever gittin to the sunny place we girlsused to thinkwed git to byanby ive been agittin deeper n deeperin the shadetill its most dark they aint been no restnr hope fr me marthynone i aint  there there tillie dont talk sodont dear try to think how bright

how we used to runoh mattie if i was only there the world was all bright thenwasnt it we didnt expectto work all our days life looked like a meadow full of daisies and pinks and the nicest ones and the sweetest birds were just a little ways onwhere the sun wasit didnt lookwasnt we happy  yes yes dear but you mustnt talk so much the good woman thought matildas mind was wandering dont you want some medcine is your fever risin  but the daisies and pinks all turned to weeds she went on waiting a little when we picked em an the sunny placehas been always behind me and the dark before me oh if i was only therein the sunwhere the pinks and daisies are  you mustnt talk so mattie think about your children you aint sorry yhad them theyve been a comfort to y you aint sorry you had em  i aint glad was the unhesitating reply of the failing woman and then she went on in growing excitement theyll haf to grow old jest as i havegit bent and gray an die they aint ben much comfort to me the boys are like their father and julyies weak they aint no happinessfor such as me and them  she paused for breath and mrs ridings not knowing what to say did better than speak she fell to stroking the poor face and the hands getting more restless each moment it was as if matilda fletcher had been silent so long had borne so much without complaint that now it burst from her in a torrent not to be stayed all her most secret doubts and her sweetest hopes seemed trembling on her lips or surging in her brain racking her poor emaciated frame for utterence now that death was sure she was determined to rid her bosom of its perilous stuff martha was appalled  i used to thinkthat when i got married id be perfectly happy but i never have been happy sence it was the beginning of trouble to me i never found things better than they looked they was always worse ive gone further an further from the sunshiny meadow an the birds an flowersand ill never git back to em again never she ended with a sob and a low wail  her face was horrifying with its intensity of pathetic regret her straining wideopen eyes seemed to be seeing those sunny spots in the meadow  mattie sometimes when im asleep i think i am back there aginand you girls are therean were pullin off the leaves of the wild sunflowerrich man poor man beggar manand i hear you all laugh when i pull off the last leaf and then i come to myselfand im an old driedup woman dyinunsatisfied  ive felt that way a little myself matildy confessed the watcher in a scared whisper  i knew it mattie i knew youd know how i felt things have been better for you you aint had to live in an old log house all your life an work yourself to skin an bone for a man you dont respect nor like  matildy bent take that back take it back for mercy sake dont you dare die thinkin thatdont you dare  bent hearing her voice rising came to the door and the wife recognizing his step cried out  dont let him in dont i cant bear himkeep him out i dont want to see him agin  who do you mean not joe  yes him  had the dying woman confessed to murder good martha could not have been more shocked she could not understand this terrible revulsion in feeling for she herself had been absolutely loyal to her husband through all the trials which had come upon them  but she met bent at the threshold and closing the door went out with him into the summer kitchen where the rest of the family were sitting a gloomy silence fell on them all after the greetings were over the men were smoking all were seated in chairs tipped back against the wall joe bent a smallish man with a weak goodnatured face asked in a hoarse whisper  how is she mis ridings  she seems quite strong mr bent i think you had all better go to bed if i want you i can call you doctor give me directions  all right responded the relieved man ill sleep on the lounge in the other room if you want me just rap on the door  when after making other arrangements martha went back to the bedroom she was startled to hear the sick woman muttering to herself or perhaps because she had forgotten marthas absence  but the shadows on the meadow didnt stay they passed on and then the sun was all the brighter on the flowers we used to string sweetwilliams on spears of grassdont you remember  martha gave her a drink of the opiate in the glass adjusted her on the pillow and threw open the window even to the point of removing the screen and the gibbous moon flooded the room with light she did not light a lamp for its flame would heat the room besides the moonlight was sufficient it fell on the face of the sick woman till she looked like a thing of marbleall but her dark eyes  does the moon hurt you tilly shall i put down the curtain  the woman heard with difficulty and when the question was repeated said slowly  no i like it after a little dont you remember mattie how beautiful the moonlight seemed it seemed to promise happinessand lovebut it never come for us it makes me dream of the past nowjust as it did of the future then an the whippoorwills too  the night was perfectly beautiful such a night as makes dying an infinite sorrow the summer was at its liberalest innumerable insects of the nocturnal sort were singing in unison with the frogs in the pools a whippoorwill called and its neighbor answered like an echo the leaves of the trees glossy from the late rain moved musically to the light west wind and the exquisite perfume of many flowers came in on the breeze  when the failing woman sank into silence martha leaned her elbow on the windowsill and gazing far into the great deeps of space gave herself up to unwonted musings upon the problems of human life she sighed deeply at times she found herself at moments in the almost terrifying position of a human soul in space not a wife not a mother but just a soul facing the questions which harass philosophers as she realized her condition of mind she apprehended something of the thinking of the woman on the bed matilda had gone beyondor far backof the wife and mother  the hours wore on the dying woman stirred uneasily now and then whispering a word or phrase which related to her girlhoodnever to her later life once she said  mother hold me im so tired  martha took the thin form in her arms and laying her head close beside the sunken cheek sang in half breath a lullaby till the sufferer grew quiet again  the lustrous moon passed over the house leaving the room dark and still the patient watcher sat beside the bed listening to the slow breathing of the dying one the cool air grew almost chill the east began to lighten and with the coming light the tide of life sank in the dying body the head hitherto restlessly turning ceased to move the eyes grew quiet and began to soften like a sleepers  how are you now dear asked the watcher several times bending over the bed and bathing back the straying hair  im tiredtired motherturn me she murmured drowsily with heavy lids drooping  martha patted the pillows once again and turned her friends face to the wall the poor tortured restless brain slowly stopped its grinding whirl and the thin limbs heavy with years of hopeless toil straightened out in an endless sleep  matilda fletcher had found rest     a preachers love story  i   the train drew out of the great van buren street depot at 430 of a dark day in late october a tall young man with a timid look in his eyes was almost the last passenger to get on and his pale face wore a worried look as he dropped into an empty seat and peered out at the squalid city reeling past in the mist  the buildings grew smaller and vacant lots appeared stretching away in flat spaces broken here and there by ridges of ugly squat little tenement blocks over this landscape vast banners of smoke streamed magnified by the misty rain which was driven in from the lake  at last there came a swell of land clothed on with trees it was still light enough for him to see that they were burr oaks and the young students heart thrilled at sight of them his forehead smoothed out and his eyes grew tender with boyish memories  he was seated thus with head leaning against the pane when another young man came down the aisle from the smokingcar and took a seat beside him with a pleasant word  he was a handsome young fellow of twenty three or four his face was large and beardless and he had a bold and keen look in spite of the bang of yellow hair which hung over his forehead some commonplaces passed between them and then silence fell on each the conductor coming through the car the smoothfaced young fellow put up a card to be punched and the student handed up a ticket simply saying kesota  after a decent pause the younger man said going to kesota are you  yes  so am i i live there in fact  do you then perhaps you can tell me the name of your county superintendent im looking for a school he smiled frankly im just out of jackson university and  that so im an ann arbor man myself they took a moment for mutual warming up yes i know the superintendent why not come right up to my boardingplace and tomorrow ill introduce you looking for a school eh what kind of a school  oh a village school or even a country school its too late to get a good place but ive been sick and  yes the good positions are all snapped up still you might by accident hit on something i know mott hell do all he can for you bytheway my names allen  the young student understood this hint and spoke mine is stacey  the younger man mused a few minutes as if he had forgotten his new acquaintance suddenly he roused up  say would you take a country school several miles out  i think i would if nothing better offered  well in my old district theyre without a teacher its six miles out and it isnt a lovely neighborhood however they will pay fifty dollars a month thats ten dollars extra for the scrimmages they wanted me to teach this wintermy sister tackles it in summerbut great peter i cant waste my time teaching school when i can run up

smiled brightly ask him if he dont need a little cash to pay for hogkillin or something like that he laughed again no i didnt graduate at ann arbor funny how things go aint it i was on my way back the third year when i stopped in to see the pitits one o the sights of chicago you knowand billy krans saw me looking over the rail i went in won and then took a flyer on december come a big slump and i failed to materialize at school  what did you do then asked stacey to whom this did not seem humorous  i wrote a contrite letter to the governor stating case requesting forgivenessand money no go couldnt raise neither i then wrote casting him off you are no longer father of mine he smiled again radiantly you should have seen me the next time i went home plug hat imported suit gold watch diamond shirtstud cost me 200 to paralyze the general but i did it my glory absolutely turned him white as a sheet i knew what he thought so i said perfectly legitimate dad the walls of joliet are not gaping for me that about halffetched himcalling him dad i mean but he cant get reconciled to my business too many ups and downs he says fact is he thinks its gambling and i dont argue the case with him im on my way home now to stay over sunday  the train whistled and allen looked out into the darkness were coming to the crossing now i cant go up to the boardingplace when you do but ill give you directions and you tell the landlady i sent you and itll be all right allen you rememberherman allen  following directions stacey came at length to a twostory frame house situated on the edge of the bank with its back to the river it stood alone with vacant lots all about a pleasantfaced woman answered the ring  he explained briefly how do you do im a teacher and id like to get board here a few days while passing my examinations mr herman allen sent me  the womans quick eye and ear were satisfied all right walk in sir im pretty full but i expect i can accommodate youif you dont mind mr allen for a roommate  oh not at all he said while taking off his coat  come right in this way supper will be ready soon  he went into a comfortable sittingroom where a huge open fire of soft coal was blazing magnificently the walls were papered in florid patterns and several enlarged portraits were on the walls the fire was the only adornment all else was cheap and some of it was tawdry  stacey spread his thin hands to the blaze while the landlady sat down a moment out of politeness to chat scanning him keenly she was a handsome woman strong wellrounded about forty years of age with quick gray eyes and a clean firmlipped mouth  did you just get in  yes ive been on the road all day he said on an impulse of communication indeed im just out of college  is that so exclaimed mrs mills stopping her rocking in an access of interest what college  jackson university ive been sick and only came west  there came a look into her face that transformed and transfigured her my boy was in ann arbor he was killed on the train on his way home one day she stopped for fear of breaking into a quaver and smiled brightly thats why i always like college boys they all stop here with me she rose hastily well youll excuse me wont you and ill go an tend to supper  there was a great deal that was feminine in stacey and he felt at once the pathos of the womans life he looked a refined studious rather delicate young man as he sat low in his chair and observed the light and heat of the fire his large head was heavy with learning and his dark eyes deep with religious fervor  several young women entered and the room was filled with the clatter of tongues herman came in a few moments later his face in a girlish glow of color everybody rushed at him with loud outcry he was evidently a great favorite he threw his arms about mrs mills giving her a hearty hug the girls pretended to be shocked when he reached out for them but they were not afraid of him they hung on his arms and besieged him with questions till he cried out in jolly perplexity  girls girls this will never do  mrs mills brushed out his damp yellow curls with her hands youre all wet  girls if youll let me sit down ill take one on each knee he said pleadingly and they released him  stacey grew red with sympathetic embarrassment and shrank away into a corner  go get supper ready commanded herman and it was only after they had left him that he said to stacey oh you found your way all right he took a seat by the fire and surveyed his wet shoes i took a run up to motts houseonly a half block out o the way he said theyd be tickled to have you at cyene bytheway youre a theolog arent you wallace nodded and herman went on so i told mott he said you might work up a society out there at cyene  is there a church there  used to be butsay i tell you what you do you go out with me tomorrow and ill give you a history of the township  the ringing of the bell took them all out into the cheerful diningroom in a goodnatured scramble mrs mills put stacey at one end of the table near a young woman who looked like a teacher and he had full sweep of the table which was surrounded by bright and happy faces the stationhand was there and a couple of grocery clerks and a brakeman sat at staceys right hand they all seemed very much at home and called one another by their christian names and there was very obvious courtship on the part of several young couples  stacey escaped from the table as soon as possible and returned to his seat beside the fire he was young enough to enjoy the chatter of the girls but his timidity made him glad they paid so little attention to him the rain had changed to sleet outside and hammered at the window viciously but the blazing fire and the romping young people set it at defiance the landlady came to the door of the diningroom dish and cloth in hand to share in each outburst of laughter and not infrequently the hired girl peered over her shoulder with a broad smile on her face a little later having finished their work they both came in and took active part in the lighthearted fun  herman and one of the girls were having a great struggle over some trifle he had snatched from her hand and the rest stood about laughing to see her desperate attempts to recover it this was a familiar form of courtship in kesota and an evening filled with such romping was considered a cracking good time after the girl red and dishevelled had given up herman sat down at the organ and they all sang moody and sankey hymns negro melodies and college songs till ten oclock then mrs mills called come now boys and girls and they all said goodnight like obedient children  herman and wallace went up to their bedroom together  say stacey have you got a policy wallace shook his head and dont want any i suppose well i just asked you as a matter of form you see he went on winking at wallace comically nominally im an insurance agent but practically im a lambbut i get a mouthful o fur myself occasionally what im working for is to get on that wheat exchange thats where you get life id rather be an established broker in that howling mob than go to congress  he rose on his elbow in bed and looked at wallace who was rising from a silent prayer  say why didnt you shout i forgot all about iti mean your profession  wallace crept into bed beside his communicative bedfellow in silence he didnt know how to deal with such spirits  say called herman suddenly as wallace was about dropping off to sleep you aint got no picnic old man  why what do you mean  wait till you see cyene church oh its a daisy snarl  i wish youd tell me about it  oh its quiet now the calmness of death said herman well you see it came this way the church is made up of baptists and methodists and the methodists wanted an organ because you understand father was the head centre and mattie is the only girl among the methodists who can play the old man has got a head like a mule he cant be switched off once he makes up his mind deacon marsden he dont believe in anything above tuningforks and hes tightern the bark on a bulldog he stood out like a sore thumb and dad wouldnt give an inch  you see they held meetings every other sunday so dad worked up the organ business and got one and then locked it up when the baptists held their services things went from bad to worse they didnt speak as they passed bythat is the old folks we young folks didnt care a continental whether school kept or not well upshot is the church died out the wind blew the horsesheds down and there they lieand the church is standing there empty as anold bootandsay staceyby jinksare you a baptist  yes  oh peter aint that lovely he chuckled shamelessly and went off to sleep without another word   ii   herman was still sleeping when stacey rose and dressed and went down to breakfast mrs mills defended herman against the charge of laziness hes probably been out late all the week  stacey found mott in the county courthouse and a perfunctory examination soon put him in possession of a certificate there was no question of his attainments  herman met him at dinnertime  well elder im going down to get a rig to go out home in its coldern a blue whetstone so put on all the clothes youve got gimme your check and ill get your traps have you seen mott  yes  well then everythings all fixed  he turned up about three oclock seated on the spring seat of a lumber wagon beside a woman who drove the powerful team whether she was young or old could not be told through her wraps she wore a cap and a thick faded cloak  mrs mills hurried to the door why mattie allen what you doin out such a day as this come in here instanter  cant stop called a clear boyish voice too late  well land o stars youll freeze  when wallace reached the wagon side herman said my sister stacey  the girl slipped her strong brown hand out of her huge glove and gave him a friendly grip get right in she said herman youre going to stand up behind  herman appealed to mrs mills for sympathy this is what comes of having plebeian connections  oh dry up laughed the girl or ill make you drive  stacey scrambled in awkwardly beside her she was not at all embarrassed apparently  tuck yourself in tight its mighty cold on the prairie  why didnt you come down with the baroosh grumbled herman  well the corn was contracted for and father wasnt able to comehe had another attack of neuralgia last night after he got the corn loaded so i had to come  shant i drive for you asked wallace  no thank you youll have all you can do to keep from freezing she studied his thin coat and worn gloves with keen glance he could see only her pink cheeks strong nose and dark smiling eyes  it was one of those terrible illinois days when the temperature drops suddenly to zero and the churned mud of the highways hardens into scoriac rock which cripples the horses and sends the heavy wagons booming and thundering along like mad things the wind was keen as a sawbladed sword and smote incessantly the desolate sky was one thick impenetrable mass of swiftly flying clouds  when they swung out upon the long pike leading due north wallace drew his breath with a gasp and bent his head to the wind  pretty strong isnt it shouted mattie  oh the farmers life is the life for me trala sang herman from his shelter behind the seat  mattie turned what do you think of penelope this month  shes agitten there said herman pounding his shoe heels  shes too smart for young corey she ought to marry a man like bromfield my wouldnt they talk  did y get the second bundle of magazines last saturday  yes and dad found something in the popular science that made him mad and he burned it  did e tumlala oh the farmers life for me  are you cold she asked wallace  he turned a purple face upon her nonot much  i guess you better slip right down under the blankets she advised  the wind blew gray out of the northa wild blast which stopped the young students blood in his veins he hated to give up but he could no longer hold the blankets over his knees so he slipped down into the corner of the box with his back to the wind while mattie drew the blankets over his head slapped the reins down on the backs of the snorting horses and encouraged them with shouts like a man get out o this dan hup there nellie  the wagon boomed and rattled the floor of the box seemed beaten with a maul the glimpses wallace had of the land appalled him it was so flat and gray and bare  herman sang at the top of his voice and danced and pounded his feet against the wagon box this ends it if i cant come home without freezing to death i dont come i should have hired a rig irrespective of you  the girl laughed oh youre getting thinblooded herman life in the city has taken the starch all out of you  better grow limp in a great city than freeze stiff in the country he replied  an hours ride brought them into a yard before a large graywhite frame house  herman sprang out to meet a tall old man with head muffled up hello dad take the team were just naturally froze solidat least i am this is mr stacey the new teacher  how de do run in ill take the horses  herman and wallace stumbled toward the house stiff and bent  herman flung his arms about a tall woman in the kitchen door hello muz he said this is mr stacey the new teacher  mattie came in soon with a boyish rush gleeful as a happy babe she unwound the scarf from her head and neck and hung up her cap and cloak like a man but she gave her hair a little touch of feminine care and came forward with both palms pressed to her burning cheeks  did you suffer child asked mrs allen  no i enjoyed it  herman looked at stacey i believe on my life she did  oh its fun i dont get a chance to do anything so exciting very often  herman clicked his tongue exciting well well  you must remember things are slower here mattie explained  she came to light much younger than stacey thought her she was not eighteen but her supple and splendid figure was fully matured her hair hung down her back in a braid which gave a distinct touch of childishness to her  sis youre still agrowin herman said as he put his arm around her waist and looked up at her  she seemed to realize for the first time that stacey was a young man and her eyes fell  well now set up the chairs child said mrs allen  when the young teacher returned from his cold spare room off the parlor the family sat waiting for him they all drew up noisily and allen said  ask the blessing sir  wallace said grace  as allen passed the potatoes he continued  my son tells me you are a minister of the gospel  i have studied for it  what denomination  tut tut warned herman dont start any theological rabbits tonight dad with jaw swelled up you wont be able to hold your own  im a baptist stacey answered  the old mans face grew grim it had been ludicrous before with its swollen jaw baptist he turned a stern look upon his son whose smile angered him didnt you know no moren to bring a baptist preacher into this house  there there father began the wife  be quiet im boss of this shanty and i wont have you bringing  herman struck in dont make a show of yourself old man never mind the old gent stacey hes mumpy today anyhow  stacey rose i guess iid better not stayi  oh no no sit down its all right the old mans a little acid at me he doesnt mean it  stacey got his coat and hat his heart was swollen with indignation he felt as if something fine were lost to him and the land outside was so desolate  mrs allen was in tears but the old man having taken his stand was going to keep it  herman lost his temper a little well dad youre a little the cussedest christian i ever knew stacey sit down dont you be a fool just because he is  stacey was buttoning his coat with trembling hands when martha went up to him  dont go she said fathers sick and cross hell be sorry for this tomorrow  wallace looked into her frank kindly eyes and hesitated  herman said dad you are a lovely follower of christ youll apologize for this or ill never set foot on your threshold again  stacey still hesitated he was hurt and angry but being naturally of a sweet and gentle nature he grew sad and yielding to the pressure of the girls hand on his arm he began to unbutton his overcoat  she helped him with it and hung it back on the nail and her mother and herman tried to restore something of the brightness which had been lost but allen sat grimly eating his chin pushed down like a hogs snout  after supper as his father was about retiring to his bedroom herman fixed his bright eyes on him and something very hard and masterful came into his face  old man you and i havent had a settlement on this thing yet ill see you later  allen shrank before his sons look but shuffled sullenly off without uttering a word  herman turned to wallace stacey i want to beg your pardon for getting you into this scrape i didnt suppose the old gentleman would act like that the older he gets the more his new hampshire granite shows i hope you wont lay it up against me  wallace was too conscientious to say he didnt mind it but he took hermans hand in a quick clasp  lets have a song proposed herman music hath charms to soothe the savage breast to charm a rock and split a cabbage  they went into the best room where a fire was blazing and mattie and herman sang hymns and oldfashioned lovesongs and college glees wonderfully intermingled they ended with lorena a wailing extra sentimental lovesong current in war times and when they looked around there was a lofty look on the face of the young preachera look of exaltation of consecration and resolve   iii   the next morning at breakfast herman said as he seized a hot biscuit well dispense with grace this morning and till after the war is over but wallace blessed his bread in a silent prayer and mattie thought it very brave of him to do so  herman was full of mockery the sun rises just the same whether its sprinkling or immersion its lucky nature dont take a hand in these theological contests she doesnt even referee the scrap she never seems to care whether you are sparring for points or fighting to a finish what you theologic middleweights are really fighting for i cant seeand i dont care till you fall over the ropes on to my corns  stacey listened in a daze to hermans tirade he knew it was addressed to allen and that it deprecated war and that it was mocking the fresh face and smiling lips of the young girl seemed to put other affairs very far away it was such a beautiful thing to sit at table with a lovely girl  after breakfast he put on his cap and coat and went out into the clear cold november air all about him the prairie outspread marked with farmhouses and lined with leafless hedges artificial groves surrounded each homestead and these relieved to some degree the desolateness of the fields  down the road he saw the spire of a small white church and as he walked briskly toward it hermans description of it came to his mind  as he drew near the ruined sheds the rotting porch and the windows boarded up told a sorry story and his face grew sad he tried one of the doors and found it open some tramp had broken the lock the inside was even more desolate than the outside it was littered with rotting straw and plum stones and melon seeds obscene words were scrawled on the walls and even on the pulpit itself  taken altogether it was an appalling picture to the young servant of the man of galileea blunt reminder of the inherent ferocity and depravity of man  as he pondered the fire burned and there rose again the flame of his resolution he lifted his face and prayed that he might be the one to bring these people into the living union of the church of christ  his blood set toward his heart with tremulous action  his eyes glowed with zeal like that of the prophets of the middle ages he saw the people united once more in this desecrated hall he heard the bells ringing the sound of song the voices of love and fellowship filling the anterooms where hate had scrawled hideous blasphemy against woman and against god  as he sat there herman came in his keen eyes seeking out every stain and evidence of vandalism  cheerful prospect isnt it  wallace looked up with the blaze of his resolution still in his eyes his pale face was sweet and solemn  oh how these people need christ  herman turned away they need killingabout two dozen of em id like to have the job of indicating which ones i wouldnt miss the old man you bet he added with cordial resentment  wallace was helpless in the face of such reckless thought and so sat silently watching the handsome young fellow as he walked about  well now stacey i guess youll need to move i had another session with the old man but he wont give in so im off for chicago mothers brother george chapman who lives about as near the schoolhouse on the other side will take you in i guess wed better go right down now and see about it ive said goodby to the old manfor good this time we didnt shake hands either he said as they started down the road together he was very stern and hard something of the father was hidden under his laughing exterior  stacey regretted deeply the necessity which drove him out of allens house mrs allen and mattie had appealed to him very strongly for years he had lived far from young women and there was a magical power in the intimate home actions of this young girl her bare head with simple arrangement of hair someway seemed the most beautiful thing he had ever seen  he thought of her that night as he sat at the table with chapman and his aged mother they lived alone and their lives were curiously silent once in a while a lowvoiced question and that was all george read the popular science harpers monthly magazine and the open court and brooded over them with slow intellectual movement it was wonderful the amount of information he secreted from these periodicals he was better informed than many college graduates he had little curiosity about the young stranger he understood that he was to teach the school beyond that he did not care to go  he tried wallace once or twice on the latest discoveries of john fiske and edison and then gave him up and retired to his seat beside the sittingroom stove  on the following monday morning school began and as wallace took his way down the lane the wrecked church came again to his eyes he walked past it with slow feet his was a deeply religious nature one that sorrowed easily over sin suffering of the poor did not trouble him hunger seemed a little thing beside losing ones everlasting soul therefore to come from his studies upon such a monument of human depravity as this rotting church was to receive a shock and to hear a call to action  approaching the schoolhouse his thought took a turn toward the scholars and toward mattie he had forgotten to ask her if she intended to be one of his pupils  there were several children already gathered at the weatherbeaten door as he came up it was all very americanthe boxlike house of white the slender teacher approaching the roughly clad urchins waiting  he said good morning scholars  they chorused a queer croak in replyhesitating inarticulate shy he unlocked the door and entered the cold bare roomfamiliar unlovely with a certain power of primitive associations in such a room he had studied his primer and his rays arithmetic in such a room he had made gradual recession from the smallest front seat to the back wall seat and from one side of such a room to the other he had furtively worshipped a graceful girlish head  he allowed himself but a moment of such dreaming before assuming command and with his ready helpers a fire was soon started other children came in timorous as rabbits slipping by each with an eye fixed on him like a scared chicken they preempted their seats by putting down books and slates and there arose sly wars for possession which he watched with amusementit was so like his own life at that age  he assumed control as nearly in the manner of the oldtime teachers as he could recall and the work of his teaching was begun the day passed quickly and as he walked homeward again there stood that rotting church and in his mind there rose a surging emotion larger than he could himself comprehenda desire to rebuild it by uniting the warring factions of whose lack of christianity this deserted chapel was a fatal witness   iv   now this mystical thing happened as this son of a line of preachers brooded on this unlovely strife among men he lost the equipoise of the scholar and student of modern history he grew narrower and more intense the burden of his responsibility as a preacher of christ grew daily more insupportable  toward the end of the week he announced preaching in the schoolhouse on sunday afternoon and at the hour set he found the room crowded with people of all ages and sorts  his heart grew heavy as he looked out over the roomon women nursing querulous children on the grizzled faces of grimlooking men who studied him with keen unsympathetic eyes he had hard unfriendly material to work with there were but few of the opposite camp present while the baptist leaders were all there with more curiosity than sympathy in their faces  they exulted to think the next preacher to come among them as an evangelist should be a baptist  after the singing which would have dribbled away into failure but for mattie wallace rose looking very white and weak and began his prayer some of the boys laughed when his voice stuck in his throat but he went on to the end of an earnest supplication feeling he had not touched them at all  while they sang again he sat looking down at them with dry throat and staring eyes how hard how unchristianlike they all were what could he say to them he saw mattie gazing up at him and on the front seat sat three beautiful little girls huddled together with hands clasped inexpressibly dainty by contrast as he looked at them the thought came to him what is the goodness of a girlof a child it is not partisanit is not of creeds of articlesit is goodness of thought of deeds his face lighted up with the inward feeling of this idea and he rose resolutely  friends with the help of christ i am come among you to do you good i shall hold meetings each night here in the schoolhouse until we can unite and rebuild the church again let me say now friends that i was educated a baptist my father was a faithful worker in the baptist church and so was his father before him i was educated in a baptist college and i came here hoping to build up a baptist church he paused  but i see my mistake i am here to build up a church of christ of good deeds and charity and peace and so i here say i am no longer a baptist or methodist i am only a preacher and i will not rest until i rebuild the church which stands rotting away there his voice rang with determination as he uttered those words  the people listened there was no movement now even the babies seemed to feel the need of being silent when he began again it was to describe that hideous wreck he delineated the falling plaster the litter around the pulpit the profanation of the walls it is a symbol of your sinful hearts he cried  much more he said carried out of himself by his passion it was as if the repentant spirit of his denominational fathers were speaking through him and yet he was not so impassioned that he did not see or at least feel the eyes of the strong young girl fixed upon him his resolutions were spoken to her and a swift response seemed to leap from her eyes  when it was over some of the methodists and one of the baptists came up to shake hands with him awkwardly wordless and the pressure of their hands helped him many of the baptist brethren slipped outside to discuss the matter some were indignant others much moved  allen went by him with an audible grunt of derision with a dark scowl on his face but mattie smiled at him with tears still in her eyes she had been touched by his vibrant voice she had no sins to repent of  the skeptics of the neighborhood were quite generally sympathetic youve struck the right trail now parson said chapman as they walked homeward together the days of the oldtime denominationalism are about played out  but the young preacher was not so sure of it now that his inspiration was gone he remembered his debt to his college to his father to the denomination and it was not easy to set aside the grip of such memories  he sat late revolving the whole situation in his mind when he went to bed his problem was still with him and involved itself with his dreams but always the young girl smiled upon him with sympathetic eyes and told him to go onor so it seemed to him  he was silent at breakfast he went to school with a feeling that a return to teaching little towheads to count and spell was now impossible he sat at his scarred and dingy desk while they took their places and his eyes had a passionate intensity of prayer in them which awed his pupils he had assumed new grandeur and terror in their eyes when they were seated he bowed his head and uttered a short plea for grace and then he looked at them again  on the low front seat with dangling legs and red round faces sat the little ones some way he could not call them to his knees and teach them to spell he felt as if he ought to call them to him as christ did to teach them love and reverence it was impossible that they should not be touched by this hideous neighborhood strife  behind them sat the older children some of them with rough hard sly faces one or two grinned rudely and nudged each other the older girls sat with bated breath they perceived something strange in the air most of them had heard his sermon of the night before  at last he broke silence children there is something i must say to you this morning im going to have meeting here tonight and it may be i shall not be your teacher any morei mean in school i wish youd go home today and tell your people to come to church here tonight i wish youd all come yourselves i want you to be good i want you to love god and be good i want you to go home and tell your people the teacher cant teach children how to read till he has taught the older people to be kind and generous you may put your books away and school will be dismissed  the wondering children obeyedsome with glad promptness others with sadness for they had already come to like their teacher very much  as he sat by the door and watched them file out it was as if he were a king abdicating a throne and these his faithful subjects  mrs allen came over with mattie to see him that day she was a good woman gentle and prayerful and she said with much emotion  oh mr stacey i do hope you can patch things up here if you could only touch his heart he dont mean to do wrong but hes so set in his waysif he says a thing he sticks to it  stacey turned to mattie for a word of encouragement but she only looked away it was impossible for her to put into words her feeling in the matter which was more of admiration for his courage than for any part of his religious zeal he was so different from other men  it did him good to have these women come and he repeated his vow  by the grace of our lord i am going to rebuild the cyene church and his face paled and his eyes grew luminous  the girl shivered with emotion he seemed to recede from her as he spoke and to grow larger too such nobility of purpose was new and splendid to her                                       the revival was wondrously dramatic the little schoolhouse was crowded to the doors night by night the reek of stablestained coats and boots the smell of strong tobacco the effluvia of many breaths the heat the closeness were forgotten in the fervor of the young evangelists utterances his voice took on wild emotional cadences which sounded deep places in the heart to these people long unused to religious oratory it was like the return of john and isaiah it was poetry and the drama and processions and apocalyptic visions this youth had the histrionic spell too and his slender body lifted and dilated and his head took on majesty and power and the fling of his white hand was a challenge and an appeal  a series of stirring events took place on the third night  on wednesday jacob turner rose and asked the prayers of his neighbors and was followed by two baptist spearmen of the front rank on thursday the women were weeping on one anothers bosoms only one or two of the men held outold deacon allen and his antagonist stewart marsden grimvisaged old figures they were placed among repentant men and weeping women they sat like rocks in the rush of the two factions moving toward each other for peaceful union granitic narrow keen of thrust they seemed unmoved while all around them one by one skeptics acknowledged the pathos and dignity of the preachers views of life and death  meanwhile the young evangelist lived at high pressure he grew thinner and whiter each night he toiled in the daytime to formulate his thoughts for the evening he could not sleep till far toward morning the food he ate did him little good while his heart went out constantly to his people in strenuous supplication it was testimony of his human quality that he never for one moment lost that shining girl face out of his thought he looked for it there night after night it was his inspiration in speaking as at the first  on the nights when mattie was not there his speech was labored as the elders noticed but on the blessed nights when she came and sang her voice amid all the rest came to him and uttered poetry and peace like a rill of cool sweet water and afterward when he walked home under the stars his mind went with her she was so strong and lithe and good to see he did not realize the worshipping attitude the girl took before his divine duties  at last the great day camethe great night  in some way perhaps by the growing mass of rushing emotion set in action by some deepgoing phrase or perhaps by some interior slow weakening of stubborn will deacon allen gave way and when the preacher called for penitents the old man struggled to his feet his seamed weatherbeaten face full of grotesque movement he broke out  brethren pray for me im a miserable sinner i want to confess my sinsherebefore ye all he broke into sobbing terrible to hear my heart is madeflesh againby the blessed power of christ  he struggled to get his voice one or two cried praise god but most of them sat silent awed into immobility  the old man walked up the aisle ive been rebelliousand now i want to shake hands with you alland i ask your prayers he bent down and thrust his hand to marsden his enemy while the tears streamed down his face  marsden turned white with a sort of fear but he rose awkwardly and grasped the outstretched hand and at the touch of palms every soul rose as if by electric shock amens burst forth the preacher began a fervent prayer and came down toward the grizzled weeping old men and they all embraced while some old lady with sweet quavering voice raised a triumphal hymn in which all joined and found grateful relief from their emotional tension  allen turned to mattie and his wife my boysend for himherman  it seemed as if the people could not go away the dingy little schoolhouse was like unto the shining temple of gods grace and the regenerated seemed to fear that to go home might permit a return to hate and strife so they clung around the young preacher and would not let him go  at last he came out with allen holding to his arm you must come home with us tonight he pleaded and the young minister with glad heart consented for he hoped he might walk beside mattie but this was not possible there were several others in the group and they moved off two and two up the deep hollows which formed the road in the snow  the young minister walked with head uplifted to the stars hearing nothing of the low murmur of talk conscious only of his great plans his happy heart and the strong young girl who walked before him  in the warm kitchen into which they came he lost something of his spiritual tension and became more humanly aware of the significance of sitting again with these people he gave the girl his coat and hat and then watched her slip off her knitted hood and her cloak her eyes shone with returning laughter and her cheeks were flushed with blood  looking upon her the young evangelist lost his look of exaltation his eyes grew soft and his limbs relaxed his silence was no longer raptit was the silence of delicious drowsy reverie   v   the next morning he did not rise at all the collapse had come the bad air the nervous strain the lack of sleep had worn down his slender store of strength and when the great victory came he fell like a tree whose trunk has been slowly gnawed across by teeth of silent saw his drowse deepened into torpor  in the bright winter morning seated in a gay cutter behind a bay colt strung with slashing bells mattie drove to kesota for the doctor she felt the discord between the joyous jangle of the bells the stream of sunlight and the sparkle of snow crystals but it only added to the poignancy of her anxiety  she had not yet reached selfconsciousness in her regard for the young preachershe thought of him as a noble human being liable to death and she chirped again and again to the flying colt whose broad hoofs flung the snow in stinging showers against her face  a call at the doctors house set him jogging out along the lanes while she sent a telegram to herman as she whirled bay tom into the road to go home her heart rose in relief that was almost exaltation she loved horses she always sang under her breath chiming to the beat of their bells when alone and now she loosened the rein and hummed an old lovesong while the powerful young horse squared away in a trot which was twelve miles an hour  in such air in such sun who could die her good animal strength rose dominant over fear of death  she came upon the doctor swinging along in his old blue cutter dozing in countrydoctor style making up for lost sleep  out o the way doctor she gleefully called  the doctor roused up and looked around with a smile he was not beyond admiring such a girl as that he snapped his whiplash lightly on old sofias back who looked up surprised and seeming to comprehend matters began to reach out broad flat thin legs in a pace which the proud colt respected she came of illustrious line did sofia scanthaired and ungracious as she now was  dont run over me called the doctor ironically and with sofia still leading they swung into the yard  mattie went in with the doctor while allen looked after both horses they found chapman attending wallace who lay in a dazed quietconscious but not definitely aware of material things  the doctor looked his patient over carefully then he asked who is the yoong mon  hes been teaching here or rather preaching  when did this coom on  last night wound up a big revival last night i believe kind o caved in i reckon  thats all needs rest hell be wearin a wood jacket if he doosna leave off preachin  regular jamboree i couldnt stop him one of these periodical neighborhood

said the candid old scotchman mak im eat mak im eat  once more tom pounded along the shining road to kesota to meet the sixoclock train from chicago  herman magnificently clothed in furlined ulster and cap alighted with unusually grave face and hurried toward mattie  well what is it sis mother sick  no its the teacher he is unconscious ive been for the doctor oh we were scared  he looked relieved but a little chagrined oh well i dont see why i should be yanked out of my boots by a telegram because the teacher is sick he isnt kinyet  for the first time a feeling of confusion swept over mattie and her face flushed  hermans keen eyes half closed as he looked into her face  matwhatwhat now look herehows this wheres ben hollys claim  he never had any she shifted ground quickly oh herman we had a wonderful time last night father and uncle marsden shook hands  what shouted herman as he fell in a limp mass against the cutter bring a physicianim stricken  dont act so everybodys looking  theyd better look im drowning while they wait  she untied the horse and came back  climb in there and stop your fooling and ill tell you all about it  he crawled in with tearing groans of mock agony and then leaned his head against her shoulder well go on sis i can bear it now  she nudged him to make him sit up  well you know weve had a revival  so you wrote must have been a screamer to fetch dad and old marsden a regular pentecost of shinar  it wasi mean it was beautiful i saw father was getting stirred up he prayed almost all day yesterday and at nightwell i cant tell you but wallace talked oh so beautiful and tender  she calls him wallace mused herman like a comedian hush and then came the handshaking and then the minister came home with us because father asked him to and stayed because he liked the chicken  the girl was hurt and she showed it if you make fun i wont tell you another word she said  away chicago enter cyene well come i wont fool any more  then after wallacei mean  let it stand come to the murder  then father came and asked me to send for you and mother cried and so did he and oh hermie hes so sweet and kind dont make fun of him will you its splendid to have him give in and everybody feels glad that the district will be all friendly again  herman did not gibe now his voice was gentle the pathos in the scene appealed to him so the old man sent for me himself did he  yes he could hardly wait till morning but this morning when we came to call the teacher he didnt answer and father went in and found him unconscious then i went for the doctor  bay tom whirled along in the splendid dusk his nostrils flaring ghostly banners of steam on the cold crisp air the stars overhead were points of green and blue and crimson light lowhung changing each moment their influence entered the soul of the mocking young fellow he felt very solemn almost melancholy for a moment  well sis ive got something to tell you all im going to tell it to you by degrees im going to be married  oh she gasped with quick indrawn breath who  dont be ungrammatical whatever you do shes a cashier in a restaurant and shes a fine girl he added steadily as if combating a prejudice he forgot for the moment that such prejudices did not exist in cyene  sis was instantly tender and very very serious  of course she is or you wouldnt care for her oh id like to see her  ill take you up some day and show her to you  oh will you oh when can i go she was smitten into gravity again not till the teacher is well  herman pretended to be angry dog take the teacher the old spindlelegs if id known he was going to raise such a ruction in our quiet and peaceful neighborhood i never would have brought him here  mattie did not laugh she pondered she never quite understood her brother when he went off on those queer tirades which might be a joke or an insult he had grown away from her in his city life  they rode on in silence the rest of the way except now and then an additional question from mattie concerning his sweetheart  as they neared the farmhouse she lost interest in all else but the condition of the young minister they could see the light burning dimly in his room and in the parlor and kitchen as well and this unusual lighting stirred the careless young man deeply it was associated in his mind with death and birth and also with great joy the house was lighted so the night his elder brother died and it looked so to him when he whirled into the yard with the doctor when mattie was born  oh i hope he isnt worse said the girl with deep feeling  herman put his arm about her and she knew he knew  so do i sis  allen came to the door as they drove in and the careless boy realized suddenly the emotional tension his father was in as the old man came to the sleighside he could not speak his fingers trembled as he took the outstretched hand of his boy  hermans voice shook a little  well dad mattie says the war is over  the old man tried to speak but only coughed and then he blew his nose at last he said brokenly  go right in your mothers waitin  it was singularly dramatic to the youth to come from the careless superficial life of his city companions into contact with such primeval passions as these made him feel like a spectator at some new and powerful and tragic play  his mother fell upon his neck and cried while mattie stood by pale and anxious inside the parlor could be heard the mumble of mens voices  in such wise do death and the fear of death fall upon country homes all day the house had swarmed with people all day this mother had looked forward to the reconciliation of her husband with her son all day had the pale and silent minister of god kept his corpselike calm while all about the white snow gleamed and radiant shadows filled every hollow and the cattle bawled and frisked in the barnyard and the fowls cackled joyously what time the mild soft wind breathed warmly over the land  mattie cried out to her mother in quick low voice oh mother how is he  he aint no worse the doctor says theres no immediate danger  the girl brought her hands together girlishly and said oh im so glad is he awake  no hes asleep  is the doctor still here  yes  i guess ill step in said herman  the doctor and george chapman sat beside the hardcoal heater talking in low voices the old doctor was permitting himself the luxury of a story of pioneer life he arose with automatic courtesy and shook hands with herman  hows the sick man getting on  vera wellvera wellconsederin the mon is a complete wornoutthats allnaethin more thes floomadidale bezniss of rantin away on the fear o the laird for sax weeks wull have worn out the frame of a booldawg  herman and chapman smiled i hope youll tell him that  na fear yoong mon said the grim old warrior weel now aill juist be takin anither look at him  herman went in with the doctor and stood looking on while the old man peered and felt about he came out soon and leaving a few directions with herman and chapman took his departure everything seemed favorable he said  there was no longer poignancy of anxiety in matties mind she was too much of a child to imagine the horror of loss but she was grave and gay by turns her healthy and wholesome nature continually reasserted itself over the power of her newly attained womans interest in the young preacher she went to bed and slept dreamlessly while herman yawned and inwardly raged at the fix in which circumstances had placed him  like many another lover days away from his sweetheart were lost days he wondered how she would take all this life in cyene it would be good fun to bring her down anyway and hear her talk he planned such a trip and grew so interested in the thought he forgot his patient  in the early dawn wallace rallied and woke herman heard the rustle of the pillow and turned to find the sick mans eyes looking at him fixedly calm but puzzled hermans lips slowly changed into a beautiful boyish smile hello old man how do you find yourself his hearty humorous greeting seemed to do the sick man good herman approached the bed know where you are wallace slowly put out a hand and herman took it youre coming on all right want some breakfast make it bucks he said in chicago restaurant slang white wingssunnyone up coff  all this was good tonic for wallace and an hour later he sipped broth while mrs allen and the deacon and herman stood watching the process with apparently consuming interest mattie was still soundly sleeping  now began delicious days of convalescence during which wallace looked peacefully out at the coming and going of the two women each possessing powerful appeal to him one the motherly presence which had been denied him for many years the other something he had never permitted himself to hope fora sweethearts daily companionship  he lay there planning his church and also his home into the thought of a new church came shyly but persistently the thought of a fireside of his own with this young girl sitting in the glow of it waiting for him his life possessed little romance he had earned his own way through school and to college his slender physical energies had been taxed to their utmost at every stage of his climb but now it seemed as though some blessed rest and peace were at hand  meanwhile the bitter partisans met each other coming and going out of the gate of the allen estate and the goodness of god shone in their softened faces herman was skeptical of its lasting quality but was forced to acknowledge that it was a lovely light he it was who made the electrical suggestion to rebuild the church as an evidence of good faith you say youre regenerated well prove itgo ahead and regenerate the church he said  the enthusiasm of the neighborhood took flame it should be done a meeting was called everybody subscribed money or work it was a generous outpouring of love and faith  it was herman also who counselled secrecy it would be a nice thing to surprise him he said well agree to keep the scheme from him at home if you dont give it away  they set to work like bees the women came down one day and took possession with brooms and mops and soap and while the carpenters repaired the windows they fell savagely upon the grime of the seats and floors the walls of the church echoed with womans gossip and girlish laughter everything was scoured from the doorhinges to the altar rails new doors were hung and a new stove secured and then came the painters to put a new coat of paint on the inside the cold weather forbade repainting the outside  the sheds were rebuilt by men whose hearts glowed with oldtime fire it was like pioneer days when barnraisings and bees made life worth while in a wild stern land the old men were moved to tears and the younger rough men shouted cheery boisterous cries to hide their own deep emotion hand met hand in heartiness never shown before neighbors frequented one anothers homes and the old times of visiting and brotherly love came back upon them nothing marred the perfect beauty of their revivalsave the fear of its evanescence it seemed too good to last  meanwhile love of another and merrier sort went on the young men and maidens turned prayermeeting into trysts and scrubbingbees into festivals they rode from house to house under glittering stars over sparkling snows singing    hallelujah tis done   i believe on the son   i am saved by the blood   of the crucified one  and their rejoicing chorus was timed to the clash of bells on swift young horses who shall say they did not right did the galilean forbid love and joy  no matter gods stars the mysterious night the bells the watchful bay of dogs the sting of snow the croon of loving voices the clasp of tender arms the touch of parting lipsthese things these joys outweigh death and hell and all that makes the criminal tremble being saved they must of surety rejoice  and through it all wallace crawled slowly back to life and strength he ate of mother allens chickenbroth and of toast from matties caretaking hand and gradually reassumed color and heart his solemn eyes watched the young girl with an intensity which seemed to take her strength from her she would gladly have given her blood for him if it had occurred to her or if it had been suggested as a good thing instead she gave him potatoes baked to a nicety and buttered toast that would melt on the tongue and on the whole they served the purpose  one day a smartly dressed man called to see wallace mattie recognized him as the baptist clergyman from kesota he came in and introducing himself said he had heard of the excellent work of mr stacey and that he would like to speak with him  wallace was sitting in a rockingchair in the parlor herman was in chicago and there was no one but mrs allen and mattie in the house  the kesota minister introduced himself to wallace and then entered upon a long eulogium upon his work in cyene he asked after his credentials his plans his connections and then he said  youve done a fine work in softening the hearts of these people we had almost despaired of doing anything with them yes you have done a wonderful work and now we must reorganize a regular society here i will be out again when you get stronger and well see about it  wallace was too weak to take any stand in the talk and so allowed him to get up and go away without protest or explanation of his own plans  when herman came down on saturday he told him of the baptist ministers visit and the proposition herman stretched his legs out toward the fire and put his hands in his pockets then he rose and took a strange attitude such as wallace had seen in comic picturesit was in fact the attitude of a bowery tough  say look here if you want o set dis community by de ears agin you do dat tingsee you play dat confidence game and deyll rat yesure you invite us to come into a nonpartisan dealseeand den you springs your own platform on us in de joint corkusand we wont stand it dis goes troo de way it began or we dont playsee  out of all this wallace deduced his own feelingthat continued peace and goodwill lay in keeping clear of all doctrinal debates and disputesthe love of christ the desire to do good and to be clean these emotions had been roused far more deeply than he realized and he lifted his face to god in the hope that no lesser thing should come in to mar the beauty of his church  there came a day when he walked out in the sunshine and heard the hens cawcawing about the yard and saw the young colts playing about the barn and the splendor of the winter day dazzled him as if he were looking upon the broadflung robe of the lord most high everywhere the snow lay ridged with purple and brown hedges smoke rose peacefully from chimneys and the sound of boys skating on a nearby pond added the human element  the trouble of concealing the work of the community upon the church increased daily and mattie feared that some hint of it had come to him she had her plan she wanted to drive him down herself and let him see the reburnished temple alone but this was impossible on the day when he seemed able to go her father drove them all down marsden was there also and several of his womenfolks putting down a new carpet on the platform as they drew near the church wallace said  why theyve fixed up the sheds  mattie nodded she was trembling with the delicious excitement of itshe wanted him hurried into the church at once he had hardly time to think before he was whirled up to the new porch and marsden came out followed by several women he was bewildered by it all marsden helped him out with hearty voice sounding  careful now dont hurry  mattie took one arm and so he entered the church everything repainted everything warm and bright and cozy  the significance of it came to him like a wave of light and he took his seat in the pulpit chair and stared at them all with a look on his pale face which moved them more than words he was like a man transfigured by an inward glow his eyes for an instant flamed with this marvellous fire then darkened softened with tears and his voice came back in a sob of joy and he could only say  friendsbrethren  marsden after much coughing said  we all united on this we wanted to have you come to the church andwell we couldnt bear to have you see it again the way it was  he understood it now it was the sign of a united community it set the seal of christs victory over evil passions and the young preachers head bowed in prayer and they all knelt while his weak voice returned thanks to the lord for his gifts  then they all rose and shook off the oppressive solemnity and he had time to look around at all the changes at last he turned to mattie and reached out his handhe had the boldness of a man in the shadow of some mighty event which makes false modesty and conventions shadowy things of little importance his sharpened interior sense read her clear soul and he knew she was his therefore he reached her his hand and she came to him with a flush on her face which died out as she stood proudly by his side while he said  and martha shall help me  therefore this good thing happenedthat in the midst of his fervor and his consecration to gods work the love of woman found a place    an afterword of winds snows and the stars    o witchery of the winter night     with broad moon shouldering to the west    in the city streets the west wind sweeps   before my feet in rustling flight   the midnight snows in untracked heaps   lie cold and desolate and white   i stand and wait with upturned eyes   awed with the splendor of the skies   and startrained progress of the moon    the city walls dissolve like smoke   beneath the magic of the moon   and age falls from me like a cloak   i hear sweet girlish voices ring   clear as some softly stricken string   the moon is sailing to the west   the sleighbells clash in homeward flight   with frost each horses breast is white   the big moon sinking to the west         good night lettie        good night ben   the moon is sinking at the west   good night my sweetheart  once again   the parting kiss while comrades wait   impatient at the roadside gate   and the red moon sinks beyond the west  the end
