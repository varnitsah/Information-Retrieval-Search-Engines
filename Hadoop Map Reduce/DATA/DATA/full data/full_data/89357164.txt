89357164	nada the lily  by h rider haggard     dedication  sompseu  for i will call you by the name that for fifty years has been honoured by every tribe between zambesi and cape agulbasi greet you  sompseu my father i have written a book that tells of men and matters of which you know the most of any who still look upon the light therefore i set your name within that book and such as it is i offer it to you  if you knew not chaka you and he have seen the same suns shine you knew his brother panda and his captains and perhaps even that very mopo who tells this tale his servant who slew him with the princes you have seen the circle of the witchdoctors and the unconquerable zulu impis rushing to war you have crowned their kings and shared their counsels and with your sons blood you have expiated a statesmans error and a generals fault  sompseu a song has been sung in my ears of how first you mastered this people of the zulu is it not true my father that for long hours you sat silent and alone while three thousand warriors shouted for your life and when they grew weary did you not stand and say pointing towards the ocean kill me if you wish men of cetywayo but i tell you that for every drop of my blood a hundred avengers shall rise from yonder sea  then so it was told me the regiments turned staring towards the black water as though the day of ulundi had already come and they saw the white slayers creeping across the plains  thus sompseu your name became great among the people of the zulu as already it was great among many another tribe and their nobles did you homage and they gave you the bayete the royal salute declaring by the mouth of their council that in you dwelt the spirit of chaka  many years have gone by since then and now you are old my father it is many years even since i was a boy and followed you when you went up among the boers and took their country for the queen  why did you do this my father i will answer who know the truth you did it because had it not been done the zulus would have stamped out the boers were not cetywayos impis gathered against the land and was it not because it became the queens land that at your word he sent them murmuring to their kraals 1 to save bloodshed you annexed the country beyond the vaal perhaps it had been better to leave it since death chooses for himself and after all there was killingof our own people and with the killing shame but in those days we did not guess what we should live to see and of majuba we thought only as a little hill  enemies have borne false witness against you on this matter sompseu you who never erred except through over kindness yet what does that avail when you have gone beyond it will be forgotten since the sting of ingratitude passes and lies must wither like the winter veldt only your name will not be forgotten as it was heard in life so it shall be heard in story and i pray that however humbly mine may pass down with it chance has taken me by another path and i must leave the ways of action that i love and bury myself in books but the old days and friends are in my mind nor while i have memory shall i forget them and you  therefore though it be for the last time from far across the seas i speak to you and lifting my hand i give your sibonga 2 and that royal salute to which now that its kings are gone and the people of heaven are no more a nation with her majesty you are alone entitled      bayete baba nkosi ya makosi     ngonyama indhlovu ai pendulwa     wen o wa vela wasi pata     wen o wa hlul izizwe zonke za patwa nguive     wa

encouraged to his task by a purpose somewhat beyond that of setting out a wild tale of savage life when he was yet a ladnow some seventeen years agofortune took him to south africa there he was thrown in with men who for thirty or forty years had been intimately acquainted with the zulu people with their history their heroes and their customs from these he heard many tales and traditions some of which perhaps are rarely told nowadays and in time to come may cease to be told altogether then the zulus were still a nation now that nation has been destroyed and the chief aim of its white rulers is to root out the warlike spirit for which it was remarkable and to replace it by a spirit of peaceful progress the zulu military organisation perhaps the most wonderful that the world has seen is already a thing of the past it perished at ulundi it was chaka who invented that organisation building it up from the smallest beginnings when he appeared at the commencement of this century it was as the ruler of a single small tribe when he fell in the year 1828 beneath the assegais of his brothers umhlangana and dingaan and of his servant mopo or umbopo as he is called also all southeastern africa was at his feet and in his march to power he had slaughtered more than a million human beings an attempt has been made in these pages to set out the true character of this colossal genius and most evil mana napoleon and a tiberius in oneand also that of his brother and successor dingaan so no more need be said of them here the authors aim moreover has been to convey in a narrative form some idea of the remarkable spirit which animated these kings and their subjects and to make accessible in a popular shape incidents of history which are now for the most part only to be found in a few scarce works of reference rarely consulted except by students it will be obvious that such a task has presented difficulties since he who undertakes it must for a time forget his civilisation and think with the mind and speak with the voice of a zulu of the old regime all the horrors perpetrated by the zulu tyrants cannot be published in this polite age of melanite and torpedoes their details have therefore been suppressed still much remains and those who think it wrong that massacre and fighting should be written ofexcept by special correspondentsor that the sufferings of mankind beneath one of the worlds most cruel tyrannies should form the groundwork of romance may be invited to leave this book unread most indeed nearly all of the historical incidents here recorded are substantially true thus it is said that chaka did actually kill his mother unandi for the reason given and destroy an entire tribe in the tatiyana cleft and that he prophesied of the coming of the white man after receiving his death wounds of the incident of the missionary and the furnace of logs it is impossible to speak so certainly it came to the writer from the lips of an old traveller in the zulu but he cannot discover any confirmation of it still these kings undoubtedly put their soldiers to many tests of equal severity umbopo or mopo as he is named in this tale actually lived after he had stabbed chaka he rose to great eminence then he disappears from the scene but it is not accurately known whether he also went the way of the assegai or perhaps as is here suggested came to live near stanger under the name of zweete the fate of the two lovers at the mouth of the cave is a true zulu tale which has been considerably varied to suit the purposes of this romance the late mr leslie who died in 1874 tells it in his book among the zulus and amatongas i heard a story the other day he says which if the power of writing fiction were possessed by me i might have worked up into a firstclass sensational novel it is the story that has been woven into the plot of this book to him also the writer is indebted for the artifice by which umslopogaas obtained admission to the swazi stronghold it was told to mr leslie by the zulu who performed the feat and thereby won a wife also the writers thanks are due to his friends mr f b fynney 1 late zulu border agent for much information given to him in bygone years by word of mouth and more recently through his pamphlet zululand and the zulus and to mr john bird formerly treasurer to the government of natal whose compilation the annals of natal is invaluable to all who would study the early history of that colony and of zululand  as for the wilder and more romantic incidents of this story such as the hunting of umslopogaas and galazi with the wolves or rather with the hyaenasfor there are no true wolves in zululandthe author can only say that they seem to him of a sort that might well have been mythically connected with the names of those heroes similar beliefs and traditions are common in the records of primitive peoples the club watcher of the fords or to give its zulu name unothlolamazibuko is an historical weapon chronicled by bishop callaway it was once owned by a certain undhlebekazizwa he was an arbitrary person for no matter what was discussed in our village he would bring it to a conclusion with a stick but he made a good end for when the zulu soldiers attacked him he killed no less than twenty of them with the watcher and the spears stuck in him as thick as reeds in a morass this mans strength was so great that he could kill a leopard like a fly with his hands only much as umslopogaas slew the traitor in this story  perhaps it may be allowable to add a few words about the zulu mysticism magic and superstition to which there is some allusion in this romance it has been little if at all exaggerated thus the writer well remembers hearing a legend how the guardian spirit of the amazulu was seen riding down the storm here is what mr fynney says of her in the pamphlet to which reference has been made the natives have a spirit which they call nomkubulwana or the inkosazanayezulu the princess of heaven she is said to be robed in white and to take the form of a young maiden in fact an angel she is said to appear to some chosen person to whom she imparts some revelation but whatever that revelation may be it is kept a profound secret from outsiders i remember that just before the zulu war nomkubulwana appeared revealing something or other which had a great effect throughout the land and i know that the zulus were quite impressed that some calamity was about to befall them one of the ominous signs was that fire is said to have descended from heaven and ignited the grass over the graves of the former kings of zululand  on another occasion nomkubulwana appeared to some one in zululand the result of that visit being that the native women buried their young children up to their heads in sand deserting them for the time being going away weeping but returning at nightfall to unearth the little ones again  for this divine personage there is therefore authority and the same may be said of most of the supernatural matters spoken of in these pages the exact spiritual position held in the zulu mind by the umkulunkuluthe oldoldthe greatgreatthe lord of heavensis a more vexed question and for its proper consideration the reader must be referred to bishop callaways work the religious system of the amazulu briefly umkulunkulus character seems to vary from the idea of an ancestral spirit or the spirit of an ancestor to that of a god in the case of an able and highly intelligent person like the mopo of this story the ideal would probably not be a low one therefore he is made to speak of umkulunkulu as the great spirit or god  it only remains to the writer to express his regret that this story is not more varied in its hue it would have been desirable to introduce some gayer and more happy incidents but it has not been possible it is believed that the picture given of the times is a faithful one though it may be open to correction in some of its details at the least the aged man who tells the tale of his wrongs and vengeance could not be expected to treat his subject in an optimistic or even in a cheerful vein   1 i grieve to state that i must now say the late mr f b fynney     nada the lily     introduction  some years sinceit was during the winter before the zulu wara white man was travelling through natal his name does not matter for he plays no part in this story with him were two wagons laden with goods which he was transporting to pretoria the weather was cold and there was little or no grass for the oxen which made the journey difficult but he had been tempted to it by the high rates of transport that prevailed at that season of the year which would remunerate him for any probable loss he might suffer in cattle so he pushed along on his journey and all went well until he had passed the little town of stanger once the site of duguza the kraal of chaka the first zulu king and the uncle of cetywayo the night after he left stanger the air turned bitterly cold heavy grey clouds filled the sky and hid the light of the stars  now if i were not in natal i should say that there was a heavy fall of snow coming said the white man to himself i have often seen the sky look like that in scotland before snow then he reflected that there had been no deep snow in natal for years and having drunk a tot of squareface and smoked his pipe he went to bed beneath the aftertent of his larger wagon  during the night he was awakened by a sense of bitter cold and the low moaning of the oxen that were tied to the trektow every ox in its place he thrust his head through the curtain of the tent and looked out the earth was white with snow and the air was full of it swept along by a cutting wind  now he sprang up huddling on his clothes and as he did so calling to the kaffirs who slept beneath the wagons presently they awoke from the stupor which already was beginning to overcome them and crept out shivering with cold and wrapped from head to foot in blankets  quick you boys he said to them in zulu quick would you see the cattle die of the snow and wind loose the oxen from the trektows and drive them in between the wagons they will give them some shelter and lighting a lantern he sprang out into the snow  at last it was doneno easy task for the numbed hands of the kaffirs could scarcely loosen the frozen reims the wagons were outspanned side by side with a space between them and into this space the mob of thirtysix oxen was driven and there secured by reims tied crosswise from the front and hind wheels of the wagons then the white man crept back to his bed and the shivering natives fortified with gin or squareface as it is called locally took refuge on the second wagon drawing a tentsail over them  for awhile there was silence save for the moaning of the huddled and restless cattle  if the snow goes on i shall lose my oxen he said to himself they can never bear this cold  hardly had the words passed his lips when the wagon shook there was a sound of breaking reims and trampling hoofs once more he looked out the oxen had skrecked in a mob there they were running away into the night and the snow seeking to find shelter from the cold in a minute they had vanished utterly there was nothing to be done except wait for the morning  at last it came revealing a landscape blind with snow such search as could be made told them nothing the oxen had gone and their spoor was obliterated by the freshfallen flakes the white man called a council of his kaffir servants what was to be done he asked  one said this thing one that but all agreed that they must wait to act until the snow melted  or till we freeze you whose mothers were fools said the white man who was in the worst of tempers for had he not lost four hundred pounds worth of oxen  then a zulu spoke who hitherto had remained silent he was the driver of the first wagon  my father he said to the white man this is my word the oxen are lost in the snow no man knows whither they have gone or whether they live or are now but hides and bones yet at the kraal yonder and he pointed to some huts about two miles away on the hillside lives a witch doctor named zweete he is oldvery oldbut he has wisdom and he can tell you where the oxen are if any man may my father  stuff answered the white man still as the kraal cannot be colder than this wagon we will go and ask zweete bring a bottle of squareface and some snuff with you for presents  an hour later he stood in the hut of zweete before him was a very ancient man a mere bag of bones with sightless eyes and one handhis leftwhite and shrivelled  what do you seek of zweete my white father asked the old man in a thin voice you do not believe in me and my wisdom why should i help you yet i will do it though it is against your law and you do wrong to ask meyes to show you that there is truth in us zulu doctors i will help you my father i know what you seek you seek to know where your oxen have run for shelter from the cold is it not so  it is so doctor answered the white man you have long ears  yes my white father i have long ears though they say that i grow deaf i have keen eyes also and yet i cannot see your face let me hearken let me look  for awhile he was silent rocking himself to and fro then he spoke you have a farm white man down near pine town is it not ah i thought soand an hours ride from your farm lives a boer with four fingers only on his right hand there is a kloof on the boers farm where mimosatrees grow there in the kloof you shall find your oxenyes five days journey from here you will find them all i say all my father except three onlythe big black africander ox the little red zulu ox with one horn and the speckled ox you shall not find these for they have died in the snow send and you will find the others no no i ask no fee i do not work wonders for reward why should i i am rich  now the white man scoffed but in the end so great is the power of superstition he sent and here it may be stated that on the eleventh day of his sojourn at the kraal of zweete those whom he sent returned with the oxen except the three only after that he scoffed no more those eleven days he spent in a hut of the old mans kraal and every afternoon he came and talked with him sitting far into the night  on the third day he asked zweete how it was that his left hand was white and shrivelled and who were umslopogaas and nada of whom he had let fall some words then the old man told him the tale that is set out here day by day he told some of it till it was finished it is not all written in these pages for portions may have been forgotten or put aside as irrelevant neither has it been possible for the writer of it to render the full force of the zulu idiom nor to convey a picture of the teller for in truth he acted rather than told his story was the death of a warrior in question he stabbed with his stick showing how the blow fell and where did the story grow sorrowful he groaned or even wept moreover he had many voices one for each of the actors in his tale this man ancient and withered seemed to live again in the far past it was the past that spoke to his listener telling of deeds long forgotten of deeds that are no more known  yet as he best may the white man has set down the substance of the story of zweete in the spirit in which zweete told it and because the history of nada the lily and of those with whom her life was intertwined moved him strangely and in many ways he has done more he has printed it that others may judge of it  and now his part is played let him who was named zweete but who had another name take up the story    chapter i the boy chaka prophesies  you ask me my father to tell you the tale of the youth of umslopogaas holder of the iron chieftainess the axe groanmaker who was named bulalio the slaughterer and of his love for nada the most beautiful of zulu women it is long but you are here for many nights and if i live to tell it it shall be told strengthen your heart my father for i have much to say that is sorrowful and even now when i think of nada the tears creep through the horn that shuts out my old eyes from light  do you know who i am my father you do not know you think that i am an old old witchdoctor named zweete so men have thought for many years but that is not my name few have known it for i have kept it locked in my breast lest thought i live now under the law of the white man and the great queen is my chieftainess an assegai still might find this heart did any know my name  look at this hand my fatherno not that which is withered with fire look on this right hand of mine you see it though i who am blind cannot but still within me i see it as it was once ay i see it red and strongred with the blood of two kings listen my father bend your ear to me and listen i am mopoah i felt you start you start as the regiment of the bees started when mopo walked before their ranks and from the assegai in his hand the blood of chaka 1 dropped slowly to the earth i am mopo who slew chaka the king i killed him with dingaan and umhlangana the princes but the wound was mine that his life crept out of and but for me he would never have been slain i killed him with the princes but dingaan i and one other slew alone   1 the zulu napoleon one of the greatest geniuses and most wicked     men who ever lived he was killed in the year 1828 having     slaughtered more than a million human beingsed  what do you say dingaan died by the tongola  yes yes he died but not there he died on the ghost mountain he lies in the breast of the old stone witch who sits aloft forever waiting for the world to perish but i also was on the ghost mountain in those days my feet still could travel fast and vengeance would not let me sleep i travelled by day and by night i found him i and another we killed himah ah  why do i tell you this what has it to do with the loves of umslopogaas and nada the lily i will tell you i stabbed chaka for the sake of my sister baleka the mother of umslopogaas and because he had murdered my wives and children i and umslopogaas slew dingaan for the sake of nada who was my daughter  there are great names in the story my father yes many have heard the names when the impis roared them out as they charged in battle i have felt the mountains shake and seen the waters quiver in their sound but where are they now silence has them and the white men write them down in books i opened the gates of distance for the holders of the names they passed through and they are gone beyond i cut the strings that tied them to the world they fell off ha ha they fell off perhaps they are falling still perhaps they creep about their desolate kraals in the skins of snakes i wish i knew the snakes that i might crush them with my heel yonder beneath us at the burying place of kings there is a hole in that hole lies the bones of chaka the king who died for baleka far away in zululand there is a cleft upon the ghost mountain at the foot of that cleft lie the bones of dingaan the king who died for nada it was far to fall and he was heavy those bones of his are broken into little pieces i went to see them when the vultures and the jackals had done their work and then i laughed three times and came here to die  all that is long ago and i have not died though i wish to die and follow the road that nada trod perhaps i have lived to tell you this tale my father that you may repeat it to the white men if you will how old am i nay i do not know very very old had chaka lived he would have been as old as i 2 none are living whom i knew when i was a boy i am so old that i must hasten the grass withers and the winter comes yes while i speak the winter nips my heart well i am ready to sleep in the cold and perhaps i shall awake again in the spring   2 this would have made him nearly a hundred years old an age rarely     attained by a native the writer remembers talking to an aged zulu     woman however who told him that she was married when chaka was     kinged  before the zulus were a peoplefor i will begin at the beginningi was born of the langeni tribe we were not a large tribe afterwards all our ablebodied men numbered one full regiment in chakas army perhaps there were between two and three thousand of them but they were brave now they are all dead and their women and children with themthat people is no more it is gone like last months moon how it went i will tell you byandbye  our tribe lived in a beautiful open country the boers whom we call the amaboona are there now they tell me my father makedama was chief of the tribe and his kraal was built on the crest of a hill but i was not the son of his head wife one evening when i was still little standing as high as a mans elbow only i went out with my mother below the cattle kraal to see the cows driven in my mother was very fond of these cows and there was one with a white face that would follow her about she carried my little sister baleka riding on her hip baleka was a baby then we walked till we met the lads driving in the cows my mother called the whitefaced cow and gave it mealie leaves which she had brought with her then the boys went on with the cattle but the whitefaced cow stopped by my mother she said that she would bring it to the kraal when she came home my mother sat down on the grass and nursed her baby while i played round her and the cow grazed presently we saw a woman walking towards us across the plain she walked like one who is tired on her back was a bundle of mats and she led by the hand a boy of about my own age but bigger and stronger than i was we waited a long while till at last the woman came up to us and sank down on the veldt for she was very weary we saw by the way her hair was dressed that she was not of our tribe  greeting to you said the woman  goodmorrow answered my mother what do you seek  food and a hut to sleep in said the woman i have travelled far  how are you namedand what is your people asked my mother  my name is unandi i am the wife of senzangacona of the zulu tribe said the stranger  now there had been war between our people and the zulu people and senzangacona had killed some of our warriors and taken many of our cattle so when my mother heard the speech of unandi she sprang up in anger  you dare to come here and ask me for food and shelter wife of a dog of a zulu she cried begone or i will call the girls to whip you out of our country  the woman who was very handsome waited till my mother had finished her angry words then she looked up and spoke slowly there is a cow by you with milk dropping from its udder will you not even give me and my boy a gourd of milk and she took a gourd from her bundle and held it towards us  i will not said my mother  we are thirsty with long travel will you not then give us a cup of water we have found none for many hours  i will not wife of a dog go and seek water for yourself  the womans eyes filled with tears but the boy folded his arms on his breast and scowled he was a very handsome boy with bright black eyes but when he scowled his eyes were like the sky before a thunderstorm  mother he said we are not wanted here any more than we were wanted yonder and he nodded towards the country where the zulu people lived let us be going to dingiswayo the umtetwa people will protect us  yes let us be going my son answered unandi but the path is long we are weary and shall fall by the way  i heard and something pulled at my heart i was sorry for the woman and her boy they looked so tired then without saying anything to my mother i snatched the gourd and ran with it to a little donga that was hard by for i knew that there was a spring presently i came back with the gourd full of water my mother wanted to catch me for she was very angry but i ran past her and gave the gourd to the boy then my mother ceased trying to interfere only she beat the woman with her tongue all the while saying that evil had come to our kraals from her husband and she felt in her heart that more evil would come upon us from her son her ehlose 3 told her so ah my father her ehlose told her true if the woman unandi and her child had died that day on the veldt the gardens of my people would not now be a wilderness and their bones would not lie in the great gulley that is near ucetywayos kraal   3 guardian spirited  while my mother talked i and the cow with the white face stood still and watched and the baby baleka cried aloud the boy unandis son having taken the gourd did not offer the water to his mother he drank twothirds of it himself i think that he would have drunk it all had not his thirst been slaked but when he had done he gave what was left to his mother and she finished it then he took the gourd again and came forward holding it in one hand in the other he carried a short stick  what is your name boy he said to me as a big rich man speaks to one who is little and poor  mopo is my name i answered  and what is the name of your people  i told him the name of my tribe the langeni tribe  very well mopo now i will tell you my name my name is chaka son of senzangacona and my people are called the amazulu and i will tell you something more i am little today and my people are a small people but i shall grow big so big that my head will be lost in the clouds you will look up and you shall not see it my face will blind you it will be bright like the sun and my people will grow great with me they shall eat up the whole world and when i am big and my people are big and we have stamped the earth flat as far as men can travel then i will remember your tribethe tribe of the langeni who would not give me and my mother a cup of milk when we were weary you see this gourd for every drop it can hold the blood of a man shall flowthe blood of one of your men but because you gave me the water i will spare you mopo and you only and make you great under me you shall grow fat in my shadow you alone i will never harm however you sin against me this i swear but for that woman and he pointed to my mother let her make haste and die so that i do not need to teach her what a long time death can take to come i have spoken and he ground his teeth and shook his stick towards us  my mother stood silent awhile then she gasped out the little liar he speaks like a man does he the calf lows like a bull i will teach him another notethe brat of an evil prophet and putting down baleka she ran at the boy  chaka stood quite still till she was near then suddenly he lifted the stick in his hand and hit her so hard on the head that she fell down after that he laughed turned and went away with his mother unandi  these my father were the first words i heard chaka speak and they were words of prophecy and they came true the last words i heard him speak were words of prophecy also and i think that they will come true even now they are coming true in the one he told how the zulu people should rise and say have they not risen in the other he told how they should fall and they did fall do not the white men gather themselves together even now against ucetywayo as vultures gather round a dying ox the zulus are not what they were to stand against them yes yes they will come true and mine is the song of a people that is doomed  but of these other words i will speak in their place  i went to my mother presently she raised herself from the ground and sat up with her hands over her face the blood from the wound the stick had made ran down her face on to her breast and i wiped it away with grass she sat for a long while thus while the child cried the cow lowed to be milked and i wiped up the blood with the grass at last she took her hands away and spoke to me  mopo my son she said i have dreamed a dream i dreamed that i saw the boy chaka who struck me he was grown like a giant he stalked across the mountains and the veldt his eyes blazed like the lightning and in his hand he shook a little assegai that was red with blood he caught up people after people in his hands and tore them he stamped their kraals flat with his feet before him was the green of summer behind him the land was black as when the fires have eaten the grass i saw our people mopo they were many and fat their hearts laughed the men were brave the girls were fair i counted their children by the hundreds i saw them again mopo they were bones white bones thousands of bones tumbled together in a rocky place and he chaka stood over the bones and laughed till the earth shook then mopo in my dream i saw you grown a man you alone were left of our people you crept up behind the giant chaka and with you came others great men of a royal look you stabbed him with a little spear and he fell down and grew small again he fell down and cursed you but you cried in his ear a namethe name of baleka your sisterand he died let us go home mopo let us go home the darkness falls  so we rose and went home but i held my peace for i was afraid very much afraid    chapter ii mopo is in trouble  now i must tell how my mother did what the boy chaka had told her and died quickly for where his stick had struck her on the forehead there came a sore that would not be healed and in the sore grew an abscess and the abscess ate inwards till it came to the brain then my mother fell down and died and i cried very much for i loved her and it was dreadful to see her cold and stiff with not a word to say however loudly i called to her well they buried my mother and she was soon forgotten i only remembered her nobody else didnot even baleka for she was too littleand as for my father he took another young wife and was content after that i was unhappy for my brothers did not love me because i was much cleverer than they and had greater skill with the assegai and was swifter in running so they poisoned the mind of my father against me and he treated me badly but baleka and i loved each other for we were both lonely and she clung to me like a creeper to the only tree in a plain and though i was young i learned this that to be wise is to be strong for though he who holds the assegai kills yet he whose mind directs the battle is greater than he who kills now i saw that the witchfinders and the medicinemen were feared in the land and that everybody looked up to them so that even when they had only a stick in their hands ten men armed with spears would fly before them therefore i determined that i should be a witchdoctor for they alone can kill those whom they hate with a word so i learned the arts of the medicinemen i made sacrifices i fasted in the veldt alone i did all those things of which you have heard and i learned much for there is wisdom in our magic as well as liesand you know it my father else you had not come here to ask me about your lost oxen  so things went on till i was twenty years of agea man full grown by now i had mastered all i could learn by myself so i joined myself on to the chief medicineman of our tribe who was named noma he was old had one eye only and was very clever of him i learned some tricks and more wisdom but at last he grew jealous of me and set a trap to catch me as it chanced a rich man of a neighbouring tribe had lost some cattle and came with gifts to noma praying him to smell them out noma tried and could not find them his vision failed him then the headman grew angry and demanded back his gifts but noma would not give up that which he once had held and hot words passed the headman said that he would kill noma noma said that he would bewitch the headman  peace i said for i feared that blood would be shed peace and let me see if my snake will tell me where the cattle are  you are nothing but a boy answered the headman can a boy have wisdom  that shall soon be known i said taking the bones in my hand 1   1 the kafir witchdoctors use the knucklebones of animals in their     magic rites throwing them something as we throw diceed  leave the bones alone screamed noma we will ask nothing more of our snakes for the good of this son of a dog  he shall throw the bones answered the headman if you try to stop him i will let sunshine through you with my assegai and he lifted his spear  then i made haste to begin i threw the bones the headman sat on the ground before me and answered my questions you know of these matters my fatherhow sometimes the witchdoctor has knowledge of where the lost things are for our ears are long and sometimes his ehlose tells him as but the other day it told me of your oxen well in this case my snake stood up i knew nothing of the mans cattle but my spirit was with me and soon i saw them all and told them to him one by one their colour their ageeverything i told him too where they were and how one of them had fallen into a stream and lay there on its back drowned with its forefoot caught in a forked root as my ehlose told me so i told the headman  now the man was pleased and said that if my sight was good and he found the cattle the gifts should be taken from noma and given to me and he asked the people who were sitting round and there were many if this was not just yes yes they said it was just and they would see that it was done but noma sat still and looked at me evilly he knew that i had made a true divination and he was very angry it was a big matter the herd of cattle were many and if they were found where i had said then all men would think me the greater wizard now it was late and the moon had not yet risen therefore the headman said that he would sleep that night in our kraal and at the first light would go with me to the spot where i said the cattle were after that he went away  i too went into my hut and lay down to sleep suddenly i awoke feeling a weight upon my breast i tried to start up but something cold pricked my throat i fell back again and looked the door of the hut was open the moon lay low on the sky like a ball of fire far away i could see it through the door and its light crept into the hut it fell upon the face of noma the witchdoctor he was seated across me glaring at me with his one eye and in his hand was a knife it was that which i had felt prick my throat  you whelp whom i have bred up to tear me he hissed into my ear you dared to divine where i failed did you very well now i will show you how i serve such puppies first i will pierce through the root of your tongue so that you cannot squeal then i will cut you to pieces slowly bit by bit and in the morning i will tell the people that the spirits did it because you lied next i will take off your arms and legs yes yes i will make you like a stick then i willand he began driving in the knife under my chin  mercy my uncle i said for i was frightened and the knife hurt have mercy and i will do whatever you wish  will you do this he asked still pricking me with the knife will you get up go to find the dogs cattle and drive them to a certain place and hide them there and he named a secret valley that was known to very few if you do that i will spare you and give you three of the cows if you refuse or play me false then by my fathers spirit i will find a way to kill you  certainly i will do it my uncle i answered why did you not trust me before had i known that you wanted to keep the cattle i would never have smelt them out i only did so fearing lest you should lose the presents  you are not so wicked as i thought he growled get up then and do my bidding you can be back here two hours after dawn  so i got up thinking all the while whether i should try to spring on him but i was without arms and he had the knife also if by chance i prevailed and killed him it would have been thought that i had murdered him and i should have tasted the assegai so i made another plan i would go and find the cattle in the valley where i had smelt them out but i would not bring them to the secret hidingplace no i would drive them straight to the kraal and denounce noma before the chief my father and all the people but i was young in those days and did not know the heart of noma he had not been a witchdoctor till he grew old for nothing oh he was evilhe was cunning as a jackal and fierce like a lion he had planted me by him like a tree but he meant to keep me clipped like a bush now i had grown tall and overshadowed him therefore he would root me up  i went to the corner of my hut noma watching me all the while and took a kerrie and my small shield then i started through the moonlight till i was past the kraal i glided along quietly as a shadow after that i began to run singing to myself as i went to frighten away the ghosts my father  for an hour i travelled swiftly over the plain till i came to the hillside where the bush began here it was very dark under the shade of the trees and i sang louder than ever at last i found the little buffalo path i sought and turned along it presently i came to an open place where the moonlight crept in between the trees i knelt down and looked yes my snake had not lied to me there was the spoor of the cattle then i went on gladly till i reached a dell through which the water ran softly sometimes whispering and sometimes talking out loud here the trail of the cattle was broad they had broken down the ferns with their feet and trampled the grass presently i came to a pool i knew itit was the pool my snake had shown me and there at the edge of the pool floated the drowned ox its foot caught in a forked root all was just as i had seen it in my heart  i stepped forward and looked round my eye caught something it was the faint grey light of the dawn glinted on the cattles horns as i looked one of them snorted rose and shook the dew from his hide he seemed big as an elephant in the mist and twilight  then i collected them allthere were seventeenand drove them before me down the narrow path back towards the kraal now the daylight came quickly and the sun had been up an hour when i reached the spot where i must turn if i wished to hide the cattle in the secret place as noma had bid me but i would not do this no i would go on to the kraal with them and tell all men that noma was a thief still i sat down and rested awhile for i was tired as i sat i heard a noise and looked up there over the slope of the rise came a crowd of men and leading them was noma and by his side the headman who owned the cattle i rose and stood still wondering but as i stood they ran towards me shouting and waving sticks and spears  there he is screamed noma there he isthe clever boy whom i have brought up to bring shame on me what did i tell you did i not tell you that he was a thief yesyes i know your tricks mopo my child see he is stealing the cattle he knew where they were all the time and now he is taking them away to hide them they would be useful to buy a wife with would they not my clever boy and he made a rush at me with his stick lifted and after him came the headman grunting with rage  i understood now my father my heart went mad in me everything began to swim round a red cloth seemed to lift itself up and down before my eyes i have always seen it thus when i was forced to fight i screamed out one word only liar and ran to meet him on came noma he struck at me with his stick but i caught the blow upon my little shield and hit back wow i did hit the skull of noma met my kerrie and down he fell dead at my feet i yelled again and rushed on at the headman he threw an assegai but it missed me and next second i hit him too he got up his shield but i knocked it down upon his head and over he rolled senseless whether he lived or died i do not know my father but his head being of the thickest i think it likely that he lived then while the people stood astonished i turned and fled like the wind they turned too and ran after me throwing spears at me and trying to cut me off but none of them could catch meno not one i went like the wind i went like a buck when the dogs wake it from sleep and presently the sound of their chase grew fainter and fainter till at last i was out of sight and alone    chapter iii mopo ventures home  i threw myself down on the grass and panted till my breath came back then i went and hid in a patch of reeds down by a swamp all day long i lay there thinking what was i to do now i was a jackal without a hole if i went back to my people certainly they would kill me whom they thought a thief my blood would be given for nomas and that i did not wish though my heart was sad then there came into my mind the thought of chaka the boy to whom i had given the cup of water long ago i had heard of him his name was known in the land already the air was big with it the very trees and grass spoke it the words he had said and the vision that my mother had seen were beginning to come true by the help of the umtetwas he had taken the place of his father senzangacona he had driven out the tribe of the amaquabe now he made war on zweete chief of the endwande and he had sworn that he would stamp the endwande flat so that nobody could find them any more now i remembered how this chaka promised that he would make me great and that i should grow fat in his shadow and i thought to myself that i would arise and go to him perhaps he would kill me well what did it matter certainly i should be killed if i stayed here yes i would go but now my heart pulled another way there was but one whom i loved in the worldit was my sister baleka my father had betrothed her to the chief of a neighbouring tribe but i knew that this marriage was against her wish perhaps my sister would run away with me if i could get near her to tell her that i was going i would tryyes i would try  i waited till the darkness came down then i rose from my bed of weeds and crept like a jackal towards the kraal in the mealie gardens i stopped awhile for i was very hungry and filled myself with the halfripe mealies then i went on till i came to the kraal some of my people were seated outside of a hut talking together over a fire i crept near silently as a snake and hid behind a little bush i knew that they could not see me outside the ring of the firelight and i wanted to hear what they said as i guessed they were talking of me and called me many names they said that i should bring illluck on the tribe by having killed so great a witchdoctor as noma also that the people of the headman would demand payment for the assault on him i learned moreover that my father had ordered out all the men of the tribe to hunt for me on the morrow and to kill me wherever they found me ah i thought you may hunt but you will bring nothing home to the pot just then a dog that was lying by the fire got up and began to sniff the air i could not see what dog it wasindeed i had forgotten all about the dogs when i drew near the kraal that is what comes of want of experience my father the dog sniffed and sniffed then he began to growl looking always my way and i grew afraid  what is the dog growling at said one man to another go and see but the other man was taking snuff and did not like to move let the dog go and see for himself he answered sneezing what is the good of keeping a dog if you have to catch the thief  go on then said the first man to the dog and he ran forward barking then i saw him it was my own dog koos a very good dog presently as i lay not knowing what to do he smelt my smell stopped barking and running round the bush he found me and began to lick my face be quiet koos i whispered to him and he lay down by my side  where has that dog gone now said the first man is he bewitched that he stops barking suddenly and does not come back  we will see said the other rising a spear in his hand  now once more i was terribly afraid for i thought that they would catch me or i must run for my life again but as i sprang up to run a big black snake glided between the men and went off towards the huts they jumped aside in a great fright then all of them turned to follow the snake saying that this was what the dog was barking at that was my good ehlose my father which without any doubt took the shape of a snake to save my life  when they had gone i crept off the other way and koos followed me at first i thought that i would kill him lest he should betray me but when i called to him to knock him on the head with my kerrie he sat down upon the ground wagging his tail and seemed to smile in my face and i could not do it so i thought that i would take my chance and we went on together this was my purpose first to creep into my own hut and get my assegais and a skin blanket then to gain speech with baleka my hut i thought would be empty for nobody sleeps there except myself and the huts of noma were some paces away to the right i came to the reed fence that surrounded the huts nobody was to be seen at the gate which was not shut with thorns as usual it was my duty to close it and i had not been there to do so then bidding the dog lie down outside i stepped through boldly reached the door of my hut and listened it was empty there was not even a breath to be heard so i crept in and began to search for my assegais my watergourd and my wood pillow which was so nicely carved that i did not like to leave it soon i found them then i felt about for my skin rug and as i did so my hand touched something cold i started and felt again it was a mans facethe face of a dead man of noma whom i had killed and who had been laid in my hut to await burial oh then i was frightened for noma dead and in the dark was worse than noma alive i made ready to fly when suddenly i heard the voices of women talking outside the door of the hut i knew the voices they were those of nomas two wives and one of them said she was coming in to watch by her husbands body now i was in a trap indeed for before i could do anything i saw the light go out of a hole in the hut and knew by the sound of a fat woman puffing as she bent herself up that nomas first wife was coming through it presently she was in and squatting by the side of the corpse in such a fashion that i could not get to the door she began to make lamentations and to call down curses on me ah she did not know that i was listening i too squatted by nomas head and grew quickwitted in my fear now that the woman was there i was not so much afraid of the dead man and i remembered too that he had been a great cheat so i thought i would make him cheat for the last time i placed my hands beneath his shoulders and pushed him up so that he sat upon the ground the woman heard the noise and made a sound in her throat  will you not be quiet you old hag i said in nomas voice can you not let me be at peace even now when i am dead  she heard and falling backwards in fear drew in her breath to shriek aloud  what will you also dare to shriek i said again in nomas voice then i must teach you silence and i tumbled him over on to the top of her  then her senses left her and whether she ever found them again i do not know at least she grew quiet for that time for me i snatched up the rugafterwards i found it was nomas best kaross made by basutos of chosen catskins and worth three oxenand i fled followed by koos  now the kraal of the chief my father makedama was two hundred paces away and i must go thither for there baleka slept also i dared not enter by the gate because a man was always on guard there so i cut my way through the reed fence with my assegai and crept to the hut where baleka was with some of her halfsisters i knew on which side of the hut it was her custom to lie and where her head would be so i lay down on my side and gently very gently began to bore a hole in the grass covering of the hut it took a long while for the thatch was thick but at last i was nearly through it then i stopped for it came into my mind that baleka might have changed her place and that i might wake the wrong girl i almost gave it over thinking that i would fly alone when suddenly i heard a girl wake and begin to cry on the other side of the thatch ah i thought that is baleka who weeps for her brother so i put my lips where the thatch was thinnest and whispered  baleka my sister baleka do not weep i mopo am here say not a word but rise come out of the hut bringing your skin blanket  now baleka was very clever she did not shriek as most girls would have done no she understood and after waiting awhile she rose and crept from the hut her blanket in her hand  why are you here mopo she whispered as we met surely you will be killed  hush i said and then i told her of the plan which i had made will you come with me i said when i had done or will you creep back into the hut and bid me farewell  she thought awhile then she said no my brother i will come for i love you alone among our people though i believe that this will be the end of itthat you will lead me to my death  i did not think much of her words at the time but afterwards they came back to me so we slipped away together followed by the dog koos and soon we were running over the veldt with our faces set towards the country of the zulu tribe    chapter iv the flight of mopo and baleka  all the rest of that night we journeyed till even the dog was tired then we hid in a mealie field for the day as we were afraid of being seen towards the afternoon we heard voices and looking through the stems of the mealies we saw a party of my fathers men pass searching for us they went on to a neighbouring kraal to ask if we had been seen and after that we saw them no more for awhile at night we travelled again but as fate would have it we were met by an old woman who looked oddly at us but said nothing after that we pushed on day and night for we knew that the old woman would tell the pursuers if she met them and so indeed it came about on the third evening we reached some mealie gardens and saw that they had been trampled down among the broken mealies we found the body of a very old man as full of assegai wounds as a porcupine with quills we wondered at this and went on a little way then we saw that the kraal to which the gardens belonged was burnt down we crept up to it andah it was a sad sight for us to see afterwards we became used to such sights all about us lay the bodies of dead people scores of themold men young men women children little babies at the breastthere they lay among the burnt huts pierced with assegai wounds red was the earth with their blood and red they looked in the red light of the setting sun it was as though all the land had been smeared with the bloody hand of the great spirit of the umkulunkulu baleka saw it and began to cry she was weary poor girl and we had found little to eat only grass and green corn  an enemy has been here i said and as i spoke i thought that i heard a groan from the other side of a broken reed hedge i went and looked there lay a young woman she was badly wounded but still alive my father a little way from her lay a man dead and before him several other men of another tribe he had died fighting in front of the woman were the bodies of three children another a little one lay on her body i looked at the woman and as i looked she groaned again opened her eyes and saw me and that i had a spear in my hand  kill me quickly she said have you not tortured me enough  i said that i was a stranger and did not want to kill her  then bring me water she said there is a spring there behind the kraal  i called to baleka to come to the woman and went with my gourd to the spring there were bodies in it but i dragged them out and when the water had cleared a little i filled the gourd and brought it back to the woman she drank deep and her strength came back a littlethe water gave her life  how did you come to this i asked  it was an impi of chaka chief of the zulus that ate us up she answered they burst upon as at dawn this morning while we were asleep in our huts yes i woke up to hear the sound of killing i was sleeping by my husband with him who lies there and the children we all ran out my husband had a spear and shield he was a brave man see he died bravely he killed three of the zulu devils before he himself was dead then they caught me and killed my children and stabbed me till they thought that i was dead afterwards they went away i dont know why they came but i think it was because our chief would not send men to help chaka against zweete  she stopped gave a great cry and died  my sister wept at the sight and i too was stirred by it ah i thought to myself the great spirit must be evil if he is not evil such things would not happen that is how i thought then my father now i think differently i know that we had not found out the path of the great spirit that is all i was a chicken in those days my father afterwards i got used to such sights they did not stir me any more not one whit but then in the days of chaka the rivers ran bloodyes we had to look at the water to see if it was clean before we drank people learned how to die then and not make a noise about it what does it matter they would have been dead now anyway it does not matter nothing matters except being born that is a mistake my father  we stopped at the kraal that night but we could not sleep for we heard the itongo the ghosts of the dead people moving about and calling to each other it was natural that they should do so men were looking for their wives and mothers for their children but we were afraid that they might be angry with us for being there so we clung together and trembled in each others arms koos also trembled and from time to time he howled loudly but they did not seem to see us and towards morning their cries grew fainter  when the first light came we rose and picked our way through the dead down to the plain now we had an easy road to follow to chakas kraal for there was the spoor of the impi and of the cattle which they had stolen and sometimes we came to the body of a warrior who had been killed because his wounds prevented him from marching farther but now i was doubtful whether it was wise for us to go to chaka for after what we had seen i grew afraid lest he should kill us still we had nowhere to turn so i said that we would walk along till something happened now we grew faint with hunger and weariness and baleka said that we had better sit down and die for then there would be no more trouble so we sat down by a spring but i did not wish to die yet though baleka was right and it would have been well to do so as we sat the dog koos went to a bush that was near and presently i heard him spring at something and the sound of struggling i ran to the bushhe had caught hold of a duiker buck as big as himself that was asleep in it then i drove my spear into the buck and shouted for joy for here was food when the buck was dead i skinned him and we took bits of the flesh washed them in the water and ate them for we had no fire to cook them with it is not nice to eat uncooked flesh but we were so hungry that we did not mind and the food refreshed us when we had eaten what we could we rose and washed ourselves at the spring but as we washed baleka looked up and gave a cry of fear for there on the crest of the hill about ten spearthrows away was a party of six armed men people of my own tribechildren of my father makedamawho still pursued us to take us or kill us they saw usthey raised a shout and began to run we too sprang up and ranran like bucks for fear had touched our feet  now the land lay thus before us the ground was open and sloped down to the banks of the white umfolozi which twisted through the plain like a great and shining snake on the other side the ground rose again and we did not know what was beyond but we thought that in this direction lay the kraal of chaka we ran for the riverwhere else were we to run and after us came the warriors they gained on us they were strong and they were angry because they had come so far run as we would still they gained now we neared the banks of the river it was full and wide above us the waters ran angrily breaking into swirls of white where they passed over sunken rocks below was a rapid in which none might live between the two a deep pool where the water was quiet but the stream strong  ah my brother what shall we do gasped baleka  there is this to choose i answered perish on the spears of our people or try the river  easier to die by water than on iron she answered  good i said now may our snakes look towards us and the spirits of our fathers be with us at the least we can swim and i led her to the head of the pool we threw away our blanketseverything except an assegai which i held in my teethand we plunged in wading as far as we could now we were up to our breasts now we had lost the earth and were swimming towards the middle of the river the dog koos leading the way  then it was that the soldiers appeared upon the bank ah little people one cried you swim do you well you will drown and if you do not drown we know a ford and we will catch you and kill youyes if we must run over the edge of the world after you we will catch you and he hurled an assegai after us which fell between us like a flash of light  while he spoke we swam hard and now we were in the current it swept us downwards but still we made way for we could swim well it was just this if we could reach the bank before we were swept into the rapids we were safe if not thengoodnight now we were near the other side but alas we were also near the lip of the foaming water we strained we struggled baleka was a brave girl and she swam bravely but the water pushed her down below me and i could do nothing to help her i got my foot upon the rock and looked round there she was and eight paces from her the broken water boiled i could not go back i was too weak and it seemed that she must perish but the dog koos saw he swam towards her barking then turned round heading for the shore she grasped him by the tail with her right hand then he put out his strengthhe was very strong she too struck out with her feet and left hand and slowlyvery slowlydrew near then i stretched out the handle of my assegai towards her she caught it with her left hand already her feet were over the brink of the rapids but i pulled and koos pulled and we brought her safe into the shallows and from the shallows to the bank and there she fell gasping  now when the soldiers on the other bank saw that we had crossed they shouted threats at us then ran away down the bank  arise baleka i said they have gone to see a ford  ah let me die she answered  but i forced her to rise and after awhile she got her breath again and we walked on as fast as we could up the long rise for two hours we walked or more till at last we came to the crest of the rise and there far away we saw a large kraal  keep heart i said see there is the kraal of chaka  yes brother she answered but what waits us there death is behind us and before uswe are in the middle of death  presently we came to a path that ran to the kraal from the ford of the umfolozi it was by it that the impi had travelled we followed the path till at last we were but half an hours journey from the kraal then we looked back and lo there behind us were the pursuersfive of themone had drowned in crossing the river  again we ran but now we were weak and they gained upon us then once more i thought of the dog he was fierce and would tear any one on whom i set him i called him and told him what to do though i knew that it would be his death he understood and flew towards the soldiers growling his hair standing up on his spine they tried to kill him with spears and kerries but he jumped round them biting at them and kept them back at last a man hit him and he sprang up and seized the man by the throat there he clung man and dog rolling over and over together till the end of it was that they both died ah he was a dog we do not see such dogs nowadays his father was a boer hound the first that came into the country that dog once killed a leopard all by himself well this was the end of koos  meanwhile we had been running now we were but three hundred paces from the gate of the kraal and there was something going on inside it that we could see from the noise and the dust the four soldiers leaving the dead dog and the dying man came after us swiftly i saw that they must catch us before we reached the gate for now baleka could go but slowly then a thought came into my head i had brought her here i would save her life if i could should she reach the kraal without me chaka would not kill a girl who was so young and fair  run on baleka run on i said dropping behind now she was almost blind with weariness and terror and not seeing my purpose staggered towards the gate of the kraal but i sat down on the veldt to get my breath again for i was about to fight four men till i was killed my heart beat and the blood drummed in my ears but when they drew near and i rosethe assegai in my handonce more the red cloth seemed to go up and down before my eyes and all fear left me  the men were running two and two with the length of a spear throw between them but of the first pair one was five or six paces in front of the other this man shouted out loud and charged me shield and spear up now i had no shieldnothing but the assegai but i was crafty and he was overbold on he came i stood waiting for him till he drew back the spear to stab me then suddenly i dropped to my knees and thrust upward with all my strength beneath the rim of his shield and he also thrust but over me his spear only cutting the flesh of my shouldersee here is its scar yes to this day and my assegai ah it went home it ran through and through his middle he rolled over and over on the plain the dust hid him only i was now weaponless for the haft of my spearit was but a light throwing assegaibroke in two leaving nothing but a little bit of stick in my hand and the other one was upon me then in the darkness i saw a light i fell on to my hands and knees and flung myself over sideways my body struck the legs of the man who was about to stab me lifting his feet from beneath him down he came heavily before he had touched the ground i was off it his spear had fallen from his hand i stooped seized it and as he rose i stabbed him through the back it was all done in the shake of a leaf my father in the shake of a leaf he also was dead then i ran for i had no stomach for the other two my valour was gone  about a hundred paces from me baleka was staggering along with her arms out like one who has drunk too much beer by the time i caught her she was some forty paces from the gate of the kraal but then her strength left her altogether yes there she fell senseless and i stood by her and there too i should have been killed had not this chanced since the other two men having stayed one instant by their dead fellows came on against me mad with rage for at that moment the gate of the kraal opened and through it ran a party of soldiers dragging a prisoner by the arms after them walked a great man who wore a leopard skin on his shoulders and was laughing and with him were five or six ringed councillors and after them again came a company of warriors  the soldiers saw that killing was going on and ran up just as the slayers reached us  who are you they cried who dare to kill at the gate of the elephants kraal here the elephant kills alone  we are of the children of makedama they answered and we follow these evildoers who have done wickedness and murder in our kraal see but now two of us are dead at their hands and others lie dead along the road suffer that we slay them  ask that of the elephant said the soldiers ask too that he suffer you should not be slain  just then the tall chief saw blood and heard words he stalked up and he was a great man to look at though still quite young in years for he was taller by a head than any round him and his chest was big as the chests of two his face was fierce and beautiful and when he grew angry his eye flashed like a smitten brand  who are these that dare to stir up dust at the gates of my kraal he asked frowning  o chaka o elephant answered the captain of the soldiers bending himself double before him the men say that these are evildoers and that they pursue them to kill them  good he answered let them slay the evildoers  o great chief thanks be to thee great chief said those men of my people who sought to kill us  i hear you he answered then spoke once more to the captain and when they have slain the evildoers let themselves be blinded and turned loose to seek their way home because they have dared to lift a spear within the zulu gates now praise on my children and he laughed while the soldiers murmured ou he is wise he is great his justice is bright and terrible like the sun  but the two men of my people cried out in fear for they did not seek such justice as this  cut out their tongues also said chaka what shall the land of the zulus suffer such a noise never lest the cattle miscarry to it ye black ones there lies the girl she is asleep and helpless kill her what you hesitate nay then if you will have time for thought i give it take these men smear them with honey and pin them over antheaps by tomorrows sun they will know their own minds but first kill these two hunted jackals and he pointed to baleka and myself they seem tired and doubtless they long for sleep  then for the first time i spoke for the soldiers drew near to slay us  o chaka i cried i am mopo and this is my sister baleka  i stopped and a great shout of laughter went up from all who stood round  very well mopo and thy sister baleka said chaka grimly goodmorning to you mopo and balekaalso goodnight  o chaka i broke in i am mopo son of makedama of the langeni tribe it was i who gave thee a gourd of water many years ago when we were both little then thou badest me come to thee when thou hadst grown great vowing that thou wouldst protect me and never do me harm so i have come bringing my sister with me and now i pray thee do not eat up the words of long ago  as i spoke chakas face changed and he listened earnestly as a man who holds his hand behind his ear those are no liars he said welcome mopo thou shalt be a dog in my hut and feed from my hand but of thy sister i said nothing why then should she not be slain when i swore vengeance against all thy tribe save thee alone  because she is too fair to slay o chief i answered boldly also because i love her and ask her life as a boon  turn the girl over said chaka and they did so showing her face  again thou speakest no lie son of makedama said the chief i grant thee the boon she also shall lie in my hut and be of the number of my sisters now tell me thy tale speaking only the truth  so i sat down and told him all nor did he grow weary of listening but when i had done he said but one thingthat he would that the dog koos had not been killed since if he had still been alive he would have set him on the hut of my father makedama and made him chief over the langeni  then he spoke to the captain of the soldiers i take back my words he said let not these men of the langeni be mutilated one shall die and the other shall go free here and he pointed to the man whom we had seen led out of the kraalgate here mopo we have a man who has proved himself a coward yesterday a kraal of wizards yonder was eaten up by my orderperhaps you two saw it as you travelled this man and three others attacked a soldier of that kraal who defended his wife and children the man fought wellhe slew three of my people then this dog was afraid to meet him face to face he killed him with a throwing assegai and afterwards he stabbed the woman that is nothing but he should have fought the husband hand to hand now i will do him honour he shall fight to the death with one of these pigs from thy sty and he pointed with his spear to the men of my fathers kraal and the one who survives shall be run down as they tried to run you down i will send back the other pig to the sty with a message choose children of makedama which of you will live  now the two men of my tribe were brothers and loved one another and each of them was willing to die that the other might go free therefore both of them stepped forward saying that they would fight the zulu  what is there honour among pigs said chaka then i will settle it see this assegai i throw it into the air if the blade falls uppermost the tall man shall go free if the shaft falls uppermost then life is to the short one so and he sent the little spear whirling round and round in the air every eye watched it as it wheeled and fell the haft struck the ground first  come hither thou said chaka to the tall brother hasten back to the kraal of makedama and say to him thus says chaka the lion of the zulukamalandela years ago thy tribe refused me milk today the dog of thy son mopo howls upon the roof of thy hut begone 1   1 among the zulus it is a very bad omen for a dog to climb the roof     of a hut the saying conveyed a threat to be appreciated by every     zulued  the man turned shook his brother by the hand and went bearing the words of evil omen  then chaka called to the zulu and the last of those who had followed us to kill us bidding them fight so when they had praised the prince they fought fiercely and the end of it was that the man of my people conquered the zulu but as soon as he had found his breath again he was set to run for his life and after him ran five chosen men  still it came about that he outran them doubling like a hare and got away safely nor was chaka angry at this for i think that he bade the men who hunted him to make speed slowly there was only one good thing in the cruel heart of chaka that he would always save the life of a brave man if he could do so without making his word nothing and for my part i was glad to think that the man of my people had conquered him who murdered the children of the dying woman that we found at the kraal beyond the river    chapter v mopo becomes the kings doctor  these then my father were the events that ended in the coming of me mopo and of my sister baleka to the kraal of chaka the lion of the zulu now you may ask why have i kept you so long with this tale which is as are other tales of our people but that shall be seen for from these matters as a tree from a seed grew the birth of umslopogaas bulalio umslopogaas the slaughterer and nada the beautiful of whose love my story has to tell for nada was my daughter and umslopogaas though few knew it was none other than the son of chaka born of my sister baleka  now when baleka recovered from the weariness of our flight and had her beauty again chaka took her to wife numbering her among his women whom he named his sisters and me chaka took to be one of his doctors of his izinyanga of medicine and he was so well pleased with my medicine that in the end i became his head doctor now this was a great post in which during the course of years i grew fat in cattle and in wives but also it was one of much danger for when i rose strong and well in the morning i could never know but that at night i should sleep stiff and red many were the doctors whom chaka slew doctored they never so well they were killed at last for a day would surely come when the king felt ill in his body or heavy in his mind and then to the assegai or the torment with the wizard who had doctored him yet i escaped because of the power of my medicine and also because of that oath which chaka had sworn to me as a child so it came about that where the king went there i went with him i slept near his hut i sat behind him at council in the battle i was ever at his side  ah the battle the battle in those days we knew how to fight my father in those days the vultures would follow our impis by thousands the hyenas would steal along our path in packs and none went empty away never may i forget the first fight i stood in at the side of chaka it was just after the king had built his great kraal on the south bank of the umhlatuze then it was that the chief zwide attacked his rival chaka for the third time and chaka moved out to meet him with ten full regiments 1 now for the first time armed with the short stabbingspear   1 about 30000 mened  the ground lay thus on a long low hill in front of our impi were massed the regiments of zwide there were seventeen of them the earth was black with their number their plumes filled the air like snow we too were on a hill and between us lay a valley down which there ran a little stream all night our fires shone out across the valley all night the songs of soldiers echoed down the hills then the grey dawning came the oxen lowed to the light the regiments arose from their bed of spears they sprang up and shook the dew from hair and shieldyes they arose the glad to die the impi assumed its array regiment by regiment there was the breast of spears there were the horns of spears they were numberless as the stars and like the stars they shone the morning breeze came up and fanned them their plumes bent in the breeze like a plain of seeding grass they bent the plumes of the soldiers ripe for the assegai up over the shoulder of the hill came the sun of slaughter it glowed red upon the red shields red grew the place of killing the white plumes of the chiefs were dipped in the blood of heaven they knew it they saw the omen of death and ah they laughed in the joy of the waking of battle what was death was it not well to die on the spear what was death was it not well to die for the king death was the arms of victory victory would be their bride that night and oh her breast is fair  hark the warsong the ingomo the music of which has the power to drive men mad rose far away to the left and was thrown along from regiment to regimenta rolling ball of sound  we are the kings kine bred to be butchered  you too are one of us we are the zulu children of the lion  what did you tremble  suddenly chaka was seen stalking through the ranks followed by his captains his indunas and by me he walked along like a great buck death was in his eyes and like a buck he sniffed the air scenting the air of slaughter he lifted his assegai and a silence fell only the sound of chanting still rolled along the hills  where are the children of zwide he shouted and his voice was like the voice of a bull  yonder father answered the regiments and every spear pointed across the valley  they do not come he shouted again shall we then sit here till we grow old  no father they answered begin begin  let the umkandhlu regiment come forward he shouted a third time and as he spoke the black shields of the umkandhlu leaped from the ranks of the impi  go my children cried chaka there is the foe go and return no more  we hear you father they answered with one voice and moved down the slope like a countless herd of game with horns of steel  now they crossed the stream and now zwide awoke a murmur went through his companies lines of light played above his spears  ou they are coming ou they have met hearken to the thunder of the shields hearken to the song of battle  to and fro they swing the umkandhlu gives wayit flies they pour back across the streamhalf of them the rest are dead a howl of rage goes up from the host only chaka smiles  open up open up he cries make room for the umkandhlu girls and with hanging heads they pass us  now he whispers a word to the indunas the indunas run they whisper to menziwa the general and to the captains then two regiments rush down the hill two more run to the right and yet another two to the left but chaka stays on the hill with the three that are left again comes the roar of the meeting shields ah these are men they fight they do not run regiment after regiment pours upon them but still they stand they fall by hundreds and by thousands but no man shows his back and on each man there lie two dead wow my father of those two regiments not one escaped they were but boys but they were the children of chaka menziwa was buried beneath the heaps of his warriors now there are no such men  they are all dead and quiet chaka still holds his hand he looks to the north and to the south see spears are shining among the trees now the horns of our host close upon the flanks of the foe they slay and are slain but the men of zwide are many and brave and the battle turns against us  then again chaka speaks a word the captains hear the soldiers stretch out their necks to listen  it has come at last charge children of the zulu  there is a roar a thunder of feet a flashing of spears a bending of plumes and like a river that has burnt its banks like stormclouds before the gale we sweep down upon friend and foe they form up to meet us the stream is passed our wounded rise upon their haunches and wave us on we trample them down what matter they can fight no more then we meet zwide rushing to greet us as bull meets bull ou my father i know no more everything grows red that fight that fight we swept them away when it was done there was nothing to be seen but the hillside was black and red few fled few were left to fly we passed over them like fire we ate them up presently we paused looking for the foe all were dead the host of zwide was no more then we mustered ten regiments had looked upon the morning sun three regiments saw the sun sink the rest had gone where no suns shine  such were our battles in the days of chaka  you ask of the umkandhlu regiment which fled i will tell you when we reached our kraal once more chaka summoned that regiment and mustered it he spoke to them gently gently he thanked them for their service he said it was natural that girls should faint at the sight of blood and turn to seek their kraals yet he had bid them come back no more and they had come back what then was there now left for him to do and he covered his face with his blanket then the soldiers killed them all nearly two thousand of themkilled them with taunts and jeers  that is how we dealt with cowards in those days my father after that one zulu was a match for five of any other tribe if ten came against him still he did not turn his back fight and fall but fly not that was our watchword never again while chaka lived did a conquered force pass the gates of the kings kraal  that fight was but one war out of many with every moon a fresh impi started to wash its spears and came back few and thin but with victory and countless cattle tribe after tribe went down before us those of them who escaped the assegai were enrolled into fresh regiments and thus though men died by thousands every month yet the army grew soon there were no other chiefs left umsuduka fell and after him mancengeza umzilikazi was driven north matiwane was stamped flat then we poured into this land of natal when we entered its people could not be numbered when we left here and there a man might be found in a hole in the earththat was all men women and children we wiped them out the land was clean of them next came the turn of ufaku chief of the amapondos ah where is ufaku now  and so it went on and on till even the zulus were weary of war and the sharpest assegais grew blunt    chapter vi the birth of umslopogaas  this was the rule of the life of chaka that he would have no children though he had many wives every child born to him by his sisters was put away at once  what mopo he said to me shall i rear up children to put me to the assegai when they grow great they call me tyrant say how do those chiefs die whom men name tyrants they die at the hands of those whom they have bred nay mopo i will rule for my life and when i join the spirits of my fathers let the strongest take my power and my place  now it chanced that shortly after chaka had spoken thus my sister baleka the kings wife fell in labour and on that same day my wife macropha was brought to bed of twins and this but eight days after my second wife anadi had given birth to a son you ask my father how i came to be married seeing that chaka forbade marriage to all his soldiers till they were in middle life and had put the mans ring upon their heads it was a boon he granted me as inyanga of medicine saying it was well that a doctor should know the sicknesses of women and learn how to cure their evil tempers as though my father that were possible  when the king heard that baleka was sick he did not kill her outright because he loved her a little but he sent for me commanding me to attend her and when the child was born to cause its body to be brought to him according to custom so that he might be sure that it was dead i bent to the earth before him and went to do his bidding with a heavy heart for was not baleka my sister and would not her child be of my own blood still it must be so for chakas whisper was as the shout of other kings and if we dared to disobey then our lives and the lives of all in our kraals would answer for it better that an infant should die than that we should become food for jackals presently i came to the emposeni the place of the kings wives and declared the kings word to the soldiers on guard they lowered their assegais and let me pass and i entered the hut of baleka in it were others of the kings wives but when they saw me they rose and went away for it was not lawful that they should stay where i was thus i was left alone with my sister  for awhile she lay silent and i did not speak though i saw by the heaving of her breast that she was weeping  hush little one i said at length your sorrow will soon be done  nay she answered lifting her head it will be but begun oh cruel man i know the reason of your coming you come to murder the babe that shall be born of me  it is the kings word woman  it is the kings word and what is the kings word have i then naught to say in this matter  it is the kings child woman  it is the kings child and it is not also my child must my babe be dragged from my breast and be strangled and by you mopo have i not loved you mopo did i not flee with you from our people and the vengeance of our father do you know that not two moons gone the king was wroth with you because he fell sick and would have caused you to be slain had i not pleaded for you and called his oath to mind and thus you pay me you come to kill my child my firstborn child  it is the kings word woman i answered sternly but my heart was split in two within me  then baleka said no more but turning her face to the wall of the hut she wept and groaned bitterly  now as she wept i heard a stir without the hut and the light in the doorway was darkened a woman entered alone i looked round to see who it was then fell upon the ground in salutation for before me was unandi mother of the king who was named mother of the heavens that same lady to whom my mother had refused the milk  hail mother of the heavens i said  greeting mopo she answered say why does baleka weep is it because the sorrow of women is upon her  ask of her great chieftainess i said  then baleka spoke i weep mother of a king because this man who is my brother has come from him who is my lord and thy son to murder that which shall be born of me o thou whose breasts have given suck plead for me thy son was not slain at birth  perhaps it were well if he had been so slain baleka said unandi then had many another man lived to look upon the sun who is now dead  at the least as an infant he was good and gentle and thou mightest love him mother of the zulu  never baleka as a babe he bit my breast and tore my hair as the man is so was the babe  yet may his child be otherwise mother of the heavens think thou hast no grandson to comfort thee in thy age wilt thou then see all thy stock wither the king our lord lives in war he too may die and what then  then the root of senzangacona is still green has the king no brothers  they are not of they flesh mother what thou dost not hearken then as a woman to woman i plead with thee save my child or slay me with my child  now the heart of unandi grew gentle and she was moved to tears  how may this be done mopo she said the king must see the dead infant and if he suspect and even reeds have ears you know the heart of chaka and where we shall lie tomorrow  are there then no other newborn babes in zululand said baleka sitting up and speaking in a whisper like the hiss of a snake listen mopo is not your wife also in labour now hear me mother of the heavens and my brother hear me also do not think to play with me in this matter i will save my child or you twain will perish with it for i will tell the king that you came to me the two of you and whispered plots into my earplots to save the child and kill the king now choose and swiftly  she sank bank there was silence and we looked one upon another then unandi spoke  give me your hand mopo and swear that you will be faithful to me in this secret as i swear to you a day may come when this child who has not seen the light rules as king in zululand and then in reward you shall be the greatest of the people the kings voice whisperer in the kings ear but if you break your oath then beware for i shall not die alone  i swear mother of the heavens i answered  it is well son of makedama  it is well my brother said baleka now go and do that which must be done swiftly for my sorrow is upon me go knowing that if you fail i will be pitiless for i will bring you to your death yes even if my own death is the price  so i went whither to you go asked the guard at the gate  i go to bring my medicines men of the king i answered  so i said but oh my heart was heavy and this was my planto fly far from zululand i could not and i dared not do this thing what should i kill my own child that its life might be given for the life of the babe of baleka and should i lift up my will against the will of the king saving the child to look upon the sun which he had doomed to darkness nay i would fly leaving all and seek out some far tribe where i might begin to live again here i could not live here in the shadow of chaka was nothing but death  i reached my own huts there to find that my wife macropha was delivered of twins i sent away all in the hut except my other wife anadi she who eight days gone had born me a son the second of the twins was born it was a boy born dead the first was a girl she who lived to be nada the beautiful nada the lily then a thought came into my heart here was a path to run on  give me the boy i said to anadi he is not dead give him to me that i may take him outside the kraal and wake him to life by my medicine  it is of no usethe child is dead said anadi  give him to me woman i said fiercely and she gave me the body  then i took him and wrapped him up in my bundle of medicines and outside of all i rolled a mat of plaited grass  suffer none to enter the hut till i return i said and speak no word of the child that seems to be dead if you allow any to enter or if you speak a word then my medicine will not work and the babe will be dead indeed  so i went leaving the women wondering for it is not our custom to save both when twins are born but i ran swiftly to the gates of the emposeni  i bring the medicines men of the king i said to the guards  pass in they answered  i passed through the gates and into the hut of baleka unandi was alone in the hut with my sister  the child is born said the mother of the king look at him mopo son of makedama  i looked he was a great child with large black eyes like the eyes of chaka the king and unandi too looked at me where is it she whispered  i loosed the mat and drew the dead child from the medicines glancing round fearfully as i did so  give me the living babe i whispered back  they gave it to me and i took of a drug that i knew and rubbed it on the tongue of the child now this drug has the power to make the tongue it touches dumb for awhile then i wrapped up the child in my medicines and again bound the mat about the bundle but round the throat of the stillborn babe i tied a string of fibre as though i had strangled it and wrapped it loosely in a piece of matting  now for the first time i spoke to baleka woman i said and thou also mother of the heavens i have done your wish but know that before all is finished this deed shall bring about the death of many be secret as the grave for the grave yawns for you both  i went again bearing the mat containing the dead child in my right hand but the bundle of medicines that held the living one i fastened across my shoulders i passed out of the emposeni and as i went i held up the bundle in my right hand to the guards showing them that which was in it but saying nothing  it is good they said nodding  but now illfortune found me for just outside the emposeni i met three of the kings messengers  greeting son of makedama they said the king summons you to the intunkuluthat is the royal house my father  good i answered i will come now but first i would run to my own place to see how it goes with macropha my wife here is that which the king seeks and i showed them the dead child take it to him if you will  that is not the kings command mopo they answered his word is that you should stand before him at once  now my heart turned to water in my breast kings have many ears could he have heard and how dared i go before the lion bearing his living child hidden on my back yet to waver was to be lost to show fear was to be lost to disobey was to be lost  good i come i answered and we walked to the gate of the intunkulu  it was sundown chaka was sitting in the little courtyard in front of his hut i went down on my knees before him and gave the royal salute bayete and so i stayed  rise son of makedama he said  i cannot rise lion of the zulu i answered i cannot rise having royal blood on my hands till the king has pardoned me  where is it he asked  i pointed to the mat in my hand  let me look at it  then i undid the mat and he looked on the child and laughed aloud  he might have been a king he said as he bade a councillor take it away mopo thou hast slain one who might have been a king art thou not afraid  no black one i answered the child is killed by order of one who is a king  sit down and let us talk said chaka for his mood was idle tomorrow thou shalt have five oxen for this deed thou shalt choose them from the royal herd  the king is good he sees that my belt is drawn tight he satisfies my hunger will the king suffer that i go my wife is in labour and i would visit her  nay stay awhile say how it is with baleka my sister and thine  it is well  did she weep when you took the babe from her  nay she wept not she said my lords will is my will  good had she wept she had been slain also who was with her  the mother of the heavens  the brow of chaka darkened unandi my mother what did she there by myself i swear though she is my motherif i thoughtand he ceased  there was a silence then he spoke again say what is in that mat and he pointed with his little assegai at the bundle on my shoulders  medicine king  thou dost carry enough to doctor an impi undo the mat and let me look at it  now my father i tell you that the marrow melted in my bones with terror for if i undid the mat i feared he must see the child and then  it is tagati it is bewitched o king it is not wise to look on medicine  open he answered angrily what may i not look at that which i am forced to swallowi who am the first of doctors  death is the kings medicine i answered lifting the bundle and laying it as far from him in the shadow of the fence as i dared then i bent over it slowly undoing the rimpis with which it was tied while the sweat of terror ran down by face blinding me like tears what would i do if he saw the child what if the child awoke and cried i would snatch the assegai from his hand and stab him yes i would kill the king and then kill myself now the mat was unrolled inside were the brown leaves and roots of medicine beneath them was the senseless bade wrapped in dead moss  ugly stuff said the king taking snuff now see mopo what a good aim i have this for thy medicine and he lifted his assegai to throw it through the bundle but as he threw my snake put it into the kings heart to sneeze and thus it came to pass that the assegai only pierced the outer leaves of the medicine and did not touch the child  may the heavens bless the king i said according to custom  thanks to thee mopo it is a good omen he answered and now begone take my advice kill thy children as i kill mine lest they live to worry thee the whelps of lions are best drowned  i did up the bundle fastfast though my hands trembled oh what if the child should wake and cry it was done i rose and saluted the king then i doubled myself up and passed from before him scarcely was i outside the gates of the intunkulu when the infant began to squeak in the bundle if it had been one minute before  what said a soldier as i passed have you got a puppy hidden under your moocha 1 mopo   1 girdle composed of skin and tails of oxened  i made no answer but hurried on till i came to my huts i entered there were my two wives alone  i have recovered the child women i said as i undid the bundle  anadi took him and looked at him  the boy seems bigger than he was she said  the breath of life has come into him and puffed him out i answered  his eyes are not as his eyes were she said again now they are big and black like the eyes of the king  my spirit looked upon his eyes and made them beautiful i answered  this child has a birthmark on his thigh she said a third time that which i gave you had no mark  i laid my medicine there i answered  it is not the same child she said sullenly it is a changeling who will lay illluck at our doors  then i rose up in my rage and cursed her heavily for i saw that if she was not stopped this womans tongue would bring us all to ruin  peace witch i cried how dare you to speak thus from a lying heart do you wish to draw down a curse upon our roof would you make us all food for the kings spear say such words again and you shall sit within the circlethe ingomboco shall know you for a witch  so i stormed on threatening to bring her to death till at length she grew fearful and fell at my feet praying for mercy and forgiveness but i was much afraid because of this womans tongue and not without reason    chapter vii umslopogaas answers the king  now the years went on and this matter slept nothing more was heard of it but still it only slept and my father i feared greatly for the hour when it should awake for the secret was known by two womenunandi mother of the heavens and baleka my sister wife of the king and by two moremacropha and anadi my wivesit was guessed at how then should it remain a secret forever moreover it came about that unandi and baleka could not restrain their fondness for this child who was called my son and named umslopogaas but who was the son of chaka the king and of baleka and the grandson of unandi so it happened that very often one or the other of them would come into my hut making pretence to visit my wives and take the boy upon her lap and fondle it in vain did i pray them to forbear love pulled at their heartstrings more heavily than my words and still they came this was the end of itthat chaka saw the child sitting on the knee of unandi his mother  what does my mother with that brat of thine mopo he asked of me cannot she kiss me if she will find a child to kiss and he laughed like a wolf  i said that i did not know and the matter passed over for awhile but after that chaka caused his mother to be watched now the boy umslopogaas grew great and strong there was no such lad of his years for a days journey round but from a babe he was somewhat surly of few words and like his father chaka afraid of nothing in all the world there were but two people whom he lovedthese were i mopo who was called his father and nada she who was said to be his twin sister  now it must be told of nada that as the boy umslopogaas was the strongest and bravest of children so the girl nada was the gentlest and most fair of a truth my father i believe that her blood was not all zulu though this i cannot say for certain at the least her eyes were softer and larger than those of our people her hair longer and less tightly curled and her skin was lightermore of the colour of pure copper these things she had from her mother macropha though she was fairer than macrophafairer indeed than any woman of my people whom i have seen her mother macropha my wife was of swazi blood and was brought to the kings kraal with other captives after a raid and given to me as a wife by the king it was said that she was the daughter of a swazi headman of the tribe of the halakazi and that she was born of his wife is true but whether he was her father i do not know for i have heard from the lips of macropha herself that before she was born there was a white man staying at her fathers kraal he was a portuguese from the coast a handsome man and skilled in the working of iron this white man loved the mother of my wife macropha and some held that macropha was his daughter and not that of the swazi headman at least i know this that before my wifes birth the swazi killed the white man but none can tell the truth of these matters and i only speak of them because the beauty of nada was rather as is the beauty of the white people than of ours and this might well happen if her grandfather chanced to be a white man  now umslopogaas and nada were always together together they ate together they slept and wandered they thought one thought and spoke with one tongue ou it was pretty to see them twice while they were still children did umslopogaas save the life of nada  the first time it came about thus the two children had wandered far from the kraal seeking certain berries that little ones love on they wandered and on singing as they went till at length they found the berries and ate heartily then it was near sundown and when they had eaten they fell asleep in the night they woke to find a great wind blowing and a cold rain falling on them for it was the beginning of winter when fruits are ripe  up nada said umslopogaas we must seek the kraal or the cold will kill us  so nada rose frightened and hand in hand they stumbled through the darkness but in the wind and the night they lost their path and when at length the dawn came they were in a forest that was strange to them they rested awhile and finding berries ate them then walked again all that day they wandered till at last the night came down and they plucked branches of trees and piled the branches over them for warmth and they were so weary that they fell asleep in each others arms at dawn they rose but now they were very tired and berries were few so that by midday they were spent then they lay down on the side of a steep hill and nada laid her head upon the breast of umslopogaas  here let us die my brother she said  but even then the boy had a great spirit and he answered time to die sister when death chooses us see now do you rest here and i will climb the hill and look across the forest  so he left her and climbed the hill and on its side he found many berries and a root that is good for food and filled himself with them at length he came to the crest of the hill and looked out across the sea of green lo there far away to the east he saw a line of white that lay like smoke against the black surface of a cliff and knew it for the waterfall beyond the royal town then he came down the hill shouting for joy and bearing roots and berries in his hand but when he reached the spot where nada was he found that her senses had left her through hunger cold and weariness she lay upon the ground like one asleep and over her stood a jackal that fled as he drew nigh now it would seem that there were but two shoots to the stick of umslopogaas one was to save himself and the other to lie down and die by nada yet he found a third for undoing the strips of his moocha he made ropes of them and with the ropes he bound nada on his back and started for the kings kraal he could never have reached it for the way was long yet at evening some messengers running through the forest came upon a naked lad with a girl bound to his back and a staff in his hand who staggered along slowly with starting eyes and foam upon his lips he could not speak he was so weary and the ropes had cut through the skin of his shoulders yet one of the messengers knew him for umslopogaas the son of mopo and they bore him to the kraal they would have left the girl nada thinking her dead but he pointed to her breast and feeling it they found that her heart still beat so they brought her also and the end of it was that both recovered and loved each other more than ever before  now after this i mopo bade umslopogaas stay at home within the kraal and not lead his sister to the wilds but the boy loved roaming like a fox and where he went there nada followed so it came about that one day they slipped from the kraal when the gates were open and sought out a certain deep glen which had an evil name for it was said that spirits haunted it and put those to death who entered there whether this was true i do not know but i know that in the glen dwelt a certain woman of the woods who had her habitation in a cave and lived upon what she could kill or steal or dig up with her hands now this woman was mad for it had chanced that her husband had been smelt out by the witchdoctors as a worker of magic against the king and slain then chaka according to custom despatched the slayers to eat up his kraal and they came to the kraal and killed his people last of all they killed his children three young girls and would have assegaied their mother when suddenly a spirit entered into her at the sight and she went mad so that they let her go being afraid to touch her afterwards so she fled and took up her abode in the haunted glen and this was the nature of her madness that whenever she saw children and more especially girl children a longing came upon her to kill them as her own had been killed this indeed she did often for when the moon was full and her madness at its highest she would travel far to find children snatching them away from the kraals like a hyena still none would touch her because of the spirit in her not even those whose children she had murdered  so umslopogaas and nada came to the glen where the childslayer lived and sat down by a pool of water not far from the mouth of her cave weaving flowers into a garland presently umslopogaas left nada to search for rock lilies which she loved as he went he called back to her and his voice awoke the woman who was sleeping in her cave for she came out by night only like a jackal then the woman stepped forth smelling blood and having a spear in her hand presently she saw nada seated upon the grass weaving flowers and crept towards her to kill her now as she cameso the child told mesuddenly a cold wind seemed to breathe upon nada and fear took hold of her though she did not see the woman who would murder her she let fall the flowers and looked before her into the pool and there mirrored in the pool she saw the greedy face of the childslayer who crept down upon her from above her hair hanging about her brow and her eyes shining like the eyes of a lion  then with a cry nada sprang up and fled along the path which umslopogaas had taken and after her leapt and ran the mad woman umslopogaas heard her cry he turned and rushed back over the brow of the hill and lo there before him was the murderess already she had grasped nada by the hair already her spear was lifted to pierce her umslopogaas had no spear he had nothing but a little stick without a knob yet with it he rushed at the mad woman and struck her so smartly on the arm that she let go of the girl and turned on him with a yell then lifting her spear she struck at him but he leapt aside again she struck but he sprang into the air and the spear passed beneath him a third time the woman struck and though he fell to earth to avoid the blow yet the assegai pierced his shoulder but the weight of his body as he fell twisted it from her hand and before she could grasp him he was up and beyond her reach the spear still fast in his shoulder  then the woman turned screaming with rage and madness and ran at nada to kill her with her hands but umslopogaas set his teeth and drawing the spear from his wound charged her shouting she lifted a great stone and hurled it at himso hard that it flew into fragments against another stone which it struck yet he charged on and smote at her so truly that he drove the spear through her and she fell down dead after that nada bound up his wound which was deep and with much pain he reached the kings kraal and told me this story  now there were some who cried that the boy must be put to death because he had killed one possessed with a spirit but i said no he should not be touched he had killed the woman in defence of his own life and the life of his sister and every one had a right to slay in selfdefence except as against the king or those who did the kings bidding moreover i said if the woman had a spirit it was an evil one for no good spirit would ask the lives of children but rather those of cattle for it is against our custom to sacrifice human beings to the amatonga even in war though the basuta dogs do so still the tumult grew for the witchdoctors were set upon the boys death saying that evil would come of it if he was allowed to live having killed one inspired and at last the matter came to the ears of the king then chaka summoned me and the boy before him and he also summoned the witchdoctors  first the witchdoctors set out their case demanding the death of umslopogaas chaka asked them what would happen if the boy was not killed they answered that the spirit of the dead woman would lead him to bring evil on the royal house chaka asked if he would bring evil on him the king they in turn asked the spirits and answered no not on him but on one of the royal house who should be after him chaka said that he cared nothing what happened to those who came after him or whether good or evil befell them then he spoke to umslopogaas who looked him boldly in the face as an equal looks at an equal  boy he said what hast thou to say as to why thou shouldst not be killed as these men demand  this black one answered umslopogaas that i stabbed the woman in defence of my own life  that is nothing said chaka if i the king wished to kill thee mightest thou therefore kill me or those whom i sent the itongo in the woman was a spirit king and ordered her to kill thee thou shouldst then have let thyself be killed hast thou no other reason  this elephant answered umslopogaas the woman would have murdered my sister whom i love better than my life  that is nothing said chaka if i ordered thee to be killed for any cause should i not also order all within thy gates to be killed with thee may not then a spirit king do likewise if thou hast nothing more to say thou must die  now i grew afraid for i feared lest chaka should slay him who was called my son because of the word of the doctors but the boy umslopogaas looked up and answered boldly not as one who pleads for his life but as one who demands a right  i have this to say eaterup of enemies and if it is not enough let us stop talking and let me be killed thou o king didst command that this woman should be slain those whom thou didst send to destroy her spared her because they thought her mad i have carried out the commandment of the king i have slain her mad or sane whom the king commanded should be killed and i have earned not death but a reward  well said umslopogaas answered chaka let ten head of cattle be given to this boy with the heart of a man his father shall guard them for him art thou satisfied now umslopogaas  i take that which is due to me and i thank the king because he need not pay unless he will umslopogaas answered  chaka stared awhile began to grow angry then burst out laughing  why this calf is such another one as was dropped long ago in the kraal of senzangacona he said as i was so is this boy go on lad in that path and thou mayst find those who shall cry the royal salute of bayete to thee at the end of it only keep out of my way for two of a kind might not agree now begone  so we went out but as we passed them i saw the doctors muttering together for they were illpleased and foreboded evil also they were jealous of me and wished to smite me through the heart of him who was called my son    chapter viii the great ingomboco  after this there was quiet until the feast of the firstfruits was ended but few people were killed at this feast though there was a great ingomboco or witchhunt and many were smelt out by the witchdoctors as working magic against the king now things had come to this pass in zululandthat the whole people cowered before the witchdoctors no man might sleep safe for none knew but that on the morrow he would be touched by the wand of an isanusi as we name a finder of witches and led away to his death for awhile chaka said nothing and so long as the doctors smelt out those only whom he wished to get rid ofand they were manyhe was well pleased but when they began to work for their own ends and to do those to death whom he did not desire to kill he grew angry yet the custom of the land was that he whom the witchdoctor touched must die he and all his house therefore the king was in a cleft stick for he scarcely dared to save even those whom he loved one night i came to doctor him for he was sick in his mind on that very day there had been an ingomboco and five of the bravest captains of the army had been smelt out by the abangoma the witchfinders together with many others all had been destroyed and men had been sent to kill the wives and children of the dead now chaka was very angry at this slaying and opened his heart to me  the witchdoctors rule in zululand and not i mopo son of makedama he said to me where then is it to end shall i myself be smelt out and slain these isanusis are too strong for me they lie upon the land like the shadow of night tell me how may i be free of them  those who walk the bridge of spears o king fall off into nowhere i answered darkly even witchdoctors cannot keep a footing on that bridge has not a witchdoctor a heart that can cease to beat has he not blood that can be made to flow  chaka looked at me strangely thou art a bold man who darest to speak thus to me mopo he said dost thou not know that it is sacrilege to touch an isanusi  i speak that which is in the kings mind i answered hearken o king it is indeed sacrilege to touch a true isanusi but what if the isanusi be a liar what if he smell out falsely bringing those to death who are innocent of evil is it then sacrilege to bring him to that end which he has given to many another say o king  good words answered chaka now tell me son of makedama how may this matter be put to proof  then i leaned forward whispering into the ear of the black one and he nodded heavily  thus i spoke then because i too saw the evil of the isanusis i who knew their secrets also i feared for my own life and for the lives of all those who were dear to me for they hated me as one instructed in their magic one who had the seeing eye and the hearing ear  one morning thereafter a new thing came to pass in the royal kraal for the king himself ran out crying aloud to all people to come and see the evil that had been worked upon him by a wizard they came together and saw this on the doorposts of the gateway of the intunkulu the house of the king were great smears of blood the knees of men strong in the battle trembled when they saw it women wailed aloud as they wail over the dead they wailed because of the horror of the omen  who has done this thing cried chaka in a terrible voice who has dared to bewitch the king and to strike blood upon his house  there was no answer and chaka spoke again this is no little matter he said to be washed away with the blood of one or two and be forgotten the man who wrought it shall not die alone or travel with a few to the world of spirits all his tribe shall go with him down to the baby in his hut and cattle in his kraal let messengers go out east and west and north and south and summon the witchdoctors from every quarter let them summon the captains from every regiment and the headmen from every kraal on the tenth day from now the circle of the ingomboco must be set and there shall be such a smelling out of wizards and of witches as has not been known in zululand  so the messengers went out to do the bidding of the king taking the names of those who should be summoned from the lips of the indunas and day by day people flocked up to the gates of the royal kraal and creeping on their knees before the majesty of the king praised him aloud but he vouchsafed an answer to none one noble only he caused to be killed because he carried in his hand a stick of the royal red wood which chaka himself had given him in bygone years 1   1 this beautiful wood is known in natal as red ivoryed  on the last night before the forming of the ingomboco the witchdoctors male and female entered the kraal there were a hundred and a half of them and they were made hideous and terrible with the white bones of men with bladders of fish and of oxen with fat of wizards and with skins of snakes they walked in silence till they came in front of the intunkulu the royal house then they stopped and sang this song for the king to hear      we have come o king we have come from the caves and the rocks             and the swamps       to wash in the blood of the slain     we have gathered our host from the air as vultures are gathered in             war       when they scent the blood of the slain      we come not alone o king with each wise one there passes a             ghost       who hisses the name of the doomed     we come not alone for we are the sons and indunas of death       and he guides our feet to the doomed      red rises the moon oer the plain red sinks the sun in the west       look wizards and bid them farewell     we count you by hundreds you who cried for a curse on the king       ha soon shall we bid you farewell  then they were silent and went in silence to the place appointed for them there to pass the night in mutterings and magic but those who were gathered together shivered with fear when they heard their words for they knew well that many a man would be switched with the gnus tail before the sun sank once more and i too trembled for my heart was full of fear ah my father those were evil days to live in when chaka ruled and death met us at every turn then no man might call his life his own or that of his wife or child or anything all were the kings and what war spared that the witchdoctors took  the morning dawned heavily and before it was well light the heralds were out summoning all to the kings ingomboco men came by hundreds carrying short sticks onlyfor to be seen armed was deathand seated themselves in the great circle before the gates of the royal house oh their looks were sad and they had little stomach for eating that morning they who were food for death they seated themselves then round them on the outside of the circle gathered knots of warriors chosen men great and fierce armed with kerries only these were the slayers  when all was ready the king came out followed by his indunas and by me as he appeared wrapped in the kaross of tigerskins and towering a head higher than any man there all the multitudeand it was many as the game on the hillscast themselves to earth and from every lip sharp and sudden went up the royal salute of bayete but chaka took no note his brow was cloudy as a mountaintop he cast one glance at the people and one at the slayers and wherever his eye fell men turned grey with fear then he stalked on and sat himself upon a stool to the north of the great ring looking toward the open space  for awhile there was silence then from the gates of the womens quarters came a band of maidens arrayed in their beaded dancingdresses and carrying green branches in their hands as they came they clapped their hands and sang softly      we are the heralds of the kings feast ai ai       vultures shall eat it ah ah     it is goodit is good to die for the king  they ceased and ranged themselves in a body behind us then chaka held up his hand and there was a patter of running feet presently from behind the royal huts appeared the great company of the abangoma the witchdoctorsmen to the right and women to the left in the left hand of each was the tail of a vilderbeeste in the right a bundle of assegais and a little shield they were awful to see and the bones about them rattled as they ran the bladders and the snakeskins floated in the air behind them their faces shone with the fat of anointing their eyes started like the eyes of fishes and their lips twitched hungrily as they glared round the deathring ha ha little did those evil children guess who should be the slayers and who should be the slain before that sun sank  on they came like a grey company of the dead on they came in silence broken only by the patter of their feet and the dry rattling of their bony necklets till they stood in long ranks before the black one awhile they stood thus then suddenly every one of them thrust forward the little shield in his hand and with a single voice they cried hail father  hail my children answered chaka  what seekest thou father they cried again blood  the blood of the guilty he answered  they turned and spoke each to each the company of the men spoke to the company of the women  the lion of the zulu seeks blood  he shall be fed screamed the women  the lion of the zulu smells blood  he shall see it screamed the women  his eyes search out the wizards  he shall count their dead screamed the women  peace cried chaka waste not the hours in talk but to the work hearken wizards have bewitched me wizards have dared to smite blood upon the gateways of the king dig in the burrows of the earth and find them ye rats fly through the paths of the air and find them ye vultures smell at the gates of the people and name them ye jackals ye hunters in the night drag them from the caves if they be hidden from the distance if they be fled from the graves if they be dead to the work to the work show them to me truly and your gifts shall be great and for them if they be a nation they shall be slain now begin begin by companies of ten for you are many and all must be finished ere the sun sink  it shall be finished father they answered  then ten of the women stood forward and at their head was the most famous witchdoctress of that dayan aged woman named nobela a woman to whose eyes the darkness was no evil whose scent was keen as a dogs who heard the voices of the dead as they cried in the night and spoke truly of what she heard all the other isanusis male and female sat down in a halfmoon facing the king but this woman drew forward and with her came nine of her sisterhood they turned east and west north and south searching the heavens they turned east and west north and south searching the earth they turned east and west north and south searching the hearts of men then they crept round and round the great ring like cats then they threw themselves upon the earth and smelt it and all the time there was silence silence deep as midnight and in it men hearkened to the beating of their hearts only now and again the vultures shrieked in the trees  at length nobela spoke  do you smell him sisters  we smell him they answered  does he sit in the east sisters  he sits in the east they answered  is he the son of a stranger sisters  he is the son of a stranger  then they crept nearer crept on their hands and knees till they were within ten paces of where i sat among the indunas near to the king the indunas looked on each other and grew grey with fear and for me my father my knees were loosened and my marrow turned to water in my bones for i knew well who was that son of a stranger of whom they spoke it was i my father i who was about to be smelt out and if i was smelt out i should be killed with all my house for the kings oath would scarcely avail me against the witchdoctors i looked at the fierce faces of the isanusis before me as they crept crept like snakes i glanced behind and saw the slayers grasping their kerries for the deed of death and i say i felt like one for whom the bitterness is overpast then i remembered the words which the king and i had whispered together of the cause for which this ingomboco was set and hope crept back to me like the first gleam of the dawn upon a stormy night still i did not hope overmuch for it well might happen that the king had but set a trap to catch me  now they were quite near and halted  have we dreamed falsely sisters asked nobela the aged  what we dreamed in the night we see in the day they answered  shall i whisper his name in your ears sisters  they lifted their heads from the ground like snakes and nodded and as they nodded the necklets of bones rattled on their skinny necks then they drew their heads to a circle and nobela thrust hers into the centre of the circle and said a word  ha ha they laughed we hear you his is the name let him be named by it in the face of heaven him and all his house then let him hear no other name forever  and suddenly they sprang up and rushed towards me nobela the aged isanusi at their head they leaped at me pointing to me with the tails of the vilderbeestes in their hands then nobela switched me in the face with the tail of the beast and cried aloud  greeting mopo son of makedama thou art the man who smotest blood on the doorposts of the king to bewitch the king let thy house be stamped flat  i saw her come i felt the blow on my face as a man feels in a dream i heard the feet of the slayers as they bounded forward to hale me to the dreadful death but my tongue clave to the roof of my mouthi could not say a word i glanced at the king and as i did so i thought that i heard him mutter near the mark not in it  then he held up his spear and all was silence the slayers stopped in their stride the witchdoctors stood with outstretched arms the world of men was as though it had been frozen into sleep  hold he said stand aside son of makedama who art named an evildoer stand aside thou nobela and those with thee who have named him evildoer what shall i be satisfied with the life of one dog smell on ye vultures company by company smell on for the day the labour at night the feast  so i rose astonished and stood on one side the witchdoctresses also stood on one side wonderstruck since no such smelling out as this had been seen in the land for till this hour when a man was swept with the gnus tail of the isanusi that was the instant of his death why then men asked in their hearts was the death delayed the witchdoctors asked it also and looked to the king for light as men look to a thundercloud for the flash but from the black one there came no word  so we stood on one side and a second party of the isanusi women began their rites as the others had done so they did and yet they worked otherwise for this is the fashion of the isanusis that no two of them smell out in the same way and this party swept the faces of certain of the kings councillors naming them guilty of the witchwork  stand ye on one side said the king to those who had been smelt out and ye who have hunted out their wickedness stand ye with those who named mopo son of makedama it well may be that all are guilty  so these stood on one side also and a third party took up the tale and they named certain of the great generals and were in turn bidden to stand on one side together with those whom they had named  so it went on through all the day company by company the women doomed their victims till there were no more left in their number and were commanded to stand aside together with those whom they had doomed then the male isanusis began and i could see well that by this time their hearts were fearful for they smelt a snare yet the kings bidding must be done and though their magic failed them here victims must be found so they smelt out this man and that man till we were a great company of the doomed who sat in silence on the ground looking at each other with sad eyes and watching the sun which we deemed our last climb slowly down the sky and ever as the day waned those who were left untried of the witchdoctors grew madder and more fierce they leaped into the air they ground their teeth and rolled upon the ground they drew forth snakes and devoured them alive they shrieked out to the spirits and called upon the names of ancient kings  at length it drew on to evening and the last company of the witchdoctors did their work smelling out some of the keepers of the emposeni the house of the women but there was one man of their company a young man and a tall who held back and took no share in the work but stood by himself in the centre of the great circle fixing his eyes on the heavens  and when this company had been ordered to stand aside also together with those whom they had smelt out the king called aloud to the last of the witchdoctors asking him of his name and tribe and why he alone did not do his office  my name is indabazimbi the son of arpi o king he answered and i am of the tribe of the maquilisini does the king bid me to smell out him of whom the spirits have spoken to me as the worker of this deed  i bid thee said the king  then the young man indabazimbi stepped straight forward across the ring making no cries or gestures but as one who walks from his gate to the cattle kraal and suddenly he struck the king in the face with the tail in his hand saying i smell out the heavens above me 2   2 a zulu title for the kinged  now a great gasp of wonder went up from the multitude and all looked to see this fool killed by torture but chaka rose and laughed aloud  thou hast said it he cried and thou alone listen ye people i did the deed i smote blood upon the gateways of my kraal with my own hand i smote it that i might learn who were the true doctors and who were the false now it seems that in the land of the zulu there is one true doctorthis young manand of the false look at them and count them they are like the leaves see there they stand and by them stand those whom they have doomedthe innocent whom with their wives and children they have doomed to the death of the dog now i ask you my people what reward shall be given to them  then a great roar went up from all the multitude let them die o king  ay he answered let them die as liars should  now the isanusis men and women screamed aloud in fear and cried for mercy tearing themselves with their nails for least of all things did they desire to taste of their own medicine of death but the king only laughed the more  hearken ye he said pointing to the crowd of us who had been smelt out ye were doomed to death by these false prophets now glut yourselves upon them slay them my children slay them all wipe them away stamp them outall all save this young man  then we bounded from the ground for our hearts were fierce with hate and with longing to avenge the terrors we had borne the doomed slew the doomers while from the circle of the ingomboco a great roar of laughter went up for men rejoiced because the burden of the witchdoctors had fallen from them  at last it was done and we drew back from the heap of the dead nothing was heard there nowno more cries or prayers or curses the witchfinders travelled the path on which they had set the feet of many the king drew near to look he came alone and all who had done his bidding bent their heads and crept past him praising him as they went only i stood still covered as i was with mire and filth for i did not fear to stand in the presence of the king chaka drew near and looked at the piledup heaps of the slain and the cloud of dust that yet hung over them  there they lie mopo he said there lie those who dared to prophecy falsely to the king that was a good word of thine mopo which taught me to set the snare for them yet methought i saw thee start when nobela queen of the witchdoctresses switched death on thee well they are dead and the land breathes more freely and for the evil which they have done it is as yonder dust that shall soon sink again to earth and there be lost  thus he spoke then ceasedfor lo something moved beneath the cloud of dust something broke a way through the heap of the dead slowly it forced its path pushing the slain this way and that till at length it stood upon its feet and tottered towards usa thing dreadful to look on the shape was the shape of an aged woman and even through the blood and mire i knew her it was nobela she who had doomed me she whom but now i had smitten to earth but who had come back from the dead to curse me  on she tottered her apparel hanging round her in red rags a hundred wounds upon her face and form i saw that she was dying but life still flickered in her and the fire of hate burned in her snaky eyes  hail king she screamed  peace liar he answered thou art dead  not yet king i heard thy voice and the voice of yonder dog whom i would have given to the jackals and i will not die till i have spoken i smelt him out this morning when i was alive now that i am as one already dead i smell him out again he shall bewitch thee with blood indeed chakahe and unandi thy mother and baleka thy wife think of my words when the assegai reddens before thee for the last time king farewell and she uttered a great cry and rolled upon the ground dead  the witch lies hard and dies hard said the king carelessly and turned upon his heel but those words of dead nobela remained fixed in his memory or so much of them as had been spoken of unandi and baleka there they remained like seeds in the earth there they grew to bring forth fruit in their season  and thus ended the great ingomboco of chaka the greatest ingomboco that ever was held in zululand    chapter ix the loss of umslopogaas  now after the smelling out of the witchdoctors chaka caused a watch to be kept upon his mother unandi and his wife baleka my sister and report was brought to him by those who watched that the two women came to my huts by stealth and there kissed and nursed a boyone of my children then chaka remembered the prophecy of nobela the dead isanusi and his heart grew dark with doubt but to me he said nothing of the matter for then as always his eyes looked over my head he did not fear me or believe that i plotted against him i who was his dog still he did this though whether by chance or design i do not know he bade me go on a journey to a distant tribe that lived near the borders of the amaswazi there to take count of certain of the kings cattle which were in the charge of that tribe and to bring him account of the tale of their increase so i bowed before the king and said that i would run like a dog to do his bidding and he gave me men to go with me  then i returned to my huts to bid farewell to my wives and children and there i found that my wife anadi the mother of moosa my son had fallen sick with a wandering sickness for strange things came into her mind and what came into her mind that she said being as i did not doubt bewitched by some enemy of my house  still i must go upon the kings business and i told this to my wife macropha the mother of nada and as it was thought of umslopogaas the son of chaka but when i spoke to macropha of the matter she burst into tears and clung to me i asked her why she wept thus and she answered that the shadow of evil lay upon her heart for she was sure that if i left her at the kings kraal when i returned again i should find neither her nor nada my child nor umslopogaas who was named my son and whom i loved as a son still in the land of life then i tried to calm her but the more i strove the more she wept saying that she knew well that these things would be so  now i asked her what could be done for i was stirred by her tears and the dread of evil crept from her to me as shadows creep from the valley to the mountain  she answered take me with you my husband that i may leave this evil land where the very skies rain blood and let me rest awhile in the place of my own people till the terror of chaka has gone by  how can i do this i said none may leave the kings kraal without the kings pass  a man may put away his wife she replied the king does not stand between a man and his wife say my husband that you love me no longer that i bear you no more children and that therefore you send me back whence i came byandbye we will come together again if we are left among the living  so be it i answered leave the kraal with nada and umslopogaas this night and tomorrow morning meet me at the river bank and we shall go on together and for the rest may the spirits of our fathers hold us safe  so we kissed each other and macropha went on secretly with the children  now at the dawning on the morrow i summoned the men whom the king had given me and we started upon our journey when the sun was well up we came to the banks of the river and there i found my wife macropha and with her the two children they rose as i came but i frowned at my wife and she gave me no greeting those with me looked at her askance  i have divorced this woman i said to them she is a withered tree a worn out old hag and now i take her with me to send her to the country of the swazis whence she came cease weeping i added to macropha it is my last word  what says the king asked the men  i will answer to the king i said and we went on  now i must tell how we lost umslopogaas the son of chaka who was then a great lad drawing on to manhood fierce in temper well grown and broad for his years  we had journeyed seven days for the way was long and on the night of the seventh day we came to a mountainous country in which there were few kraals for chaka had eaten them all up years before perhaps you know the place my father in it is a great and strange mountain it is haunted also and named the ghost mountain and on the top of it is a grey peak rudely shaped like the head of an aged woman here in this wild place we must sleep for darkness drew on now we soon learned that there were many lions in the rocks around for we heard their roaring and were much afraid all except umslopogaas who feared nothing so we made a circle of thornbushes and sat in it holding our assegais ready presently the moon came upit was a fullgrown moon and very bright so bright that we could see everything for a long way round now some six spearthrows from where we sat was a cliff and at the top of the cliff was a cave and in this cave lived two lions and their young when the moon grew bright we saw the lions come out and stand upon the edge of the cliff and with them were two little ones that played about like kittens so that had we not been frightened it would have been beautiful to see them  oh umslopogaas said nada i wish that i had one of the little lions for a dog  the boy laughed saying then shall i fetch you one sister  peace boy i said no man may take young lions from their lair and live  such things have been done my father he answered laughing and no more was said of the matter  now when the cubs had played awhile we saw the lioness take up the cubs in her mouth and carry them into the cave then she came out again and went away with her mate to seek food and soon we heard them roaring in the distance now we stacked up the fire and went to sleep in our enclosure of thorns without fear for we knew that the lions were far away eating game but umslopogaas did not sleep for he had determined that he would fetch the cub which nada had desired and being young and foolhardy he did not think of the danger which he would bring upon himself and all of us he knew no fear and now as ever if nada spoke a word nay even if she thought of a thing to desire it he would not rest till it was won for her so while we slept umslopogaas crept like a snake from the fence of thorns and taking an assegai in his hand he slipped away to the foot of the cliff where the lions had their den then he climbed the cliff and coming to the cave entered there and groped his way into it the cubs heard him and thinking that it was their mother who returned began to whine and purr for food guided by the light of their yellow eyes he crept over the bones of which there were many in the cave and came to where they lay then he put out his hands and seized one of the cubs killing the other with his assegai because he could not carry both of them now he made haste thence before the lions returned and came back to the thorn fence where we lay just as dawn as breaking  i awoke at the coming of the dawn and standing up i looked out lo there on the farther side of the thorn fence looking large in the grey mist stood the lad umslopogaas laughing in his teeth he held the assegai yet dripping with blood and in his hands the lion cub that despite its whines and struggles he grasped by the skin of the neck and the hind legs  awake my sister he cried here is the dog you seek ah he bites now but he will soon grow tame  nada awoke and rising cried out with joy at the sight of the cub but for a moment i stood astonished  fool i cried at last let the cub go before the lions come to rend us  i will not let it go my father he answered sullenly are there not five of us with spears and can we not fight two cats i was not afraid to go alone into their den are you all afraid to meet them in the open  you are mad i said let the cub go and i ran towards umslopogaas to take it from him but he sprang aside and avoided me  i will never let that go of which i have got hold he said at least not living and suddenly he seized the head of the cub and twisted its neck then threw it on to the ground and added see now i have done your bidding my father  as he spoke we heard a great sound of roaring from the cave in the cliff the lions had returned and found one cub dead and the other gone  into the fenceback into the fence i cried and we sprang over the thornbushes where those with us were making ready their spears trembling as they handled them with fear and the cold of the morning we looked up there down the side of the cliff came the lions bounding on the scent of him who had robbed them of their young the lion ran first and as he came he roared then followed the lioness but she did not roar for in her mouth was the cub that umslopogaas had assegaied in the cave now they drew near mad with fury their manes bristling and lashing their flanks with their long tails  curse you for a fool son of mopo said one of the men with me to umslopogaas presently i will beat you till the blood comes for this trick  first beat the lions then beat me if you can answered the lad and wait to curse till you have done both  now the lions were close to us they came to the body of the second cub that lay outside the fence of thorns the lion stopped and sniffed it then he roaredah he roared till the earth shook as for the lioness she dropped the dead cub which she was carrying and took the other into her mouth for she could not carry both  get behind me nada cried umslopogaas brandishing his spear the lion is about to spring  as the words left his mouth the great brute crouched to the ground then suddenly he sprang from it like a bird and like a bird he travelled through the air towards us  catch him on the spears cried umslopogaas and by nature as it were we did the boys bidding for huddling ourselves together we held out the assegais so that the lion fell upon them as he sprang and their blades sank far into him but the weight of his charge carried us to the ground and he fell on to us striking at us and at the spears and roaring with pain and fury as he struck presently he was on his legs biting at the spears in his breast then umslopogaas who alone did not wait his onslaught but had stepped aside for his own ends uttered a loud cry and drove his assegai into the lion behind the shoulder so that with a groan the brute rolled over dead  meanwhile the lioness stood without the fence the second dead cub in her mouth for she could not bring herself to leave either of them but when she heard her mates last groan she dropped the cub and gathered herself together to spring umslopogaas alone stood up to face her for he only had withdrawn his assegai from the carcass of the lion she swept on towards the lad who stood like a stone to meet her now she met his spear it sunk in it snapped and down fell umslopogaas dead or senseless beneath the mass of the lioness she sprang up the broken spear standing in her breast sniffed at umslopogaas then as though she knew that it was he who had robbed her she seized him by the loins and moocha and sprang with him over the fence  oh save him cried the girl nada in bitter woe and we rushed after the lioness shouting  for a moment she stood over her dead cubs umslopogaas hanging from her mouth and looked at them as though she wondered and we hoped that she might let him fall then hearing our cries she turned and bounded away towards the bush bearing umslopogaas in her mouth we seized our spears and followed but the ground grew stony and search as we would we could find no trace of umslopogaas or of the lioness they had vanished like a cloud so we came back and ah my heart was sore for i loved the lad as though he had indeed been my son but i knew that he was dead and there was an end  where is my brother cried nada when we came back  lost i answered lost never to be found again  then the girl gave a great and bitter cry and fell to the earth saying i would that i were dead with my brother  let us be going said macropha my wife  have you no tears to weep for your son asked a man of our company  what is the use of weeping over the dead does it then bring them back she answered let us be going  the man thought these words strange but he did not know that umslopogaas was not born of macropha  still we waited in that place a day thinking that perhaps the lioness would return to her den and that at least we might kill her but she came back no more so on the next morning we rolled up our blankets and started forward on our journey sad at heart in truth nada was so weak from grief that she could hardly travel but i never heard the name of umslopogaas pass her lips again during that journey she buried him in her heart and said nothing and i too said nothing but i wondered why it had been brought about that i should save the life of umslopogaas from the jaws of the lion of zulu that the lioness of the rocks might devour him  and so the time went on till we reached the kraal where the kings business must be done and where i and my wife should part  on the morning after we came to the kraal having kissed in secret though in public we looked sullenly on one another we parted as those part who meet no more for it was in our thoughts that we should never see each others face again nor indeed did we do so and i drew nada aside and spoke to her thus we part my daughter nor do i know when we shall meet again for the times are troubled and it is for your safety and that of your mother that i rob my eyes of the sight of you nada you will soon be a woman and you will be fairer than any woman among our people and it may come about that many great men will seek you in marriage and perhaps that i your father shall not be there to choose for you whom you shall wed according to the custom of our land but i charge you as far as may be possible for you to do so take only a man whom you can love and be faithful to him alone for thus shall a woman find happiness  here i stopped for the girl took hold of my hand and looked into my face peace my father she said do not speak to me of marriage for i will wed no man now that umslopogaas is dead because of my foolishness i will live and die alone and oh may i die quickly that i may go to seek him whom i love only  nay nada i said umslopogaas was your brother and it is not fitting that you should speak of him thus even though he is dead  i know nothing of such matters my father she said i speak what my heart tells me and it tells me that i loved umslopogaas living and though he is dead i shall love him alone to the end ah you think me but a child yet my heart is large and it does not lie to me  now i upbraided the girl no more because i knew that umslopogaas was not her brother but one whom she might have married only i marvelled that the voice of nature should speak so truly in her telling her that which was lawful even when it seemed to be most unlawful  speak no more of umslopogaas i said for surely he is dead and though you cannot forget him yet speak of him no more and i pray of you my daughter that if we do not meet again yet you should keep me in your memory and the love i bear you and the words which from time to time i have said to you the world is a thorny wilderness my daughter and its thorns are watered with a rain of blood and we wander in our wretchedness like lost travellers in a mist nor do i know why our feet are set on this wandering but at last there comes an end and we die and go hence none know where but perhaps where we go the evil may change to the good and those who were dear to each other on the earth may become yet dearer in the heavens for i believe that man is not born to perish altogether but is rather gathered again to the umkulunkulu who sent him on his journeyings therefore keep hope my daughter for if these things are not so at least sleep remains and sleep is soft and so farewell  then we kissed and parted and i watched macropha my wife and nada my daughter till they melted into the sky as they walked upon their journey to swaziland and was very sad because having lost umslopogaas he who in after days was named the slaughterer and the woodpecker i must lose them also    chapter x the trial of mopo  now i sat four days in the huts of the tribe whither i had been sent and did the kings business and on the fifth morning i rose up together with those with me and we turned our faces towards the kings kraal but when we had journeyed a little way we met a party of soldiers who commanded us to stand  what is it kings men i asked boldly  this son of makedama answered their spokesman give over to us your wife macropha and your children umslopogaas and nada that we may do with them as the king commands  umslopogaas i answered has gone where the kings arm cannot stretch for he is dead and for my wife macropha and my daughter nada they are by now in the caves of the swazis and the king must seek them there with an army if he will find them to macropha he is welcome for i hate her and have divorced her and as for the girl well there are many girls and it is no great matter if she lives or dies yet i pray him to spare her  thus i spoke carelessly for i knew well that my wife and child were beyond the reach of chaka  you do well to ask the girls life said the soldier laughing for all those born to you are dead by order of the king  is it indeed so i answered calmly though my knees shook and my tongue clove to my lips the will of the king be done a cut stick puts out new leaves i can have more children  ay mopo but first you must get new wives for yours are dead also all five of them  is it indeed so i answered the kings will be done i wearied of those brawling women  so mopo said the soldier but to get other wives and have more children born to you you must live yourself for no children are born to the dead and i think that chaka has an assegai which you shall kiss  is it so i answered the kings will be done the sun is hot and i tire of the road he who kisses the assegai sleeps sound  thus i spoke my father and indeed in that hour i desired to die the world was empty for me macropha and nada were gone umslopogaas was dead and my other wives and children were murdered i had no heart to begin to build up a new house none were left for me to love and it seemed well that i should die also  the soldiers asked those with me if that tale was true which i told of the death of umslopogaas and of the going of macropha and nada into swaziland they said yes it was true then the soldiers said that they would lead me back to the king and i wondered at this for i thought that they would kill me where i stood so we went on and piece by piece i learned what had happened at the kings kraal  on the day after i left it came to the ears of chaka by the mouth of his spies that my second wifeanadiwas sick and spoke strange words in her sickness then taking three soldiers with him he went to my kraal at the death of the day he left the three soldiers by the gates of the kraal bidding them to suffer none to come in or go out but chaka himself entered the large hut where anadi lay sick having his toy assegai with the shaft of the royal red wood in his hand now as it chanced in the hut were unandi the mother of chaka and baleka my sister the wife of chaka for not knowing that i had taken away umslopogaas the son of baleka according to their custom these two foolish women had come to kiss and fondle the lad but when they entered the hut they found it full of my other wives and children these they sent away all except moosa the son of anadithat boy who was born eight days before umslopogaas the son of chaka but they kept moosa in the hut and kissed him giving him imphi 1 to eat fearing lest it should seem strange to the women my wives if umslopogaas being gone they refused to take notice of any other child   1 a variety of sugarcaneed  now as they sat thus presently the doorway was darkened and behold the king himself crept through it and saw them fondling the child moosa when they knew who it was that entered the women flung themselves upon the ground before him and praised him but he smiled grimly and bade them be seated then he spoke to them saying you wonder unandi my mother and baleka my wife why it is that i am come here into the hut of mopo son of makedama i will tell you it is because he is away upon my business and i hear that his wife anadi is sickit is she who lies there is it not therefore as the first doctor in the land i am come to cure her unandi my mother and baleka my sister  thus he spoke eyeing them as he did so and taking snuff from the blade of his little assegai and though his words were gentle they shook with fear for when chaka spoke thus gently he meant death to many but unandi mother of the heavens answered saying that it was well that the king had come since his medicine would bring rest and peace to her who lay sick  yes he answered it is well it is pleasant moreover my mother and sister to see you kissing yonder child surely were he of your own blood you could not love him more  now they trembled again and prayed in their hearts that anadi the sick woman who lay asleep might not wake and utter foolish words in her wandering but the prayer was answered from below and not from above for anadi woke and hearing the voice of the king her sick mind flew to him whom she believed to be the kings child  ah she said sitting upon the ground and pointing to her own son moosa who squatted frightened against the wall of the hut kiss him mother of the heavens kiss him whom do they call him the young cub who brings illfortune to our doors they call him the son of mopo and macropha and she laughed wildly stopped speaking and sank back upon the bed of skins  they call him the son of mopo and macropha said the king in a low voice whose son is he then woman  oh ask her not o king cried his mother and his wife casting themselves upon the ground before him for they were mad with fear ask her not she has strange fancies such as are not meet for your ears to hear she is bewitched and has dreams and fancies  peace he answered i will listen to this womans wanderings perhaps some star of truth shines in her darkness and i would see light who then is he woman  who is he she answered are you a fool that ask who he is he ishushput your ear closelet me speak low lest the reeds of the hut speak it to the king he isdo you listen he isthe son of chaka and baleka the sister of mopo the changeling whom unandi mother of the heavens palmed off upon this house to bring a curse on it and whom she would lead out before the people when the land is weary of the wickedness of the king her son to take the place of the king  it is false o king cried the two women do not listen to her it is false the boy is her own son moosa whom she does not know in her sickness  but chaka stood up in the hut and laughed terribly truly nobela prophesied well he cried and i did ill to slay her so this is the trick thou hast played upon me my mother thou wouldst give a son to me who will have no son thou wouldst give me a son to kill me good mother of the heavens take thou the doom of the heavens thou wouldst give me a son to slay me and rule in my place now in turn i thy son will rob me of a mother die unandidie at the hand thou didst bring forth and he lifted the little assegai and smote it through her  for a moment unandi mother of the heavens wife of senzangacona stood uttering no cry then she put up her hand and drew the assegai from her side  so shalt thou die also chaka the evil she cried and fell down dead there in the hut  thus then did chaka murder his mother unandi  now when baleka saw what had been done she turned and fled from the hut into the emposeni and so swiftly that the guards at the gates could not stop her but when she reached her own hut balekas strength failed her and she fell senseless on the ground but the boy moosa my son being overcome with terror stayed where he was and chaka believing him to be his son murdered him also and with his own hand  then he stalked out of the hut and leaving the three guards at the gate commanded a company of soldiers to surround the kraal and fire it this they did and as the people rushed out they killed them and those who did not run out were burned in the fire thus then perished all my wives my children my servants and those who were within the gates in their company the tree was burned and the bees in it and i alone was left livingi and macropha and nada who were far away  nor was chaka yet satisfied with blood for as has been told he sent messengers bidding them kill macropha my wife and nada my daughter and him who was named my son but he commanded the messengers that they should not slay me but bring me living before him  now when the soldiers did not kill me i took counsel with myself for it was my belief that i was saved alive only that i might die later and in a more cruel fashion therefore for awhile i thought that it would be well if i did that for myself which another purposed to do for me why should i who was already doomed wait to meet my doom what had i left to keep me in the place of life seeing that all whom i loved were dead or gone to die would be easy for i knew the ways of death in my girdle i carried a secret medicine he who eats of it my father will see the suns shadow move no more and will never look upon the stars again but i was minded to know the assegai or the kerrie nor would i perish more slowly beneath the knives of the tormentors nor be parched by the pangs of thirst or wander eyeless to my end therefore it was that since i had sat in the doom ring looking hour after hour into the face of death i had borne this medicine with me by night and by day surely now was the time to use it  so i thought as i sat through the watches of the night ay and drew out the bitter drug and laid it on my tongue but as i did so i remembered my daughter nada who was left to me though she sojourned in a far country and my wife macropha and my sister baleka who still lived so said the soldiers though how it came about that the king had not killed her i did not know then also another thought was born in my heart while life remained to me i might be revenged upon him who had wrought me this woe but can the dead strike alas the dead are strengthless and if they still have hearts to suffer they have no hands to give back blow for blow nay i would live on time to die when death could no more be put away time to die when the voice of chaka spoke my doom death chooses for himself and answers no questions he is a guest to whom none need open the door of his hut for when he wills he can pass through the thatch like air not yet would i taste of that medicine of mine  so i lived on my father and the soldiers led me back to the kraal of chaka now when we came to the kraal it was night for the sun had sunk as we passed through the gates still as he had been commanded the captain of those who watched me went in before the king and told him that i lay without in bonds and the king said let him be brought before me who was my physician that i may tell him how i have doctored those of his house  so they took me and led me to the royal house and pushed me through the doorway of the great hut  now a fire burned in the hut for the night was cold and chaka sat on the further side of the fire looking towards the opening of the hut and the smoke from the fire wreathed him round and its light shone upon his face and flickered in his terrible eyes  at the door of the hut certain councillors seized me by the arms and dragged me towards the fire but i broke from them and prostrating myself for my arms were free i praised the king and called him by his royal names the councillors sprang towards me to seize me again but chaka said let him be i would talk with my servant then the councillors bowed themselves on either side and laid their hands on their sticks their foreheads touching the ground but i sat down on the floor of the hut over against the king and we talked through the fire  tell me of the cattle that i sent thee to number mopo son of makedama said chaka have my servants dealt honestly with my cattle  they have dealt honestly o king i answered  tell me then of the number of the cattle and of their markings mopo forgetting none  so i sat and told him ox by ox cow by cow and heifer by heifer forgetting none and chaka listened silently as one who is asleep but i knew that he did not sleep for all the while the firelight flickered in his fierce eyes also i knew that he did but torment me or that perhaps he would learn of the cattle before he killed me at length all the tale was told  so said the king it goes well there are yet honest men left in the land knowest thou mopo that sorrow has come upon thy house while thou wast about my business  i have heard it o king i answered as one who speaks of a small matter  yes mopo sorrow has come upon thy house the curse of heaven has fallen upon thy kraal they tell me mopo that the fire from above ran briskly through they huts  i have heard it i king  they tell me mopo that those within thy gates grew mad at the sight of the fire and dreaming there was no escape that they stabbed themselves with assegais or leaped into the flames  i have heard it o king what of it any river is deep enough to drown a fool  thou hast heard these things mopo but thou hast not yet heard all knowest thou mopo that among those who died in thy kraal was she who bore me she who was named mother of the heavens  then my father i mopo acted wisely because of the thought which my good spirit gave me for i cast myself upon the ground and wailed aloud as though in utter grief  spare my ears black one i wailed tell me not that she who bore thee is dead o lion of the zulu for the others what is it it is a breath of wind it is a drop of water but this trouble is as the gale or as the sea  cease my servant cease said the mocking voice of chaka but know this thou hast done well to grieve aloud because the mother of the heavens is no more and ill wouldst thou have done to grieve because the fire from above has kissed thy gates for hadst thou done this last thing or left the first undone i should have known that thy heart was wicked and by now thou wouldst have wept indeedtears of blood mopo it is well for thee then that thou hast read my riddle aright  now i saw the depths of the pit that chaka had dug for me and blessed my ehlose who had put into my heart those words which i should answer i hoped also that chaka would now let me go but it was not to be for this was but the beginning of my trial  knowest thou mopo said the king that as my mother died yonder in the flames of thy kraal she cried out strange and terrible words which came to my ears through the singing of the fire these were her words that thou mopo and thy sister baleka and thy wives had conspired together to give a child to me who would be childless these were her words the words that came to me through the singing of the fire tell me now mopo where are those children that thou leddest from thy kraal the boy with the lion eyes who is named umslopogaas and the girl who is named nada  umslopogaas is dead by the lions mouth o king i answered and nada sits in the swazi caves and i told him of the death of umslopogaas and of how i had divorced macropha my wife  the boy with the lion eyes to the lions mouth said chaka enough of him he is gone nada may yet be sought for with the assegai in the swazi caves enough of her let us speak of this song that my motherwho alas is dead mopothis song she sang through the singing of the flames tell me mopo tell me now was it a true tale  nay o king surely the mother of the heavens was maddened by the heavens when she sang that song i answered i know nothing of it o king  thou knowest naught of it mopo said the king and again he looked at me terribly through the reek of the fire thou knowest naught of it mopo surely thou art acold thy hands shake with cold nay man fear notwarm them warm them mopo see now plunge that hand of thine into the heart of the flame and he pointed with his little assegai the assegai handled with the royal wood to where the fire glowed reddestay he pointed and laughed  then my father i grew cold indeedyes i grew cold who soon should be hot for i saw the purpose of chaka he would put me to the trial by fire  for a moment i sat silent thinking then the king spoke again in a great voice nay mopo be not so backward shall i sit warm and see thee suffer cold what my councillors rise take the hand of mopo and hold it to the flame that his heart may rejoice in the warmth of the flame while we speak together of this matter of the child that was so my mother sang born to baleka my wife the sister of mopo my servant  there is little need for that o king i answered being made bold by fear for i saw that if i did nothing death would swiftly end my doubts once indeed i bethought me of the poison that i bore and was minded to swallow it and make an end but the desire to live is great and keen is the thirst for vengeance so i said to my heart not yet awhile i will endure this also afterwards if need be i can die  i thank the king for his graciousness and i will warm me at the fire speak on o king while i warm myself and thou shalt hear true words i said boldly  then my father i stretched out my left hand and plunged it into the firenot into the hottest of the fire but where the smoke leapt from the flame now my flesh was wet with the sweat of fear and for a little moment the flames curled round it and did not burn me but i knew that the torment was to come  for a short while chaka watched me smiling then he spoke slowly that the fire might find time to do its work  say then mopo thou knowest nothing of this matter of the birth of a son to thy sister baleka  i know this only o king i answered that a son was born in past years to thy wife baleka that i killed the child in obedience to thy word and laid its body before thee  now my father the steam from my flesh had been drawn from my hand by the heat and the flame got hold of me and ate into my flesh and its torment was great but of this i showed no sign upon my face for i knew well that if i showed sign or uttered cry then having failed in the trial death would be my portion  then the king spoke again dost thou swear by my head mopo that no son of mine was suckled in thy kraals  i swear it o king i swear it by thy head i answered  and now my father the agony of the fire was such as may not be told i felt my eyes start forward in their sockets my blood seemed to boil within me it rushed into my head and down my face their ran two tears of blood but yet i held my hand in the fire and made no sign while the king and his councillors watched me curiously still for a moment chaka said nothing and that moment seemed to me as all the years of my life  ah he said at length i see that thou growest warm mopo withdraw thy hand from the flame i am answered thou hast passed the trial thy heart is clean for had there been lies in it the fire had given them tongue and thou hadst cried aloud making thy last music mopo  now i took my hand from the flame and for awhile the torment left me  it is well o king i said calmly fire has no power of hurt on those whose heart is pure  but as i spoke i looked at my left hand it was black my fatherblack as a charred stick and the nails were gone from the twisted fingers look at it now my father you can see though my eyes are blind the hand is white like yoursit is white and dead and shrivelled these are the marks of the fire in chakas hutthe fire that kissed me many many years ago i have had but little use of that hand since this night of torment but my right arm yet remained to me my father and ah i used it  it seems that nobela the doctress who is dead lied when she prophesied evil on me from thee mopo said chaka again it seems that thou art innocent of this offence and that baleka thy sister is innocent and that the song which the mother of the heavens sang through the singing flames was no true song it is well for thee mopo for in such a matter my oath had not helped thee but my mother is deaddead in the flames with thy wives and children mopo and in this there is witchcraft we will have a mourning mopo thou and i such a mourning as has not been seen in zululand for all the people on the earth shall weep at it and there shall be a smelling out at this mourning mopo but we will summon no witchdoctors thou and i will be witchdoctors and ourselves shall smell out those who have brought these woes upon us what shall my mother die unavenged she who bore me and has perished by witchcraft and shall thy wives and children die unavengedthou being innocent go forth mopo my faithful servant whom i have honoured with the warmth of my fire go forth and once again he stared at me through the reek of the flame and pointed with his assegai to the door of the hut    chapter xi the counsel of baleka  i rose i praised the king with a loud voice and i went from the intunkulu the house of the king i walked slowly through the gates but when i was without the gates the anguish that took me because of my burnt hand was more than i could bear i ran to and fro groaning till i came to the hut of one whom i knew there i found fat and having plunged my hand in the fat i wrapped it round with a skin and passed out again for i could not stay still i went to and fro till at length i reached the spot where my huts had been the outer fence of the huts still stood the fire had not caught it i passed through the fence there within were the ashes of the burnt hutsthey lay ankledeep i walked in among the ashes my feet struck upon things that were sharp the moon was bright and i looked they were the blackened bones of my wives and children i flung myself down in the ashes in bitterness of heart i covered myself over with the ashes of my kraal and with the bones of my wives and children yes my father there i lay and on me were the ashes and among the ashes were the bones thus then did i lie for the last time in my kraal and was sheltered from the frost of the night by the dust of those to whom i had given life such were the things that befell us in the days of chaka my father yes not to me alone but to many another also  i lay among the ashes and groaned with the pain of my burn and groaned also from the desolation of my heart why had i not tasted the poison there in the hut of chaka and before the eyes of chaka why did i not taste it now and make an end nay i had endured the agony i would not give him this last triumph over me now having passed the fire once more i should be great in the land and i would become great yes i would bear my sorrows and become great that in a day to be i might wreak vengeance on the king ah my father there as i rolled among the ashes i prayed to the amatongo to the ghosts of my ancestors i prayed to my ehlose to the spirit that watches meay and i even dared to pray to the umkulunkulu the great soul of the world who moves through the heavens and the earth unseen and unheard and thus i prayed that i might yet live to kill chaka as he had killed those who were dear to me and while i prayed i slept or if i did not sleep the light of thought went out of me and i became as one dead then there came a vision to me a vision that was sent in answer to my prayer or perchance it was a madness born of my sorrows for my father it seemed to me that i stood upon the bank of a great and wide river it was gloomy there the light lay low upon the face of the river but far away on the farther side was a glow like the glow of a stormy dawn and in the glow i saw a mighty bed of reeds that swayed about in the breath of dawn and out of the reeds came men and women and children by hundreds and thousands and plunged into the waters of the river and were buffeted about by them now my father all the people that i saw in the water were black people and all those who were torn out of the reeds were blackthey were none of them white like your people my father for this vision was a vision of the zulu race who alone are torn out of the reeds now i saw that of those who swam in the river some passed over very quickly and some stood still as it were still in the wateras in life my father some die soon and some live for many years and i saw the countless faces of those in the water among them were many that i knew there my father i saw the face of chaka and near him was my own face there too i saw the face of dingaan the prince his brother and the face of the boy umslopogaas and the face of nada my daughter and then for the first time i knew that umslopogaas was not dead but only lost  now i turned in my vision and looked at that bank of the river on which i stood then i saw that behind the bank was a cliff mighty and black and in the cliff were doors of ivory and through them came light and the sound of laughter there were other doors also black as though fashioned of coal and through them came darkness and the sounds of groans i saw also that in front of the doors was set a seat and on the seat was the figure of a glorious woman she was tall and she alone was white and clad in robes of white and her hair was like gold which is molten in the fire and her face shone like the midday sun then i saw that those who came up out of the river stood before the woman the water yet running from them and cried aloud to her  hail inkosazanayzulu hail queen of the heavens  now the figure of the glorious woman held a rod in either hand and the rod in her right hand was white and of ivory and the rod in her left hand was black and of ebony and as those who came up before her throne greeted her so she pointed now with the wand of ivory in her right hand and now with the wand of ebony in her left hand and with the wand of ivory she pointed to the gates of ivory through which came light and laughter and with the wand of ebony she pointed to the gates of coal through which came blackness and groans and as she pointed so those who greeted her turned and went some through the gates of light and some through the gates of blackness  presently as i stood a handful of people came up from the bank of the river i looked on them and knew them there was unandi the mother of chaka there was anadi my wife and moosa my son and all my other wives and children and those who had perished with them  they stood before the figure of the woman the princess of the heavens to whom the umkulunkulu has given it to watch over the people of the zulu and cried aloud hail inkosazanayzulu hail  then she the inkosazana pointed with the rod of ivory to the gates of ivory but still they stood before her not moving now the woman spoke for the first time in a low voice that was sad and awful to hear  pass in children of my people pass in to the judgment why tarry ye pass in through the gates of light  but still they tarried and in my vision unandi spoke we tarry queen of the heavenswe tarry to pray for justice on him who murdered us i who on earth was named mother of the heavens on behalf of all this company pray to thee queen of the heavens for justice on him who murdered us  how is he named asked the voice that was low and awful  chaka king of the zulus answered the voice of unandi chaka my son  many have come to ask for vengeance on that head said the voice of the queen of the heavens and many more shall come fear not unandi it shall fall fear not anadi and ye wives and children of mopo it shall fall i say with the spear that pierced thy breast unandi shall the breast of chaka be also pierced and ye wives and children of mopo the hand that pierces shall be the hand of mopo as i guide him so shall he go ay i will teach him to wreak my vengeance on the earth pass in children of my peoplepass in to the judgment for the doom of chaka is written  thus i dreamed my father ay this was the vision that was sent me as i lay in pain and misery among the bones of my dead in the ashes of my kraal thus it was given me to see the inkosazana of the heavens as she is in her own place twice more i saw her as you shall hear but that was on the earth and with my waking eyes yes thrice has it been given to me in all to look upon that face that i shall now see no more till i am dead for no man may look four times on the inkosazana and live or am i mad my father and did i weave these visions from the woof of my madness i do not know but it is true that i seemed to see them  i woke when the sky was grey with the morning light it was the pain of my burnt hand that aroused me from my sleep or from my stupor i rose shaking the ashes from me and went without the kraal to wash away their defilement then i returned and sat outside the gates of the emposeni waiting till the kings women whom he named his sisters should come to draw water according to their custom at last they came and sitting with my kaross thrown over my face to hide it looked for the passing of baleka presently i saw her she was sadfaced and walked slowly her pitcher on her head i whispered her name and she drew aside behind an aloe bush and making pretence that her foot was pierced with a thorn she lingered till the other women had gone by then she came up to me and we greeted one another gazing heavily into each others eyes  in an ill day did i hearken to you baleka i said to you and to the mother of the heavens and save your child alive see now what has sprung from this seed dead are all my house dead is the mother of the heavensall are deadand i myself have been put to the torment by fire and i held out my withered hand towards her  ay mopo my brother she answered but flesh is nearest to flesh and i should think little of it were not my son umslopogaas also dead as i have heard but now  you speak like a woman baleka is it then nothing to you that i your brother have lostall i love  fresh seed can yet be raised up to you my brother but for me there is no hope for the king looks on me no more i grieve for you but i had this one alone and flesh is nearest to flesh think you that i shall escape i tell you nay i am but spared for a little then i go where the others have gone chaka has marked me for the grave for a little while i may be left then i die he does but play with me as a leopard plays with a wounded buck i care not i am weary but i grieve for the boy there was no such boy in the land would that i might die swiftly and go to seek him  and if the boy is not dead baleka what then  what is that you said she answered turning on me with wild eyes oh say it againagain mopo i would gladly die a hundred deaths to know that umslopogaas still lives  nay baleka i know nothing but last night i dreamed a dream and i told her all my dream and also of that which had gone before the dream  she listened as one listens to the words of a king when he passes judgement for life or for death  i think that there is wisdom in your dreams mopo she said at length you were ever a strange man to whom the gates of distance are no bar now it is borne in upon my heart that umslopogaas still lives and now i shall die happy yes gainsay me not i shall die i know it i read it in the kings eyes but what is it it is nothing if only the prince umslopogaas yet lives  your love is great woman i said and this love of yours has brought many woes upon us and it may well happen that in the end it shall all be for nothing for there is an evil fate upon us say now what shall i do shall i fly or shall i abide here taking the chance of things  you must stay here mopo see now this is in the kings mind he fears because of the death of his mother at his own handyes even he he is afraid lest the people should turn upon him who killed his own mother therefore he will give it out that he did not kill her but that she perished in the fire which was called down upon your kraals by witchcraft and though all men know the lie yet none shall dare to gainsay him as he said to you there will be a smelling out but a smelling out of a new sort for he and you shall be the witchfinders and at that smelling out he will give to death all those whom he fears all those whom he knows hate him for his wickedness and because with his own hand he slew his mother for this cause then he will save you alive mopoyes and make you great in the land for if indeed his mother unandi died through witchcraft as he shall say are you not also wronged by him and did not your wives and children also perish by witchcraft therefore do not fly abide here and become greatbecome great to the great end of vengeance mopo my brother you have much wrong to wreak soon you will have more for i too shall be gone and my blood also shall cry for vengeance to you hearken mopo are there not other princes in the land what of dingaan what of umhlangana what of umpanda brothers to the king do not these also desire to be kings do they not day by day rise from sleep feeling their limbs to know if they yet live do they not night by night lie down to sleep not knowing if it shall be their wives that they shall kiss ere dawn or the red assegai of the king draw near to them my brother creep into their hearts and learn their counsel or teach them yours so in the end shall chaka be brought to that gate through which your wives have passed and where i also am about to tread  thus baleka spoke and she was gone leaving me pondering for her words were heavy with wisdom i knew well that the brothers of the king went heavily and in fear of death for his shadow was on them with panda indeed little could be done for he lived softly speaking always as one whose wits are few but dingaan and umhlangana were of another wood and from them might be fashioned a kerrie that should scatter the brains of chaka to the birds but the time to speak was not now not yet was the cup of chaka full  then having finished my thought i rose and going to the kraal of my friend i doctored my burnt hand that pained me and as i was doctoring it there came a messenger to me summoning me before the king  i went in before the king and prostrated myself calling him by his royal names but he took me by the hand and raised me up speaking softly  rise mopo my servant he said thou hast suffered much woe because of the witchcraft of thine enemies i i have lost my mother and thou thou hast lost thy wives and children weep my councillors weep because i have lost my mother and mopo my servant has lost his wives and children by the witchcraft of our foes  then all the councillors wept aloud while chaka glared at them  hearken mopo said the king when the weeping was done none can give me back my mother but i can give thee more wives and thou shalt find children go in among the damsels who are reserved to the king and choose thee six go in among the cattle of the king and choose thee ten times ten of the best call upon the servants of the king that they build up thy kraal greater and fairer than it was before these things i give thee freely but thou shalt have more mopoyes thou shalt have vengeance on the first day of the new moon i summon a great meeting a bandhla of all the zulu people yes thine own tribe the langeni shall be there also then we will mourn together over our woes then too we will learn who brought these woes upon us go now mopo go and go ye also my councillors leaving me to weep alone because my mother is dead  thus then my father did the words of baleka come true and thus because of the crafty policy of chaka i grew greater in the land than ever i had been before i chose the cattle they were fat i chose the wives they were fair but i took no pleasure in them nor were any more children born to me for my heart was like a withered stick the sap and strength had gone from my heartit was drawn out in the fire of chakas hut and lost in my sorrow for those whom i had loved    chapter xii the tale of galazi the wolf  now my father i will go back a little for my tale is long and winds in and out like a river in a plain and tell of the fate of umslopogaas when the lion had taken him as he told it to me in the after years  the lioness bounded away and in her mouth was umslopogaas once he struggled but she bit him hard so he lay quiet in her mouth and looking back he saw the face of nada as she ran from the fence of thorns crying save him he saw her face he heard her words then he saw and heard little more for the world grew dark to him and he passed as it were into a deep sleep presently umslopogaas awoke again feeling pain in his thigh where the lioness had bitten him and heard a sound of shouting he looked up near to him stood the lioness that had loosed him from her jaws she was snorting with rage and in front of her was a lad long and strong with a grim face and a wolfs hide black and grey bound about his shoulders in such fashion that the upper jar and teeth of the wolf rested on his head he stood before the lioness shouting and in one hand he held a large warshield and in the other he grasped a heavy club shod with iron  now the lioness crouched herself to spring growling terribly but the lad with the club did not wait for her onset he ran in upon her and struck her on the head with the club he smote hard and well but this did not kill her for she reared herself upon her hind legs and struck at him heavily he caught the blow upon his shield but the shield was driven against his breast so strongly that he fell backwards beneath it and lay there howling like a wolf in pain then the lioness sprang upon him and worried him still because of the shield as yet she could not come at him to slay him but umslopogaas saw that this might not endure for presently the shield would be torn aside and the stranger must be killed now in the breast of the lioness still stood the half of umslopogaass broken spear and its blade was a span deep in her breast then this thought came into the mind of umslopogaas that he would drive the spear home or die so he rose swiftly for strength came back to him in his need and ran to where the lioness worried at him who lay beneath the shield she did not heed him so he flung himself upon his knees before her and seizing the haft of the broken spear drove it deep into her and wrenched it round now she saw umslopogaas and turned roaring and clawed at him tearing his breast and arms then as he lay he heard a mighty howling and behold grey wolves and black leaped upon the lioness and rent and worried her till she fell and was torn to pieces by them after this the senses of umslopogaas left him again and the light went out of his eyes so that he was as one dead  at length his mind came back to him and with it his memory and he remembered the lioness and looked up to find her but he did not find her and he saw that he lay in a cave upon a bed of grass while all about him were the skins of beasts and at his side was a pot filled with water he put out his hand and taking the pot drank of the water and then he saw that his arm was wasted as with sickness and that his breast was thick with scars scarcely skinned over  now while he lay and wondered the mouth of the cave was darkened and through it entered that same lad who had done battle with the lioness and been overthrown by her bearing a dead buck upon his shoulders he put down the buck upon the ground and walking to where umslopogaas lay looked at him  ou he said your eyes are opendo you then live stranger  i live answered umslopogaas and i am hungry  it is time said the other since with toil i bore you here through the forest for twelve days you have lain without sense drinking water only so deeply had the lion clawed you that i thought of you as dead twice i was near to killing you that you might cease to suffer and i to be troubled but i held my hand because of a word which came to me from one who is dead now eat that your strength may return to you afterwards we will talk  so umslopogaas ate and little by little his health returned to himevery day a little and afterwards as they sat at night by the fire in the cave they spoke together  how are you named asked umslopogaas of the other  i am named galazi the wolf he answered and i am of zulu blooday of the blood of chaka the king for the father of senzangacona the father of chaka was my greatgrandfather  whence came you galazi  i came from swazilandfrom the tribe of the halakazi which i should rule this is the story siguyana my grandfather was a younger brother of senzangacona the father of chaka but he quarrelled with senzangacona and became a wanderer with certain of the people of the umtetwa he wandered into swaziland and sojourned with the halakazi tribe in their great caves and the end of it was that he killed the chief of the tribe and took his place after he was dead my father ruled in his place but there was a great party in the tribe that hated his rule because he was of the zulu race and it would have set up a chief of the old swazi blood in his place still they could not do this for my fathers hand was heavy on the people now i was the only son of my father by his head wife and born to be chief after him and therefore those of the swazi party and they were many and great hated me also so matters stood till last year in the winter and then my father set his heart on killing twenty of the headmen with their wives and children because he knew that they plotted against him but the headmen learned what was to come and they prevailed upon a wife of my father a woman of their own blood to poison him so she poisoned him in the night and in the morning it was told me that my father lay sick and summoned me and i went to him in his hut i found him and he was writhing with pain  what is it my father i said who has done this evil  it is this my son he gasped that i am poisoned and she stands yonder who has done the deed and he pointed to the woman who stood at the side of the hut near the door her chin upon her breast trembling as she looked upon the fruit of her wickedness  now the girl was young and fair and we had been friends yet i say that i did not pause for my heart was mad within me i did not pause but seizing my spear i ran at her and though she cried for mercy i killed her with the spear  that was well done galazi said my father but when i am gone look to yourself my son for these swazi dogs will drive you out and rob you of your place but if they drive you out and you still live swear this to methat you will not rest till you have avenged me  i swear it my father i answered i swear that i will stamp out the men of the tribe of halakazi every one of them except those of my own blood and bring their women to slavery and their children to bonds  big words for a young mouth said my father yet shall you live to bring these things about galazi this i know of you now in my hour of death you shall be a wanderer for a few years of your life child of siguyana and wandering in another land you shall die a mans death and not such a death as yonder witch has given to me then having spoken thus he lifted up his head looked at me and with a great groan he died  now i passed out of the hut dragging the body of the dead girl after me in front of the hut were gathered many headmen waiting for the end and i saw that their looks were sullen  the chief my father is dead i cried in a loud voice and i galazi who am the chief have slain her who murdered him and i rolled the body of the girl over on to her back so that they might look upon her face  now the father of the girl was among those who stood before me he who had persuaded her to the deed and he was maddened at the sight  what my brothers he cried shall we suffer that this young zulu dog this murderer of a girl be chief over us never the old lion is dead now for the cub and he ran at me with spear aloft  never shouted the others and they too ran towards me shaking their spears  i waited i did not hasten for i knew well that i should not die then i knew it from my fathers last words i waited till the man was near me he thrust i sprang aside and drove my spear through him and on the daughters body the father fell dead then i shouted aloud and rushed through them none touched me none could catch me the man does not live who can overtake me when my feet are on the ground and i am away  yet i might try said umslopogaas smiling for of all lads among the zulus he was the swiftest of foot  first walk again then run answered galazi  take up the tale quoth umslopogaas it is a merry one  something is left to tell stranger i fled from the country of the halakazi nor did i linger at all in the land of the swazis but came on swiftly into the zulu now it was in my mind to go to chaka and tell him of my wrongs asking that he would send an impi to make an end of the halakazi but while i journeyed finding food and shelter as i might i came one night to the kraal of an old man who knew chaka and had known siguyana my grandfather and to him when i had stayed there two days i told my tale but the old man counselled me against my plan saying that chaka the king did not love to welcome new shoots sprung from the royal stock and would kill me moreover the man offered me a place in his kraal now i held that there was wisdom in his words and thought no more of standing before the king to cry for justice for he who cries to kings for justice sometimes finds death still i would not stay in the kraal of the old man for he had sons to come after him who looked on me with no liking moreover i wished to be a chief myself even if i lived alone so i left the kraal by night and walked on not knowing where i should go  now on the third night i came to a little kraal that stands on the farther side of the river at the foot of the mountain in front of the kraal sat a very old woman basking in the rays of the setting sun she saw me and spoke to me saying young man you are tall and strong and swift of foot would you earn a famous weapon a club that destroys all who stand before it  i said that i wished to have such a club and asked what i should do to win it  you shall do this said the old woman tomorrow morning at the first light you shall go up to yonder mountain and she pointed to the mountain where you are now stranger on which the stone witch sits forever waiting for the world to die twothirds of the way up the mountain you will come to a path that is difficult to climb you shall climb the path and enter a gloomy forest it is very dark in the forest but you must push through it till you come to an open place with a wall of rock behind it in the wall of rock is a cave and in the cave you will find the bones of a man bring down the bones in a bag and i will give you the club  while she spoke thus people came out of the kraal and listened  do not heed her young man they said unless you are weary of life do not heed her she is crazy the mountain is haunted it is a place of ghosts look at the stone witch who sits upon it evil spirits live in that forest and no man has walked there for many years this womans son was foolish he went to wander in the forest saying that he cared nothing for ghosts and the amatongo the ghostfolk killed him that was many years ago and none have dared to seek his bones ever she sits here and asks of the passers by that they should bring him to her offering the great club for a reward but they dare not  they lie said the old woman there are no ghosts there the ghosts live only in their cowardly hearts there are but wolves i know that the bones of my son lie in the cave for i have seen them in a dream but alas my old limbs are too weak to carry me up the mountain path and all these are cowards there is no man among them since the zulus killed my husband covering him with wounds  now i listened answering nothing but when all had done i asked to see the club which should be given to him who dared to face the amatongo the spirits who lived in the forest upon the ghost mountain then the old woman rose and creeping on her hands went into the hut presently she returned again dragging the great club after her  look at it stranger look at it was there ever such a club and galazi held it up before the eyes of umslopogaas  in truth my father that was a club for i mopo saw it in after days it was great and knotty black as iron that had been smoked in the fire and shod with metal that was worn smooth with smiting  i looked at it went on galazi and i tell you stranger a great desire came into my heart to possess it  how is this club named i asked of the old woman  it is named watcher of the fords she answered and it has not watched in vain five men have held that club in war and a hundredandseventythree have given up their lives beneath its strokes he who held it last slew twenty before he was slain himself for this fortune goes with the clubthat he who owns it shall die holding it but in a noble fashion there is but one other weapon to match with it in zululand and that is the great axe of jikiza the chief of the people of the axe who dwells in the kraal yonder the ancient hornhafted imbubuzi the groanmaker that brings victory were axe groanmaker and club watcher of the fords side by side there are no thirty men in zululand who could stand before them i have said choose and the aged woman watched me cunningly through her horny eyes  she speaks truly now said one of those who stood near let the club be young man he who owns it smites great blows indeed but in the end he dies by the assegai none dare own the watcher of the fords  a good death and a swift i answered and pondered a time while still the old woman watched me through her horny eyes at length she rose la la she said the watcher is not for this one this is but a child i must seek me a man i must seek me a man  not so fast old wife i said will you lend me this club to hold in my hand while i go to find the bones of your son and to snatch them from the people of the ghosts  lend you the watcher boy nay nay i should see little of you again or of the good club either  i am no thief i answered if the ghosts kill me you will see me no more or the club either but if i live i will bring you back the bones or if i do not find them i will render the watcher into your hands again at the least i say that if you will not lend me the club then i will not go into the haunted place  boy your eyes are honest she said still peering at me take the watcher go seek the bones if you die let the club be lost with you if you fail bring it back to me but if you win the bones then it is yours and it shall bring you glory and you shall die a mans death at last holding him aloft among the dead  so on the morrow at dawn i took the club watcher in my hand and a little dancing shield and made ready to start the old woman blessed me and bade me farewell but the other people of the kraal mocked saying a little man for so big a club beware little man lest the ghosts use the club on you so they spoke but one girl in the kraalshe is a granddaughter of the old womanled me aside praying me not to go for the forest on the ghost mountain had an evil name none dared walk there since it was certainly full of spirits who howled like wolves i thanked the girl but to the others i said nothing only i asked of the path to the ghost mountain  now stranger if you have strength come to the mouth of the cave and look out for the moon is bright  so umslopogaas rose and crept through the narrow mouth of the cave there above him a great grey peak towered high into the air shaped like a seated woman her chin resting upon her breast the place where the cave was being as it were on the lap of the woman below this place the rock sloped sharply and was clothed with little bushes lower down yet was a forest great and dense that stretched to the top of a cliff and at the foot of the cliff beyond the waters of the river lay the wide plains of zululand  yonder stranger said galazi pointing with the club watcher of the fords far away to the plain beneath yonder is the kraal where the aged woman dwelt there is a cliff rising from the plain up which i must climb there is the forest where dwell the amatongo the people of the ghosts there on the hither side of the forest runs the path to the cave and here is the cave itself see this stone lying at the mouth of the cave it turns thus shutting up the entrance holeit turns gently though it is so large a child may move it for it rests upon a sharp point of rock only mark this the stone must not be pushed too far for look if it came to here and he pointed to a mark in the mouth of the cave then that man need be strong who can draw it back again though i have done it myself who am not a man full grown but if it pass beyond this mark then see it will roll down the neck of the cave like a pebble down the neck of a gourd and i think that two men one striving from within and one dragging from without scarcely could avail to push it clear look now i close the stone as is my custom of a night soand he grasped the rock and swung it round upon its pivot on which it turned as a door turns thus i leave it and though except those to whom the secret is know none would guess that a cave was here yet it can be rolled back again with a push of the hand but enough of the stone enter again wanderer and i will go forward with my tale for it is long and strange  i started from the kraal of the old woman and the people of the kraal followed me to the brink of the river it was in flood and few had dared to cross it  ha ha they cried now your journey is done little man watch by the ford you who would win the watcher of the ford beat the water with the club perhaps so it shall grow gentle that your feet may pass it  i answered nothing to their mocking only i bound the shield upon my shoulders with a string and the bag that i had brought i made fast about my middle and i held the great club in my teeth by the thong then i plunged into the river and swam twice stranger the current bore me under and those on the bank shouted that i was lost but i rose again and in the end i won the farther shore  now those on the bank mocked no more they stood still wondering and i walked on till i came to the foot of the cliff that cliff is hard to climb stranger when you are strong upon your feet i will show you the path yet i found a way up it and by midday i came to the forest here on the edge of the forest i rested awhile and ate a little food that i had brought with me in the bag for now i must gather up my strength to meet the ghosts if ghosts there were then i rose and plunged into the forest the trees were great that grow there stranger and their leaves are so think that in certain places the light is as that of night when the moon is young still i wended on often losing my path but from time to time between the tops of the trees i saw the figure of the grey stone woman who sits on the top of ghost mountain and shaped my course towards her knees my heart beat as i travelled through the forest in dark and loneliness like that of the night and ever i looked round searching for the eyes of the amatongo but i saw no spirits though at times great spotted snakes crept from before my feet and perhaps these were the amatongo at times also i caught glimpses of some grey wolf as he slunk from tree to tree watching me and always high above my head the wind sighed in the great boughs with a sound like the sighing of women  still i went on singing to myself as i went that my heart might not be faint with fear and at length towards the end of the second hour the trees grew fewer the ground sloped upwards and the light poured down from the heavens again but stranger you are weary and the night wears on sleep now and tomorrow i will end the tale say first how are you named  i am named umslopogaas son of mopo he answered and my tale shall be told when yours is done let us sleep  now when galazi heard this name he started and was troubled but said nothing so they laid them down to sleep and galazi wrapped umslopogaas with the skins of bucks  but galazi the wolf was so hardy that he lay on the bare ground and had no covering so they slept and without the door of the cave the wolves howled scenting the blood of men    chapter xiii galazi becomes king of the wolves  on the morrow umslopogaas awoke and knew that strength was growing on him fast still all that day he rested in the cave while galazi went out to hunt in the evening he returned bearing a buck upon his shoulders and they skinned the buck and ate of it as they sat by the fire and when the sun was down galazi took up his tale  now umslopogaas son of mopo hear i had passed the forest and had come as it were to the legs of the old stone witch who sits up aloft there forever waiting for the world to die here the sun shone merrily here lizards ran and birds flew to and fro and though it grew towards the eveningfor i had wandered long in the foresti was afraid no more so i climbed up the steep rock where little bushes grow like hair on the arms of a man till at last i came to the knees of the stone witch which are the space before the cave i lifted by head over the brink of the rock and looked and i tell you umslopogaas my blood ran cold and my heart turned to water for there before the cave rolled wolves many and great some slept and growled in their sleep some gnawed at the skulls of dead game some sat up like dogs and their tongues hung from their grinning jaws i looked i saw and beyond i discovered the mouth of the cave where the bones of the boy should be but i had no wish to come there being afraid of the wolves for now i knew that these were the ghosts who live upon the mountain so i bethought me that i would fly and turned to go and umslopogaas even as i turned the great club watcher of the fords swung round and smote me on the back with such a blow as a man smites upon a coward now whether this was by chance or whether the watcher would shame him who bore it say you for i do not know at the least shame entered into me should i go back to be mocked by the people of the kraal and by the old woman and if i wished to go should i not be killed by the ghosts at night in the forest nay it was better to die in the jaws of the wolves and at once  thus i thought in my heart then tarrying not lest fear should come upon me again i swung up the watcher and crying aloud the warcry of the halakazi i sprang over the brink of the rock and rushed upon the wolves they too sprang up and stood howling with bristling hides and fiery eyes and the smell of them came into my nostrils yet when they saw it was a man that rushed upon them they were seized with sudden fear and fled this way and that leaping by great bounds from the place of rock which is the knees of the stone witch so that presently i stood alone in front of the cave now having conquered the wolf ghosts and no blow struck my heart swelled within me and i walked to the mouth of the cave proudly as a cock walks upon a roof and looked in through the opening as it chanced the sinking sun shone at this hour full into the cave so that all its darkness was made red with light then once more umslopogaas i grew afraid indeed for i could see the end of the cave  look now there is a hole in the wall of the cave where the firelight falls below the shadow of the roof twice the height of a man from the floor it is a narrow hole and a high is it notas though one had cut it with iron and a man might sit in it his legs hanging towards the floor of the cave ay umslopogaas a man might sit in it might he not and there a man sat or that which had been a man there sat the bones of a man and the black skin had withered on his bones holding them together and making him awful to see his hands were open beside him he leaned upon them and in the right hand was a piece of hide from his moocha it was half eaten umslopogaas he had eaten it before he died his eyes also were bound round with a band of leather as though to hide something from their gaze one foot was gone one hung over the edge of the niche towards the floor and beneath it on the floor red with rust lay the blade of a broken spear  now come hither umslopogaas place your hand upon the wall of the cave just here it is smooth is it notsmooth as the stones on which women grind their corn what made it so smooth you ask i will tell you  when i peered through the door of the cave i saw this on the floor of the cave lay a shewolf panting as though she had galloped many a mile she was great and fierce near to her was another wolfhe was a dogold and black bigger than any i have seen a very father of wolves and all his head and flanks were streaked with grey but this wolf was on his feet as i watched he drew back nearly to the mouth of the cave then of a sudden he ran forward and bounded high into the air towards the withered foot of that which hung from the cleft of the rock his pads struck upon the rock here where it is smooth and there for a second he seemed to cling while his great jaws closed with a clash but a spears breadth beneath the dead mans foot then he fell back with a howl of rage and drew slowly down the cave again he ran and leaped again the great jaws closed again he fell down howling then the shewolf rose and they sprang together striving to pull down him who sat above but it was all in vain they could never come nearer than within a spears breadth of the dead mans foot and now umslopogaas you know why the rock is smooth and shines from month to month and year to year the wolves had ravened there seeking to devour the bones of him who sat above night upon night they had leaped thus against the wall of the cave but never might their clashing jaws close upon his foot one foot they had indeed but the other they could not come by  now as i watched filled with fear and wonder the shewolf her tongue lolling from her jaws made so mighty a bound that she almost reached the hanging foot and yet not quite she fell back and then i saw that the leap was her last for that time for she had oversprung herself and lay there howling the black blood flowing from her mouth the wolf saw also he drew near sniffed at her then knowing that she was hurt seized her by the throat and worried her now all the place was filled with groans and choking howls as the wolves rolled over and over beneath him who sat above and in the bloodred light of the dying sun the sight and sounds were so horrid that i trembled like a child the shewolf grew faint for the fangs of her mate were buried in her throat then i saw that now was the time to smite him lest when he had killed her he should kill me also so i lifted the watcher and sprang into the cave having it in my mind to slay the wolf before he lifted up his head but he heard my footsteps or perhaps my shadow fell upon him loosing his grip he looked up this father of wolves then making no sound he sprang straight at my throat  i saw him and whirling the watcher aloft i smote with all my strength the blow met him in midair it fell full on his chest and struck him backwards to the earth but there he would not say for rising before i could smite again once more he sprang at me this time i leaped aside and struck downwards and the blow fell upon his right leg and broke it so that he could spring no more yet he ran at me on three feet and though the club fell on his side he seized me with his teeth biting through that leather bag which was wound about my middle into the flesh behind then i yelled with pain and rage and lifting the watcher endways drove it down with both hands as a man drives a stake into the earth and that with so great a stroke that the skull of the wolf was shattered like a pot and he fell dead dragging me with him presently i sat up on the ground and placing the handle of the watcher between his jaws i forced them open freeing my flesh from the grip of his teeth then i looked at my wounds they were not deep for the leather bag had saved me yet i feel them to this hour for there is poison in the mouth of a wolf presently i glanced up and saw that the shewolf had found her feet again and stood as though unhurt for this is the nature of these ghosts umslopogaas that though they fight continually they cannot destroy each other they may be killed by man alone and that hardly there she stood and yet she did not look at me or on her dead mate but at him who sat above i saw and crept softly behind her then lifting the watcher i dashed him down with all my strength the blow fell on her neck and broke it so that she rolled over and at once was dead  now i rested awhile then went to the mouth of the cave and looked out the sun was sinking all the depth of the forest was black but the light still shone on the face of the stone woman who sits forever on the mountain here then i must bide this night for though the moon shone white and full in the sky i dared not wend towards the plains alone with the wolves and the ghosts and if i dared not go alone how much less should i dare to go bearing with me him who sat in the cleft of the rock nay here i must bide so i went out of the cave to the spring which flows from the rock on the right yonder and washed my wounds and drank then i came back and sat in the mouth of the cave and watched the light die away from the face of the world while it was dying there was silence but when it was dead the forest awoke a wind sprang up and tossed it till the green of its boughs waved like troubled water on which the moon shines faintly from the heart of it too came howlings of ghosts and wolves that were answered by howls from the rocks abovehearken umslopogaas such howlings as we hear tonight  it was awful here in the mouth of the cave for i had not yet learned the secret of the stone and if i had known it should i have dared to close it leaving myself alone with the dead wolves and him whom the wolves had struggled to tear down i walked out yonder on to the platform and looked up the moon shone full upon the face of the stone witch who sits aloft forever she seemed to grin at me and oh i grew afraid for now i knew that this was a place of dead men a place where spirits perch like vultures in a tree as they sweep round and round the world i went back to the cave and feeling that i must do something lest i should go mad i drew to me the carcase of the great dogwolf which i had killed and taking my knife of iron i began to skin it by the light of the moon for an hour or more i skinned singing to myself as i worked and striving to forget him who sat in the cleft above and the howlings which ran about the mountains but ever the moonlight shone more clearly into the cave now by it i could see his shape of bone and skin ay and even the bandage about his eyes why had he tied it there i wonderedperhaps to hide the faces of the fierce wolves as they sprang upwards to grip him and always the howlings drew nearer now i could see grey forms creeping to and fro in the shadows of the rocky place before me ah there before me glared two red eyes a sharp snout sniffed at the carcase which i skinned with a yell i lifted the watcher and smote there came a scream of pain and something galloped away into the shadows  now the skin was off i cast it behind me and seizing the carcase dragged it to the edge of the rock and left it presently the sound of howlings drew near again and i saw the grey shapes creep up one by one now they gathered round the carcase now they fell upon it and rent it fighting horribly till all was finished then licking their red chops they slunk back to the forest  did i sleep or did i wake nay i cannot tell but i know this that of a sudden i seemed to look up and see i saw a lightperchance umslopogaas it was the light of the moon shining upon him that sat aloft at the end of the cave it was a red light and he glowed in it as glows a thing that is rotten i looked or seemed to look and then i thought that the hanging jaw moved and from it came a voice that was harsh and hollow as of one who speaks from an empty belly through a withered throat  hail galazi child of siguyana said the voice galazi the wolf say what dost thou here in the ghost mountain where the stone witch sits forever waiting for the world to die  then umslopogaas i answered or seemed to answer and my voice too sounded strange and hollow  hail dead one who sittest like a vulture on a rock i do this on the ghost mountain i come to seek thy bones and bear them to thy mother for burial  many and many a year have i sat aloft galazi answered the voice watching the ghostwolves leap and leap to drag me down till the rock grew smooth beneath the wearing of their feet so i sat seven days and nights being yet alive the hungry wolves below and hunger gnawing at my heart so i have sat many and many a year being dead in the heart of the old stone witch watching the moon and the sun and the stars hearkening to the howls of the ghostwolves as they ravened beneath me and learning the wisdom of the old witch who sits above in everlasting stone yet my mother was young and fair when i trod the haunted forest and climbed the knees of stone how seems she now galazi  she is white and wrinkled and very aged i answered they call her mad yet at her bidding i came to seek thee dead one bearing the watcher that was thy fathers and shall be mine  it shall be thine galazi said the voice for thou alone hast dared the ghosts to give me sleep and burial hearken thine also shall be the wisdom of the old witch who sits aloft forever frozen into everlasting stonethine and one others these are not wolves that thou hast seen that is no wolf which thou hast slain nay they are ghostsevil ghosts of men who lived in ages gone and who must now live till they be slain by men and knowest thou how they lived galazi and what was the food they ate when the light comes again galazi climb to the breasts of the stone witch and look in the cleft which is between her breasts there shalt thou see how these men lived and now this doom is on them they must wander gaunt and hungry in the shape of wolves haunting that ghost mountain where they once fed till they are led forth to die at the hands of men because of their devouring hunger they have leapt from year to year striving to reach my bones and he whom thou hast slain was the king of them and she at his side was their queen  now galazi the wolf this is the wisdom that i give thee thou shalt be king of the ghostwolves thou and another whom a lion shall bring thee gird the black skin upon thy shoulders and the wolves shall follow thee all the three hundred and sixty and three of them that are left and let him who shall be brought to thee gird on the skin of grey where ye twain lead them there shall they raven bringing you victory till all are dead but know this that there only may they raven where in life they ravened seeking for their food yet that was an ill gift thou tookest from my motherthe gift of the watcher for though without the watcher thou hadst never slain the king of the ghostwolves yet bearing the watcher thou shalt thyself be slain now on the morrow carry me back to my mother so that i may sleep where the ghostwolves leap no more i have spoken galazi  now the dead ones voice seemed to grow ever fainter and more hollow as he spoke till at the last i could scarcely hear his words yet i answered him asking him this  who is it then that the lion shall bring to me to rule with me over the ghostwolves and how is he named  then the dead one spoke once more very faintly yet in the silence of the place i heard his words  he is named umslopogaas the slaughterer son of chaka lion of the zulu  now umslopogaas started up from his place by the fire  i am named umslopogaas he said but the slaughterer i am not named and i am the son of mopo and not the son of chaka lion of the zulu you have dreamed a dream galazi or if it was no dream then the dead one lied to you  perchance this was so umslopogaas answered galazi the wolf perhaps i dreamed of perhaps the dead one lied nevertheless if he lied in this matter in other matters he did not lie as you shall hear  after i had heard these words or had dreamed that i heard them i slept indeed and when i woke the forest beneath was like the clouds of mist but the grey light glinted upon the face of her who sits in stone above now i remembered the dream that i had dreamed and i would see if it were all a dream so i rose and leaving the cave found a place where i might climb up to the breasts and head of the stone witch i climbed and as i went the rays of the sun lit upon her face and i rejoiced to see them but when i drew near the likeness to the face of a woman faded away and i saw nothing before me but rugged heaps of piledup rock for this umslopogaas is the way of witches be they of stone or fleshwhen you draw near to them they change their shape  now i was on the breast of the mountain and wandered to and fro awhile between the great heaps of stone at length i found as it were a crack in the stone thrice as wide as a man can jump and in length half a spears throw and near this crack stood great stones blackened by fire and beneath them broken pots and a knife of flint i looked down into the crackit was very deep and green with moss and tall ferns grew about in it for the damp gathered there there was nothing else i had dreamed a lying dream i turned to go then found another mind and climbed down into the cleft pushing aside the ferns beneath the ferns was moss i scraped it away with the watcher presently the iron of the club struck on something that was yellow and round like a stone and from the yellow thing came a hollow sound i lifted it umslopogaas it was the skull of a child  i dug deeper and scraped away more moss till presently i saw beneath the moss was nothing but the bones of menold bones that had lain there many years the little ones had rotted the larger ones remainedsome were yellow some black and others still white they were not broken as are those that hyenas and wolves have worried yet on some of them i could see the marks of teeth then umslopogaas i went back to the cave never looking behind me  now when i was come to the cave i did this i skinned the shewolf also when i had finished the sun was up and i knew that it was time to go but i could not go alonehe who sat aloft in the cleft of the cave must go with me i greatly feared to touch himthis dead one who had spoken to me in a dream yet i must do it so i brought stones and piled them up till i could reach him then i lifted him down for he was very light being but skin and bones when he was down i bound the hides of the wolves about me then leaving the leather bag into which he could not enter i took the dead one and placed him on my shoulders as a man might carry a child for his legs were fixed somewhat apart and holding him by the foot which was left on him i set out for the kraal down the slope i went as swiftly as i could for now i knew the way seeing and hearing nothing except once when there came a rush of wings and a great eagle swept down at that which sat upon my shoulders i shouted and the eagle flew away then i entered the dark of the forest here i must walk softly lest the head of him i carried should strike against the boughs and be smitten from him  for awhile i went on thus till i drew near to the heart of the forest then i heard a wolf howl on my right and from the left came answering howls and these again were answered by others in front of and behind me i walked on boldly for i dared not stay guiding myself by the sun which from time to time shone down on me redly through the boughs of the great trees now i could see forms grey and black slinking near my path sniffing at the air as they went and now i came to a little open place and behold all the wolves in the world were gathered together there my heart melted my legs trembled beneath me on every side were the brutes great and hungry and i stood still with club aloft and slowly they crept up muttering and growling as they came till they formed a deep circle round me yet they did not spring on me only drew nearer and ever nearer presently one sprang indeed but not at me he sprang at that which sat upon my shoulders i moved aside and he missed his aim and coming to the ground again stood there growling and whining like a beast afraid then i remembered the words of my dream if dream it were how that the dead one had given me wisdom that i should be king of the ghostwolvesi and another whom a lion should bear to me was it not so if it was not so how came it that the wolves did not devour me  for a moment i stood thinking then i lifted up my voice and howled like a wolf and lo umslopogaas all the wolves howled in answer with a mighty howling i stretched out my hand and called to them they ran to me gathering round me as though to devour me but they did not harm me they licked my legs with their red tongues and fighting to come near me pressed themselves against me as does a cat one indeed snatched at him who sat on my shoulder but i struck him with the watcher and he slunk back like a whipped hound moreover the others bit him so that he yelled now i knew that i had no more to fear for i was king of the ghostwolves so i walked on and with me came all the great pack of them i walked on and on and they trotted beside me silently and the fallen leaves crackled beneath their feet and the dust rose up about them till at length i reached the edge of the forest  now i remembered that i must not be seen thus by men lest they should think me a wizard and kill me therefore at the edge of the forest i halted and made signs to the wolves to go back at this they howled piteously as though in grief but i called to them that i would come again and be their king and it seemed as though their brute hearts understood my words then they all went still howling till presently i was alone  and now umslopogaas it is time to sleep tomorrow night i will end my tale    chapter xiv the wolfbrethren  now my father on the morrow night once again umslopogaas and galazi the wolf sat by the fire in the mouth of their cave as we sit tonight my father and galazi took up his tale  i passed on till i came to the river it was still full but the water had run down a little so that my feet found foothold i waded into the river using the watcher as a staff and the stream reached to my elbows but no higher now one on the farther bank of the river saw that which sat upon my shoulders and saw also the wolfs skin on my head and ran to the kraal crying here comes one who walks the waters on the back of a wolf  so it came about that when i drew towards the kraal all the people of the kraal were gathered together to meet me except the old woman who could not walk so far but when they saw me coming up the slope of the hill and when they knew what it was that sat upon my shoulders they were smitten with fear yet they did not run because of their great wonder only they walked backward before me clinging each to each and saying nothing i too came on silently till at length i reached the kraal and before its gates sat the old woman basking in the sun of the afternoon presently she looked up and cried  what ails you people of my house that you walk backwards like men bewitched and who is that tall and deathly man who comes toward you  but still they drew on backward saying no word the little children clinging to the women the women clinging to the men till they had passed the old wife and ranged themselves behind her like a regiment of soldiers then they halted against the fence of the kraal but i came on to the old woman and lifted him who sat upon my shoulders and placed him on the ground before her saying woman here is your son i have snatched him with much toil from the jaws of the ghostsand they are many up yonderall save one foot which i could not find take him now and bury him for i weary of his fellowship  she looked upon that which sat before her she put out her withered hand and drew the bandage from his sunken eyes then she screamed aloud a shrill scream and flinging her arms about the neck of the dead one she cried it is my son whom i boremy very son whom for twice ten years and half a ten i have not looked upon greeting my son greeting now shalt thou find burial and i with threeay i with thee  and once more she cried aloud standing upon her feet with arms outstretched then of a sudden foam burst from her lips and she fell forward upon the body of her son and was dead  now silence came upon the place again for all were fearful at last one cried how is this man named who has won the body from the ghosts  i am named galazi i answered  nay said he the wolf you are named look at the wolfs red hide upon his head  i am named galazi and the wolf you have named me i said again so be it i am named galazi the wolf  methinks he is a wolf said he look now at his teeth how they grin this is no man my brothers but a wolf  no wolf and no man said another but a wizard none but a wizard could have passed the forest and won the lap of her who sits in stone forever  yes yes he is a wolfhe is a wizard they screamed kill him kill the wolfwizard before he brings the ghosts upon us and they ran towards me with uplifted spears  i am a wolf indeed i cried and i am a wizard indeed and i will bring wolves and ghosts upon you ere all is done and i turned and fled so swiftly that soon they were left behind me now as i ran i met a girl a basket of mealies was on her head and she bore a dead kid in her hand i rushed at her howling like a wolf and i snatched the mealies from her head and the kid from her hand then i fled on and coming to the river i crossed it and for that night i hid myself in the rocks beyond eating the mealies and the flesh of the kid  on the morrow at dawn i rose and shook the dew from the wolfhide then i went on into the forest and howled like a wolf they knew my voice the ghostwolves and howled in answer from far and near then i heard the pattering of their feet and they came round me by tens and by twenties and fawned upon me i counted their number they numbered three hundred and sixty and three  afterwards i went on to the cave and i have lived there in the cave umslopogaas for nigh upon twelve moons and i have become a wolfman for with the wolves i hunt and raven and they know me and what i bid them that they do stay umslopogaas now you are strong again and if your courage does not fail you you shall see this very night come now have you the heart umslopogaas  then umslopogaas rose and laughed aloud i am young in years he cried and scarcely come to the full strength of men yet hitherto i have not turned my back on lion or witch on wolf or man now let us see this impi of yoursthis impi black and grey that runs on four legs with fangs for spears  you must first bind on the shewolfs hide umslopogaas quoth galazi else before a man could count his fingers twice there would be little enough left of you bind it about the neck and beneath the arms and see that the fastenings do not burst lest it be the worse for you  so umslopogaas took the grey wolfs hide and bound it on with thongs of leather and its teeth gleamed upon his head and he took a spear in his hand galazi also bound on the hide of the king of the wolves and they went out on to the space before the cave galazi stood there awhile and the moonlight fell upon him and umslopogaas saw that his face grew wild and beastlike that his eyes shone and his teeth grinned beneath his curling lips he lifted up his head and howled out upon the night thrice galazi lifted his head and thrice he howled loudly and yet more loud but before ever the echoes had died in the air from the heights of the rocks above and the depths of the forest beneath there came howlings in answer nearer they grew and nearer now there was a sound of feet and a wolf great and grey bounded towards them and after him many another they came to galazi they sprang upon him fawning round him but he beat them down with the watcher then of a sudden they saw umslopogaas and rushed at him openmouthed  stand and do not move cried galazi be not afraid  i have always fondled dogs answered umslopogaas shall i learn to fear them now  yet though he spoke boldly in his heart he was afraid for this was the most terrible of all sights the wolves rushed on him openmouthed from before and from behind so that in a breath he was wellnigh hidden by their forms yet no fang pierced him for as they leapt they smelt the smell of the skin upon him then umslopogaas saw that the wolves leapt at him no more but the shewolves gathered round him who wore the shewolfs skin they were great and gaunt and hungry all were fullgrown there were no little ones and their number was so many that he could not count them in the moonlight umslopogaas looking into their red eyes felt his heart become as the heart of a wolf and he too lifted up his head and howled and the shewolves howled in answer  the pack is gathered now for the hunt cried galazi make your feet swift my brother for we shall journey far tonight ho blackfang ho greysnout ho my people black and grey away away  he spoke and bounded forward and with him went umslopogaas and after him streamed the ghostwolves they fled down the mountain sides leaping from boulder to boulder like bucks presently they stood by a kloof that was thick with trees galazi stopped holding up the watcher and the wolves stopped with him  i smell a quarry he cried in my people in  then the wolves plunged silently into the great kloof but galazi and umslopogaas drew to the foot of it and waited presently there came a sound of breaking boughs and lo before them stood a buffalo a bull who lowed fiercely and sniffed the air  this one will give us a good chase my brother see he is gaunt and thin ah that meat is tender which my people have hunted to the death  as galazi spoke the first of the wolves drew from the covert and saw the buffalo then giving tongue they sprang towards it the bull saw also and dashed down the hill and after him came galazi and umslopogaas and with them all their company and the rocks shook with the music of their hunting they rushed down the mountain side and it came into the heart of umslopogaas that he too was a wolf they rushed madly yet his feet were swift as the swiftest no wolf could outstrip him and in him was but one desirethe desire of prey now they neared the borders of the forest and galazi shouted he shouted to greysnout and to blackfang to blood and to deathgrip and these four leaped forward from the pack running so swiftly that their bellies seemed to touch the ground they passed about the bull turning him from the forest and setting his head up the slope of the mountain then the chase wheeled the bull leaped and bounded up the mountain side and on one flank lay greysnout and deathgrip and on the other lay blood and blackfang while behind came the wolfbrethren and after them the wolves with lolling tongues up the hill they sped but the feet of umslopogaas never wearied his breath did not fail him once more they drew near the lap of the grey witch where the cave was on rushed the bull mad with fear he ran so swiftly that the wolves were left behind since here for a space the ground was level to his feet galazi looked on umslopogaas at his side and grinned  you do not run so ill my brother who have been sick of late see now if you can outrun me who shall touch the quarry first  now the bull was ahead by two spearthrows umslopogaas looked and grinned back at galazi good he cried away  they sped forward with a bound and for awhile it seemed to umslopogaas as though they stood side by side only the bull grew nearer and nearer then he put out his strength and the swiftness of his feet and lo when he looked again he was alone and the bull was very near never were feet so swift as those of umslopogaas now he reached the bull as he laboured on umslopogaas placed his hands upon the back of the bull and leaped he was on him he sat him as you white men sit a horse then he lifted the spear in his hand and drove it down between the shoulders to the spine and of a sudden the great buffalo staggered stopped and fell dead  galazi came up who now is the swiftest galazi cried umslopogaas i or you or your wolf host  you are the swiftest umslopogaas said galazi gasping for his breath never did a man run as you run nor ever shall again  now the wolves streamed up and would have torn the carcase but galazi beat them back and they rested awhile then galazi said let us cut meat from the bull with a spear  so they cut meat from the bull and when they had finished galazi motioned to the wolves and they fell upon the carcase fighting furiously in a little while nothing was left except the larger bones and yet each wolf had but a little  then they went back to the cave and slept  afterwards umslopogaas told galazi all his tale and galazi asked him if he would abide with him and be his brother and rule with him over the wolfkind or seek his father mopo at the kraal of chaka  umslopogaas said that it was rather in his mind to seek his sister nada for he was weary of the kraal of chaka but he thought of nada day and night  where then is nada your sister asked galazi  she sleeps in the caves of your people galazi she tarries with the halakazi  stay awhile umslopogaas cried galazi stay till we are men indeed then we will seek this sister of yours and snatch her from the caves of the halakazi  now the desire of this wolflife had entered into the heart of umslopogaas and he said that it should be so and on the morrow they made them bloodbrethren to be one till death before all the company of ghostwolves and the wolves howled when they smelt the blood of men in all things thenceforth these two were equal and the ghostwolves hearkened to the voice of both of them and on many a moonlight night they and the wolves hunted together winning their food at times they crossed the river hunting in the plains for game was scarce on the mountain and the people of the kraal would come out hearing the mighty howling and watch the pack sweep across the veldt and with them a man or men then they would say that the ghosts were abroad and creep into their huts shivering with fear but as yet the wolfbrethren and their pack killed no men but game only or at times elephants and lions  now when umslopogaas had abode some moons in the witch mountain on a night he dreamed of nada and awakening soft at heart bethought himself that he would learn tidings concerning me his father mopo and what had befallen me and her whom he deemed his mother and nada his sister and his other brethren so he clothed himself hiding his nakedness and leaving galazi descended to that kraal where the old woman had dwelt and there gave it out that he was a young man a chiefs son from a far place who sought a wife the people of the kraal listened to him though they held that his look was fierce and wild and one asked if this were galazi the wolf galazi the wizard but another answered that this was not galazi for their eyes had seen him umslopogaas said that he knew nothing of galazi and little of wolves and lo while he spoke there came an impi of fifty men and entered the kraal umslopogaas looked at the leaders of the impi and knew them for captains of chaka at first he would have spoken to them but his ehlose bade him hold his peace so he sat in a corner of the big hut and listened presently the headman of the kraal who trembled with fear for he believed that the impi had been sent to destroy him and all that were his asked the captain what was his will  a little matter and a vain said the captain we are sent by the king to search for a certain youth umslopogaas the son of mopo the kings doctor mopo gave it out that the youth was killed by a lion near these mountains and chaka would learn if this is true  we know nothing of the youth said the headman but what would ye with him  only this answered the captain to kill him  that is yet to do thought umslopogaas  who is this mopo asked the headman  an evildoer whose house the king has eaten upman woman and child answered the captain    chapter xv the death of the kings slayers  when umslopogaas heard these words his heart was heavy and a great anger burned in his breast for he thought that i mopo was dead with the rest of his house and he loved me but he said nothing only watching till none were looking he slipped past the backs of the captains and won the door of the hut soon he was clear of the kraal and running swiftly crossed the river and came to the ghost mountain meanwhile the captain asked the headman of the kraal if he knew anything of such a youth as him for whom they sought the headman told the captain of galazi the wolf but the captain said that this could not be the lad for galazi had dwelt many moons upon the ghost mountain  there is another youth said the headman a stranger fierce strong and tall with eyes that shine like spears he is in the hut now he sits yonder in the shadow  the captain rose and looked into the shadow but umslopogaas was gone  now this youth is fled said the headman and yet none saw him fly perhaps he also is a wizard indeed i have heard that now there are two of them upon the ghost mountain and that they hunt there at night with the ghostwolves but i do not know if it is true  now i am minded to kill you said the captain in wrath because you have suffered this youth to escape me without doubt it is umslopogaas son of mopo  it is no fault of mine said the headmen these young men are wizards who can pass hither and thither at will but i say this to you captain of the king if you will go on the ghost mountain you must go there alone with your soldiers for none in these parts dare to tread upon that mountain  yet i shall dare tomorrow said the captain we grow brave at the kraal of chaka there men do not fear spears or ghosts or wild beasts or magic but they fear the kings word alone the sun setsgive us food tomorrow we will search the mountain  thus my father did this captain speak in his follyhe who should never see another sun  now umslopogaas reached the mountain and when he had passed the forestof which he had learned every secret waythe darkness gathered and the wolves awoke in the darkness and drew near howling umslopogaas howled in answer and presently that great wolf deathgrip came to him umslopogaas saw him and called him by his name but behold the brute did not know him and flew at him growling then umslopogaas remembered that the shewolfs skin was not bound about his shoulders and therefore it was that the wolf deathgrip knew him not for though in the daytime when the wolves slept he might pass to and fro without the skin at night it was not so he had not brought the skin because he dared not wear it in the sight of the men of the kraal lest they should know him for one of the wolfbrethren and it had not been his plan to seek the mountain again that night but rather on the morrow now umslopogaas knew that his danger was great indeed he beat back deathgrip with his kerrie but others were behind him for the wolves gathered fast then he bounded away towards the cave for he was so swift of foot that the wolves could not catch him though they pressed him hard and once the teeth of one of them tore his moocha never before did he run so fast and in the end he reached the cave and rolled the rock to and as he did so the wolves dashed themselves against it then he clad himself in the hide of the shewolf and pushing aside the stone came out and lo the eyes of the wolves were opened and they knew him for one of the brethren who ruled over them and slunk away at his bidding  now umslopogaas sat himself down at the mouth of the cave waiting for galazi and he thought presently galazi came and in few words umslopogaas told him all his tale  you have run a great risk my brother said galazi what now  this said umslopogaas these people of ours are hungry for the flesh of men let us feed them full on the soldiers of chaka who sit yonder at the kraal seeking my life i would take vengeance for mopo my father and all my brethren who are dead and for my mothers the wives of mopo what say you  galazi laughed aloud that will be merry my brother he said i weary of hunting beasts let us hunt men tonight  ay tonight said umslopogaas nodding i long to look upon that captain as a maid longs for her lovers kiss but first let us rest and eat for the night is young then galazi summon our impi  so they rested and ate and afterwards went out armed and galazi howled to the wolves and they came in tens and twenties till all were gathered together galazi moved among them shaking the watcher as they sat upon their haunches and followed him with their fiery eyes  we do not hunt game tonight little people he cried but men and you love the flesh of men  now all the wolves howled as though they understood then the pack divided itself as was its custom the shewolves following umslopogaas the dogwolves following galazi and in silence they moved swiftly down towards the plain they came to the river and swam it and there eight spear throws away on the farther side of the river stood the kraal now the wolfbrethren took counsel together and galazi with the dogwolves went to the north gate and umslopogaas with the shewolves to the south gate they reached them safely and in silence for at the bidding of the brethren the wolves ceased from their howlings the gates were stopped with thorns but the brethren pulled out the thorns and made a passage as they did this it chanced that certain dogs in the kraal heard the sound of the stirred boughs and awakening caught the smell of the wolves that were with umslopogaas for the wind blew from that quarter these dogs ran out barking and presently they came to the south gate of the kraal and flew at umslopogaas who pulled away the thorns now when the wolves saw the dogs they could be restrained no longer but sprang on them and tore them to fragments and the sound of their worrying came to the ears of the soldiers of chaka and of the dwellers in the kraal so that they sprang from sleep snatching their arms and as they came out of the huts they saw in the moonlight a man wearing a wolfs hide rushing across the empty cattle kraal for the grass was long and the cattle were out at graze and with him countless wolves black and grey then they cried aloud in terror saying that the ghosts were on them and turned to flee to the north gate of the kraal but behold here also they met a man clad in a wolfs skin only and with him countless wolves black and grey  now some flung themselves to earth screaming in their fear and some strove to run away but the greater part of the soldiers and with them many of the men of the kraal came together in knots being minded to die like men at teeth of the ghosts and that though they shook with fear then umslopogaas howled aloud and howled galazi and they flung themselves upon the soldiers and the people of the kraal and with them came the wolves then a crying and a baying rose up to heaven as the grey wolves leaped and bit and tore little they heeded the spears and kerries of the soldiers some were killed but the rest did not stay presently the knots of men broke up and to each man wolves hung by twos and threes dragging him to earth some few fled indeed but the wolves hunted them by gaze and scent and pulled them down before they passed the gates of the kraal  the wolfbrethren also ravened with the rest busy was the watcher and many bowed beneath him and often the spear of umslopogaas flashed in the moonlight it was finished none were left living in that kraal and the wolves growled sullenly as they took their fill they who had been hungry for many days now the brethren met and laughed in their wolf joy because they had slaughtered those who were sent out to slaughter they called to the wolves bidding them search the huts and the wolves entered the huts as dogs enter a thicket and killed those who lurked there or drove them forth to be slain without presently a man great and tall sprang from the last of the huts where he had hidden himself and the wolves outside rushed on him to drag him down but umslopogaas beat them back for he had seen the face of the man it was that captain whom chaka had sent out to kill him he beat them back and stalked up to the captain saying greeting to you captain of the king now tell us what is your errand here beneath the shadow of her who sits in stone and he pointed with his spear to the grey witch on the ghost mountain on which the moon shone bright  now the captain had a great heart though he had hidden from the wolves and answered boldly  what is that to you wizard your ghost wolves had made an end of my errand let them make an end of me also  be not in haste captain said umslopogaas say did you not seek a certain youth the son of mopo  that is so answered the captain i sought one youth and i have found many evil spirits and he looked at the wolves tearing their prey and shuddered  say captain quoth umslopogaas drawing back his hood of wolfs hide so that the moonlight fell upon his face is this the face of that youth whom you sought  it is the face answered the captain astonished  ay laughed umslopogaas it is the face fool i knew your errand and heard your words and thus have i answered them and he pointed to the dead now choose and swiftly will you run for your life against my wolves will you do battle for your life against these four and he pointed to greysnout and to blackfang to blood and to deathgrip who watched him with slavering lips or will you stand face to face with me and if i am slain with him who bears the club and with whom i rule this people black and grey  i fear ghosts but of men i have no fear though they be wizards answered the captain  good cried umslopogaas shaking his spear  then they rushed together and that fray was fierce for presently the spear of umslopogaas was broken in the shield of the captain and he was left weaponless now umslopogaas turned and fled swiftly bounding over the dead and the wolves who preyed upon them and the captain followed with uplifted spear and mocked him as he came galazi also wondered that umslopogaas should fly from a single man hither and thither fled umslopogaas and always his eyes were on the earth of a sudden galazi who watched saw him sweep forward like a bird and stoop to the ground then he wheeled round and lo there was an axe in his hand the captain rushed at him and umslopogaas smote as he rushed and the blade of the great spear that was lifted to pierce him fell to the ground hewn from its haft again umslopogaas smote the moonshaped axe sank through the stout shield deep into the breast beyond then the captain threw up his arms and fell to the earth  ah cried umslopogaas you sought a youth to slay him and have found an axe to be slain by it sleep softly captain of chaka  then umslopogaas spoke to galazi saying my brother i will fight no more with the spear but with the axe alone it was to seek an axe that i ran to and fro like a coward but this is a poor thing see the haft is split because of the greatness of my stroke now this is my desireto win that great axe of jikiza which is called groanmaker of which we have heard tell so that axe and club may stand together in the fray  that must be for another night said galazi we have not done so ill for once now let us search for pots and corn of which we stand in need and then to the mountain before dawn finds us  thus then did the wolfbrethren bring death on the impi of chaka and this was but the first of many deaths that they wrought with the help of the wolves for ever they ravened through the land at night and falling on those they hated they ate them up till their name and the name of the ghostwolves became terrible in the ears of men and the land was swept clean but they found that the wolves would not go abroad to worry everywhere thus on a certain night they set out to fall upon the kraals of the people of the axe where dwelt the chief jikiza who was named the unconquered and owned the axe groanmaker but when they neared the kraal the wolves turned back and fled then galazi remembered the dream that he had dreamed in which the dead one in the cave had seemed to speak telling him that there only where the meneaters had hunted in the past might the wolves hunt today so they returned home but umslopogaas set himself to find a plan to win the axe    chapter xvi umslopogaas ventures out to win the axe  now many moons had gone by since umslopogaas became a king of the wolves and he was a man full grown a man fierce and tall and keen a slayer of men fleet of foot and of valour unequalled seeing by night as well as by day but he was not yet named the slaughterer and not yet did he hold that iron chieftainess the axe groanmaker still the desire to win the axe was foremost in his mind for no woman had entered there who when she enters drives out all other desireay my father even that of good weapons at times indeed umslopogaas would lurk in the reeds by the river looking at the kraal of jikiza the unconquered and would watch the gates of his kraal and once as he lurked he saw a man great broad and hairy who bore upon his shoulder a shining axe hafted with the horn of a rhinoceros after that his greed for this axe entered into umslopogaas more and more till at length he scarcely could sleep for thinking of it and to galazi he spoke of little else wearying him much with his talk for galazi loved silence but for all his longing he could find no means to win it  now it befell that as umslopogaas hid one evening in the reeds watching the kraal of jikiza he saw a maiden straight and fair whose skin shone like the copper anklets on her limbs she walked slowly towards the reeds where he lay hidden nor did she stop at the brink of the reeds she entered them and sat herself down within a spears length of where umslopogaas was seated and at once began to weep speaking to herself as she wept  would that the ghostwolves might fall on him and all that is his she sobbed ay and on masilo also i would hound them on even if i myself must next know their fangs better to die by the teeth of the wolves than to be sold to this fat pig of a masilo oh if i must wed him i will give him a knife for the brides kiss oh that i were a lady of the ghostwolves there should be a picking of bones in the kraal of jikiza before the moon grows young again  umslopogaas heard and of a sudden reared himself up before the maid and he was great and wild to look on and the shewolfs fangs shone upon his brow  the ghostwolves are at hand damsel he said they are ever at hand for those who need them  now the maid saw him and screamed faintly then grew silent wondering at the greatness and the fierce eyes of the man who spoke to her  who are you she asked i fear you not whoever you are  there you are wrong damsel for all men fear me and they have cause to fear i am one of the wolfbrethren whose names have been told of i am a wizard of the ghost mountain take heed now lest i kill you it will be of little avail to call upon your people for my feet are fleeter than theirs  i have no wish to call upon my people wolfman she answered and for the rest i am too young to kill  that is so maiden answered umslopogaas looking at her beauty what were the words upon your lips as to jikiza and a certain masilo were they not fierce words such as my heart likes well  it seems that you heard them answered the girl what need to waste breath in speaking them again  no need maiden now tell me your story perhaps i may find a way to help you  there is little to tell she answered it is a small tale and a common my name is zinita and jikiza the unconquered is my stepfather he married my mother who is dead but none of his blood is in me now he would give me in marriage to a certain masilo a fat man and an old whom i hate because masilo offers many cattle for me  is there then another whom you would wed maiden asked umslopogaas  there is none answered zinita looking him in the eyes  and is there no path by which you may escape from masilo  there is only one path wolfmanby death if i die i shall escape if masilo dies i shall escape but to little end for i shall be given to another but if jikiza dies then it will be well what of that wolfpeople of yours are they not hungry wolfman  i cannot bring them here answered umslopogaas is there no other way  there is another way said zinita if one can be found to try it and again she looked at him strangely causing the blood to beat within him hearken do you not know how our people are governed they are governed by him who holds the axe groanmaker he that can win the axe in war from the hand of him who holds it shall be our chief but if he who holds the axe dies unconquered then his son takes his place and with it the axe it has been thus indeed for four generations since he who held groanmaker has always been unconquerable but i have heard that the greatgrandfather of jikiza won the axe from him who held it in his day he won it by fraud for when the axe had fallen on him but lightly he fell over feigning death then the owner of the axe laughed and turned to walk away but the forefather of jikiza sprang up behind him and pierced him through with a spear and thus he became chief of the people of the axe therefore it is the custom of jikiza to hew off the heads of those whom he kills with the axe  does he then slay many asked umslopogaas  of late years few indeed she said for none dare stand against himno not with all to win for holding the axe groanmaker he is unconquerable and to fight with him is sure death fiftyandone have tried in all and before the hut of jikiza there are piled fiftyandone white skulls and know this the axe must be won in fight if it is stolen or found it has no virtuenay it brings shame and death to him who holds it  how then may a man give battle to jikiza he asked again  thus once in every year on the first day of the new moon of the summer season jikiza holds a meeting of the headmen then he must rise and challenge all or any to come forward and do battle with him to win the axe and become chief in his place now if one comes forward they go into the cattle kraal and there the matter is ended afterwards when the head is hewn from his foe jikiza goes back to the meeting of the headmen and they talk as before all are free to come to the meeting and jikiza must fight with them if they wish it whoever they be  perhaps i shall be there said umslopogaas  after this meeting at the new moon i am to be given in marriage to masilo said the maid but should one conquer jikiza then he will be chief and can give me in marriage to whom he will  now umslopogaas understood her meaning and knew that he had found favour in her sight and the thought moved him a little for women were strange to him as yet  if perchance i should be there he said and if perchance i should win the iron chieftainess the axe groanmaker and rule over the people of the axe you should not live far from the shadow of the axe thenceforward maid zinita  it is well wolfman though some might not wish to dwell in that shadow but first you must win the axe many have tried and all have failed  yet one must succeed at last he said and so farewell and he leaped into the torrent of the river and swam it with great strokes  now the maid zinita watched him till he was gone and love of him entered into her hearta love that was fierce and jealous and strong but as he wended to the ghost mountain umslopogaas thought rather of axe groanmaker than of maid zinita for ever at the bottom umslopogaas loved war more than women though this has been his fate that women have brought sorrow on his head  fifteen days must pass before the day of the new moon and during this time umslopogaas thought much and said little still he told galazi something of the tale and that he was determined to do battle with jikiza the unconquered for the axe groanmaker galazi said that he would do well to let it be and that it was better to stay with the wolves than to go out seeking strange weapons he said also that even if he won the axe the matter might not stay there for he must take the girl also and his heart boded no good of women it had been a girl who poisoned his father in the kraals of the halakazi to all of which umslopogaas answered nothing for his heart was set both on the axe and the girl but more on the first than the last  so the time wore on and at length came the day of the new moon at the dawn of that day umslopogaas arose and clad himself in a moocha binding the shewolfs skin round his middle beneath the moocha in his hand he took a stout fightingshield which he had made of buffalo hide and that same light moonshaped axe with which he had slain the captain of chaka  a poor weapon with which to kill jikiza the unconquerable said galazi eyeing it askance  it shall serve my turn answered umslopogaas  now umslopogaas ate and then they moved together slowly down the mountain and crossed the river by a ford for he wished to save his strength on the farther side of the river galazi hid himself in the reeds because his face was known and there umslopogaas bade him farewell not knowing if he should look upon him again afterwards he walked up to the great place of jikiza now when he reached the gates of the kraal he saw that many people were streaming through them and mingled with the people presently they came to the open space in front of the huts of jikiza and there the headmen were gathered together in the centre of them and before a heap of the skulls of men which were piled up against his doorposts sat jikiza a huge man a hairy and a proud who glared about him rolling his eyes fastened to his arm by a thong of leather was the great axe groanmaker and each man as he came up saluted the axe calling it inkosikaas or chieftainess but he did not salute jikiza umslopogaas sat down with the people in front of the councillors and few took any notice of him except zinita who moved sullenly to and fro bearing gourds of beer to the councillors near to jikiza on his right hand sat a fat man with small and twinkling eyes who watched the maid zinita greedily  yon man thought umslopogaas is masilo the better for bloodletting will you be masilo  presently jikiza spoke rolling his eyes this is the matter before you councillors i have settled it in my mind to give my stepdaughter zinita in marriage to masilo but the marriage gift is not yet agreed on i demand a hundred head of cattle from masilo for the maid is fair and straight a proper maid and moreover my daughter though not of my blood but masilo offers fifty head only therefore i ask you to settle it  we hear you lord of the axe answered one of the councillors but first o unconquered you must on this day of the year according to ancient custom give public challenge to any man to fight you for the groanmaker and for your place as chief of the people of the axe  this is a wearisome thing grumbled jikiza can i never have done in it fiftyandthree have i slain in my youth without a wound and now for many years i have challenged like a cock on a dunghill and none crow in answer  ho now is there any man who will come forward and do battle with me jikiza for the great axe groanmaker to him who can win it it shall be and with it the chieftainship of the people of the axe  thus he spoke very fast as a man gabbles a prayer to a spirit in whom he has little faith then turned once more to talk of the cattle of masilo and of the maid zinita but suddenly umslopogaas stood up looking at him over the top of his war shield and crying here is one o jikiza who will do battle with you for the axe groanmaker and for the chieftainship that is to him who holds the axe  now all the people laughed and jikiza glared at him  come forth from behind that big shield of yours he said come out and tell me your name and lineageyou who would do battle with the unconquered for the ancient axe  then umslopogaas came forward and he looked so fierce though he was but young that the people laughed no more  what is my name and lineage to you jikiza he said let it be and hasten to do me battle as you must by the custom for i am eager to handle the groanmaker and to sit in your seat and settle this matter of the cattle of masilo the pig when i have killed you i will take a name who now have none  now once more the people laughed but jikiza grew mad with wrath and sprang up gasping  what he said you dare to speak thus to me you babe unweaned to me the unconquered the holder of the axe never did i think to live to hear such talk from a longlegged pup on to the cattle kraal to the cattle kraal people of the axe that i may hew this braggarts head from his shoulders he would stand in my place would hethe place that i and my fathers have held for four generations by virtue of the axe i tell you all that presently i will stand upon his head and then we will settle the matter of masilo  babble not so fast man quoth umslopogaas or if you must babble speak those words which you would say ere you bid the sun farewell  now jikiza choked with rage and foam came from his lips so that he could not speak but the people found this sportall except masilo who looked askance at the stranger tall and fierce and zinita who looked at masilo and with no love so they moved down to the cattle kraal and galazi seeing it from afar could keep away no longer but drew near and mingled with the crowd    chapter xvii umslopogaas becomes chief of the people of the axe  now when umslopogaas and jikiza the unconquered had come to the cattle kraal they were set in its centre and there were ten paces between them umslopogaas was armed with the great shield and the light moonshaped axe jikiza carried the groanmaker and a small dancing shield and looking at the weapons of the two people thought that the stranger would furnish no sport to the holder of the axe  he is illarmed said an old man it should be otherwiselarge axe small shield jikiza is unconquerable and the big shield will not help this longlegged stranger when groanmaker rattles on the buffalo hide the old man spoke thus in the hearing of galazi the wolf and galazi thought that he spoke wisely and sorrowed for the fate of his brother  now the word was given and jikiza rushed on umslopogaas roaring for his rage was great but umslopogaas did not stir till his foe was about to strike then suddenly he leaped aside and as jikiza passed he smote him hard upon the back with the flat of his axe making a great sound for it was not his plan to try and kill jikiza with this axe now a shout of laughter went up from the hundreds of the people and the heart of jikiza nearly burst with rage because of the shame of that blow round he came like a bull that is mad and once more rushed at umslopogaas who lifted his shield to meet him then of a sudden just when the great axe leapt on high umslopogaas uttered a cry as of fear and turning fled before the face of jikiza now once more the shout of laughter went up while umslopogaas fled swiftly and after him rushed jikiza blind with fury round and about the kraal sped umslopogaas scarcely a spears length ahead of jikiza and he ran keeping his back to the sun as much as might be that he might watch the shadow of jikiza a second time he sped round while the people cheered the chase as hunters cheer a dog which pursues a buck so cunningly did umslopogaas run that though he seemed to reel with weakness in such fashion that men thought his breath was gone yet he went ever faster and faster drawing jikiza after him  now when umslopogaas knew by the breathing of his foe and by the staggering of his shadow that his strength was spent suddenly he made as though he were about to fall himself and stumbled out of the path far to the right and as he stumbled he let drop his great shield full in the way of jikizas feet then it came about that jikiza rushing on blindly caught his feet in the shield and fell headlong to earth umslopogaas saw and swooped on him like an eagle to a dove before men could so much as think he had seized the axe groanmaker and with a blow of the steel he held had severed the thong of leather which bound it to the wrist of jikiza and sprung back holding the great axe aloft and casting down his own weapon upon the ground now the watchers saw all the cunning of his fight and those of them who hated jikiza shouted aloud but others were silent  slowly jikiza gathered himself from the ground wondering if he were still alive and as he rose he grasped the little axe of umslopogaas and looking at it he wept but umslopogaas held up the great groanmaker the iron chieftainess and examined its curved points of blue steel the gouge that stands behind it and the beauty of its haft bound about with wire of brass and ending in a knob like the knob of a stick as a lover looks upon the beauty of his bride then before all men he kissed the broad blade and cried aloud  greeting to thee my chieftainess greeting to thee wife of my youth whom i have won in war never shall we part thou and i and together will we die thou and i for i am not minded that others should handle thee when i am gone  thus he cried in the hearing of men then turned to jikiza who stood weeping because he had lost all  where now is your pride o unconquered laughed umslopogaas fight on you are as well armed as i was a while ago when i did not fear to stand before you  jikiza looked at him for a moment then with a curse he hurled the little axe at him and turning fled swiftly towards the gates of the cattle kraal  umslopogaas stooped and the little axe sped over him then he stood for a while watching and the people thought that he meant to let jikiza go but that was not his desire he waited indeed until jikiza had covered nearly half the space between him and the gate then with a roar he leaped forward as light leaps from a cloud and so fast did his feet fly that the watchers could scarce see them move jikiza fled fast also yet he seemed but as one who stands still now he reached the gate of the kraal now there was rush a light of downward falling steel and something swept past him then behold jikiza fell in the gateway of the cattle kraal and all saw that he was dead smitten to death by that mighty axe groanmaker which he and his fathers had held for many years  a great shout went up from the crowd of watchers when they knew that jikiza the unconquered was killed at last and there were many who hailed umslopogaas naming him chief and lord of the people of the axe but the sons of jikiza to the number of ten great men and brave rushed on umslopogaas to kill him umslopogaas ran backwards lifting up the groanmaker when certain councillors of the people flung themselves in between them crying hold  is not this your law ye councillors said umslopogaas that having conquered the chief of the people of the axe i myself am chief  that is our law indeed stranger answered an aged councillor but this also is our law that now you must do battle one by one with all who come against you so it was in my fathers time when the grandfather of him who now lies dead won the axe and so it must be again today  i have nothing to say against the rule said umslopogaas now who is there who will come up against me to do battle for the axe groanmaker and the chieftainship of the people of the axe  then all the ten sons of jikiza stepped forward as one man for their hearts were made with wrath because of the death of their father and because the chieftainship had gone from their race so that in truth they cared little if they lived or died but there were none besides these for all men feared to stand before umslopogaas and the groanmaker  umslopogaas counted them there are ten by the head of chaka he cried now if i must fight all these one by one no time will be left to me this day to talk of the matter of masilo and of the maid zinita hearken what say you sons of jikiza the conquered if i find one other to stand beside me in the fray and all of you come on at once against us twain ten against two to slay us or be slain will that be to your minds  the brethren consulted together and held that so they should be in better case than if they went up one by one  so be it they said and the councillors assented  now as he fled round and round umslopogaas had seen the face of galazi his brother in the throng and knew that he hungered to share the fight so he called aloud that he whom he should choose and who would stand back to back with him in the fray if victory were theirs should be the first after him among the people of the axe and as he called he walked slowly down the line scanning the faces of all till he came to where galazi stood leaning on the watcher  here is a great fellow who bears a great club said umslopogaas how are you named fellow  i am named wolf answered galazi  say now wolf are you willing to stand back to back with me in this fray of two against ten if victory is ours you shall be next to me amongst this people  better i love the wild woods and the mountains breast than the kraals of men and the kiss of wives axebearer answered galazi yet because you have shown yourself a warrior of might and to taste again of the joy of battle i will stand back to back with you axebearer and see this matter ended  a bargain wolf cried umslopogaas and they walked side by sidea mighty pairtill they came to the centre of the cattle kraal all there looked on them wondering and it came into the thoughts of some of them that these were none other than the wolfbrethren who dwelt upon the ghost mountain  now axe groanmaker and club watcher are come together galazi said umslopogaas as they walked and i think that few can stand before them  some shall find it so answered galazi at the least the fray will be merry and what matter how frays end  ah said umslopogaas victory is good but death ends all and is best of all  then they spoke of the fashion in which they would fight and umslopogaas looked curiously at the axe he carried and at the point on its hammer balancing it in his hand when he had looked long the pair took their stand back to back in the centre of the kraal and people saw that umslopogaas held the axe in a new fashion its curved blade being inwards towards his breast and the hollow point turned towards the foe the ten brethren gathered themselves together shaking their assegais five of them stood before umslopogaas and five before galazi the wolf they were all great men made fierce with rage and shame  now nothing except witchcraft can save these two said a councillor to one who stood by him  yet there is virtue in the axe answered the other and for the club it seems that i know it i think it is named watcher of the fords and woe to those who stand before the watcher i myself have seen him aloft when i was young moreover these are no cravens who hold the axe and the club they are but lads indeed yet they have drunk wolfs milk  meanwhile an aged man drew near to speak the word of onset it was that same man who had set out the law to umslopogaas he must give the signal by throwing up a spear and when it struck the ground then the fight would begin the old man took the spear and threw it but his hand was weak and he cast so clumsily that it fell among the sons of jikiza who stood before umslopogaas causing them to open up to let it pass between them and drawing the eyes of all ten of them to it but umslopogaas watched for the touching of the spear only being careless where it touched as the point of it kissed the earth he said a word and lo umslopogaas and galazi not waiting for the onslaught of the ten as men had thought they must sprang forward each at the line of foes who were before him while the ten still stood confused for it had been their plan to attack the wolfbrethren were upon them groanmaker was up but as for no great stroke he did but peck as a bird pecks with his bill and yet a man dropped dead the watcher also was up but he fell like a falling tree and was the death of one through the lines of the ten passed the wolfbrethren in the gaps that each had made then they turned swiftly and charged towards each other again again groanmaker pecked again the watcher thundered and lo once more umslopogaas stood back to back unhurt but before them lay four men dead  the onslaught and the return were so swift that men scarcely understood what had been done even those of the sons of jikiza who were left stared at each other wondering then they knew that they were but six for four of them were dead with a shout of rage they rushed upon the pair from both sides but in either case one was the most eager and outstepped the other two and thus it came about that time was given the wolfbrethren to strike at him alone before his fellows were at his side he who came at umslopogaas drove at him with his spear but he was not to be caught thus for he bent his middle sideways so that the spear only cut his skin and as he bent tapped with the point of the axe at the head of the smiter dealing death on him  yonder woodpecker has a bill of steel and he can use it well said the councillor to him who stood by him  this is a slaughterer indeed the man answered and the people heard the names thenceforth they knew umslopogaas as the woodpecker and as bulalio or the slaughterer and by no other names now he who came at galazi the wolf rushed on wildly holding his spear short but galazi was cunning in war he took one step forward to meet him then swinging the watcher backward he let him fall at the full length of arms and club the child of jikiza lifted his shield to catch the blow but the shield was to the watcher what a leaf is to the wind full on its hide the huge club fell making a loud sound the warshield doubled up like a raw skin and he who bore it fell crushed to the earth  now for a moment the four who were left of the sons of jikiza hovered round the pair feinting at them from afar but never coming within reach of axe or club one threw a spear indeed and though umslopogaas leaped aside and as it sped towards him smote the haft in two with the blade of groanmaker yet its head flew on wounding galazi in the flank then he who had thrown the spear turned to fly for his hands were empty and the others followed swiftly for the heart was out of them and they dared to do battle with these two no more  thus the fight was ended and from its beginning till the finish was not longer than the time in which men might count a hundred slowly  it seems that none are left for us to kill galazi said umslopogaas laughing aloud ah that was a cunning fight ho you sons of the unconquered who run so fast stay your feet i give you peace you shall live to sweep my huts and to plough my fields with the other women of my kraal now councillors the fighting is done so let us to the chiefs hut where masilo waits us and he turned and went with galazi and after him followed all the people wondering and in silence  when he reached the hut umslopogaas sat himself down in the place where jikiza had sat that morning and the maid zinita came to him with a wet cloth and washed the wound that the spear had made he thanked her then she would have washed galazis wound also and this was deeper but galazi bade her to let him be roughly as he would have no woman meddling with his wounds for neither then nor at any other time did galazi turn to women but he hated zinita most of them all  then umslopogaas spoke to masilo the pig who sat before him with a frightened face saying it seems o masilo that you have sought this maid zinita in marriage and against her will persecuting her now i had intended to kill you as an offering to her anger but there has been enough bloodletting today yet you shall have a marriage gift to this girl whom i myself will take in marriage you shall give a hundred head of cattle then get you gone from among the people of the axe lest a worse thing befall you masilo the pig  so masilo rose up and went and his face was green with fear but he paid the hundred head of cattle and fled towards the kraal of chaka zinita watched him go and she was glad of it and because the slaughterer had named her for his wife  i am well rid of masilo she said aloud in the hearing of galazi but i had been better pleased to see him dead before me  this woman has a fierce heart thought galazi and she will bring no good to umslopogaas my brother  now the councillors and the captains of the people of the axe konzaed to him whom they named the slaughterer doing homage to him as chief and holder of the axe and also they did homage to the axe itself so umslopogaas became chief over this people and their number was many and he grew great and fat in cattle and wives and none dared to gainsay him from time to time indeed a man ventured to stand up before him in fight but none could conquer him and in a little while no one sought to face groanmaker when he lifted himself to peck  galazi also was great among the people but dwelt with them little for best he loved the wild woods and the mountains breast and often as of old he swept at night across the forest and the plains and the howling of the ghostwolves went with him  but henceforth umslopogaas the slaughterer hunted very rarely with the wolves at night he slept at the side of zinita and she loved him much and bore him children    chapter xviii the curse of baleka  now my father my story winds back again as the river bends towards its source and i tell of those events which happened at the kings kraal of gibamaxegu which you white people name gibbeclack the kraal that is called pickouttheoldmen for it was there that chaka murdered all the aged who were unfit for war  after i mopo had stood before the king and he had given me new wives and fat cattle and a kraal to dwell in the bones of unandi the great mother elephant mother of the heavens were gathered together from the ashes of my huts and because all could not be found some of the bones of my wives were collected also to make up the number but chaka never knew this when all were brought together a great pit was dug and the bones were set out in order in the pit and buried but not alone for round them were placed twelve maidens of the servants of unandi and these maidens were covered over with the earth and left to die in the pit by the bones of unandi their mistress moreover all those who were present at the burial were made into a regiment and commanded that they should dwell by the grave for the space of a year they were many my father but i was not one of them also chaka gave orders that no crops should be sown that year that the milk of the cows should be spilled upon the ground and that no woman should give birth to a child for a full year and that if any should dare to bear children then that they should be slain and their husbands with them and for a space of some months these things were done my father and great sorrow came upon the land  then for a little while there was quiet and chaka went about heavily and he wept often and we who waited on him wept also as we walked till at length it came about by use that we could weep without ceasing for many hours no angry woman can weep as we wept in those days it was an art my father for the teaching of which i received many cattle for woe to him who had no tears in those days then it was also that chaka sent out the captain and fifty soldiers to search for umslopogaas for though he said nothing more to me of this matter he did not believe all the tale that i had told him of the death of umslopogaas in the jaws of a lion and the tale of those who were with me how that company fared at the hands of umslopogaas and of galazi the wolf and at the fangs of the people black and grey i have told you my father none of them ever came back again in after days it was reported to the king that these soldiers were missing never having returned but he only laughed saying that the lion which ate umslopogaas son of mopo was a fierce one and had eaten them also  at last came the night of the new moon that dreadful night to be followed by a more dreadful morrow i sat in the kraal of chaka and he put his arm about my neck and groaned and wept for his mother whom he had murdered and i groaned also but i did not weep because it was dark and on the morrow i must weep much in the sight of king and men therefore i spared my tears lest they should fail me in my need  all night long the people drew on from every side towards the kraal and as they came in thousands and tens of thousands they filled the night with their cries till it seemed as though the whole world were mourning and loudly none might cease their crying and none dared to drink so much as a cup of water the daylight came and chaka rose saying come let us go forth mopo and look on those who mourn with us so we went out and after us came men armed with clubs to do the bidding of the king  outside the kraal the people were gathered and their number was countless as the leaves upon the trees on every side the land was black with them as at times the veldt is black with game when they saw the king they ceased from their howling and sang the warsong then once again they howled and chaka walked among them weeping now my father the sight became dreadful for as the sun rose higher the day grew hot and utter weariness came upon the people who were packed together like herds of cattle and though oxen slain in sacrifice lay around they might neither eat nor drink some fell to the ground and were trampled to death others took too much snuff to make them weep others stained their eyes with saliva others walked to and fro their tongues hanging from their jaws while groans broke from their parched throats  now mopo we shall learn who are the wizards that have brought these ills upon us said the king and who are the truehearted men  as we spoke we cam upon a man a chief of renown he was named zwaumbana chief of the amabovus and with him were his wives and followers this man could weep no more he gasped with thirst and heat the king looked at him  see mopo he said see that brute who has no tears for my mother who is dead oh the monster without a heart shall such as he live to look upon the sun while i and thou must weep mopo never never take him away and all those who are with him take them away the people without hearts who do not weep because my mother is dead by witchcraft  and chaka walked on weeping and i followed also weeping but the chief zwaumbana and those with him were all slain by those who do the bidding of the king and the slayers also must weep as they slew presently we came upon another man who seeing the king took snuff secretly to bring tears to his eyes but the glance of chaka was quick and he noted it  look at him mopo he said look at the wizard who has no tears though my mother is dead by witchcraft see he takes snuff to bring tears to his eyes that are dry with wickedness take him away the heartless brute oh take him away  so this one also was killed and these were but the first of thousands for presently chaka grew mad with wickedness with fury and with the lust of blood he walked to and fro weeping going now and again into his hut to drink beer and i with him for he said that we who sorrowed must have food and ever as he walked he would wave his arm or his assegai saying take them away the heartless brutes who do not weep because my mother is dead and those who chanced to stand before his arm were killed till at length the slayers could slay no more and themselves were slain because their strength had failed them and they had no more tears and i also i must slay lest if i slew not i should myself be slain  and now at length the people also went mad with their thirst and the fury of their fear they fell upon each other killing each other every man who had a foe sought him out and killed him none were spared the place was but a shambles there on that day died full seven thousand men and still chaka walked weeping among them saying take them away the heartless brutes take them away yet my father there was cunning in his cruelty for though he destroyed many for sport alone also he slew on this day all those whom he hated or whom he feared  at length the night came down the sun sank red that day all the sky was like blood and blood was all the earth beneath then the killing ceased because none had now the strength to kill and the people lay panting in heaps upon the ground the living and the dead together i looked at them and saw that if they were not allowed to eat and drink before day dawned again the most of them would be dead and i spoke to the king for i cared little in that hour if i lived or died even my hope of vengeance was forgotten in the sickness of my heart  a mourning indeed o king i said a merry mourning for truehearted men but for wizards a mourning such as they do not love i think that thy sorrows are avenged o king thy sorrows and mine also  not so mopo answered the king this is but the beginning our mourning was merry today it shall be merrier tomorrow  tomorrow o king few will be left to mourn for the land will be swept of men  why mopo son of makedama but a few have perished of all the thousands who are gathered together number the people and they will not be missed  but a few have died beneath the assegai and the kerrie o king yet hunger and thirst shall finish the spears work the people have neither eaten nor drunk for a day and a night and for a day and a night they have wailed and moaned look without black one there they lie in heaps with the dead by tomorrows light they also will be dead or dying  now chaka thought awhile and he saw that the work would go too far leaving him but a small people over whom to rule  it is hard mopo he said that thou and i must mourn alone over our woes while these dogs feast and make merry yet because of the gentleness of my heart i will deal gently with them go out son of makedama and bid my children eat and drink if they have the heart for this mourning is ended scarcely will unandi my mother sleep well seeing that so little blood has been shed on her gravesurely her spirit will haunt my dreams yet because of the gentleness of my heart i declare this mourning ended let my children eat and drink if indeed they have the heart  happy are the people over whom such a king is set i said in answer then i went out and told the words of chaka to the chiefs and captains and those of them who had the voice left to them praised the goodness of the king but the most gave over sucking the dew from their sticks and rushed to the water like cattle that have wandered five days in the desert and drank their fill some of them were trampled to death in the water  afterwards i slept as i might best it was not well my father for i knew that chaka was not yet gutted with slaughter  on the morrow many of the people went back to their homes having sought leave from the king others drew away the dead to the place of bones and yet others were sent out in impis to kill such as had not come to the mourning of the king when midday was past chaka said that he would walk and ordered me and other of his indunas and servants to walk with him we went on in silence the king leaning on my shoulder as on a stick what of thy people mopo he said at length what of the langeni tribe were they at my mourning i did not see them  then i answered that i did not know they had been summoned but the way was long and the time short for so many to march so far  dogs should run swiftly when their master calls mopo my servant said chaka and the dreadful light came into his eyes that never shone in the eyes of any other man then i grew sick at heart my fatheray though i loved my people little and they had driven me away i grew sick at heart now we had come to a spot where there is a great rift of black rock and the name of that rift is udongalukatatiyana on either side of this donga the ground slopes steeply down towards its yawning lips and from its end a man may see the open country here chaka sat down at the end of the rift pondering presently he looked up and saw a vast multitude of men women and children who wound like a snake across the plain beneath towards the kraal gibamaxegu  i think mopo said the king that by the colour of their shields yonder should be the langeni tribethine own people mopo  it is my people o king i answered  then chaka sent messengers running swiftly and bade them summon the langeni people to him where he sat other messengers he sent also to the kraal whispering in their ears but what he said i did not know then  now for a while chaka watched the long black snake of men winding towards him across the plain till the messengers met them and the snake began to climb the slope of the hill  how many are these people of thine mopo asked the king  i know not o elephant i answered who have not seen them for many years perhaps they number three full regiments  nay more said the king what thinkest thou mopo would this people of thine fill the rift behind us and he nodded at the gulf of stone  now my father i trembled in all my flesh seeing the purpose of chaka but i could find no words to say for my tongue clave to the roof of my mouth  the people are many said chaka yet mopo i bet thee fifty head of cattle that they will not fill the donga  the king is pleased to jest i said  yea mopo i jest yet as a jest take thou the bet  as the king wills i murmuredwho could not refuse now the people of my tribe drew near at their head was an old man with white hair and beard and looking at him i knew him for my father makedama when he came within earshot of the king he gave him the royal salute of bayete and fell upon his hands and knees crawling towards him and konzaed to the king praising him as he came all the thousands of the people also fell on their hands and knees and praised the king aloud and the sound of their praising was like the sound of a great thunder  at length makedama my father writhing on his breast like a snake lay before the majesty of the king chaka bade him rise and greeted him kindly but all the thousands of the people yet lay upon their breasts beating the dust with their heads  rise makedama my child father of the people of the langeni said chaka and tell me why art thou late in coming to my mourning  the way was far o king answered makedama my father who did not know me the way was far and the time short moreover the women and the children grew weary and footsore and they are weary in this hour  speak not of it makedama my child said the king surely thy heart mourned and that of thy people and soon they shall rest from their weariness say are they here every one  every one o elephantnone are wanting my kraals are desolate the cattle wander untended on the hills birds pick at the unguarded crops  it is well makedama thou faithful servant yet thou wouldst mourn with me an houris it not so now hearken bid thy people pass to the right and to the left of me and stand in all their numbers upon the slopes of the grass that run down to the lips of the rift  so makedama my father bade the people do the bidding of the king for neither he nor the indunas saw his purpose but i who knew his wicked heart i saw it then the people filed past to the right and to the left by hundreds and by thousands and presently the grass of the slopes could be seen no more because of their number when all had passed chaka spoke again to makedama my father bidding him climb down to the bottom of the donga and thence lift up his voice in mourning the old man obeyed the king slowly and with much pain he clambered to the bottom of the rift and stood there it was so deep and narrow that the light scarcely seemed to reach to where he stood for i could only see the white of his hair gleaming far down in the shadows  then standing far beneath he lifted up his voice and it reached the thousands of those who clustered upon the slopes it seemed still and small yet it came to them faintly like the voice of one speaking from a mountaintop in a time of snow  mourn children of makedama  and all the thousands of the peoplemen women and childrenechoed his words in a thunder of sound crying  mourn children of makedama  again he cried  mourn people of the langeni mourn with the whole world  and the thousands answered  mourn people of the langeni mourn with the whole world  a third time came his voice  mourn children of makedama mourn people of the langeni mourn with the whole world  howl ye warriors weep ye women beat your breasts ye maidens sob ye little children  drink of the water of tears cover yourselves with the dust of affliction  mourn o tribe of the langeni because the mother of the heavens is no more  mourn children of makedama because the spirit of fruitfulness is no more  mourn o ye people because the lion of the zulu is left so desolate  let your tears fall as the rain falls let your cries be as the cries of women who bring forth  for sorrow is fallen like the rain the world has conceived and brought forth death  great darkness is upon us darkness and the shadow of death  the lion of the zulu wanders and wanders in desolation because the mother of the heavens is no more  who shall bring him comfort there is comfort in the crying of his children  mourn people of the langeni let the voice of your mourning beat against the skies and rend them  ouai ouai ouai  thus sang the old man my father makedama far down in the deeps of the cleft he sang it in a still small voice but line after line his song was caught up by the thousands who stood on the slopes above and thundered to the heavens till the mountains shook with its sound moreover the noise of their crying opened the bosom of a heavy raincloud that had gathered as they mourned and the rain fell in great slow drops as though the sky also wept and with the rain came lightning and the roll of thunder  chaka listened and large tears coursed down his cheeks whose heart was easily stirred by the sound of song now the rain hissed fiercely making as it were a curtain about the thousands of the people but still their cry went up through the rain and the roll of the thunder was lost in it presently there came a hush and i looked to the right there above the heads of the people coming over the brow of the hill were the plumes of warriors and in their hands gleamed a hedge of spears i looked to the left there also i saw the plumes of warriors dimly through the falling rain and in their hands a hedge of spears i looked before me towards the end of the cleft there also loomed the plumes of warriors and in their hands was a hedge of spears  then from all the people there arose another cry a cry of terror and of agony  ah now they mourn indeed mopo said chaka in my ear now thy people mourn from the heart and not with the lips alone  as he spoke the multitude of the people on either side of the rift surged forward like a wave surged back again once more surged forward then with a dreadful crying driven on by the merciless spears of the soldiers they began to fall in a torrent of men women and children far into the black depths below        my father forgive me the tears that fall from these blind eyes of mine i am very aged i am but as a little child and as a little child i weep i cannot tell it at last it was done and all grew still        thus was makedama buried beneath the bodies of his people thus was ended the tribe of the langeni as my mother had dreamed so it came about and thus did chaka take vengeance for that cup of milk which was refused to him many a year before  thou hast not won thy bet mopo said the king presently see there is a little space where one more may find room to sleep full to the brim is this cornchamber with the ears of death in which no living grain is left yet there is one little space and is there not one to fill it are all the tribe of the langeni dead indeed  there is one o king i answered i am of the tribe of the langeni let my carcase fill the place  nay mopo nay who then should take the bet moreover i slay thee not for it is against my oath also do we not mourn together thou and i  there is no other left living of the tribe of the langeni o king the bet is lost it shall be paid  i think that there is another said chaka there is a sister to thee and me mopo ah see she comes  i looked up my father and i saw this i saw baleka my sister walking towards us and on her shoulders was a kaross of wildcat skins and behind her were two soldiers she walked proudly holding her head high and her step was like the step of a queen now she saw the sight of death for the dead lay before her like black water in a sunless pool a moment she stood shivering having guessed all then walked on and stood before chaka  what is thy will with me o king she said  thou art come in a good hour sister said chaka turning his eyes from hers it is thus mopo my servant and thy brother made a bet with me a bet of cattle it was a little matter that we wagered onas to whether the people of the langeni tribethine own tribe baleka my sisterwould fill yonder place udongalukatatiyana when they heard of the bet my sister the people of the langeni hurled themselves into the rift by thousands being eager to put the matter to the proof and now it seems that thy brother has lost the bet for there is yet place for one yonder ere the donga is full then my sister thy brother mopo brought it to my mind that there was still one of the langeni tribe left upon the earth who should she sleep in that place would turn the bet in his favour and prayed me to send for her so my sister as i would not take that which i have not won i have done so and now do thou go apart and talk with mopo thy brother alone upon this matter as once before thou didst talk when a child was born to thee my sister  now baleka took no heed of the words of chaka which he spoke of me for she knew his meaning well only she looked him in the eyes and said  ill shalt thou sleep from this night forth chaka till thou comest to a land where no sleep is i have spoken  chaka saw and heard and of a sudden he quailed growing afraid in his heart and turned his head away  mopo my brother said baleka let us speak together for the last time it is the kings word  so i drew apart with baleka my sister and a spear was in my hand we stood together alone by the people of the dead and baleka threw the corner of the kaross about her brows and spoke to me swiftly from beneath its shadow  what did i say to you a while ago mopo it has come to pass swear to me that you will live on and that this same hand of yours shall taken vengeance for me  i swear it my sister  swear to me that when the vengeance is done you will seek out my son umslopogaas if he still lives and bless him in my name  i swear it my sister  fare you well mopo we have always loved each other much and now all fades and it seems to me that once more we are little children playing about the kraals of the langeni so may we play again in another land now mopoand she looked at me steadily and with great eyesi am weary i would join the spirits of my people i hear them calling in my ears it is finished        for the rest i will not tell it to you my father    chapter xix masilo comes to the kraal duguza  that night the curse of baleka fell upon chaka and he slept ill so ill did he sleep that he summoned me to him bidding me walk abroad with him i went and we walked alone and in silence chaka leading the way and i following after him now i saw that his feet led him towards the udongalukatatiyana that place where all my people lay dead and with them baleka my sister we climbed the slope of the hill slowly and came to the mouth of the cleft to that same spot where chaka had stood when the people fell over the lips of the rock like water then there had been noise and crying now there was silence for the night was very still the moon was full also and lighted up the dead who lay near to us so that i could see them all yes i could see even the face of baleka my sisterthey had thrown her into the midst of the dead never had it looked so beautiful as in this hour and yet as i gazed i grew afraid only the far end of the donga was hid in shadow  thou wouldst not have won thy bet now mopo my servant said chaka see they have sunk together the donga is not full by the length of a stabbingspear  i did not answer but at the sound of the kings voice jackals stirred and slunk away  presently he spoke again laughing loudly as he spoke thou shouldst sleep well this night my mother for i have sent many to hush thee to rest ah people of the langeni tribe you forgot but i remembered you forgot how a woman and a boy came to you seeking food and shelter and you would give them noneno not a gourd of milk what did i promise you on that day people of the langeni tribe did i not promise you that for every drop the gourd i craved would hold i would take the life of a man and have i not kept my promise do not men lie here more in number than the drops of water in a gourd and with them woman and children countless as the leaves o people of the langeni tribe who refused me milk when i was little having grown great i am avenged upon you having grown great ah who is there so great as i the earth shakes beneath my feet when i speak the people tremble when i frown they diethey die in thousands i have grown great and great i shall remain the land is mine far as the feet of man can travel the land is mine and mine are those who dwell in it and i shall grow greater yetgreater ever greater is it thy face baleka that stares upon me from among the faces of the thousands whom i have slain thou didst promise me that i should sleep ill henceforth baleka i fear thee notat the least thou sleepest sound tell me balekarise from thy sleep and tell me whom there is that i should fearand suddenly he ceased the ravings of his pride  now my father while chaka the king spoke thus it came into my mind to make an end of things and kill him for my heart was made with rage and the thirst of vengeance already i stood behind him already the stick in my hand was lifted to strike out his brains when i stopped also for i saw something there in the midst of the dead i saw an arm stir it stirred it lifted itself it beckoned towards the shadow which hid the head of the cleft and the piledup corpses that lay there and it seemed to me that the arm was the arm of baleka perchance it was not her arm perchance it was but the arm of one who yet lived among the thousands of the dead say you my father at the least the arm rose at her side and was ringed with such bracelets as baleka wore and it beckoned from her side though her cold face changed not at all thrice the arm rose thrice it stood awhile in air thrice it beckoned with crooked finger as though it summoned something from the depths of the shadow and from the multitudes of the dead then it fell down and in the utter silence i heard its fall and a clank of brazen bracelets and as it fell there rose from the shadow a sound of singing of singing wild and sweet such as i had never heard the words of that song came to me then my father but afterwards they passed from me and i remember them no more only i know this that the song was of the making of things and of the beginning and the end of peoples it told of how the black folk grew and of how the white folk should eat them up and wherefore they were and wherefore they should cease to be it told of evil and of good of woman and of man and of how these war against each other and why it is that they war and what are the ends of the struggle it told also of the people of the zulu and it spoke of a place of a little hand where they should conquer and of a place where a white hand should prevail against them and how they shall melt away beneath the shadow of the white hand and be forgotten passing to a land where things do not die but live on forever the good with the good the evil with the evil it told of life and of death of joy and of sorrow of time and of that sea in which time is but a floating leaf and of why all these things are many names also came into the song and i knew but a few of them yet my own was there and the name of baleka and the name of umslopogaas and the name of chaka the lion but a little while did the voice sing yet all this was in the songay and much more but the meaning of the song is gone from me though i knew it once and shall know it again when all is done the voice in the shadow sang on till the whole place was full of the sound of its singing and even the dead seemed to listen chaka heard it and shook with fear but his ears were deaf to its burden though mine were open  the voice came nearer and now in the shadow there was a faint glow of light like the glow that gathers on the sixdays dead slowly it drew nearer through the shadow and as it came i saw that the shape of the light was the shape of a woman now i could see it well and i knew the face of glory my father it was the face of the inkosazanayzulu the queen of heaven she came towards us very slowly gliding down the gulf that was full of dead and the path she trod was paved with the dead and as she came it seemed to me that shadows rose from the dead following her the queen of the deadthousands upon thousands of them and ah her glory my fatherthe glory of her hair of molten goldof her eyes that were as the noonday skythe flash of her arms and breast that were like the driven snow when it glows in the sunset her beauty was awful to look on but i am glad to have lived to see it as it shone and changed in the shifting robe of light which was her garment  now she drew near to us and chaka sank upon the earth huddled up in fear hiding his face in his hands but i was not afraid my fatheronly the wicked need fear to look on the queen of heaven nay i was not afraid i stood upright and gazed upon her glory face to face in her hand she held a little spear hafted with the royal wood it was the shadow of the spear that chaka held in his hand the same with which he had slain his mother and wherewith he should himself be slain now she ceased her singing and stood before the crouching king and before me who was behind the king so that the light of her glory shone upon us she lifted the little spear and with it touched chaka son of senzangacona on the brow giving him to doom then she spoke but though chaka felt the touch he did not hear the words that were for my ears alone  mopo son of makedama said the low voice stay thy hand the cup of chaka is not full when for the third time thou seest me riding down the storm then smite mopo my child  thus she spoke and a cloud swept over the face of the moon when it passed she was gone and once more i was alone with chaka with the night and the dead  chaka looked up and his face was grey with the sweat of fear  who was this mopo he said in a hollow voice  this was the inkosazana of the heavens she who watches ever over the people of our race o king and who from time to time is seen of men ere great things shall befall  i have heard speak of this queen said chaka wherefore came she now what was the song she sang and why did she touch me with a spear  she came o king because the dead hand of baleka summoned her as thou sawest the song she sang was of things too high for me and why she touched thee on the forehead with the spear i do not know o king perchance it was to crown thee chief of a yet greater realm  yea perchance to crown me chief of a realm of death  that thou art already black one i answered glancing at the silent multitude before us and the cold shape of baleka  again chaka shuddered come let us be going mopo he said now i have learnt what it is to be afraid  early or late fear is a guest that all must feast even kings o earthshaker i answered and we turned and went homewards in silence  now after this night chaka gave it out that the kraal of gibamaxegu was bewitched and bewitched was the land of the zulus because he might sleep no more in peace but woke ever crying out with fear and muttering the name of baleka therefore in the end he moved his kraal far away and built the great town of duguza here in natal  look now my father there on the plain far away is a place of the white menit is called stanger there where is the white mans town stood the great kraal duguza i cannot see for my eyes are dark but you can see where the gate of the kraal was built there is a house it is the place where the white man gives out justice that is the place of the gate of the kraal through which justice never walked behind is another house where the white men who have sinned against him pray to the king of heaven for forgiveness there on that spot have i seen many a one who had done no wrong pray to a king of men for mercy but i have never seen but one who found it ou the words of chaka have come true i will tell them to you presently my father the white man holds the land he goes to and fro about his business of peace where impis ran forth to kill his children laugh and gather flowers where men died in blood by hundreds they bathe in the waters of the imbozamo where once the crocodiles were fed daily with human flesh his young men woo the maidens where other maids have kissed the assegai it is changed nothing is the same and of chaka are left only a grave yonder and a name of fear  now after chaka had come to the duguza kraal for a while he sat quiet then the old thirst of blood came on him and he sent his impis against the people of the pondos and they destroyed that people and brought back their cattle but the warriors might not rest again they were doctored for war and sent out by tens of thousands to conquer sotyangana chief of the people who live north of the limpopo they went singing after the king had looked upon them and bidden them return victorious or not at all their number was so great that from the hour of dawn till the sun was high in the heavens they passed the gates of the kraal like countless herds of cattlethey the unconquered little did they know that victory smiled on them no more that they must die by thousands of hunger and fever in the marshes of the limpopo and that those of them who returned should come with their shields in their bellies having devoured their shields because of their ravenous hunger but what of them they were nothing dust was the name of one of the great regiments that went out against sotyangana and dust they weredust to be driven to death by the breath of chaka lion of the zulu  now few men remained in the kraal duguza for nearly all had gone with the impi and only women and aged people were left dingaan and umhlangana brothers of the king were there for chaka would not suffer them to depart fearing lest they should plot against him and he looked on them always with an angry eye so that they trembled for their lives though they dared not show their fear lest fate should follow fear but i guessed it and like a snake i wound myself into their secrets and we talked together darkly and in hints but of that presently my father for i must tell of the coming of masilo he who would have wed zinita and whom umslopogaas the slaughterer had driven out from the kraals of the people of the axe  it was on the day after the impi had left that masilo came to the kraal duguza craving leave to speak with the king chaka sat before his hut and with him were dingaan and umhlangana his royal brothers i was there also and certain of the indunas councillors of the king chaka was weary that morning for he had slept badly as now he always did therefore when one told him that a certain wanderer named masilo would speak with him he did not command that the man should be killed but bade them bring him before him presently there was a sound of praising and i saw a fat man much worn with travel who crawled through the dust towards us giving the sibonga that is naming the king by his royal names chaka bade him cease from praising and tell his business then the man sat up and told all that tale which you have heard my father of how a young man great and strong came to the place of the people of the axe and conquered jikiza the holder of the axe and become chief of that people and of how he had taken the cattle of masilo and driven him away now chaka knew nothing of this people of the axe for the land was great in those days my father and there were many little tribes in it living far away of whom the king had not even heard so he questioned masilo about them and of the number of their fightingmen of their wealth in cattle of the name of the young man who ruled them and especially as to the tribute which they paid to the king  masilo answered saying that the number of their fightingmen was perhaps the half of a full regiment that their cattle were many for they were rich that they paid no tribute and that the name of the young man was bulalio the slaughtererat the least he was known by that name and he had heard no other  then the king grew wroth arise masilo he said and run to this people and speak in the ear of the people and of him who is named the slaughterer saying there is another slaughterer who sits in a kraal that is named duguza and this is his word to you o people of the axe and to thee thou who holdest the axe rise up with all the people and with all the cattle of your people and come before him who sits in the kraal duguza and lay in his hands the great axe groanmaker rise up swiftly and do this bidding lest ye sit down shortly and for the last time of all 1   1 the zulu are buried sitting  masilo heard and said that it should be so though the way was far and he feared greatly to appear before him who was called the slaughterer and who sat twenty days journey to the north beneath the shadow of the witch mountain  begone said the king and stand before me on the thirtieth day from now with the answer of this boy with an axe if thou standest not before me then some shall come to seek thee and the boy with an axe also  so masilo turned and fled swiftly to do the bidding of the king and chaka spoke no more of that matter but i wondered in my heart who this young man with an axe might be for i thought that he had dealt with jikiza and with the sons of jikiza as umslopogaas would have dealt with them had he come to the years of his manhood but i also said nothing of the matter  now on this day also there came to me news that my wife macropha and my daughter nada were dead among their people in swaziland it was said that the men of the chief of the halakazi tribe had fallen on their kraal and put all in it to the assegai and among them macropha and nada i heard the news but i wept no tear for my father i was so lost in sorrows that nothing could move me any more    chapter xx mopo bargains with the princes  eightandtwenty days went by my father and on the nineandtwentieth it befell that chaka having dreamed a dream in his troubled sleep summoned before him certain women of the kraal to the number of a hundred or more some of these were his women whom he named his sisters and some were maidens not yet given in marriage but all were young and fair now what this dream of chaka may have been i do not know or have forgotten for in those days he dreamed many dreams and all his dreams led to one end the death of men he sat in front of his hut scowling and i was with him to the left of him were gathered the girls and women and their knees were weak with fear one by one they were led before him and stood before him with bowed heads then he would bid them be of good cheer and speak softly to them and in the end would ask them this question hast thou my sister a cat in thy hut  now some would say that they had a cat and some would say that they had none and some would stand still and make no answer being dumb with fear but whatever they said the end was the same for the king would sigh gently and say fare thee well my sister it is unfortunate for thee that there is a cat in thy hut or that there is no cat in thy hut or that thou canst not tell me whether there be a cat in thy hut or no  then the woman would be taken by the slayers dragged without the kraal and their end was swift so it went on for the most part of that day till sixtyandtwo women and girls had been slaughtered but at last a maiden was brought before the king and to this one her snake had given a ready wit for when chaka asked her whether or no there was a cat in her hut she answered saying that she did not know but that there was a half a cat upon her and she pointed to a catsskin which was bound about her loins  then the king laughed and clapped his hands saying that at length his dream was answered and he killed no more that day nor ever againsave once only  that evening my heart was heavy within me and i cried in my heart how longnor might i rest so i wandered out from the kraal that was named duguza to the great cleft in the mountains yonder and sat down upon a rock high up in the cleft so that i could see the wide lands rolling to the north and the south to my right and to my left now the day was drawing towards the night and the air was very still for the heat was great and a tempest was gathering as i who am a heavenherd knew well the sun sank redly flooding the land with blood it was as though all the blood that chaka had shed flowed about the land which chaka ruled then from the womb of the night great shapes of cloud rose up and stood before the sun and he crowned them with his glory and in their hearts the lightning quivered like a blood of fire the shadow of their wings fell upon the mountain and the plains and beneath their wings was silence slowly the sun sank and the shapes of cloud gathered together like a host at the word of its captain and the flicker of the lightning was as the flash of the spears of a host i looked and my heart grew afraid the lightning died away the silence deepened and deepened till i could hear it no leaf moved no bird called the world seemed deadi alone lived in the dead world  now of a sudden my father a bright star fell from the height of heaven and lit upon the crest of the storm and as it lit the storm burst the grey air shivered a moan ran about the rocks and died away then an icy breath burst from the lips of the tempest and rushed across the earth it caught the falling star and drove it on towards me a rushing globe of fire and as it came the star grew and took shape and the shape it took was the shape of a woman i knew her now my father while she was yet far off i knew herthe inkosazana who came as she had promised riding down the storm on she swept borne forward by the blast and oh she was terrible to see for her garment was the lightning lightnings shone from her wide eyes and lightnings were in her streaming hair while in her hand was a spear of fire and she shook it as she came now she was at the mouth of the pass before her was stillness behind her beat the wings of the storm the thunder roared the rain hissed like snakes she rushed on past me and as she passed she turned her awful eyes upon me withering me she was there she was gone but she spoke no word only shook her flaming spear yet it seemed to me that the storm spoke that the rocks cried aloud that the rain hissed out a word in my ear and the word was  smite mopo  i heard it in my heart or with my ears what does it matter then i turned to look through the rush of the tempest and the reek of the rain still i could see her sweeping forward high in air now the kraal duguza was beneath her feet and the flaming spear fell from her hand upon the kraal and fire leaped up in answer  then she passed on over the edge of the world seeking her own place thus my father for the third and last time did my eyes see the inkosazanayzulu or mayhap my heart dreamed that i saw her soon i shall see her again but it will not be here  for a while i sat there in the cleft then i rose and fought my way through the fury of the storm back to the kraal duguza as i drew near the kraal i heard cries of fear coming through the roaring of the wind and the hiss of the rain i entered and asked one of the matter and it was told me that fire from above had fallen on the hut of the king as he lay sleeping and all the roof of the hut was burned away but that the rain had put out the fire  then i went on till i came to the front of the great hut and i saw by the light of the moon which now shone out in the heavens that there before it stood chaka shaking with fear and the water of the rain was running down him while he stared at the great hut of which all the thatch was burned  i saluted the king asking him what evil thing had happened seeing me he seized me by the arm and clung to me as when the slayers are at hand a child clings to his father drawing me after him into a small hut that was near  what evil thing has befallen o king i said again when light had been made  little have i known of fear mopo said chaka yet i am afraid now ay as much afraid as when once on a bygone night the dead hand of baleka summoned something that walked upon the faces of the dead  and what fearest thou o king who art the lord of all the earth  now chaka leaned forward and whispered to me hearken mopo i have dreamed a dream when the judgment of those witches was done with i went and laid me down to sleep while it was yet light for i can scarcely sleep at all when darkness has swallowed up the world my sleep has gone from methat sister of thine baleka took my sleep with her to the place of death i laid me down and i slept but a dream arose and sat by me with a hooded face and showed me a picture it seemed to me that the wall of my hut fell down and i saw an open place and in the centre of the place i lay dead covered with many wounds while round my corpse my brothers dingaan and umhlangana stalked in pride like lions on the shoulders of umhlangana was my royal kaross and there was blood on the kaross and in the hand of dingaan was my royal spear and there was blood upon the spear then in the vision of my dream mopo thou didst draw near and lifting thy hand didst give the royal salute of bayete to these brothers of mine and with thy foot didst spurn the carcase of me thy king then the hooded dream pointed upwards and was gone and i awoke and lo fire burned in the roof of my hut thus i dreamed mopo and now my servant say thou wherefore should i not slay thee thou who wouldst serve other kings than i thou who wouldst give my royal salute to the princes my brothers and he glared upon me fiercely  as thou wilt o king i answered gently doubtless thy dream was evil and yet more evil was the omen of the fire that fell upon thy hut and yet and i ceased  and yetmopo thou faithless servant  and yet o king it seems to me in my folly that it were well to strike the head of the snake and not its tail for without the tail the head may live but not the tail without the head  thou wouldst say mopo that if these princes die never canst thou or any other man give them the royal names do i hear aright mopo  who am i that i should lift up my voice asking for the blood of princes i answered judge thou o king  now chaka brooded awhile then he spoke say mopo can it be done this night  there are but few men in the kraal o king all are gone out to war and of those few many are the servants of the princes and perhaps they might give blow for blow  how then mopo  nay i know not o king yet at the great kraal beyond the river sits that regiment which is named the slayers by midday tomorrow they might be here and then  thou speakest wisely my child mopo it shall be for tomorrow go summon the regiment of the slayers and mopo see that thou fail me not  if i fail thee o king then i fail myself for it seems that my life hangs on this matter  if all the words that ever passed thy lips are lies yet is that word true mopo said chaka moreover know this my servant if aught miscarries thou shalt die no common death begone  i hear the king i answered and went out  now my father i knew well that chaka had doomed me to die though first he would use me to destroy the princes but i feared nothing for i knew this also that the hour of chaka was come at last  for a while i sat in my hut pondering then when all men slept i arose and crept like a snake by many paths to the hut of dingaan the prince who awaited me on that night following the shadow of the hut i came to the door and scratched upon it after a certain fashion presently it was opened and i crawled in and the door was shut again now there was a little light in the hut and by its flame i saw the two princes sitting side by side wrapped about with blankets which hung before their brows  who is this that comes said the prince dingaan  then i lifted the blanket from my head so that they might see my face and they also drew the blankets from their brows i spoke saying hail to you princes who tomorrow shall be dust hail to you sons of senzangacona who tomorrow shall be spirits and i pointed towards them with my withered hand  now the princes were troubled and shook with fear  what meanest thou thou dog that thou dost speak to us words of such illomen said the prince dingaan in a low voice  where dost thou point at us with that white and withered hand of thine wizard hissed the prince umhlangana  have i not told you o ye princes i whispered that ye must strike or die and has not your heart failed you now hearken chaka has dreamed another dream now it is chaka who strikes and ye are already dead ye children of senzangacona  if the slayers of the king be without the gates at least thou shalt die first thou who hast betrayed us quoth the prince dingaan and drew an assegai from under his kaross  first hear the kings dream o prince i said then if thou wilt kill me and die chaka the king slept and dreamed that he lay dead and that one of you the princes wore his royal kaross  who wore the royal kaross asked dingaan eagerly and both looked up waiting on my words  the prince umhlangana wore itin the dream of chakao dingaan shoot of a royal stock i answered slowly taking snuff as i spoke and watching the two of them over the edge of my snuffspoon  now dingaan scowled heavily at umhlangana but the face of umhlangana was as the morning sky  chaka dreamed this also i went on that one of you the princes held his royal spear  who held the royal spear asked umhlangana  the prince dingaan held itin the dream of chakao umhlangana sprung from the root of kingsand it dripped blood  now the face of umhlangana grew dark as night but that of dingaan brightened like the dawn  chaka dreamed this also that i mopo your dog who am not worthy to be mentioned with such names came up and gave the royal salute even the bayete  to whom didst thou give the bayete o mopo son of makedama asked both of the princes as with one breath waiting on my words  i gave it to both of you o twin stars of the morning princes of the zuluin the dream of chaka i gave it to both of you  now the princes looked this way and that and were silent not knowing what to say for these princes hated each other though adversity and fear had brought them to one bed  but what avails it to talk thus ye lords of the land i went on seeing that both of you ye are already as dead men and that vultures which are hungry tonight tomorrow shall be filled with meat of the best chaka the king is now a doctor of dreams and to clear away such a dream as this he has a purging medicine  now the brows of these brothers grew black indeed for they saw that their fate was on them  these are the words of chaka the king o ye bulls who lead the herd all are doomed ye twain and i and many another man who loves us in the great kraal beyond the river there sits a regiment it is summonedand thengoodnight have ye any words to say to those yet left upon the earth perhaps it will be given to me to live a little while after ye are gone and i may bring them to their ears  can we not rise up now and fall upon chaka asked dingaan  it is not possible i said the king is guarded  hast thou no plan mopo groaned umhlangana methinks thou hast a plan to save us  and if i have a plan ye princes what shall be my reward it must be great for i am weary of life and i will not use my wisdom for a little thing  now both the princes offered me good things each of them promising more than the other as two young men who are rivals promise to the father of a girl whom both would wed i listened saying always that it was not enough till in the end both of them swore by their heads and by the bones of senzangacona their father and by many other things that i should be the first man in the land after them its kings and should command the impis of the land if i would but show them a way to kill chaka and become kings then when they had done swearing i spoke weighing my words  in the great kraal beyond the river o ye princes there sit not one regiment but two one is named the slayers and loves chaka the king who has done well by them giving them cattle and wives the other is named the bees and that regiment is hungry and longs for cattle and girls moreover of that regiment the prince umhlangana is the general and it loves him now this is my planto summon the bees in the name of umhlangana not the slayers in the name of chaka bend forward o princes that i may whisper in your ears  so they bent forward and i whispered awhile of the death of a king and the sons of senzangacona nodded their heads as one man in answer then i rose up and crept from the hut as i had entered it and rousing certain trusty messengers i dispatched them running swiftly through the night    chapter xxi the death of chaka  now on the morrow two hours before midday chaka came from the hut where he had sat through the night and moved to a little kraal surrounded by a fence that was some fifty paces distant from the hut for it was my duty day by day to choose that place where the king should sit to hear the counsel of his indunas and give judgment on those whom he would kill and today i had chosen this place chaka went alone from his hut to the kraal and for my own reasons i accompanied him walking after him as we went the king glanced back at me over his shoulder and said in a low voice  is all prepared mopo  all is prepared black one i answered the regiment of the slayers will be here by noon  where are the princes mopo asked the king again  the princes sit with their wives in the houses of their women o king i answered they drink beer and sleep in the laps of their wives  chaka smiled grimly for the last time mopo  for the last time o king  we came to the kraal and chaka sat down in the shade of the reed fence upon an oxhide that was brayed soft near to him stood a girl holding a gourd of beer there were also present the old chief inguazonca brother of unandi mother of the heavens and the chief umxamama whom chaka loved when we had sat a little while in the kraal certain men came in bearing cranes feathers which the king had sent them to gather a months journey from the kraal duguza and they were admitted before the king these men had been away long upon their errand and chaka was angry with them now the leader of the men was an old captain of chakas who had fought under him in many battles but whose service was done because his right hand had been shorn away by the blow of an axe he was a great man and very brave  chaka asked the man why he had been so long in finding the feathers and he answered that the birds had flown from that part of the country whither he was sent and he must wait there till they returned that he might snare them  thou shouldst have followed the cranes yes if they flew through the sunset thou disobedient dog said the king let him be taken away and all those who were with him  now some of the men prayed a little for mercy but the captain did but salute the king calling him father and craving a boon before he died  what wouldst thou asked chaka  my father said the man i would ask thee two things i have fought many times at thy side in battle while we both were young nor did i ever turn my back upon the foe the blow that shore the hand from off this arm was aimed at thy head o king i stayed it with my naked arm it is nothing at thy will i live and at thy will i die who am i that i should question the word of the king yet i would ask this that thou wilt withdraw the kaross from about thee o king that for the last time my eyes may feast themselves upon the body of him whom above all men i love  thou art longwinded said the king what more  this my father that i may bid farewell to my son he is a little child so high o king and he held his hand above his knee  thy first boon is granted said the king slipping the kaross from his shoulders and showing the great breast beneath for the second it shall be granted also for i will not willingly divide the father and the son bring the boy here thou shalt bid him farewell then thou shalt slay him with thine own hand ere thou thyself art slain it will be good sport to see  now the man turned grey beneath the blackness of his skin and trembled a little as he murmured the kings will is the will of his servant let the child be brought  but i looked at chaka and saw that the tears were running down his face and that he only spoke thus to try the captain who loved him to the last  let the man go said the king him and those with him  so they went glad at heart and praising the king  i have told you this my father though it has not to do with my story because then and then only did i ever see chaka show mercy to one whom he had doomed to die  as the captain and his people left the gate of the kraal it was spoken in the ear of the king that a man sought audience with him he was admitted crawling on his knees i looked and saw that this was that masilo whom chaka had charged with a message to him who was named bulalio or the slaughterer and who ruled over the people of the axe it was masilo indeed but he was no longer fat for much travel had made him thin moreover on his back were the marks of rods as yet scarcely healed over  who art thou said chaka  i am masilo of the people of the axe to whom command was given to run with a message to bulalio the slaughterer their chief and to return on the thirtieth day behold o king i have returned though in a sorry plight  it seems so said the king laughing aloud i remember now speak on masilo the thin who wast masilo the fat what of this slaughterer does he come with his people to lay the axe groanmaker in my hands  nay o king he comes not he met me with scorn and with scorn he drove me from his kraal moreover as i went i was seized by the servants of zinita she whom i wooed but who is now the wife of the slaughterer and laid on my face upon the ground and beaten cruelly while zinita numbered the strokes  hah said the king and what were the words of this puppy  these were his words o king bulalio the slaughterer who sits beneath the shadow of the witch mountain to bulalio the slaughterer who sits in the kraal duguzato thee i pay no tribute if thou wouldst have the axe groanmaker come to the ghost mountain and take it this i promise thee thou shalt look on a face thou knowest for there is one there who would be avenged for the blood of a certain mopo  now while masilo told this tale i had seen two thingsfirst that a little piece of stick was thrust through the straw of the fence and secondly that the regiment of the bees was swarming on the slope opposite to the kraal in obedience to the summons i had sent them in the name of umhlangana the stick told me that the princes were hidden behind the fence waiting the signal and the coming of the regiment that it was time to do the deed  when masilo had spoken chaka sprang up in fury his eyes rolled his face worked foam flew from his lips for such words as these had never offended his ears since he was king and masilo knew him little else he had not dared to utter them  for a while he gasped shaking his small spear for at first he could not speak at length he found words  the dog he hissed the dog who dares thus to spit in my face hearken all as with my last breath i command that this slaughterer be torn limb from limb he and all his tribe and thou thou darest to bring me this talk from a skunk of the mountains and thou too mopo thy name is named in it well of thee presently ho umxamama my servant slay me this slave of a messenger beat out his brains with thy stick swift swift  now the old chief umxamama sprang up to do the kings bidding but he was feeble with age and the end of it was that masilo being mad with fear killed umxamama not umxamama masilo then inguazonca brother of unandi mother of the heavens fell upon masilo and ended him but was hurt himself in so doing now i looked at chaka who stood shaking the little red spear and thought swiftly for the hour had come  help i cried one is slaying the king  as i spoke the reed fence burst asunder and through it plunged the princes umhlangana and dingaan as bulls plunge through a brake  then i pointed to chaka with my withered hand saying behold your king  now from beneath the shelter of his kaross each prince drew out a short stabbing spear and plunged it into the body of chaka the king umhlangana smote him on the left shoulder dingaan struck him in the right side chaka dropped the little spear handled with the red wood and looked round and so royally that the princes his brothers grew afraid and shrank away from him  twice he looked on each then he spoke saying what do you slay me my brothersdogs of mine own house whom i have fed do you slay me thinking to possess the land and to rule it i tell you it shall not be for long i hear a sound of running feetthe feet of a great white people they shall stamp you flat children of my father they shall rule the land that i have won and you and your people shall be their slaves  thus chaka spoke while the blood ran down him to the ground and again he looked on them royally like a buck at gaze  make an end o ye who would be kings i cried but their hearts had turned to water and they could not then i mopo sprang forward and picked from the ground that little assegai handled with the royal woodthe same assegai with which chaka had murdered unandi his mother and moosa my son and lifted it on high and while i lifted it my father once more as when i was young a red veil seemed to wave before my eyes  wherefore wouldst thou kill me mopo said the king  for the sake of baleka my sister to whom i swore the deed and of all my kin i cried and plunged the spear through him he sank down upon the tanned oxhide and lay there dying once more he spoke and once only saying would now that i had hearkened to the voice of nobela who warned me against thee thou dog  then he was silent for ever but i knelt over him and called in his ear the names of all those of my blood who had died at his handsthe names of makedama my father of my mother of anadi my wife of moosa my son and all my other wives and children and of baleka my sister his eyes and ears were open and i think my father that he saw and understood i think also that the hate upon my face as i shook my withered hand before him was more fearful to him that the pain of death at the least he turned his head aside shut his eyes and groaned presently they opened again and he was dead  thus then my father did chaka the king the greatest man who has ever lived in zululand and the most evil pass by my hand to those kraals of the inkosazana where no sleep is in blood he died as he had lived in blood for the climber at last falls with the tree and in the end the swimmer is borne away by the stream now he trod that path which had been beaten flat for him by the feet of people whom he had slaughtered many as the blades of grass upon a mountainside but it is a lie to say as some do that he died a coward praying for mercy chaka died as he had lived a brave man ou my father i know it for these eyes saw it and this hand let out his life  now he was dead and the regiment of the bees drew near nor could i know how they would take this matter for though the prince umhlangana was their general yet all the soldiers loved the king because he had no equal in battle and when he gave he gave with an open hand i looked round the princes stood like men amazed the girl had fled the chief umxamama was dead at the hands of dead masilo and the old chief inguazonca who had killed masilo stood by hurt and wondering there were no others in the kraal  awake ye kings i cried to the brothers the impi is at the gates swift now stab that manand i pointed to the old chiefand leave the matter to my wit  then dingaan roused himself and springing upon inguazonca the brother of unandi smote him a great blow with his spear so that he sank down dead without a word then again the princes stood silent and amazed  this one will tell no tales i cried pointing at the fallen chief  now a rumour of the slaying had got abroad among the women who had heard cries and seen the flashing of spears above the fence and from the women it had come to the regiment of the bees who advanced to the gates of the kraal singing then of a sudden they ceased their singing and rushed towards the hut in front of which we stood  then i ran to meet them uttering cries of woe holding in my hand the little assegai of the king red with the kings blood and spoke with the captains in the gate saying  lament ye captains and ye soldiers weep and lament for your father is no more he who nursed you is no more the king is dead now earth and heaven will come together for the king is dead  how so mopo cried the leader of the bees how is our father dead  he is dead by the hand of a wicked wanderer named masilo who when he was doomed to die by the king snatched this assegai from the kings hand and stabbed him and afterwards before he could be cut down himself by us three the princes and myself he killed the chiefs inguazonca and umxamama also draw near and look on him who was the king it is the command of dingaan and umhlangana the kings that you draw near and look on him who was the king that his death at the hand of masilo may be told through all the land  you are better at making of kings mopo than at the saving of one who was your king from the stroke of a wanderer said the leader of the bees looking at me doubtfully  but his words passed unheeded for some of the captains went forward to look on the great one who was dead and some together with most of the soldiers ran this way and that crying in their fear that now the heaven and earth would come together and the race of man would cease to be because chaka the king was dead  now my father how shall i whose days are few tell you of all the matters that happened after the dead of chaka were i to speak of them all they would fill many books of the white men and perhaps some of them are written down there for this reason it is that i may be brief i have only spoken of a few of those events which befell in the reign of chaka for my tale is not of the reign of chaka but of the lives of a handful of people who lived in those days and of whom i and umslopogaas alone are left aliveif indeed umslopogaas the son of chaka is still living on the earth therefore in a few words i will pass over all that came about after the fall of chaka and till i was sent down by dingaan the king to summon him to surrender to the king who was called the slaughterer and who ruled the people of the axe ah would that i had known for certain that this was none other than umslopogaas for then had dingaan gone the way that chaka went and which umhlangana followed and umslopogaas ruled the people of the zulus as their king but alas my wisdom failed me i paid no heed to the voice of my heart which told me that this was umslopogaas who sent the message to chaka threatening vengeance for one mopo and i knew nothing till too late surely i thought the man spoke of some other mopo for thus my father does destiny make fools of us men we think that we can shape our fate but it is fate that shapes us and nothing befalls except fate will it all things are a great pattern my father drawn by the hand of the umkulunkulu upon the cup whence he drinks the water of his wisdom and our lives and what we do and what we do not do are but a little bit of the pattern which is so big that only the eyes of him who is above the umkulunkulu can see it all even chaka the slayer of men and all those he slew are but as a tiny grain of dust in the greatness of that pattern how then can we be wise my father who are but the tools of wisdom how can we build who are but pebbles in a wall how can we give life who are babes in the womb of fate or how can we slay who are but spears in the hands of the slayer  this came about my father matters were made straight in the land after the death of chaka at first people said that masilo the stranger had stabbed the king then it was known that mopo the wise man the doctor and the bodyservant of the king had slain the king and that the two great bulls his brothers umhlangana and dingaan children of senzangacona had also lifted spears against him but he was dead and earth and heaven had not come together so what did it matter moreover the two new kings promised to deal gently with the people and to lighten the heavy yoke of chaka and men in a bad case are always ready to hope for a better so it came about that the only enemies the princes found were each other and engwade the son of unandi chakas halfbrother but i mopo who was now the first man in the land after the kings ceasing to be a doctor and becoming a general went up against engwade with the regiment of the bees and the regiment of the slayers and smote him in his kraals it was a hard fight but in the end i destroyed him and all his people engwade killed eight men with his own hand before i slew him then i came back to the kraal with the few that were left alive of the two regiments  after that the two kings quarrelled more and more and i weighed them both in my balance for i would know which was the most favourable to me in the end i found that both feared me but that umhlangana would certainly put me to death if he gained the upper hand whereas this was not yet in the mind of dingaan so i pressed down the balance of umhlangana and raised that of dingaan sending the fears of umhlangana to sleep till i could cause his hut to be surrounded then umhlangana followed upon the road of chaka his brother the road of the assegai and dingaan ruled alone for awhile such are the things that befall princes of this earth my father see i am but a little man and my lot is humble at the last yet i have brought about the death of three of them and of these two died by my hand  it was fourteen days after the passing away of the prince umhlangana that the great army came back in a sorry plight from the marshes of the limpopo for half of them were left dead of fever and the might of the foe and the rest were starving it was well for them who yet lived that chaka was no more else they had joined their brethren who were dead on the way since never before for many years had a zulu impi returned unvictorious and without a single head of cattle thus it came about that they were glad enough to welcome a king who spared their lives and thenceforth till his fate found him dingaan reigned unquestioned  now dingaan was a prince of the blood of chaka indeed for like chaka he was great in presence and cruel at heart but he had not the might and the mind of chaka moreover he was treacherous and a liar and these chaka was not also he loved women much and spent with them the time that he should have given to matters of the state yet he reigned awhile in the land i must tell this also that dingaan would have killed panda his halfbrother so that the house of senzangacona his father might be swept out clean now panda was a man of gentle heart who did not love war and therefore it was thought that he was halfwitted and because i loved panda when the question of his slaying came on i and the chief mapita spoke against it and pleaded for him saying that there was nothing to be feared at his hands who was a fool so in the end dingaan gave way saying well you ask me to spare this dog and i will spare him but one day he will bite me  so panda was made governor of the kings cattle yet in the end the words of dingaan came true for it was the grip of pandas teeth that pulled him from the throne only if panda was the dog that bit i mopo was the man who set him on the hunt    chapter xxii mopo goes to seek the slaughterer  now dingaan deserting the kraal duguza moved back to zululand and built a great kraal by the mahlabatine which he named umgugundhlovuthat is the rumbling of the elephant also he caused all the fairest girls in the land to be sought out as his wives and though many were found yet he craved for more and at this time a rumour came to the ears of the king dingaan that there lived in swaziland among the halakazi tribe a girl of the most wonderful beauty who was named the lily and whose skin was whiter than are the skins of our people and he desired greatly to have this girl to wife so dingaan sent an embassy to the chief of the halakazi demanding that the girl should be given to him at the end of a month the embassy returned again and told the king that they had found nothing but hard words at the kraal of the halakazi and had been driven thence with scorn and blows  this was the message of the chief of the halakazi to dingaan king of the zulus that the maid who was named the lily was indeed the wonder of the earth and as yet unwed for she had found no man upon whom she looked with favour and she was held in such love by this people that it was not their wish to force any husband on her moreover the chief said that he and his people defied dingaan and the zulus as their fathers had defied chaka before him and spat upon his name and that no maid of theirs should go to be the wife of a zulu dog  then the chief of the halakazi caused the maid who was named the lily to be led before the messengers of dingaan and they found her wonderfully fair for so they said she was tall as a reed and her grace was the grace of a reed that is shaken in the wind moreover her hair curled and hung upon her shoulders her eyes were large and brown and soft as a bucks her colour was the colour of rich cream her smile was like a ripple on the waters and when she spoke her voice was low and sweeter than the sound of an instrument of music they said also that the girl wished to speak with them but the chief forbade it and caused her to be led thence with all honour  now when dingaan heard this message he grew mad as a lion in a net for he desired this maid above everything and yet he who had all things could not win the maid this was his command that a great impi should be gathered and sent to swaziland against the halakazi tribe to destroy them and seize the maid but when the matter came on to be discussed with the indunas in the presence of the king at the amapakati or council i as chief of the indunas spoke against it saying that the tribe of the halakazi were great and strong and that war with them would mean war with the swazis also moreover they had their dwelling in caves which were hard to win also i said that this was no time to send impis to seek a single girl for few years had gone by since the black one fell and foes were many and the soldiers of the land had waxed few with slaughter half of them having perished in the marshes of the limpopo now time must be given them to grow up again for today they were as a little child or like a man wasted with hunger maids were many let the king take them and satisfy his heart but let him make no war for this one  thus i spoke boldly in the face of the king as none had dared to speak before chaka and courage passed from me to the hearts of the other indunas and generals and they echoed my words for they knew that of all follies to begin a new war with the swazi people would be the greatest  dingaan listened and his brow grew dark yet he was not so firmly seated on the throne that he dared put away our words for still there were many in the land who loved the memory of chaka and remembered that dingaan had murdered him and umhlangana also for now that chaka was dead people forgot how evilly he had dealt with them and remembered only that he was a great man who had made the zulu people out of nothing as a smith fashions a bright spear from a lump of iron also though they had changed masters yet their burden was not lessened for as chaka slew so dingaan slew also and as chaka oppressed so did dingaan oppress therefore dingaan yielded to the voice of his indunas and no impi was sent against the halakazi to seek the maid that was named the lily but still he hankered for her in his heart and from that hour he hated me because i had crossed his will and robbed him of his desire  now my father there is this to be told though i did not know it then the maid who was named the lily was no other than my daughter nada the thought indeed came into my mind that none but nada could be so fair yet i knew for certain that nada and her mother macropha were dead for he who brought me the news of their death had seen their bodies locked in each others arms killed as it were by the same spear yet as it chanced he was wrong for though macropha indeed was killed it was another maid who lay in blood beside her for the people whither i had sent macropha and nada were tributary to the halakazi tribe and that chief of the halakazi who sat in the place of galazi the wolf had quarrelled with them and fallen on them by night and eaten them up  as i learned afterwards the cause of their destruction as in later days it was the cause of the slaying of the halakazi was the beauty of nada and nothing else for the fame of her loveliness had gone about the land and the old chief of the halakazi had commanded that the girl should be sent to his kraal to live there that her beauty might shine upon his place like the sun and that if so she willed she should choose a husband from the great men of the halakazi but the headmen of the kraal refused for none who had looked on her would suffer their eyes to lose sight of nada the lily though there was this fate about the maid that none strove to wed her against her will many indeed asked her in marriage both there and among the halakazi people but ever she shook her head and said nay i would wed no man and it was enough  for it was the saying among men that it was better that she should remain unmarried and all should look on her than that she should pass from their sight into the house of a husband since they held that her beauty was given to be a joy to all like the beauty of the dawn and of the evening yet this beauty of nadas was a dreadful thing and the mother of much death as shall be told and because of her beauty and the great love she bore she the lily herself must wither and the cup of my sorrows must be filled to overflowing and the heart of umslopogaas the slaughterer son of chaka the king must become desolate as the black plain when fire has swept it so it was ordained my father and so it befell seeing that thus all men white and black seek that which is beautiful and when at last they find it then it passes swiftly away or perchance it is their death for great joy and great beauty are winged nor will they sojourn long upon the earth they come down like eagles out of the sky and into the sky they return again swiftly  thus then it came about my father that i mopo believing my daughter nada to be dead little guessed that it was she who was named the lily in the kraals of the halakazi and whom dingaan the king desired for a wife  now after i had thwarted him in this matter of the sending of an impi to pluck the lily from the gardens of the halakazi dingaan learned to hate me also i was in his secrets and with me he had killed his brother chaka and his brother umhlangana and it was i who held him back from the slaying of his brother panda also and therefore he hated me as is the fashion of smallhearted men with those who have lifted them up yet he did not dare to do away with me for my voice was loud in the land and when i spoke the people listened therefore in the end he cast about for some way to be rid of me for a while till he should grow strong enough to kill me  mopo said the king to me one day as i sat before him in council with others of the indunas and generals mindest thou of the last words of the great elephant who is dead this he said meaning chaka his brother only he did not name him for now the name of chaka was blonipa in the land as is the custom with the names of dead kingsthat is my father it was not lawful that it should pass the lips  i remember the words o king i answered they were ominous words for this was their burden that you and your house should not sit long in the throne of kings but that the white men should take away your royalty and divide your territories such was the prophecy of the lion of the zulu why speak of it once before i heard him prophecy and his words were fulfilled may the omen be an egg without meat may it never become fledged may that bird never perch upon your roof o king  now dingaan trembled with fear for the words of chaka were in his mind by night and by day then he grew angry and bit his lip saying  thou fool mopo canst thou not hear a raven croak at the gates of a kraal but thou must needs go tell those who dwell within that he waits to pick their eyes such criers of ill to come may well find ill at hand mopo he ceased looked on me threateningly awhile and went on i did not speak of those words rolling by chance from a tongue half loosed by death but of others that told of a certain bulalio of a slaughterer who rules the people of the axe and dwells beneath the shadow of the ghost mountain far away to the north yonder surely i heard them all as i sat beneath the shade of the reedfence before ever i came to save him who was my brother from the spear of masilo the murderer whose spear stole away the life of a king  i remember those words also o king i said is it the will of the king that an impi should be gathered to eat up this upstart such was the command of the one who is gone given as it were with his last breath  nay mopo that is not my will if no impi can be found by thee to wipe away the halakazi and bring one whom i desire to delight my eyes then surely none can be found to eat up this slaughterer and his people moreover bulalio chief of the people of the axe has not offended against me but against an elephant whose trumpetings are done now this is my will mopo my servant that thou shouldst take with thee a few men only and go gently to this bulalio and say to him a greater elephant stalks through the land than he who has gone to sleep and it has come to his earsthat thou chief of the people of the axe dost pay no tribute and hast said that because of the death of a certain mopo thou wilt have nothing to do with him whose shadow lies upon the land now one mopo is sent to thee slaughterer to know if this tale is true for if it be true then shalt thou learn the weight of the hoof of that elephant who trumpets in the kraal of umgugundhlovu think then and weigh thy words before thou dost answer slaughterer  now i mopo heard the commands of the king and pondered them in my mind for i knew well that it was the design of dingaan to be rid of me for a space that he might find time to plot my overthrow and that he cared little for this matter of a petty chief who living far away had dared to defy chaka yet i wished to go for there had arisen in me a great desire to see this bulalio who spoke of vengeance to be taken for one mopo and whose deeds were such as the deeds of umslopogaas would have been had umslopogaas lived to look upon the light therefore i answered  i hear the king the kings word shall be done though o king thou sendest a big man upon a little errand  not so mopo answered dingaan my heart tells me that this chicken of a slaughterer will grow to a great cock if his comb is not cut presently and thou mopo art versed in cutting combs even of the tallest  i hear the king i answered again  so my father it came about that on the morrow taking with me but ten chosen men i mopo started on my journey towards the ghost mountain and as i journeyed i thought much of how i had trod that path in bygone days then macropha my wife and nada my daughter and umslopogaas the son of chaka who was thought to be my son walked at my side now as i imagined all were dead and i walked alone doubtless i also should soon be dead well people lived few days and evil in those times and what did it matter at the least i had wreaked vengeance on chaka and satisfied my heart  at length i came one night to that lonely spot where we had camped in the evil hour when umslopogaas was borne away by the lioness and once more i looked upon the cave whence he had dragged the cub and upon the awful face of the stone witch who sits aloft upon the ghost mountain forever and forever i could sleep little that night because of the sorrow at my heart but sat awake looking in the brightness of the moon upon the grey face of the stone witch and on the depths of the forest that grew about her knees wondering the while if the bones of umslopogaas lay broken in that forest now as i journeyed many tales had been told to me of this ghost mountain which all swore was haunted so said some by men in the shape of wolves and so said some by the esemkofuthat is by men who have died and who have been brought back again by magic they have no tongues the esemkofu for had they tongues they would cry aloud to mortals the awful secrets of the dead therefore they can but utter a wailing like that of a babe surely one may hear them in the forests at night as they wail aiah aiah among the silent trees  you laugh my father but i did not laugh as i thought of these tales for if men have spirits where do the spirits go when the body is dead they must go somewhere and would it be strange that they should return to look upon the lands where they were born yet i never thought much of such matters though i am a doctor and know something of the ways of the amatongo the people of the ghosts to speak truth my father i have had so much to do with the loosing of the spirits of men that i never troubled myself overmuch with them after they were loosed there will be time to do this when i myself am of their number  so i sat and gazed on the mountain and the forest that grew over it like hair on the head of a woman and as i gazed i heard a sound that came from far away out of the heart of the forest as it seemed at first it was faint and far off a distant thing like the cry of children in a kraal across a valley then it grew louder but still i could not say what it might be now it swelled and swelled and i knew itit was the sound of wild beats at chase nearer came the music the rocks rang with it and its voice set the blood beating but to hearken to it that pack was great which ran ahunting through the silent night and now it was night on the other side of the slope only and the sound swelled so loud that those who were with me awoke also and looked forth now of a sudden a great koodoo bull appeared for an instant standing out against the sky on the crest of the ridge then vanished in the shadow he was running towards us presently we saw him again speeding on his path with great bounds we saw this alsoforms grey and gaunt and galloping in number countless that leaped along his path appearing on the crest of the rise disappearing into the shadow seen again on the slope lost in the valley and with them two other shapes the shapes of men  now the big buck bounded past us not half a spears throw away and behind him streamed the countless wolves and from the throats of the wolves went up that awful music and who were these two that came with the wolves shapes of men great and strong they ran silently and swift wolves teeth gleamed upon their heads wolves hides hung about their shoulders in the hands of one was an axethe moonlight shone upon itin the hand of the other a heavy club neck and neck they ran never before had we seen men travel so fast see they sped down the slope towards us the wolves were left behind all except four of them we heard the beating of their feet they came they passed they were gone and with them their unnumbered company the music grew faint it died it was dead the hunt was far away and the night was still again  now my brethren i asked of those who were with me what is this that we have seen  then one answered we have seen the ghosts who live in the lap of the old witch and those men are the wolfbrethren the wizards who are kings of the ghosts    chapter xxiii mopo reveals himself to the slaughterer  all that night we watched but we neither saw nor heard any more of the wolves nor of the men who hunted with them on the morrow at dawn i sent a runner to bulalio chief of the people of the axe saying that a messenger came to him from dingaan the king who desired to speak with him in peace within the gates of his kraal i charged the messenger however that he should not tell my name but should say only that it was mouth of dingaan then i and those with me followed slowly on the path of the man whom i sent forward for the way was still far and i had bidden him return and meet me bearing the words of the slaughterer holder of the axe  all that day till the sun grew low we walked round the base of the great ghost mountain following the line of the river we met no one but once we came to the ruins of a kraal and in it lay the broken bones of many men and with the bones rusty assegais and the remains of oxhide shields black and white in colour now i examined the shields and knew from their colour that they had been carried in the hands of those soldiers who years ago were sent out by chaka to seek for umslopogaas but who had returned no more  now i said it has fared ill with those soldiers of the black one who is gone for i think that these are the shields they bore and that their eyes once looked upon the world through the holes in yonder skulls  these are the shields they bore and those are the skulls they wore answered one see mopo son of makedama this is no mans work that has brought them to their death men do not break the bones of their foes in pieces as these bones are broken wow men do not break them but wolves do and last night we saw wolves ahunting nor did they hunt alone mopo wow this is a haunted land  then we went on in silence and all the way the stone face of the witch who sits aloft forever stared down on us from the mountain top at length an hour before sundown we came to the open lands and there on the crest of a rise beyond the river we saw the kraal of the people of the axe it was a great kraal and well built and their cattle were spread about the plains like to herds of game for number we went to the river and passed it by the ford then sat down and waited till presently i saw the man whom i had sent forward returning towards us he came and saluted me and i asked him for news  this is my news mopo he said i have seen him who is named bulalio and he is a great manlong and lean with a fierce face and carrying a mighty axe such an axe as he bore last night who hunted with the wolves when i had been led before the chief i saluted him and spoke to himthe words you laid upon my tongue i told to him he listened then laughed aloud and said tell him who sent you that the mouth of dingaan shall be welcome and shall speak the words of dingaan in peace yet i would that it were the head of dingaan that came and not his mouth only for then axe groanmaker would join in our talkay because of one mopo whom his brother chaka murdered it would also speak with dingaan still the mouth is not the head so the mouth may come in peace  now i started when for the second time i heard talk of one mopo whose name had been on the lips of bulalio the slaughterer who was there that would thus have loved mopo except one who was long dead and yet perhaps the chief spoke of some other mopo for the name was not my own onlyin truth chaka had killed a chief of that name at the great mourning because he said that two mopos in the land were one too many and that though this mopo wept sorely when the tears of others were dry so i said only that this bulalio had a high stomach and we went on to the gates of the kraal  there were none to meet us at the gates and none stood by the doors of the huts within them but beyond from the cattle kraal that was in the centre of the huts rose a dust and a din as of men gathering for war now some of those with me were afraid and would have turned back fearing treachery and they were yet more afraid when on coming to the inner entrance of the cattle kraal we saw some five hundred soldiers being mustered there company by company by two great men who ran up and down the ranks shouting  but i cried nay nay turn not back bold looks melt the hearts of foes moreover if this bulalio would have murdered us there was no need for him to call up so many of his warriors he is a proud chief and would show his might not knowing that the king we serve can muster a company for every man he has let us go on boldly  so we walked forward towards the impi that was gathered on the further side of the kraal now the two great men who were marshalling the soldiers saw us and came to meet us one following the other he who came first bore the axe upon his shoulder and he who followed swung a huge club i looked upon the foremost of them and ah my father my heart grew faint with joy for i knew him across the years it was umslopogaas my fosterling umslopogaas and none other now grown into manhooday into such a man as was not to be found beside him in zululand he was great and fierce somewhat spare in frame but wide shouldered and shallow flanked his arms were long and not over big but the muscles stood out on them like knots in a rope his legs were long also and very thick beneath the knee his eye was like an eagles his nose somewhat hooked and he held his head a little forward as a man who searches continually for a hidden foe he seemed to walk slowly and yet he came swiftly but with a gliding movement like that of a wolf or a lion and always his fingers played round the horn handle of the axe groanmaker as for him who followed he was great also shorter than umslopogaas by the half of a head but of a sturdier build his eyes were small and twinkled unceasingly like little stars and his look was very wild for now and again he grinned showing his white teeth  when i saw umslopogaas my father my bowels melted within me and i longed to run to him and throw myself upon his neck yet i took council with myself and did notnay i dropped the corner of the kaross i wore over my eyes hiding my face lest he should know me presently he stood before me searching me out with his keen eyes for i drew forward to greet him  greeting mouth of dingaan he said in a loud voice you are a little man to be the mouth of so big a chief  the mouth is a little member even of the body of a great king o chief bulalio ruler of the people of the axe wizard of the wolves that are upon the ghost mountain who aforetime was named umslopogaas son of mopo son of makedama  now when umslopogaas heard these words he started like a child at a rustling in the dark and stared hard at me  you are well instructed he said  the ears of the king are large if his mouth be small o chief bulalio i answered and i who am but the mouth speak what the ears have heard  how know you that i have dwelt with the wolves upon the ghost mountain o mouth he asked  the eyes of the king see far o chief bulalio thus last night they saw a great chase and a merry it seems that they saw a koodoo bull running at speed and after him countless wolves making their music and with the wolves two men clad in wolves skins such men as you bulalio and he with the club who follows you  now umslopogaas lifted the axe groanmaker as though he would cut me down then let it fall again while galazi the wolf glared at me with wideopened eyes  how know you that once i was named umslopogaas who have lost that name these many days speak o mouth lest i kill you  slay if you will umslopogaas i answered but know that when the brains are scattered the mouth is dumb he who scatters brains loses wisdom  answer he said  i answer not who are you that i should answer you i know it is enough to my business  now umslopogaas ground his teeth in anger i am not wont to be thwarted here in my own kraal he said but do your business speak it little mouth  this is my business little chief when the black one who is gone yet lived you sent him a message by one masilosuch a message as his ears had never heard and that had been your death o fool puffed up with pride but death came first upon the black one and his hand was stayed now dingaan whose shadow lies upon the land the king whom i serve and who sits in the place of the black one who is gone speaks to you by me his mouth he would know this if it is true that you refuse to own his sovereignty to pay tribute to him in men and maids and cattle and to serve him in his wars answer you little headmananswer in few words and short  now umslopogaas gasped for breath in his rage and again he fingered the great axe it is well for you o mouth he said that i swore safe conduct to you else you had not gone henceelse you had been served as i served certain soldiers who in bygone years were sent to search out one umslopogaas yet i answer you in few words and short look on those spearsthey are but a fourth part of the number i can muster that is my answer look now on yonder mountain the mountain of ghosts and wolvesunknown impassable save to me and one other that is my answer spears and mountains shall come togetherthe mountain shall be alive with spears and with the fangs of beasts let dingaan seek his tribute there i have spoken  now i laughed shrilly desiring to try the heart of umslopogaas my fosterling yet further  fool i said boy with the brain of a monkey for every spear you have dingaan whom i serve can send a hundred and your mountain shall be stamped flat and for your ghosts and wolves see with the mouth of dingaan i spit upon them and i spat upon the ground  now umslopogaas shook in his rage and the great axe glimmered as he shook he turned to the captain who was behind him and said say galazi the wolf shall we kill this man and those with him  nay answered the wolf grinning do not kill them you have given them safe conduct moreover let them go back to their dog of a king that he may send out his puppies to do battle with our wolves it will be a pretty fight  get you gone o mouth said umslopogaas get you gone swiftly lest mischief befall you without my gates you shall find food to satisfy your hunger eat of it and begone for if tomorrow at the noon you are found within a spears throw of this kraal you and those with you shall bide there forever o mouth of dingaan the king  now i made as though i would depart then turning suddenly i spoke once more saying  there were words in your message to the black one who is dead of a certain mannay how was he namedof a certain mopo  now umslopogaas started as one starts who is wounded by a spear and stared at me  mopo what of mopo o mouth whose eyes are veiled mopo is dead whose son i was  ah i said yes mopo is deadthat is the black one who is gone killed a certain mopo how came it o bulalio that you were his son  mopo is dead quoth umslopogaas again he is dead with all his house his kraal is stamped flat and that is why i hated the black one and therefore i hate dingaan his brother and will be as are mopo and the house of mopo before i pay him tribute of a single ox  all this while i had spoken to umslopogaas in a feigned voice my father but now i spoke again and in my own voice saying  so now you speak from your heart young man and by digging i have reached the root of the matter it is because of this dead dog of a mopo that you defy the king  umslopogaas heard the voice and trembled no more with anger but rather with fear and wonder he looked at me hard answering nothing  have you a hut near by o chief bulalio foe of dingaan the king where i the mouth of the king may speak with you a while apart for i would learn your message word by word that i may deliver it without fault fear not slaughterer to sit alone with me in an empty hut i am unarmed and old and there is that in your hand which i should fear and i pointed to the axe  now umslopogaas still shaking in his limbs answered follow me o mouth and you galazi stay with these men  so i followed umslopogaas and presently we came to a large hut he pointed to the doorway and i crept through it and he followed after me now for a while it seemed dark in the hut for the sun was sinking without and the place was full of shadow so i waited while a man might count fifty till our eyes could search the darkness then of a sudden i threw the blanket from my face and looked into the eyes of umslopogaas  look on me now o chief bulalio o slaughterer who once was named umslopogaaslook on me and say who am i then he looked at me and his jaw fell  either you are mopo my father grown oldmopo who is dead or the ghost of mopo he answered in a low voice  i am mopo your father umslopogaas i said you have been long in knowing me who knew you from the first  then umslopogaas cried aloud but yet softly and letting fall the axe groanmaker he flung himself upon my breast and wept there and i wept also  oh my father he said i thought that you were dead with the others and now you have come back to me and i i would have lifted the axe against you in my folly oh it is well that i have lived and not died since once more i look upon your facethe face that i thought dead but which yet lives though it be sorely changed as though by grief and years  peace umslopogaas my son i said i also deemed you dead in the lions mouth though in truth it seemed strange to me that any other man than umslopogaas could have wrought the deeds which i have heard of as done by bulalio chief of the people of the axeay and thrown defiance in the teeth of chaka but you are not dead and i i am not dead it was another mopo whom chaka killed i slew chaka chaka did not slay me  and of nada what of nada my sister he said  macropha your mother and nada your sister are dead umslopogaas they are dead at the hands of the people of the halakazi who dwell in swaziland  i have heard of that people he answered presently and so has galazi the wolf yonder he has a hate to satisfy against themthey murdered his father now i have two for they have murdered my mother and my sister ah nada my sister nada my sister and the great man covered his face with his hands and rocked himself to and fro in his grief  now my father it came into my thoughts to make the truth plain to umslopogaas and tell him that nada was no sister of his and that he was no son of mine but rather of that chaka whom my hand had finished and yet i did not though now i would that i had done so for i saw well how great was the pride and how high was the heart of umslopogaas and i saw also that if once he should learn that the throne of zululand was his by right nothing could hold him back for he would swiftly break into open rebellion against dingaan the king and in my judgment the time was not ripe for that had i known indeed but one short year before that umslopogaas still lived he had sat where dingaan sat this day but i did not know it and the chance had gone by for a while now dingaan was king and mustered many regiments about him for i had held him back from war as in the case of the raid that he wished to make upon the swazis the chance had gone by but it would come again and till it came i must say nothing i would do this rather i would bring dingaan and umslopogaas together that umslopogaas might become known in the land as a great chief and the first of warriors then i would cause him to be advanced to be an induna and a general ready to lead the impis of the king for he who leads the impis is already half a king  so i held my peace upon this matter but till the dawn was grey umslopogaas and i sat together and talked each telling the tale of those years that had gone since he was borne from me in the lions mouth i told him how all my wives and children had been killed how i had been put to the torment and showed him my white and withered hand i told him also of the death of baleka my sister and of all my people of the langeni and of how i had revenged my wrongs upon chaka and made dingaan to be king in his place and was now the first man in the land under the king though the king feared me much and loved me little but i did not tell him that baleka my sister was his own mother  when i had done my tale umslopogaas told me his how galazi had rescued him from the lioness how he became one of the wolfbrethren how he had conquered jikiza and the sons of jikiza and become chief of the people of the axe and taken zinita to wife and grown great in the land  i asked him how it came about that he still hunted with the wolves as he had done last night he answered that now he was great and there was nothing more to win and at times a weariness of life came upon him and then he must up and together with galazi hunt and harry with the wolves for thus only could he find rest  i said that i would show him better game to hunt before all was done and asked him further if he loved his wife zinita umslopogaas answered that he would love her better if she loved him not so much for she was jealous and quick to anger and that was a sorrow to him then when he had slept awhile he led me from the hut and i and my people were feasted with the best and i spoke with zinita and with galazi the wolf for the last i liked him well this was a good man to have at ones back in battle but my heart spoke to me against zinita she was handsome and tall but with fierce eyes which always watched umslopogaas my fosterling and i noted that he who was fearless of all other things yet seemed to fear zinita neither did she love me for when she saw how the slaughterer clung to me as it were instantly she grew jealousas already she was jealous of galaziand would have been rid of me if she might thus it came about that my heart spoke against zinita nor did it tell me worse things of her than those which she was to do    chapter xxiv the slaying of the boers  on the morrow i led umslopogaas apart and spoke to him thus  my son yesterday when you did not know me except as the mouth of dingaan you charged me with a certain message for dingaan the king that had it been delivered into the ears of the king had surely brought death upon you and all your people the tree that stands by itself on a plain umslopogaas thinks itself tall and that there is no shade to equal its shade yet are there other and bigger trees you are such a solitary tree umslopogaas but the topmost branches of him whom i serve are thicker than your trunk and beneath his shadow live many woodcutters who go out to lop those that would grow too high you are no match for dingaan though dwelling here alone in an empty land you have grown great in your own eyes and in the eyes of those about you moreover umslopogaas know this dingaan already hates you because of the words which in bygone years you sent by masilo the fool to the black one who is dead for he heard those words and it is his will to eat you up he has sent me hither for one reason only to be rid of me awhile and whatever the words i bring back to him the end will be the samethat night shall come when you will find an impi at your gates  then what need to talk more of the matter my father asked umslopogaas that will come which must come let me wait here for the impi of dingaan and fight till i die  not so umslopogaas my son there are more ways of killing a man than by the assegai and a crooked stick can still be bent straight in the stream it is my desire umslopogaas that instead of hate dingaan should give you love instead of death advancement and that you shall grow great in his shadow listen dingaan is not what chaka was though like chaka he is cruel this dingaan is a fool and it may well come about that a man can be found who growing up in his shadow in the end shall overshadow him i might do iti myself but i am old and being worn with sorrow have no longing to rule but you are young umslopogaas and there is no man like you in the land moreover there are other matters of which it is not well to speak that shall serve you as a raft whereon to swim to power  now umslopogaas glanced up sharply for in those days he was ambitious and desired to be first among the people indeed having the blood of chaka in his veins how could it be otherwise  what is your plan my father he asked say how can this be brought about  this and thus umslopogaas among the tribe of the halakazi in swaziland there dwells a maid who is named the lily she is a girl of the most wonderful beauty and dingaan is afire with longing to have her to wife now awhile since dingaan dispatched an embassy to the chief of the halakazi asking the lily in marriage and the chief of the halakazi sent back insolent words saying that the beauty of the earth should be given to no zulu dog as a wife then dingaan was angry and he would have gathered his impis and sent them against the halakazi to destroy them and bring him the maid but i held him back from it saying that now was no time to begin a new war and it is for this cause that dingaan hates me he is so set upon the plucking of the swazi lily do you understand now umslopogaas  something he answered but speak clearly  wow umslopogaas half words are better than whole ones in this land of ours listen then this is my plan that you should fall upon the halakazi tribe destroy it and bring back the maid as a peaceoffering to dingaan  that is a good plan my father he answered at the least maid or no maid there will be fighting in it and cattle to divide when the fighting is done  first conquer then reckon up the spoils umslopogaas  now he thought awhile then said suffer that i summon galazi the wolf my captain do not fear he is trusty and a man of few words  presently galazi came and sat down before us then i put the matter to him thus that umslopogaas would fall upon the halakazi and bring to dingaan the maid he longed for as a peaceoffering but that i wished to hold him back from the venture because the halakazi people were great and strong i spoke in this sense so that i might have a door to creep out should galazi betray the plot and umslopogaas read my purpose though my craft was needless for galazi was a true man  galazi the wolf listened in silence till i had finished then he answered quietly but it seemed to me that a fire shone in his eyes as he spoke  i am chief by right of the halakazi o mouth of dingaan and know them well they are a strong people and can put two full regiments under arms whereas bulalio here can muster but one regiment and that a small one moreover they have watchmen out by night and day and spies scattered through the land so that it will be hard to take them unawares also their stronghold is a vast cave open to the sky in the middle and none have won that stronghold yet nor could it be found except by those who know its secret they are few yet i am one of them for my father showed it to me when i was a lad therefore mouth of dingaan you will know that this is no easy task which bulalio would set himself and usto conquer the halakazi that is the face of the matter so far as it concerns bulalio but for me o mouth it has another face know that long years ago i swore to my father as he lay dying by the poison of a witch of this people that i would not rest till i had avenged himay till i had stamped out the halakazi and slain their men and brought their women to the houses of strangers and their children to bonds year by year and month by month and night by night as i have lain alone upon the ghost mountain yonder i have wondered how i might bring my oath to pass and found no way now it seems that there is a way and i am glad yet this is a great adventure and perhaps before it is done with the people of the axe will be no more and he ceased and took snuff watching our faces over the spoon  galazi the wolf said umslopogaas for me also the matter has another face you have lost your father at the hands of these halakazi dogs and though till last night i did not know it i have lost my mother by their spears and with her one whom i loved above all in the world my sister nada who loved me also both are dead and the halakazi have killed them this man the mouth of dingaan and he pointed to me mopo this man says that if i can stamp out the halakazi and make captive of the lily maid i shall win the heart of dingaan little do i care for dingaan i who would go my way alone and live while i may live and die when i must by the hands of dingaan as by those of anotherwhat does it matter yet for this reason because of the death of macropha my mother and nada the sister who was dear to me i will make war upon these halakazi and conquer them or be conquered by them perhaps o mouth of dingaan you will see me soon at the kings kraal on the mahlabatine and with me the lily maid and the cattle of the halakazi or perhaps you shall not see me and then you will know that i am dead and the warriors of the axe are no more  so umslopogaas spoke to me before galazi the wolf but afterwards he embraced me and bade me farewell for he had no great hope that we should meet again and i also doubted it for as galazi said the adventure was great yet as i had seen many times it is the bold thrower who oftenest wins so we partedi to return to dingaan and tell him that bulalio chief of the people of the axe had gone up against the halakazi to win the lily maid and bring her to him in atonement while umslopogaas remained to make ready his impi for war  i went swiftly from the ghost mountain back to the kraal umgugundhlovu and presented myself before dingaan who at first looked on me coldly but when i told him my message and how that the chief bulalio the slaughterer had taken the warpath to win him the lily his manner changed he took me by the hand and said that i had done well and he had been foolish to doubt me when i lifted up my voice to persuade him from sending an impi against the halakazi now he saw that it was my purpose to rake this halakazi fire with another hand than his and to save his hand from the burning and he thanked me  moreover he said that if this chief of the people of the axe brought him the maid his heart desired not only would he forgive him the words he had spoken by the mouth of masilo to the black one who was dead but also all the cattle of the halakazi should be his and he would make him great in the land i answered that all this was as the king willed i had but done my duty by the king and worked so that whatever befell a proud chief should be weakened and a foe should be attacked at no cost to the king in such fashion also that perhaps it might come about that the king would shortly have the lily at his side  then i sat down to wait what might befall  now it is my father that the white men come into my story whom we named the amaboona but you call the boers ou i think ill of those amaboona though it was i who gave them the victory over dingaani and umslopogaas  before this time indeed a few white men had come to and fro to the kraals of chaka and dingaan but these came to pray and not to fight now the boers both fight and pray also they steal or used to steal which i do not understand for the prayers of you white men say that these things should not be done  well when i had been back from the ghost mountain something less than a moon the boers came sixty of them commanded by a captain named retief a big man and armed with roersthe long guns they had in those daysor perhaps they numbered a hundred in all counting their servants and afterriders this was their purpose to get a grant of the land in natal that lies between the tugela and the umzimoubu rivers but by my council and that of other indunas dingaan bargained with the boers that first they should attack a certain chief named sigomyela who had stolen some of the kings cattle and who lived near the quathlamba mountains and bring back those cattle this the boers agreed to and went to attack the chief and in a little while they came back again having destroyed the people of sigomyela and driving his cattle before them as well as those which had been stolen from the king  the face of dingaan shone when he saw the cattle and that night he called us the council of the amapakati together and asked us as to the granting of the country i spoke the first and said that it mattered little if he granted it seeing that the black one who was dead had already given it to the english the people of george and the end of the matter would be that the amaboona and the people of george would fight for the land yet the words of the black one were coming to pass for already it seemed we could hear the sound of the running of a white folk who should eat up the kingdom  now when i had spoken thus the heart of dingaan grew heavy and his face dark for my words stuck in his breast like a barbed spear still he made no answer but dismissed the council  on the morrow the king promised to sign the paper giving the lands they asked for to the boers and all was smooth as water when there is no wind before the paper was signed the king gave a great dance for there were many regiments gathered at the kraal and for three days this dance went on but on the third day he dismissed the regiments all except one an impi of lads who were commanded to stay now all this while i wondered what was in the mind of dingaan and was afraid for the amaboona but he was secret and told nothing except to the captains of the regiment aloneno not even to one of his council yet i knew that he planned evil and was half inclined to warn the captain retief but did not fearing to make myself foolish ah my father if i had spoken how many would have lived who were soon dead but what does it matter in any case most of them would have been dead by now  on the fourth morning early dingaan sent a messenger to the boers bidding them meet him in the cattle kraal for there he would mark the paper so they came stacking their guns at the gate of the kraal for it was death for any man white or black to come armed before the presence of the king now my father the kraal umgugundhlovu was built in a great circle after the fashion of royal kraals first came the high outer fence then the thousands of huts that ran three parts round between the great fence and the inner one within this inner fence was the large open space big enough to hold five regiments and at the top of itopposite the entrancestood the cattle kraal itself that cut off a piece of the open space by another fence bent like a bow behind this again were the emposeni the place of the kings women the guardhouse the labyrinth and the intunkulu the house of the king dingaan came out on that day and sat on a stool in front of the cattle kraal and by him stood a man holding a shield over his head to keep the sun from him also we of the amapakati the council were there and ranged round the fence of the space armed with short sticks onlynot with kerries my fatherwas that regiment of young men which dingaan had not sent away the captain of the regiment being stationed near to the king on the right  presently the boers came in on foot and walked up to the king in a body and dingaan greeted them kindly and shook hands with retief their captain then retief drew the paper from a leather pouch which set out the boundaries of the grant of land and it was translated to the king by an interpreter dingaan said that it was good and put his mark upon it and retief and all the boers were pleased and smiled across their faces now they would have said farewell but dingaan forbade them saying that they must not go yet first they must eat and see the soldiers dance a little and he commanded dishes of boiled flesh which had been made ready and bowls of milk to be brought to them the boers said that they had already eaten still they drank the milk passing the bowls from hand to hand  now the regiment began to dance singing the ingomo that is the war chant of us zulus my father and the boers drew back towards the centre of the space to give the soldiers room to dance in it was at this moment that i heard dingaan give an order to a messenger to run swiftly to the white doctor of prayers who was staying without the kraal telling him not to be afraid and i wondered what this might mean for why should the prayer doctor fear a dance such as he had often seen before presently dingaan rose and followed by all walked through the press to where the captain retief stood and bade him goodbye shaking him by the hand and bidding him hambla gachle to go in peace then he turned and walked back again towards the gateway which led to his royal house and i saw that near this entrance stood the captain of the regiments as one stands by who waits for orders  now of a sudden my father dingaan stopped and cried with a loud voice bulalani abatakati slay the wizards and having cried it he covered his face with the corner of his blanket and passed behind the fence  we the councillors stood astounded like men who had become stone but before we could speak or act the captain of the regiment had also cried aloud bulalani abatakati and the signal was caught up from every side then my father came a yell and a rush of thousands of feet and through the clouds of dust we saw the soldiers hurl themselves upon the amaboona and above the shouting we heard the sound of falling sticks the amaboona drew their knives and fought bravely but before a man could count a hundred twice it was done and they were being dragged some few dead but the most yet living towards the gates of the kraal and out on to the hill of slaughter and there on the hill of slaughter they were massacred every one of them how ah i will not tell youthey were massacred and piled in a heap and that was the end of their story my father  now i and the other councillors turned away and walked silently towards the house of the king we found him standing before his great hut and lifting our hands we saluted him silently saying no word it was dingaan who spoke laughing a little as he spoke like a man who is uneasy in his mind  ah my captains he said when the vultures plumed themselves this morning and shrieked to the sky for blood they did not look for such a feast as i have given them and you my captains you little guessed how great a king the heavens have set to rule over you nor how deep is the mind of the king that watches ever over his peoples welfare now the land is free from the white wizards of whose footsteps the black one croaked as he gave up his life or soon shall be for this is but a beginning ho messengers and he turned to some men who stood behind him away swiftly to the regiments that are gathered behind the mountains away to them bearing the kings words to the captains this is the kings word that the impi shall run to the land of natal and slay the boers there wiping them out man woman and child away  now the messengers cried out the royal salute of bayete and leaping forward like spears from the hand of the thrower were gone at once but we the councillors the members of the amapakati still stood silent  then dingaan spoke again addressing me  is thy heart at rest now mopo son of makedama ever hast thou bleated in my ear of this white people and of the deeds that they shall do and lo i have blown upon them with my breath and they are gone say mopo are the amaboona wizards yonder all dead if any be left alive i desire to speak with one of them  then i looked dingaan in the face and spoke  they are all dead and thou o king thou also art dead  it were well for thee thou dog said dingaan that thou shouldst make thy meaning plain  let the king pardon me i answered this is my meaning thou canst not kill this white men for they are not of one race but of many races and the sea is their home they rise out of the black water destroy those that are here and others shall come to avenge them more and more and more now thou hast smitten in thy hour in theirs they shall smite in turn now they lie low in blood at thy hand in a day to come o king thou shalt lie low in blood at theirs madness has taken hold of thee o king that thou hast done this thing and the fruit of thy madness shall be thy death i have spoken i who am the kings servant let the will of the king be done  then i stood still waiting to be killed for my father in the fury of my heart at the wickedness which had been worked i could not hold back my words thrice dingaan looked on me with a terrible face and yet there was fear in his face striving with its rage and i waited calmly to see which would conquer the fear or the rage when at last he spoke it was one word go not three words take him away so i went yet living and with me the councillors leaving the king alone  i went with a heavy heart my father for of all the evil sights that i have seen it seemed to me that this was the most evilthat the amaboona should be slaughtered thus treacherously and that the impis should be sent out treacherously to murder those who were left of them together with their women and children ay and they slewsix hundred of them did they slayyonder in weenen the land of weeping  say my father why does the umkulunkulu who sits in the heavens above allow such things to be done on the earth beneath i have heard the preaching of the white men and they say that they know all about himthat his names are power and mercy and love why then does he suffer these things to be donewhy does he suffer such men as chaka and dingaan to torment the people of the earth and in the end pay them but one death for all the thousands that they have given to others because of the wickedness of the peoples you say but no no that cannot be for do not the guiltless go with the guiltyay do not the innocent children perish by the hundred perchance there is another answer though who am i my father that i in my folly should strive to search out the way of the unsearchable perchance it is but a part of the great plan a little piece of that pattern of which i spokethe pattern on the cup that holds the waters of his wisdom wow i do not understand who am but a wild man nor have i found more knowledge in the hearts of you tamed white people you know many things but of these you do not know you cannot tell us what we were an hour before birth nor what we shall be an hour after death nor why we were born nor why we die you can only hope and believethat is all and perhaps my father before many days are sped i shall be wiser than all of you for i am very aged the fire of my life sinks lowit burns in my brain alone there it is still bright but soon that will go out also and then perhaps i shall understand    chapter xxv the war with the halakazi people  now my father i must tell of how umslopogaas the slaughterer and galazi the wolf fared in their war against the people of the halakazi when i had gone from the shadow of the ghost mountain umslopogaas summoned a gathering of all his headmen and told them it was his desire that the people of the axe should no longer be a little people that they should grow great and number their cattle by tens of thousands  the headmen asked how this might be brought aboutwould he then make war on dingaan the king umslopogaas answered no he would win the favour of the king thus and he told them of the lily maid and of the halakazi tribe in swaziland and of how he would go up against that tribe now some of the headmen said yea to this and some said nay and the talk ran high and lasted till the evening but when the evening was come umslopogaas rose and said that he was chief under the axe and none other and it was his will that they should go up against the halakazi if there was any man there who would gainsay his will let him stand forward and do battle with him and he who conquered should order all things to this there was no answer for there were few who cared to face the beak of groanmaker and so it came about that it was agreed that the people of the axe should make war upon the halakazi and umslopogaas sent out messengers to summon every fightingman to his side  but when zinita his head wife came to hear of the matter she was angry and upbraided umslopogaas and heaped curses on me mopo whom she knew only as the mouth of dingaan because as she said truly i had put this scheme into the mind of the slaughterer what she went on do you not live here in peace and plenty and must you go to make war on those who have not harmed you there perhaps to perish or to come to other ill you say you do this to win a girl for dingaan and to find favour in his sight has not dingaan girls more than he can count it is more likely that wearying of us your wives you go to get girls for yourself bulalio and as for finding favour rest quiet so shall you find most favour if the king sends his impis against you then it will be time to fight o fool with little wit  thus zinita spoke to him very roughlyfor she always blurted out what was in her mind and umslopogaas could not challenge her to battle so he must bear her talk as best he might for it is often thus my father that the greatest of men grow small enough in their own huts moreover he knew that it was because zinita loved him that she spoke so bitterly  now on the third day all the fightingmen were gathered and there might have been two thousand of them good men and brave then umslopogaas went out and spoke to them telling them of this adventure and galazi the wolf was with him they listened silently and it was plain to see that as in the case of the headmen some of them thought one thing and some another then galazi spoke to them briefly telling them that he knew the roads and the caves and the number of the halakazi cattle but still they doubted thereon umslopogaas added these words  tomorrow at the dawn i bulalio holder of the axe chief of the people of the axe go up against the halakazi with galazi the wolf my brother if but ten men follow us yet we will go now choose you soldiers let those come who will and let those who will stop at home with the women and the little children  now a great shout rose from every throat  we will go with you bulalio to victory or death  so on the morrow they marched and there was wailing among the women of the people of the axe only zinita did not wail but stood by in wrath foreboding evil nor would she bid her lord farewell yet when he was gone she wept also  now umslopogaas and his impi travelled fast and far hungering and thirsting till at length they came to the land of the umswazi and after a while entered the territory of the halakazi by a high and narrow pass the fear of galazi the wolf was that they should find this pass held for though they had harmed none in the kraals as they went and taken only enough cattle to feed themselves yet he knew well that messengers had sped by day and night to warn the people of the halakazi but they found no man in the pass and on the other side of it they rested for the night was far spent at dawn umslopogaas looked out over the wide plains beyond and galazi showed him a long low hill two hours march away  there my brother he said lies the head kraal of the halakazi where i was born and in that hill is the great cave  then they went on and before the sun was high they came to the crest of a rise and heard the sound of horns on its farther side they stood upon the rise and looked and lo yet far off but running towards them was the whole impi of the halakazi and it was a great impi  they have gathered their strength indeed said galazi for every man of ours there are three of these swazis  the soldiers saw also and the courage of some of them sank low then umslopogaas spoke to them  yonder are the swazi dogs my children they are many and we are few yet shall it be told at home that we men of the zulu blood were hunted by a pack of swazi dogs shall our women and children sing that song in our ears o soldiers of the axe  now some cried never but some were silent so umslopogaas spoke again  turn back all who will there is yet time turn back all who will but ye who are men come forward with me or if ye will go back all of you and leave axe groanmaker and club watcher to see this matter out alone  now there arose a mighty shout of we will die together who have lived together  do you swear it cried umslopogaas holding groanmaker on high  we swear it by the axe they answered  then umslopogaas and galazi made ready for the battle they posted all the young men in the broken ground above the bottom of the slope for these could best be spared to the spear and galazi the wolf took command of them but the veterans stayed upon the hillside and with them umslopogaas  now the halakazi came on and there were four full regiments of them the plain was black with them the air was rent with their shoutings and their spears flashed like lightnings on the farther side of the slope they halted and sent a herald forward to demand what the people of the axe would have from them the slaughterer answered that they would have three things first the head of their chief whose place galazi should fill henceforth secondly that fair maid whom men named the lily thirdly a thousand head of cattle if these demands were granted then he would spare them the halakazi if not he would stamp them out and take all  so the herald returned and when he reached the ranks of the halakazi he called aloud his answer then a great roar of laughter went up from the halakazi regiments a roar that shook the earth the brow of umslopogaas the slaughterer burned red beneath the black when he heard it and he shook groanmaker towards their host  ye shall sing another song before this sun is set he cried and strode along the ranks speaking to this man and that by name and lifting up their hearts with great words  now the halakazi raised a shout and charged to come at the young men led by galazi the wolf but beyond the foot of the slope was peaty ground and they came through it heavily and as they came galazi and the young men fell upon them and slew them still they could not hold them back for long because of their great numbers and presently the battle ranged all along the slope but so well did galazi handle the young men and so fiercely did they fight beneath his eye that before they could be killed or driven back all the force of the halakazi was doing battle with them ay and twice galazi charged with such as he could gather and twice he checked the halakazi rush throwing them into confusion till at length company was mixed with company and regiment with regiment but it might not endure for now more than half the young men were down and the rest were being pushed back up the hill fighting madly  but all this while umslopogaas and the veterans sat in their ranks upon the brow of the slope and watched those swazi dogs have a fool for their general quoth umslopogaas he has no men left to fall back on and galazi has broken his array and mixed his regiments as milk and cream are mixed in a bowl they are no longer an impi they are a mob  now the veterans moved restlessly on their haunches pushing their legs out and drawing them in again they glanced at the fray they looked into each others eyes and spoke a word here a word there well smitten galazi wow that one is down a brave lad ho a good club is the watcher the fight draws near my brother and ever as they spoke their faces grew fiercer and their fingers played with their spears  at length a captain called aloud to umslopogaas  say slaughterer is it not time to be up and doing the grass is wet to sit on and our limbs grow cramped  wait awhile answered umslopogaas let them weary of their play let them weary i tell you  as he spoke the halakazi huddled themselves together and with a rush drove back galazi and those who were left of the young men yes at last they were forced to flee and after them came the swazis and in the forefront of the pursuit was their chief ringed round with a circle of his bravest  umslopogaas saw it and bounded to his feet roaring like a bull at them now wolves he shouted  then the lines of warriors sprang up as a wave springs and their crests were like foam upon the wave as a wave that swells to break they rose suddenly like a breaking wave they poured down the slope in front of them was the slaughterer holding groanmaker aloft and oh his feet were swift so swift were his feet that strive as they would he outran them by the quarter of a spears throw galazi heard the thunder of their rush he looked round and as he looked lo the slaughterer swept past him running like a buck then galazi too bounded forward and the wolfbrethren sped down the hill the length of four spears between them  the halakazi also saw and heard and strove to gather themselves together to meet the rush in front of umslopogaas was their chief a tall man hedged about with assegais straight at the shieldhedge drove umslopogaas and a score of spears were lifted to greet him a score of shields heaved into the airthis was a fence that none might pass alive yet would the slaughterer pass itnot alone see he steadies his pace he gathers himself together and now he leaps high into the air he leaps his feet knock the heads of the warriors and rattle against the crowns of their shields they smite upwards with the spear but he has swept over them like a swooping bird he has cleared themhe has litand now the shieldhedge guards two chiefs but not for long ou groanmaker is aloft he fallsand neither shield nor axe may stay his stroke both are cleft through and the halakazi lack a leader  the shieldring wheels in upon itself fools galazi is upon you what was that look now see how many bones are left unbroken in him whom the watcher falls on full whatanother down close up shieldmenclose up ai are you fled  ah the wave has fallen on the beach listen to its roaringlisten to the roaring of the shields stand you men of the halakazistand surely they are but a few so it is done by the head of chaka they breakthey are pushed backnow the wave of slaughter seethes along the sandsnow the foe is swept like floating weed and from all the line there comes a hissing like the hissing of thin waters sgee says the hiss sgee sgee  there my father i am old what have i do with the battle any more with the battle and its joy yet it is better to die in such a fight as that than to live any other way i have seen suchi have seen many such oh we could fight when i was a man my father but none that i knew could ever fight like umslopogaas the slaughterer son of chaka and his bloodbrother galazi the wolf so so they swept them away those halakazi they swept them as a maid sweeps the dust of a hut as the wind sweeps the withered leaves it was soon done when once it was begun some were fled and some were dead and this was the end of that fight no no not of all the war the halakazi were worsted in the field but many lived to win the great cave and there the work must be finished thither then went the slaughterer presently with such of his impi as was left to him alas many were killed but how could they have died better than in that fight also those who were left were as good as all for now they knew that they should not be overcome easily while axe and club still led the way  now they stood before a hill measuring perhaps three thousand paces round its base it was of no great height and yet unclimbable for after a man had gone up a little way the sides of it were sheer offering no foothold except to the rockrabbits and the lizards no one was to be seen without this hill nor in the great kraal of the halakazi that lay to the east of it and yet the ground about was trampled with the hoofs of oxen and the feet of men and from within the mountain came a sound of lowing cattle  here is the nest of halakazi quoth galazi the wolf  here is the nest indeed said umslopogaas but how shall we come at the eggs to suck them there are no branches on this tree  but there is a hole in the trunk answered the wolf  now he led them a little way till they came to a place where the soil was trampled as it is at the entrance to a cattle kraal and they saw that there was a low cave which led into the cliff like an archway such as you white men build but this archway was filled up with great blocks of stone placed upon each other in such a fashion that it could not be forced from without after the cattle were driven in it had been filled up  we cannot enter here said galazi follow me  so they followed him and came to the north side of the mountain and there two spearcasts away a soldier was standing but when he saw them he vanished suddenly  there is the place said galazi and the fox has gone to earth in it  now they ran to the spot and saw a little hole in the rock scarcely bigger than an antbears burrow and through the hole came sounds and some light  now where is the hyena who will try a new burrow cried umslopogaas a hundred head of cattle to the man who wins through and clears the way  then two young men sprang forward who were flushed with victory and desired nothing more than to make a great name and win cattle crying  here are hyenas bulalio  to earth then said umslopogaas and let him who wins through hold the path awhile till others follow  the two young men sprang at the hole and he who reached it first went down upon his hands and knees and crawled in lying on his shield and holding his spear before him for a little while the light in the burrow vanished and they heard the sound of his crawling then came the noise of blows and once more light crept through the hole the man was dead  this one had a bad snake said the second soldier his snake deserted him let me see if mine is better  so down he went on his hands and knees and crawled as the first had done only he put his shield over his head for awhile they heard him crawling then once more came the sound of blows echoing on the oxhide shield and after the blows groans he was dead also yet it seemed that they had left his body in the hole for now no light came through this was the cause my father when they struck the man he had wriggled back a little way and died there and none had entered from the farther side to drag him out  now the soldiers stared at the mouth of the passage and none seemed to love the look of it for this was but a poor way to die umslopogaas and galazi also looked at it thinking  now i am named wolf said galazi and a wolf should not fear the dark also these are my people and i must be the first to visit them and he went down on his hands and knees without more ado but umslopogaas having peered once more down the burrow said hold galazi i will go first i have a plan do you follow me and you my children shout loudly so that none may hear us move and if we win through follow swiftly for we cannot hold the mouth of that place for long hearken also this is my counsel to you if i fall choose another chiefgalazi the wolf if he is still living  nay slaughterer do not name me said the wolf for together we live or die  so let it be galazi then choose you some other man and try this road no more for if we cannot pass it none can but seek food and sit down here till those jackals bolt then be ready farewell my children  farewell father they answered go warily lest we be left like cattle without a herdsman wandering and desolate  then umslopogaas crept into the hole taking no shield but holding groanmaker before him and at his heels crept galazi when he had covered the length of six spears he stretched out his hand and as he trusted to do he found the feet of that man who had gone before and died in the place then umslopogaas the wary did this he put his head beneath the dead mans legs and thrust himself onward till all the body was on his back and there he held it with one hand gripping its two wrists in his hand then he crawled forward a little space and saw that he was coming to the inner mouth of the burrow but that the shadow was deep there because of a great mass of rock which lay before the burrow shutting out the light this is well for me thought umslopogaas for now they will not know the dead from the living i may yet look upon the sun again now he heard the halakazi soldiers talking without  the zulu rats do not love this run said one they fear the ratcatchers stick this is good sport and a man laughed  then umslopogaas pushed himself forward as swiftly as he could holding the dead man on his back and suddenly came out of the hole into the open place in the dark shadow of the great rock  by the lily cried a soldier heres a third take this zulu rat and he struck the dead man heavily with a kerrie and that cried another driving his spear through him so that it pricked umslopogaas beneath and that and this and that said others as they smote and stabbed  now umslopogaas groaned heavily in the deep shadow and lay still no need to waste more blows said the man who had struck first this one will never go back to zululand and i think that few will care to follow him let us make an end run some of you and find stones to stop the burrow for now the sport is done  he turned as he spoke and so did the others and this was what the slaughter sought with a swift movement he freed himself from the dead man and sprang to his feet they heard the sound and turned again but as they turned groanmaker pecked softly and that man who had sworn by the lily was no more a man then umslopogaas leaped forwards and bounding on to the great rock stood there like a buck against the sky  a zulu rat is not so easily slain o ye weasels he cried as they came at him from all sides at once with a roar he smote to the right and the left and so swiftly that men could scarcely see the blows fall for he struck with groanmakers beak but though men scarcely saw the blows yet my father men fell beneath them now foes were all around leaping up at the slaughterer as rushing water leaps to hide a rockeverywhere shone spears thrusting at him from this side and from that those in front and to the side groanmaker served to stay but one wounded umslopogaas in the neck and another was lifted to pierce his back when the strength of its holder was bowed to the dustto the dust to become of the dust  for now the wolf was through the hole also and the watcher grew very busy he was so busy that soon the back of the slaughterer had nothing to fearyet those had much to fear who stood behind his back the pair fought bravely making a great slaughter and presently one by one plumed heads of the people of the axe showed through the burrow and strong arms mingled in the fray swiftly they came leaping into battle as otters leap to the waternow there were ten of them now there were twentyand now the halakazi broke and fled since they did not bargain for this then the rest of the men of the axe came through in peace and the evening grew towards the dark before all had passed the hole    chapter xxvi the finding of nada  umslopogaas marshalled his companies  there is little light left he said but it must serve us to start these conies from their burrows come my brother galazi you know where the conies hide take my place and lead us  so galazi led the impi turning a corner of the glen he came with them to a large open space that had a fountain in its midst and this place was full of thousands of cattle then he turned again to the left and brought them to the inner side of the mountain where the cliff hung over and here was the mouth of a great cave now the cave was dark but by its door was stacked a pile of resinous wood to serve as torches  here is that which will give us light said galazi and one man of every two took a torch and lit it at a fire that burned near the mouth of the cave then they rushed in waving the flaring torches and with assegais aloft here for the last time the halakazi stood against them and the torches floated up and down upon the wave of war but they did not stand for very long for all the heart was out of them wow yes many were killedi do not know how many i know this only that the halakazi are no more a tribe since umslopogaas who is named bulalio stamped them with his feetthey are nothing but a name now the people of the axe drove them out into the open and finished the fight by starlight among the cattle  in one corner of the cave umslopogaas saw a knot of men clustering round something as though to guard it he rushed at the men and with him went galazi and others but when umslopogaas was through by the light of his torch he perceived a tall and slender man who leaned against the wall of the cave and held a shield before his face  you are a coward he cried and smote with groanmaker the great axe pierced the hide but missing the head behind rang loudly against the rock and as it struck a sweet voice said  ah soldier do not kill me why are you angry with me  now the shield had come away from its holders hands upon the blade of the axe and there was something in the notes of the voice that caused umslopogaas to smite no more it was as though a memory of childhood had come to him in a dream his torch was burning low but he thrust it forward to look at him who crouched against the rock the dress was the dress of a man but this was no mans formnay rather that of a lovely woman wellnigh white in colour she dropped her hands from before her face and now he could see her well he saw eyes that shone like stars hair that curled and fell upon the shoulders and such beauty as was not known among our people and as the voice had spoken to him of something that was lost so did the eyes seem to shine across the blackness of many years and the beauty to bring back he knew not what  he looked at the girl in all her loveliness and she looked at him in his fierceness and his might red with war and wounds they both looked long while the torchlight flared on them on the walls of the cave and the broad blade of groanmaker and from around rose the sounds of the fray  how are you named who are so fair to see he asked at length  i am named the lily now once i had another name nada daughter of mopo i was once but name and all else are dead and i go to join them kill me and make an end i will shut my eyes that i may not see the great axe flash  now umslopogaas gazed upon her again and groanmaker fell from his hand  look on me nada daughter of mopo he said in a low voice look at me and say who am i  she looked once more and yet again now her face was thrust forward as one who gazes over the edge of the world it grew fixed and strange by my heart she said by my heart you are umslopogaas my brother who is dead and whom dead as living i have loved ever and alone  then the torch flared out but umslopogaas took hold of her in the darkness and pressed her to him and kissed her the sister whom he found after many years and she kissed him  you kiss me now she said yet not long ago that great axe shore my locks missing me but by a fingersbreadthand still the sound of fighting rings in my ears ah a boon of you my brothera boon let there be no more death since we are met once more the people of the halakazi are conquered and it is their just doom for thus in this same way they killed those with whom i lived before yet they have treated me well not forcing me into wedlock and protecting me from dingaan so spare them my brother if you may  then umslopogaas lifted up his voice commanding that the killing should cease and sent messengers running swiftly with these words this is the command of bulalio that he who lifts hand against one more of the people of the halakazi shall be killed himself and the soldiers obeyed him though the order came somewhat late and no more of the halakazi were brought to doom they were suffered to escape except those of the women and children who were kept to be led away as captives and they ran far that night nor did they come together again to be a people for they feared galazi the wolf who would be chief over them but they were scattered wide in the world to sojourn among strangers  now when the soldiers had eaten abundantly of the store of the halakazi and guards had been sent to ward the cattle and watch against surprise umslopogaas spoke long with nada the lily taking her apart and he told her all his story she told him also the tale which you know my father of how she had lived with the little people that were subject to the halakazi she and her mother macropha and how the fame of her beauty had spread about the land then she told him how the halakazi had claimed her and of how in the end they had taken her by force of arms killing the people of that kraal and among them her own mother thereafter she had dwelt among the halakazi who named her anew calling her the lily and they had treated her kindly giving her reverence because of her sweetness and beauty and not forcing her into marriage  and why would you not wed nada my sister asked umslopogaas you who are far past the age of marriage  i cannot tell you she answered hanging her head but i have no heart that way i only seek to be left alone  now umslopogaas thought awhile and spoke do you not know then nada why it is that i have made this war and why the people of the halakazi are dead and scattered and their cattle the prize of my arm i will tell you i am come here to win you whom i knew only by report as the lily maid the fairest of women to be a wife to dingaan the reason that i began this war was to win you and make my peace with dingaan and now i have carried it through to the end  now when she heard these words nada the lily trembled and wept and sinking to the earth she clasped the knees of umslopogaas in supplication oh do not this cruel thing by me your sister she prayed take rather that great axe and make an end of me and of the beauty which has wrought so much woe and most of all to me who wear it would that i had not moved my head behind the shield but had suffered the axe to fall upon it to this end i was dressed as a man that i might meet the fate of a man ah a curse be on my womans weakness that snatched me from death to give me up to shame  thus she prayed to umslopogaas in her low sweet voice and his heart was shaken in him though indeed he did not now purpose to give nada to dingaan as baleka was given to chaka perhaps in the end to meet the fate of baleka  there are many nada he said who would think it no misfortune that they should be given as a wife to the first of chiefs  then i am not of their number she answered nay i will die first by my own hand if need be  now umslopogaas wondered how it came about that nada looked upon marriage thus but he did not speak of the matter he said only tell me then nada how i can deliver myself of this charge i must go to dingaan as i promised our father mopo and what shall i say to dingaan when he asks for the lily whom i went out to pluck and whom his heart desires what shall i say to save myself alive from the wrath of dingaan  then nada thought and answered you shall say this my brother you shall tell him that the lily being clothed in the wardress of a warrior fell by chance in the fray see now none of your people know that you have found me they are thinking of other things than maids in the hour of their victory this then is my plan we will search now by the starlight till we find the body of a fair maid for doubtless some were killed by hazard in the fight and on her we will set a warriors dress and lay by her the corpse of one of your own men tomorrow at the light you shall take the captains of your soldiers and having laid the body of the girl in the dark of the cave you shall show it to them hurriedly and tell them that this was the lily slain by one of your own people whom in your wrath you slew also they will not look long on so common a sight and if by hazard they see the maid and think her not so very fair they will deem that it is death which has robbed her of her comeliness so the tale which you must tell to dingaan shall be built up firmly and dingaan shall believe it to be true  and how shall this be nada asked umslopogaas how shall this be when men see you among the captives and know you by your beauty are there then two such lilies in the land  i shall not be known for i shall not be seen umslopogaas you must set me free tonight i will wander hence disguised as a youth and covered with a blanket and if any meet me who shall say that i am the lily  and where will you wander nada to your death must we then meet after so many years to part again for ever  where was it that you said you lived my brother beneath the shade of a ghost mountain that men may know by a shape of stone which is fashioned like an old woman frozen into stone was it not tell me of the road thither  so umslopogaas told her the road and she listened silently  good she said i am strong and my feet are swift perhaps they may serve to bring me so far and perhaps if i win the shadow of that mountain you will find me a hut to hide in umslopogaas my brother  surely it shall be so my sister answered umslopogaas and yet the way is long and many dangers lie in the path of a maid journeying alone without food or shelter and as he spoke umslopogaas thought of zinita his wife for he guessed that she would not love nada although she was only his sister  still it must be travelled and the dangers must be braved she answered smiling alas there is no other way  then umslopogaas summoned galazi the wolf and told him all this story for galazi was the only man whom he could trust the wolf listened in silence marvelling the while at the beauty of nada as the starlight showed it when everything was told he said only that he no longer wondered that the people of the halakazi had defied dingaan and brought death upon themselves for the sake of this maid still to be plain his heart thought ill of the matter for death was not done with yet there before them shone the star of death and he pointed to the lily  now nada trembled at his words of evil omen and the slaughterer grew angry but galazi would neither add to them nor take away from them i have spoken that which my heart hears he answered  then they rose and went to search among the dead for a girl who would suit their purpose soon they found one a tall and fair maiden and galazi bore her in his arms to the great cave here in the cave were none but the dead and tossed hither and thither in their last sleep they looked awful in the glare of the torches  they sleep sound said the lily gazing on them rest is sweet  we shall soon win it maiden answered galazi and again nada trembled  then having arrayed her in the dress of a warrior and put a shield and spear by her they laid down the body of the girl in a dark place in the cave and finding a dead warrior of the people of the axe placed him beside her now they left the cave and pretending that they visited the sentries umslopogaas and galazi passed from spot to spot while the lily walked after them like a guard hiding her face with a shield holding a spear in her hand and having with her a bag of corn and dried flesh  so they passed on till at length they came to the entrance in the mountain side the stones that had blocked it were pulled down so as to allow those of the halakazi to fly who had been spared at the entreaty of nada but there were guards by the entrance to watch that none came back umslopogaas challenged them and they saluted him but he saw that they were worn out with battle and journeying and knew little of what they saw or said then he galazi and nada and passed through the opening on to the plain beyond  here the slaughterer and the lily bade each other farewell while galazi watched and presently the wolf saw umslopogaas return as one who is heavy at heart and caught sight of the lily skimming across the plain lightly like a swallow  i do not know when we two shall meet again said umslopogaas so soon as she had melted into the shadows of the night  may you never meet answered galazi for i am sure that if you meet that sister of yours will bring death on many more than those who now lie low because of her loveliness she is a star of death and when she sets the sky shall be blood red  umslopogaas did not answer but walked slowly through the archway in the mountain side  how is this chief said he who was captain of the guard three went out but only two return  fool answered umslopogaas are you drunk with halakazi beer or blind with sleep two went out and two return i sent him who was with us back to the camp  so be it father said the captain two went out and two return all is well    chapter xxvii the stamping of the fire  on the morrow the impi awoke refreshed with sleep and after they had eaten umslopogaas mustered them alas nearly half of those who had seen the sun of yesterday would wake no more forever the slaughterer mustered them and thanked them for that which they had done winning fame and cattle they were merry recking little of those who were dead and sang his praises and the praises of galazi in a loud song when the song was ended umslopogaas spoke to them again saying that the victory was great and the cattle they had won were countless yet something was lackingshe was lacking whom he came to seek to be a gift to dingaan the king and for whose sake this war was made where now was the lily yesterday she had been here clad in a moocha like a man and bearing a shield this he knew from the captives where then was she now  then all the soldiers said that they had seen nothing of her when they had done galazi spoke a word as was agreed between him and umslopogaas he said that when they stormed the cave he had seen a man run at a warrior in the cave to kill him then as he came he who was about to be slain threw down the shield and cried for mercy and galazi knew that this was no warrior of the halakazi but a very beautiful girl so he called to the man to let her alone and not to touch her for the order was that no women should be killed but the soldier being mad with the lust of fight shouted that maid or man she should die and slew her thereon hegalaziin his wrath ran up and smote the man with the watcher and killed him also and he prayed that he had done no wrong  you have done well my brother said umslopogaas come now some of you and let us look at this dead girl perhaps it is the lily and if so that is unlucky for us for i do not know what tale we shall tell to dingaan of the matter  so the captains went with umslopogaas and galazi and came to the spot where the girl had been laid and by her the man of the people of the axe  all is as the wolf my brother has told said umslopogaas waving the torch in his hand over the two who lay dead here without a doubt lies she who was named the lily whom we came to win and by her that fool who slew her slain himself by the blow of the watcher an ill sight to see and an ill tale for me to tell at the kraal of dingaan still what is is and cannot be altered and this maid who was the fairest of the fair is now none too lovely to look on let us away and he turned swiftly then spoke again saying  bind up this dead girl in ox hides cover her with salt and let her be brought with us and they did so  then the captains said surely it is so my father now it cannot be altered and dingaan must miss his bride so said they all except that man who had been captain of the guard when umslopogaas and galazi and another passed through the archway this man indeed said nothing yet he was not without his thoughts for it seemed to him that he had seen three pass through the archway and not two it seemed to him moreover that the kaross which the third wore had slipped aside as she pressed past him and that beneath it he had seen the shape of a beautiful woman and above it had caught the glint of a womans eyean eye full and dark like a bucks  also this captain noted that bulalio called none of the captives to swear to the body of the lily maid and that he shook the torch to and fro as he held it over herhe whose hand was of the steadiest all of this he kept in his mind forgetting nothing  now it chanced afterwards on the homeward march my father that umslopogaas had cause to speak angrily to this man because he tried to rob another of his share of the spoil of the halakazi he spoke sharply to him degrading him from his rank and setting another over him also he took cattle from the man and gave them to him whom he would have robbed  and thereafter though he was justly served this man thought more and more of the third who had passed through the arch of the cave and had not returned and who seemed to him to have a fair womans shape and eyes which gleamed like those of a woman  on that day then umslopogaas began his march to the kraal umgugundhlovu where dingaan sat but before he set his face homewards in the presence of the soldiers he asked galazi the wolf if he would come back with him or if he desired to stay to be chief of the halakazi as he was by right of birth and war then the wolf laughed and answered that he had come out to seek for vengeance and not for the place of a chief also that there were few of the halakazi people left over whom he might rule if he wished moreover he added this that like twin trees they two bloodbrethren had grown up side by side till their roots were matted together and that were one of them dug up and planted in swazi soil he feared lest both should wither or at the last that he galazi would wither who loved but one man and certain wolves  so umslopogaas said no more of the chieftainship but began his journey with him he brought a great number of cattle to be a gift for dingaan and a multitude of captives young women and children for he would appease the heart of dingaan because he did not bring her whom he soughtthe lily flower of flowers yet because he was cautious and put little faith in the kindness of kings umslopogaas so soon as he reached the borders of zululand sent the best of the cattle and the fairest of the maids and children on to the kraal of the people of the axe by the ghost mountain and he who had been captain of the guard but now was a common soldier noticed this also  now it chanced that on a certain morning i mopo sat in the kraal umgugundhlovu in attendance on dingaan for still i waited on the king though he had spoken no word to me good or bad since the yesterday when i foretold to him that in the blood of the white men whom he had betrayed grew the flower of his own death for my father it was on the morrow of the slaying of the amaboona that umslopogaas came to the kraal umgugundhlovu  now the mind of dingaan was heavy and he sought something to lighten it presently he bethought himself of the white praying man who had come to the kraal seeking to teach us people of the zulu to worship other gods than the assegai and the king now this was a good man but no luck went with his teaching which was hard to understand and moreover the indunas did not like it because it seemed to set a master over the master and a king over the king and to preach of peace to those whose trade was war still dingaan sent for the white man that he might dispute with him for dingaan thought that he himself was the cleverest of all men  now the white man came but his face was pale because of that which he had seen befall the boers for he was gentle and hated such sights the king bade him be seated and spoke to him saying  the other day o white man thou toldest me of a place of fire whither those go after death who have done wickedly in life tell me now of thy wisdom do my fathers lie in that place  how can i know king answered the prayerdoctor who may not judge of the deeds of men this i say only that those who murder and rob and oppress the innocent and bear false witness shall lie in that place of fire  it seems that my fathers have done all these things and if they are in this place i would go there also for i am minded to be with my fathers at the last yet i think that i should find a way to escape if ever i came there  how king  now dingaan had set this trap for the prayerdoctor in the centre of that open space where he had caused the boers to be fallen upon he had built up a great pyre of woodbrushwood beneath and on top of the brushwood logs and even whole trees perhaps my father there were sixty full wagonloads of dry wood piled together there in the centre of the place  thou shalt see with thine eyes white man he answered and bidding attendants set fire to the pile all round he summoned that regiment of young men which was left in the kraal maybe there were a thousand and half a thousand of themnot morethe same that had slain the boers  now the fire began to burn fiercely and the regiment filed in and took its place in ranks by the time that all had come the pyre was everywhere a sheet of raging flame and though we sat a hundred paces from it its heat was great when the wind turned our way  now doctor of prayers is thy hot place hotter than yonder fire said the king  he answered that he did not know but the fire was certainly hot  then i will show thee how i will come out of it if ever i go to lie in such a fireay though it be ten times as big and fierce ho my children he cried to the soldiers and springing up you see yonder fire run swiftly and stamp it flat with your feet where there was fire let there be blackness and ashes  now the white man lifted his hands and prayed dingaan not to do this thing that should be the death of many but the king bade him be silent then he turned his eyes upward and prayed to his gods for a moment also the soldiers looked on each other in doubt for the fire raged furiously and spouts of flame shot high toward the heaven and above it and about it the hot air danced but their captain called to them loudly great is the king hear the words of the king who honours you yesterday we ate up the amaboonait was nothing they were unarmed there is a foe more worthy of our valour come my children let us wash in the firewe who are fiercer than the fire great is the king who honours us  thus he spoke and ran forward and with a roar after him sprang the soldiers rank by rank they were brave men indeed moreover they knew that if death lay before them death also awaited him who lagged behind and it is far better to die with honour than ashamed on they went as to the joy of battle their captain leading them and as they went they sang the ingomo the warchant of the zulu now the captain neared the raging fire we saw him lift his shield to keep off its heat then he was gonehe had sprung into the heart of the furnace and but little of him was ever found again after him went the first company in they went beating at the flames with their oxhide shields stamping them out with their naked feet tearing down the burning logs and casting them aside not one man of that company lived my father they fell down like moths which flutter through a candle and where they fell they perished but after them came other companies and it was well for those in this fight who were last to grapple with the foe now a great smoke was mixed with the flame now the flame grew less and less and the smoke more and more and now blackened men hairless naked and blistered white with the scorching of the fire staggered out on the farther side of the flames falling to earth here and there after them came others now there was no flame only a great smoke in which men moved dimly and presently my father it was done they had conquered the fire and that with but very little hurt to the last seven companies though every man had trodden it how many perishednay i know not they were never counted but what between the dead and the injured that regiment was at half strength till the king drafted more men into it  see doctor of prayers said dingaan with a laugh thus shall i escape the fires of that land of which thou tellest if such there be indeed i will bid my impis stamp them out  then the praying man went from the kraal saying that he would teach no more among the zulus and afterwards he left the land when he had gone the burnt wood and the dead were cleared away the injured were doctored or killed according to their hurts and those who had little harm came before the king and praised him  new shields and headresses must be found for you my children said dingaan for the shields were black and shrivelled and of heads of hair and plumes there were but few left among that regiment  wow said dingaan again looking at the soldiers who still lived shaving will be easy and cheap in that place of fire of which the white man speaks  then he ordered beer to be brought to the men for the heat had made them thirsty  now though you may not guess it my father i have told you this tale because it has something to do with my story for scarcely had the matter been ended when messengers came saying that bulalio chief of the people of the axe and his impi were without having returned with much spoil from the slaying of the halakazi in swaziland now when i heard this my heart leapt for joy seeing that i had feared greatly for the fate of umslopogaas my fosterling dingaan also was very glad and springing up danced to and fro like a child  now at last we have good tidings he said at once forgetting the stamping of the fire and now shall my eyes behold that lily whom my hand has longed to pluck let bulalio and his people enter swiftly  for awhile there was silence then from far away without the high fence of the great place there came a sound of singing and through the gates of the kraal rushed two great men wearing black plumes upon their heads having black shields in their left hands and in their right one an axe and one a club while about their shoulders were bound wolfskins they ran low neck and neck with outstretched shields and heads held forward as a buck runs when he is hard pressed by dogs and no such running had been seen in the kraal umgugundhlovu as the running of the wolfbrethren half across the space they ran and halted suddenly and as they halted the dead ashes of the fire flew up before their feet in a little cloud  by my head look these come armed before me said dingaan frowning and to do this is death now say who is that man great and fierce who bears an axe aloft did i not know him dead i should say it was the black one my brother as he was in the days of the smiting of zwide so was his head set on his shoulders and so he was wont to look round like a lion  i think that is bulalio the slaughterer chief of the people of the axe o king i answered  and who is the other with him he is a great man also never have i seen such a pair  i think that is galazi the wolf he who is bloodbrother to the slaughterer and his general i said again  now after these two came the soldiers of the people of the axe armed with short sticks alone four by four they came all holding their heads low and with black shields outstretched and formed themselves into companies behind the wolfbrethren till all were there then after them the crowd of the halakazi slaves were driven inwomen boys and maids a great numberand they stood behind the ranks huddled together like frightened calves  a gallant sight truly said dingaan as he looked upon the companies of blackplumed and shielded warriors i have no better soldiers in my impis and yet my eyes behold these for the first time and again he frowned  now suddenly umslopogaas lifted his axe and started forward at full speed and after him thundered the companies on they rushed and their plumes lay back upon the wind till it seemed as though they must stamp us flat but when he was within ten paces of the king umslopogaas lifted groanmaker again and galazi held the watcher on high and every man halted where he was while once more the dust flew up in clouds they halted in long unbroken lines with outstretched shields and heads held low no mans head rose more than the length of a dance kerrie from the earth so they stood one minute then for the third time umslopogaas lifted groanmaker and in an instant every man straightened himself each shield was tossed on high and from every throat was roared the royal salute bayete  a pretty sight forsooth quoth dingaan but these soldiers are too well drilled who have never done me service nor the black one who was before me and this slaughterer is too good a captain i say come hither ye twain he cried aloud  then the wolfbrethren strode forward and stood before the king and for awhile they looked upon each other    chapter xxviii the lily is brought to dingaan  how are you named said dingaan  we are named bulalio the slaughterer and galazi the wolf o king answered umslopogaas  was it thou who didst send a certain message to the black one who is dead bulalio  yea o king i sent a message but from all i have heard masilo my messenger gave more than the message for he stabbed the black one masilo had an evil heart  now dingaan winced for he knew well that he himself and one mopo had stabbed the black one but he thought that this outland chief had not heard the tale so he said no more of the message  how is it that ye dare to come before me armed know ye not the rule that he who appears armed before the king dies  we have not heard that law o king said umslopogaas moreover there is this to be told by virtue of the axe i bear i rule alone if i am seen without the axe then any man may take my place who can for the axe is chieftainess of the people of the axe and he who holds it is its servant  a strange custom said dingaan but let it pass and thou wolf what hast thou to say of that great club of thine  there is this to be told of the club o king answered galazi by virtue of the club i guard my life if i am seen without the club then may any man take my life who can for the club is my watcher not i watcher of the club  never wast thou nearer to the losing of both club and life said dingaan angrily  it may be so o king answered the wolf when the hour is then without a doubt the watcher shall cease from his watching  ye are a strange pair quoth dingaan where have you been now and what is your business at the place of the elephant  we have been in a far country o king answered umslopogaas we have wandered in a distant land to search for a flower to be a gift to a king and in our searching we have trampled down a swazi garden and yonder are some of those who tended itand he pointed to the captivesand without are the cattle that ploughed it  good slaughterer i see the gardeners and i hear the lowing of the cattle but what of the flower where is this flower ye went so far to dig in swazi soil was it a lilybloom perchance  it was a lilybloom o king and yet alas the lily has withered nothing is left but the stalk white and withered as are the bones of men  what meanest thou said dingaan starting to his feet  that the king shall learn answered umslopogaas and turning he spoke a word to the captains who were behind him presently the ranks opened up and four men ran forward from the rear of the companies on their shoulders they bore a stretcher and upon the stretcher lay something wrapped about with raw oxhides and bound round with rimpis the men saluted and laid their burden down before the king  open said the slaughterer and they opened and there within the hides packed in salt lay the body of a girl who once was tall and fair  here lies the lilys stalk o king said umslopogaas pointing with the axe but if her flower blooms on any air it is not here  now dingaan stared at the sight of death and bitterness of heart took hold of him since he desired above all things to win the beauty of the lily for himself  bear away this carrion and cast it to the dogs he cried for thus he could speak of her whom he would have taken to wife when once he deemed her dead take it away and thou slaughterer tell me how it came about that the maid was slain it will be well for thee if thou hast a good answer for know thy life hangs on the words  so umslopogaas told the king all that tale which had been made ready against the wrath of dingaan and when he had finished galazi told his story of how he had seen the soldier kill the maid and in his wrath had killed the soldier then certain of the captains who had seen the soldier and the maid lying in one death came forward and spoke to it  now dingaan was very angry and yet there was nothing to be done the lily was dead and by no fault of any except of one who was also dead and beyond his reach  get you hence you and your people he said to the wolfbrethren i take the cattle and the captives be thankful that i do not take all your lives alsofirst because ye have dared to make war without my word and secondly because having made war ye have so brought it about that though ye bring me the body of her i sought ye do not bring the life  now when the king spoke of taking the lives of all the people of the axe umslopogaas smiled grimly and glanced at his companies then saluting the king he turned to go but as he turned a man sprang forwards from the ranks and called to dingaan saying  is it granted that i may speak truth before the king and afterwards sleep in the kings shadow  now this was that man who had been captain of the guard on the night when three passed out through the archway and two returned that same man whom umslopogaas had degraded from his rank  speak on thou art safe answered dingaan  o king thy ears have been filled with lies said the soldier hearken o king i was captain of the guard of the gate on that night of the slaying of the halakazi three came to the gate of the mountainthey were bulalio the wolf galazi and another that other was tall and slim bearing a shield highso as the third passed the gate the kaross he wore brushed against me and slipped aside beneath that kaross was no mans breast o king but the shape of a woman almost white in colour and very fair in drawing back the kaross this third one moved the shield behind that shield was no mans face o king but the face of a girl lovelier than the moon and having eyes brighter than the stars three went out at the mountain gate o king only two returned and peeping after them it seemed that i saw the third running swiftly across the plains as a young maid runs o king this also elephant bulalio yonder denied me when as captain of the guard i asked for the third who had passed the gate saying that only two had passed further none of the captives were called to swear to the body of the maid and now it is too late and that man who lay beside her was not killed by galazi in the cave he was killed outside the cave by a blow of a halakazi kerrie i saw him fall with my own eyes and slew the man who smote him one thing more king of the world the best of the captives and the cattle are not here for a gift to theethey are at the kraal of bulalio chief of the people of the axe i have spoken o king yes because my heart loves not lies i have spoken the truth and now do thou protect me from these wolfbrethren o king for they are very fierce  now all this while that the traitor told his tale umslopogaas inch by inch was edging near to him and yet nearer till at length he might have touched him with an outstretched spear none noted him except i mopo alone and perhaps galazi for all were watching the face of dingaan as men watch a storm that is about to burst  fear thou not the wolfbrethren soldier gasped dingaan rolling his red eyes the paw of the lion guards thee my servant  ere the words had left the kings lips the slaughterer leapt he leaped full on to the traitor speaking never a word and oh his eyes were awful he leaped upon him he seized him with his hands lifting no weapon and in his terrible might he broke him as a child breaks a sticknay i know not how it was too swift to see he broke him and hurling him on high cast him dead at the feet of dingaan crying in a great voice  take thy servant king surely he sleeps in thy shadow  then there was silence only through the silence was heard a gasp of fear and wonder for no such deed as this had been wrought in the presence of the kingno not since the day of senzangacona the root  now dingaan spoke and his voice came thick with rage and his limbs trembled  slay him he hissed slay the dog and all those with him  now we come to a game which i can play answered umslopogaas ho people of the axe will you stand to be slaughtered by these singed rats and he pointed with groanmaker at those warriors who had escaped without hurt in the fire but whose faces the fire had scorched  then for answer a great shout went up a shout and a roar of laughter and this was the shout  no slaughterer not so are we minded and right and left they faced to meet the foe while from all along the companies came the crackling of the shaken shields  back sprang umslopogaas to head his men forward leaped the soldiers of the king to work the kings will if so they might and galazi the wolf also sprang forward towards dingaan and as he sprang swung up the watcher crying in a great voice  hold  again there was silence for men saw that the shadow of the watcher lay dark upon the head of dingaan  it is a pity that many should die when one will suffice cried the wolf again let a blow be struck and where his shadow lies there shall the watcher be and lo the world will lack a king a word king  now dingaan looked up at the great man who stood above him and felt the shadow of the shining club lie cold upon his brow and again he shookthis time it was with fear  begone in peace he said  a good word for thee king said the wolf grinning and slowly he drew himself backwards towards the companies saying praise the king the king bids his children go in peace  but when dingaan felt that his brow was no longer cold with the shadow of death his rage came back to him and he would have called to the soldiers to fall upon the people of the axe only i stayed him saying  thy death is in it o king the slaughterer will grind such men as thou hast here beneath his feet and then once more shall the watcher look upon thee  now dingaan saw that this was true and gave no command for he had only those men with him whom the fire had left all the rest were gone to slaughter the boers in natal still he must have blood so he turned on me  thou art a traitor mopo as i have known for long and i will serve thee as yonder dog served his faithless servant and he thrust at me with the assegai in his hand  but i saw the stroke and springing high into the air avoided it then i turned and fled very swiftly and after me came certain of the soldiers the way was not far to the last company of the people of the axe moreover it saw me coming and headed by umslopogaas who walked behind them all ran to meet me then the soldiers who followed to kill me hung back out of reach of the axe  here with the king is no place for me any more my son i said to umslopogaas  fear not my father i will find you a place he answered  then i called a message to the soldiers who followed me saying  tell this to the king that he has done ill to drive me from him for i mopo set him on the throne and i alone can hold him there tell him this also that he will do yet worse to seek me where i am for that day when we are once more face to face shall be his day of death thus speaks mopo the inyanga mopo the doctor who never yet prophesied that which should not be  then we marched from the kraal umgugundhlovu and when next i saw that kraal it was to burn all of it which dingaan had left unburnt and when next i saw dingaanah that is to be told of my father  we marched from the kraal none hindering us for there were none to hinder and after we had gone a little way umslopogaas halted and said  now it is in my mind to return whence we came and slay this dingaan ere he slay me  yet it is well to leave a frightened lion in his thicket my son for a lion at bay is hard to handle doubt not that every man young and old in umgugundhlovu now stands armed about the gates lest such a thought should take you my son and though just now he was afraid yet dingaan will strike for his life when you might have killed you did not kill now the hour has gone  wise words said galazi i would that the watcher had fallen where his shadow fell  what is your counsel now father asked umslopogaas  this then that you two should abide no more beneath the shadow of the ghost mountain but should gather your people and your cattle and pass to the north on the track of mosilikatze the lion who broke away from chaka there you may rule apart or together and never dream of dingaan  i will not do that father he answered i will dwell beneath the shadow of the ghost mountain while i may  and so will i said galazi or rather among its rocks what shall my wolves lack a master when they would go ahunting shall greysnout and blackfang blood and deathgrip and their company black and grey howl for me in vain  so be it children ye are young and will not listen to the counsel of the old let it befall as it chances  i spoke thus for i did not know then why umslopogaas would not leave his kraals it was for this reason because he had bidden nada to meet him there  afterwards when he found her he would have gone but then the sky was clear the dangerclouds had melted for awhile  oh that umslopogaas my fosterling had listened to me now he would have reigned as a king not wandered an outcast in strange lands i know not where and nada should have lived not died nor would the people of the axe have ceased to be a people  this of dingaan when he heard my message he grew afraid once more for he knew me to be no liar  therefore he held his hand for awhile sending no impi to smite umslopogaas lest it might come about that i should bring him his death as i had promised and before the fear had worn away it happened that dingaans hands were full with the war against the amaboona because of his slaughter of the white people and he had no soldiers to spare with whom to wreak vengeance on a petty chief living far away  yet his rage was great because of what had chanced and after his custom he murdered many innocent people to satisfy it    chapter xxix mopo tells his tale  now afterwards as we went upon our road umslopogaas told me all there was to tell of the slaying of the halakazi and of the finding of nada  when i heard that nada my daughter still lived i wept for joy though like umslopogaas i was torn by doubt and fear for it is far for an unaided maid to travel from swaziland to the ghost mountain yet all this while i said nothing to umslopogaas of the truth as to his birth because on the journey there were many around us and the very trees have ears and the same wind to which we whispered might whisper to the king still i knew that the hour had come now when i must speak for it was in my mind to bring it about that umslopogaas should be proclaimed the son of chaka and be made king of the zulus in the place of dingaan his uncle yet all these things had gone cross for us because it was fated so my father had i known that umslopogaas still lived when i slew chaka then i think that i could have brought it about that he should be king or had things fallen out as i planned and the lily maid been brought to dingaan and umslopogaas grew great in his sight then perhaps i could have brought it about but all things had gone wrong the lily was none other than nada and how could umslopogaas give nada whom he thought his sister and who was my daughter to dingaan against her will also because of nada dingaan and umslopogaas were now at bitter enmity and for this same cause i was disgraced and a fugitive and my counsels would no longer be heard in the ear of the king  so everything must be begun afresh and as i walked with the impi towards the ghost mountain i thought much and often of the manner in which this might be done but as yet i said nothing  now at last we were beneath the ghost mountain and looked upon the face of the old witch who sits there aloft forever waiting for the world to die and that same night we came to the kraal of the people of the axe and entered it with a great singing but galazi did not enter at that time he was away to the mountain to call his flock of wolves and as we passed its foot we heard the welcome that the wolves howled in greeting to him  now as we drew near the kraal all the women and children came out to meet us headed by zinita the head wife of umslopogaas they came joyfully but when they found how many were wanting who a moon before had gone thence to fight their joy was turned to mourning and the voice of their weeping went up to heaven  umslopogaas greeted zinita kindly and yet i thought that there was something lacking at first she spoke to him softly but when she learned all that had come to pass her words were not soft for she reviled me and sang a loud song at umslopogaas  see now slaughterer she said see now what has came about because you listened to this aged foolthat was i my fatherthis fool who calls himself mouth ay a mouth he is a mouth out of which proceed folly and lies what did he counsel you to doto go up against these halakazi and win a girl for dingaan and what have you doneyou have fallen upon the halakazi and doubtless have killed many innocent people with that great axe of yours also you have left nearly half of the soldiers of the axe to whiten in the swazi caves and in exchange have brought back certain cattle of a small breed and girls and children whom we must nourish  nor does the matter end here you went it seems to win a girl whom dingaan desired yet when you find that girl you let her go because indeed you say she was your sister and would not wed dingaan forsooth is not the king good enough for this sister of yours now what is the end of the tale you try to play tricks on the king because of your sister and are found out then you kill a man before dingaan and escape bringing this fool of an aged mouth with you that he may teach you his own folly so you have lost half of your men and you have gained the king for a foe who shall bring about the death of all of us and a fool for a councillor wow slaughterer keep to your trade and let others find you wit  thus she spoke without ceasing and there was some truth in her words zinita had a bitter tongue i sat silent till she had finished and umslopogaas also remained silent though his anger was great because there was no crack in her talk through which a man might thrust a word  peace woman i said at length do not speak ill of those who are wise and who had seen much before you were born  speak no ill of him who is my father growled umslopogaas ay though you do not know it this mouth whom you revile is mopo my father  then there is a man among the people of the axe who has a fool for a father of all tidings this is the worst  there is a man among the people of the axe who has a jade and a scold for a wife said umslopogaas springing up begone zinitaand know this that if i hear you snarl such words of him who is my father you shall go further than your own hut for i will put you away and drive you from my kraal i have suffered you too long  i go said zinita oh i am well served i made you chief and now you threaten to put me away  my own hands made me chief said umslopogaas and springing up he thrust her from the hut  it is a poor thing to be wedded to such a woman my father he said presently  yes a poor thing umslopogaas yet these are the burdens that men must bear learn wisdom from it umslopogaas and have as little to do with women as may be at the least do not love them overmuch so shall you find the more peace thus i spoke smiling and would that he had listened to my counsel for it is the love of women which has brought ruin on umslopogaas  all this was many years ago and but lately i have heard that umslopogaas is fled into the north and become a wanderer to his death because of the matter of a woman who had betrayed him making it seem that he had murdered one loustra who was his blood brother just as galazi had been i do not know how it came about but he who was so fierce and strong had that weakness like his uncle dingaan and it has destroyed him at the last and for this cause i shall behold him no more  now my father for awhile we were silent and alone in the hut and as we sat i thought i heard a rat stir in the thatch  then i spoke umslopogaas at length the hour has come that i should whisper something into your ear a word which i have held secret ever since you were born  speak on my father he said wondering  i crept to the door of the hut and looked out the night was dark and i could see none about and could hear no one move yet being cautious i walked round the hut ah my father when you have a secret to tell be not so easily deceived it is not enough to look forth and to peer round dig beneath the floor and search the roof also then having done all this go elsewhere and tell your tale the woman was right i was but a fool for all my wisdom and my white hairs had i not been a fool i would have smoked out that rat in the thatch before ever i opened my lips for the rat was zinita my fatherzinita who had climbed the hut and now lay there in the dark her ear upon the smokehole listening to every word that passed it was a wicked thing to do and moreover the worst of omens but there is little honour among women when they learn that which others wish to hide away from them nor indeed do they then weight omens  so having searched and found nothing i spoke to umslopogaas my fosterling not knowing that death in a womans shape lay on the hut above us hearken i said you are no son of mine umslopogaas though you have called me father from a babe you spring from a loftier stock slaughterer  yet i was well pleased with my fathering old man said umslopogaas the breed is good enough for me say then whose son am i  now i bent forward and whispered to him yet alas not low enough you are the son of the black one who is dead yea sprung from the blood of chaka and of baleka my sister  i still have some kinship with you then mopo and that i am glad of wow who would have guessed that i was the son of the silwana of that hyena man perhaps it is for this reason that like galazi i love the company of the wolves though no love grows in my heart for my father or any of his house  you have little cause to love him umslopogaas for he murdered your mother baleka and would have slain you also but you are the son of chaka and of no other man  well his eyes must be keen indeed my uncle who can pick his own father out of a crowd and yet i once heard this tale before though i had long forgotten it  from whom did you hear it umslopogaas an hour since it was known to one alone the others are dead who knew it now it is known to twoah my father i did not guess of the thirdfrom whom then did you hear it  it was from the dead at least galazi the wolf heard it from the dead one who sat in the cave on ghost mountain for the dead one told him that a man would come to be his brother who should be named umslopogaas bulalio son of chaka and galazi repeated it to me but i had long forgotten it  it seems that there is wisdom among the dead i answered for lo today you are named umslopogaas bulalio and today i declare you the son of chaka but listen to my tale  then i told him all the story from the hour of his birth onwards and when i spoke of the words of his mother baleka after i had told my dream to her and of the manner of her death by the command of chaka and of the great fashion in which she had died then i say umslopogaas wept who i think seldom wept before or after but as my tale drew it its end i saw that he listened ill as a man listens who has a weightier matter pressing on his heart and before it was well done he broke in  so mopo my uncle if i am the son of chaka and baleka nada the lily is no sister to me  nay umslopogaas she is only your cousin  over near of blood he said yet that shall not stand between us and his face grew glad  i looked at him in question  you grow dull my uncle this is my meaning that i will marry nada if she still lives for it comes upon me now that i have never loved any woman as i love nada the lily and while he spoke i heard the rat stir in the thatch of the hut  wed her if you will umslopogaas i answered yet i think that one zinita your inkosikasi will find words to say in the matter  zinita is my head wife indeed but shall she hold me back from taking other wives after the lawful custom of our people he asked angrily and his anger showed that he feared the wrath of zinita  the custom is lawful and good i said but it has bred trouble at times zinita can have little to say if she continues in her place and you still love her as of old but enough of her nada is not yet at your gates and perhaps she will never find them see umslopogaas it is my desire that you should rule in zululand by right of blood and though things point otherwise yet i think a way can be found to bring it about  how so he asked  thus many of the great chiefs who are friends to me hate dingaan and fear him and did they know that a son of chaka lived and that son the slaughterer he well might climb to the throne upon their shoulders also the soldiers love the name of chaka though he dealt cruelly with them because at least he was brave and generous but they do not love dingaan for his burdens are the burdens of chaka but his gifts are the gifts of dingaan therefore they would welcome chakas son if once they knew him for certain but it is here that the necklet chafes for there is but my word to prove it yet i will try  perhaps it is worth trying and perhaps it is not my uncle answered umslopogaas one thing i know i had rather see nada at my gates tonight than hear all the chiefs in the land crying hail o king  you will live to think otherwise umslopogaas and now spies must be set at the kraal umgugundhlovu to give us warning of the mind of the king lest he should send an impi suddenly to eat you up perhaps his hands may be too full for that ere long for those white amaboona will answer his assegais with bullets and one more word let nothing be said of this matter of your birth least of all to zinita your wife or to any other woman  fear not uncle he answered i know how to be silent  now after awhile umslopogaas left me and went to the hut of zinita his inkosikasi where she lay wrapped in her blankets and as it seemed asleep  greeting my husband she said slowly like one who wakens i have dreamed a strange dream of you i dreamed that you were called a king and that all the regiments of the zulus filed past giving you the royal salute bayete  umslopogaas looked at her wondering for he did not know if she had learned something or if this was an omen such dreams are dangerous he said and he who dreams them does well to lock them fast till they be forgotten  or fulfilled said zinita and again umslopogaas looked at her wondering  now after this night i began my work for i established spies at the kraal of dingaan and from them i learned all that passed with the king  at first he gave orders that an impi should be summoned to eat up the people of the axe but afterwards came tidings that the boers to the number of five hundred mounted men were marching on the kraal umgugundhlovu so dingaan had no impi to spare to send to the ghost mountain and we who were beneath its shadow dwelt there in peace  this time the boers were beaten for bogoza the spy led them into an ambush still few were killed and they did but draw back that they might jump the further and dingaan knew this at this time also the english white men of natal the people of george who attacked dingaan by the lower tugela were slain by our soldiers and those with them  also by the help of certain witchdoctors i filled the land with rumours prophecies and dark sayings and i worked cunningly on the minds of many chiefs that were known to me sending them messages hardly to be understood such as should prepare their thoughts for the coming of one who should be declared to them they listened but the task was long for the men dwelt far apart and some of them were away with the regiments  so the time went by till many days had passed since we reached the ghost mountain umslopogaas had no more words with zinita but she always watched him and he went heavily for he awaited nada and nada did not come  but at length nada came    chapter xxx the coming of nada  one nightit was a night of full mooni sat alone with umslopogaas in my hut and we spoke of the matter of our plots then when we had finished that talk we spoke of nada the lily  alas my uncle said umslopogaas sadly we shall never look more on nada she is surely dead or in bonds otherwise she had been here long ago i have sought far and wide and can hear no tidings and find nothing  all that is hidden is not lost i answered yet i myself believed that there was an end of nada  then we were silent awhile and presently in the silence a dog barked we rose and crept out of the hut to see what it might be that stirred for the night drew on and it was needful to be wary since a dog might bark at the stirring of a leaf or perhaps it might be the distant footfall of an impi that it heard  we had not far to look for standing gazing at the huts like one who is afraid to call was a tall slim man holding an assegai in one hand and a little shield in the other we could not see the face of the man because the light was behind him and a ragged blanket hung about his shoulders also he was footsore for he rested on one leg now we were peering round the hut and its shadow hid us so that the man saw nothing for awhile he stood still then he spoke to himself and his voice was strangely soft  here are many huts said the voice now how may i know which is the house of my brother perhaps if i call i shall bring soldiers to me and be forced to play the man before them and i am weary of that well i will lie here under the fence till morning it is a softer bed than some i have found and i am worn out with travelsleep i must and the figure sighed and turned so that the light of the moon fell full upon its face  my father it was the face of nada my daughter whom i had not seen for so many years yet across the years i knew it at once yes though the bud had become a flower i knew it the face was weary and worn but ah it was beautiful never before nor since have i seen such beauty for there was this about the loveliness of my daughter the lily it seemed to flow from withinyes as light will flow through the thin rind of a gourd and in that she differed from the other women of our people who when they are fair are fair with the flesh alone  now my heart went out to nada as she stood in the moonlight one forsaken not having where to lay her head nada who alone was left alive of all my children i motioned to umslopogaas to hide himself in the shadow and stepped forward  ho i said roughly who are you wanderer and what do you here  now nada started like a frightened bird but quickly gathered up her thoughts and turned upon me in a lordly way  who are you that ask me she said feigning a mans voice  one who can use a stick upon thieves and nightprowlers boy come show your business or be moving you are not of this people surely that moocha is of a swazi make and here we do not love swazis  were you not old i would beat you for your insolence said nada striving to look brave and all the while searching a way to escape also i have no stick only a spear and that is for warriors not for an old umfagozan like you ay my father i lived to hear my daughter name me an umfagozana low fellow  now making pretence to be angry i leaped at her with my kerrie up and forgetting her courage she dropped her spear and uttered a little scream but she still held the shield before her face i seized her by the arm and struck a blow upon the shield with my kerrieit would scarcely have crushed a fly but this brave warrior trembled sorely  where now is your valour you who name me umfagozan i said you who cry like a maid and whose arm is soft as a maids  she made no answer but hugged her tattered blanket round her and shifting my grip from her arm i seized it and rent it showing her breast and shoulder then i let her go laughing and said  lo here is the warrior that would beat an old umfagozan for his insolence a warrior well shaped for war now my pretty maid who wander at night in the garment of a man what tale have you to tell swift with it lest i drag you to the chief as his prize the old man seeks a new wife they tell me  now when nada saw that i had discovered her she threw down the shield after the spear as a thing that was of no more use and hung her head sullenly but when i spoke of dragging her to the chief then she flung herself upon the ground and clasped my knees for since i called him old she thought that this chief could not be umslopogaas  oh my father said the lily oh my father have pity on me yes yes i am a girl a maidno wifeand you who are old you perchance have daughters such as i and in their name i ask for pity my father i have journeyed far i have endured many things to find my way to a kraal where my brother rules and now it seems i have come to the wrong kraal forgive me that i spoke to you so my father it was but a womans feint and i was hard pressed to hide my sex for my father you know it is ill to be a lonely girl among strange men  now i said nothing in answer for this reason only that when i heard nada call me father not knowing me and saw her clasp my knees and pray to me in my daughters name i who was childless save for her went nigh to weeping but she thought that i did not answer her because i was angry and about to drag her to this unknown chief and implored me the more even with tears  my father she said do not this wicked thing by me let me go and show me the path that i shall ask you who are old you know that i am too fair to be dragged before this chief of yours hearken all i knew are dead i am alone except for this brother i seek oh if you betray me may such a fate fall upon your own daughter also may she also know the day of slavery and the love that she wills not and she ceased sobbing  now i turned my head and spoke towards the hut chief i said your ehlose is kind to you tonight for he has given you a maid fair as the lily of the halakazihere nada glanced up wildly come then and take the girl  now nada turned to snatch up the assegai from the ground but whether to kill me or the chief she feared so much or herself i do not know and as she turned in her woe she called upon the name of umslopogaas she found the assegai and straightened herself again and lo there before her stood a tall chief leaning on an axe but the old man who threatened her was gonenot very far in truth but round the corner of the hut  now nada the lily looked then rubbed her eyes and looked again  surely i dream she said at last but now i spoke to an old man and in his place there stands before me the shape of one whom i desire to see  i thought maiden that the voice of a certain nada called upon one umslopogaas said he who leaned upon the axe  ay i called but where is the old man who treated me so scurvily nay what does it matterwhere he is there let him stop at least you are umslopogaas my brother or should be by your greatness and the axe to the man i cannot altogether swear in this light but to the axe i can swear for once it passed so very near my eyes  thus she spoke on gaining time and all the while she watched umslopogaas till she was sure that it was he and no other then she ceased talking and flinging herself on him she kissed him  now i trust that zinita sleeps sound murmured umslopogaas for suddenly he remembered that nada was no sister of his as she thought  nevertheless he took her by the hand and said enter sister of all maidens in the world you are the most welcome here for know i believed you dead  but i mopo ran into the hut before her and when she entered she found me sitting by the fire  now here my brother said nada pointing at me with her finger here is that old umfagozan that low fellow who unless i dream but a very little while ago brought shame upon meay my brother he struck me a maid with his kerrie and that only because i said that i would stab him for his insolence and he did worse he swore that he would drag me to some old chief of his to be a gift to him and this he was about to do had you not come will you suffer these things to go unpunished my brother  now umslopogaas smiled grimly and i answered  what was it that you called me just now nada when you prayed me to protect you father was it not and i turned my face towards the blaze of the fire so that the full light fell upon it  yes i called you father old man it is not strange for a homeless wanderer must find fathers where she canand yet no it cannot beso changedand that white hand and yet oh who are you once there was a man named mopo and he had a little daughter and she was called nadaoh my father my father i know you now  ay nada and i knew you from the first through all your mans wrappings i knew you after these many years  so the lily fell upon my neck and sobbed there and i remember that i also wept  now when she had sobbed her fill of joy umslopogaas brought nada the lily mass to eat and mealie porridge she ate the curdled milk but the porridge she would not eat saying that she was too weary  then she told us all the tale of her wanderings since she had fled away from the side of umslopogaas at the stronghold of the halakazi and it was long so long that i will not repeat it for it is a story by itself this i will say only that nada was captured by robbers and for awhile passed herself off among them as a youth but in the end they found her out and would have given her as a wife to their chief only she persuaded them to kill the chief and make her their ruler they did this because of that medicine of the eyes which nada had only among women for as she ruled the halakazi so she ruled the robbers but at the last they all loved her and she gave it out that she would wed the strongest then some of them fell to fighting and while they killed each otherfor it came about that nada brought death upon the robbers as on all othersshe escaped for she said that she did not wish to look upon their struggle but would await the upshot in a place apart  after that she had many further adventures but at length she met an old woman who guided her on her way to the ghost mountain and who this old woman was none could discover but galazi swore afterwards that she was the stone witch of the mountain who put on the shape of an aged woman to guide nada to umslopogaas to be the sorrow and the joy of the people of the axe i do not know my father yet it seems to me that the old witch would scarcely have put off her stone for so small a matter  now when nada had made an end of her tale umslopogaas told his of how things had gone with dingaan when he told her how he had given the body of the girl to the king saying that it was the lilys stalk she said it had been well done and when he spoke of the slaying of the traitor she clapped her hands though nada whose heart was gentle did not love to hear of deeds of death at last he finished and she was somewhat sad and said it seemed that her fate followed her and that now the people of the axe were in danger at the hands of dingaan because of her  ah my brother she cried taking umslopogaas by the hand it were better i should die than that i should bring evil upon you also  that would not mend matters nada he answered for whether you be dead or alive the hate of dingaan is already earned also nada know this i am not your brother  when the lily heard these words she uttered a little cry and letting fall the hand of umslopogaas clasped mine shrinking up against me  what is this tale father she asked he who was my twin he with whom i have been bred up says that he has deceived me these many years that he is not my brother who then is he father  he is your cousin nada  ah she answered i am glad it would have grieved me had he whom i loved been shown to be but a stranger in whom i have no part and she smiled a little in the eyes and at the corners of her mouth but tell me this tale also  so i told her the tale of the birth of umslopogaas for i trusted her  ah she said when i had finished ah you come of a bad stock umslopogaas though it is a kingly one i shall love you little henceforth child of the hyena man  then that is bad news said umslopogaas for know nada i desire now that you should love me more than everthat you should be my wife and love me as your husband  now the lilys face grew sad and sweet and all the hidden mockery went out of her talkfor nada loved to mock  did you not speak to me on that night in the halakazi caves umslopogaas of one zinita who is your wife and inkosikaas of the people of the axe  then the brow of umslopogaas darkened what of zinita he said it is true she is my chieftainess is it not allowed a man to take more than one wife  so i trust answered nada smiling else men would go unwed for long for few maids would marry them who then must labour alone all their days but umslopogaas if there are twenty wives yet one must be first now this has come about hitherto that wherever i have been it has been thrust upon me to be first and perhaps it might be thus once morewhat then umslopogaas  let the fruit ripen before you pluck it nada he answered if you love me and will wed me it is enough  i pray that it may not be more than enough she said stretching out her hand to him listen umslopogaas ask my father here what were the words i spoke to him many years ago before i was a woman when with my mother macropha i left him to go among the swazi people it was after you had been borne away by the lion umslopogaas i told my father that i would marry no man all my life because i loved only you who were dead my father reproached me saying that i must not speak thus of my brother but it was my heart which spoke and it spoke truly for see umslopogaas you are no brother to me i have kept that vow how many men have sort me in wedlock since i became a woman umslopogaas i tell you that they are as the leaves upon a tree yet i have given myself to none and this has been my fortune that none have sought to constrain me to marriage now i have my reward for he whom i lost is found again and to him alone i give my love yet umslopogaas beware little luck has come to those who have loved me in the past no not even to those who have but sought to look on me  i will bear the risk nada the slaughterer answered and gathering her to his great breast he kissed her  presently she slipped from his arms and bade him begone for she was weary and would rest  so he went    chapter xxxi the war of the women  now on the morrow at daybreak leaving his wolves galazi came down from the ghost mountain and passed through the gates of the kraal  in front of my hut he saw nada the lily and saluted her for each remembered the other then he walked on to the place of assembly and spoke to me  so the star of death has risen on the people of the axe mopo he said was it because of her coming that my grey people howled so strangely last night i cannot tell but i know this the star shone first on me this morning and that is my doom well she is fair enough to be the doom of many mopo and he laughed and passed on swinging the watcher but his words troubled me though they were foolish for i could not but remember that wherever the beauty of nada had pleased the sight of men there men had been given to death  then i went to lead nada to the place of assembly and found her awaiting me she was dressed now in some womans garments that i had brought her her curling hair fell upon her shoulders on her wrist and neck and knee were bracelets of ivory and in her hand she bore a lily bloom which she had gathered as she went to bathe in the river perhaps she did this my father because she wished here as elsewhere to be known as the lily and it is the zulu fashion to name people from some such trifle but who can know a womans reason or whether a thing is by chance alone my father also she had begged me of a cape i had it was cunningly made by basutus of the whitest feathers of the ostrich this she put about her shoulders and it hung down to her middle it had been a custom with nada from childhood not to go about as do other girls naked except for their girdles for she would always find some rag or skin to lie upon her breast perhaps it was because her skin was fairer than that of other women or perhaps because she knew that she who hides her beauty often seems the loveliest or because there was truth in the tale of her white blood and the fashion came to her with the blood i do not know my father at the least she did so  now i took nada by the hand and led her through the morning air to the place of assembly and ah she was sweeter than the air and fairer than the dawn  there were many people in the place of assembly for it was the day of the monthly meeting of the council of the headmen and there also were all the women of the kraal and at their head stood zinita now it had got about that the girl whom the slaughterer went to seek in the caves of the halakazi had come to the kraal of the people of the axe and all eyes watched for her  wow said the men as she passed smiling looking neither to the right nor to the left yet seeing allwow but this flower is fair little wonder that the halakazi died for her  the women looked also but they said nothing of the beauty of nada they scarcely seemed to see it  that is she for whose sake so many of our people lie unburied said one  where then does she find her fine clothes quoth another she who came here last night a footsore wanderer  feathers are not enough for her look she must bear flowers also surely they are fitter to her hands than the handle of a hoe said a third  now i think that the chief of the people of the axe will find one to worship above the axe and that some will be left mourning put in a fourth glancing at zinita and the other women of the household of the slaughterer  thus they spoke throwing words like assegais and nada heard them all and knew their meaning but she never ceased from smiling only zinita said nothing but stood looking at nada from beneath her bent brows while by one hand she held the little daughter of umslopogaas her child and with the other played with the beads about her neck presently we passed her and nada knowing well who this must be turned her eyes full upon the angry eyes of zinita and held them there awhile now what there was in the glance of nada i cannot say but i know that zinita who was afraid of few things found something to fear in it at the least it was she who turned her head away and the lily passed on smiling and greeted umslopogaas with a little nod  hail nada said the slaughterer then he turned to his headmen and spoke this is she whom we went to the caves of the halakazi to seek for dingaan ou the story is known now one told it up at the kraal umgugundhlovu who shall tell it no more she prayed me to save her from dingaan and so i did and all would have gone well had it not been for a certain traitor who is done with for i took another to dingaan look on her now my friends and say if i did not well to win herthe lily flower such as there is no other in the world to be the joy of the people of the axe and a wife to me  with one accord the headmen answered indeed you did well slaughterer for the glamour of nada was upon them and they would cherish her as others had cherished her only galazi the wolf shook his head but he said nothing for words do not avail against fate now as i found afterwards since zinita the head wife of umslopogaas had learned of what stock he was she had known that nada was no sister to him yet when she heard him declare that he was about to take the lily to wife she turned upon him saying  how can this be lord  why do you ask zinita he answered is it not allowed to a man to take another wife if he will  surely lord she said but men do not wed their sisters and i have heard that it was because this nada was your sister that you saved her from dingaan and brought the wrath of dingaan upon the people of the axe the wrath that shall destroy them  so i thought then zinita he answered now i know otherwise nada is daughter to mopo yonder indeed but he is no father to me though he has been named so nor was the mother of nada my mother that is so councillors  then zinita looked at me and muttered o fool of a mouth not for nothing did i fear evil at your hands  i heard the words and took no note and she spoke again to umslopogaas saying here is a mystery o lord bulalio will it then please you to declare to us who is your father  i have no father he answered waxing wroth the heavens above are my father i am born of blood and fire and she the lily is born of beauty to be my mate now woman be silent he thought awhile and added nay if you will know my father was indabazimbi the witchfinder the smellerout of the king the son of arpi this umslopogaas said at a hazard since having denied me he must declare a father and dared not name the black one who was gone but in after years the saying was taken up in the land and it was told that umslopogaas was the son of indabazimbi the witchfinder who had long ago fled the land nor did he deny it for when all this game had been played out he would not have it known that he was the son of chaka he who no longer sought to be a king lest he should bring down the wrath of panda upon him  when the people heard this they thought that umslopogaas mocked zinita and yet in his anger he spoke truth when he said first that he was born of the heavens above for so we zulus name the king and so the witchdoctor indabazimbi named chaka on the day of the great smelling out but they did not take it in this sense they held that he spoke truly when he gave it out that he was born of indabazimbi the witchdoctor who had fled the land whither i do not know  then nada turned to zinita and spoke to her in a sweet and gentle voice if i am not sister to bulalio yet i shall soon be sister to you who are the chiefs inkosikaas zinita shall that not satisfy you and will you not greet me kindly and with a kiss of peace who have come from far to be your sister zinita and nada held out her hands towards her though whether she did this from the heart or because she would put herself in the right before the people i do not know but zinita scowled and jerked at her necklace of beads breaking the string on which they were threaded so that the beads rolled upon the black earthen floor this way and that  keep your kisses for our lord girl zinita said roughly as my beads are scattered so shall you scatter this people of the axe  now nada turned away with a little sigh and the people murmured for they thought that zinita had treated her badly then she stretched out her hand again and gave the lily in it to umslopogaas saying  here is a token of our betrothal lord for never a head of cattle have my father and i to sendwe who are outcasts and indeed the bridegroom must pay the cattle may i bring you peace and love my lord  umslopogaas took the flower and looked somewhat foolish with ithe who was wont to carry the axe and not a flower and so that talk was ended  now as it chanced this was that day of the year when according to ancient custom the holder of the axe must challenge all and sundry to come up against him to fight in single combat for groanmaker and the chieftainship of the people therefore when the talk was done umslopogaas rose and went through the challenge not thinking that any would answer him since for some years none had dared to stand before his might yet three men stepped forward and of these two were captains and men whom the slaughterer loved with all the people he looked at them astonished  how is this he said in a low voice to that captain who was nearest and who would do battle with him  for answer the man pointed to the lily who stood by then umslopogaas understood that because of the medicine of nadas beauty all men desired to win her and since he who could win the axe would take her also he must look to fight with many well fight he must or be shamed  of the fray there is little to tell umslopogaas killed first one man and then the other and swiftly for growing fearful the third did not come up against him  ah said galazi who watched what did i tell you mopo the curse begins to work death walks ever with that daughter of yours old man  i fear so i answered and yet the maiden is fair and good and sweet  that will not mend matters said galazi  now on that day umslopogaas took nada the lily to wife and for awhile there was peace and quiet but this evil thing came upon umslopogaas that from the day when he wedded nada he hated even to look upon zinita and not at her alone but on all his other wives also galazi said it was because nada had bewitched him but i know well that the only witcheries she used were the medicine of her eyes her beauty and her love still it came to pass that henceforward and until she had long been dead the slaughterer loved her and her alone and that is a strange sickness to come upon a man  as may be guessed my father zinita and the other women took this ill they waited awhile indeed thinking that it would wear away then they began to murmur both to their husband and in the ears of other people till at length there were two parties in the town the party of zinita and the party of nada  the party of zinita was made up of women and of certain men who loved and feared their wives but that of nada was the greatest and it was all of men with umslopogaas at the head of them and from this division came much bitterness abroad and quarrelling in the huts yet neither the lily nor umslopogaas heeded it greatly nor indeed anything so lost and well content were they in each others love  now on a certain morning after they had been married three full moons nada came from her husbands hut when the sun was already high and went down through the rock gully to the river to bathe on the right of the path to the river lay the mealiefields of the chief and in them laboured zinita and the other women of umslopogaas weeding the mealieplants they looked up and saw nada pass then worked on sullenly after awhile they saw her come again fresh from the bath very fair to see and having flowers twined among her hair and as she walked she sang a song of love now zinita cast down her hoe  is this to be borne my sisters she said  no answered another it is not to be borne what shall we doshall we fall upon her and kill her now  it would be more just to kill bulalio our lord answered zinita nada is but a woman and after the fashion of us women takes all that she can gather but he is a man and a chief and should know wisdom and justice  she has bewitched him with her beauty let us kill her said the other women  nay answered zinita i will speak with her and she went and stood in the path along which the lily walked singing her arms folded across her breast  now nada saw her and ceasing her song stretched out her hand to welcome her saying greeting sister but zinita did not take it it is not fitting sister she said that my hand stained with toil should defile yours fresh with the scent of flowers but i am charged with a message on my own behalf and the behalf of the other wives of our lord bulalio the weeds grow thick in yonder corn and we women are few now that your love days are over will not you come and help us if you brought no hoe from your swazi home surely we will buy you one  now nada saw what was meant and the blood poured to her head yet she answered calmly  i would willingly do this my sister though i have never laboured in the fields for wherever i have dwelt the men have kept me back from all work save such as the weaving of flowers or the stringing of beads but there is this against itumslopogaas my husband charged me that i should not toil with my hands and i may not disobey my husband  our husband charged you so nada nay then it is strange see now i am his head wife his inkosikaasit was i who taught him how to win the axe yet he has laid no command on me that i should not labour in the fields after the fashion of women i who have borne him children nor indeed has he laid such a command upon any of our sisters his other wives can it then be that bulalio loves you better than us nada  now the lily was in a trap and she knew it so she grew bold  one must be most loved zinita she said as one must be most fair you have had your hour leave me mine perhaps it will be short moreover this umslopogaas and i loved each other much long years before you or any of his wives saw him and we love each other to the end there is no more to say  nay nada there is still something to say there is this to say choose one of two things go and leave us to be happy with our lord or stay and bring death on all  now nada thought awhile and answered did i believe that my love would bring death on him i love it might well chance that i would go and leave him though to do so would be to die but zinita i do not believe it death chiefly loves the weak and if he falls it will be on the flower not on the slayer of men and she slipped past zinita and went on singing no more  zinita watched her till she was over the ridge and her face grew evil as she watched then she returned to the women  the lily flouts us all my sisters she said now listen my counsel is that we declare a feast of women to be held at the new moon in a secret place far away all the women and the children shall come to it except nada who will not leave her lover and if there be any man whom a woman loves perhaps my sisters that man would do well to go on a journey about the time of the new moon for evil things may happen at the town of the people of the axe while we are away celebrating our feast  what then shall befall my sister asked one  nay how can i tell she answered i only know that we are minded to be rid of nada and thus to be avenged on a man who has scorned our loveay and on those men who follow after the beauty of nada is it not so my sisters  it is so they answered  then be silent on the matter and let us give out our feast  now nada told umslopogaas of those words which she had bandied with zinita and the slaughterer was troubled yet because of his foolishness and of the medicine of nadas eyes he would not turn from his way and was ever at her side thinking of little else except of her thus when zinita came to him and asked leave to declare a feast of women that should be held far away he consented and gladly for above all things he desired to be free from zinita and her angry looks for awhile nor did he suspect a plot only he told her that nada should not go to the feast and in a breath both zinita and nada answered that his word was their will as indeed it was in this matter  now i mopo saw the glamour that had fallen upon my fosterling and spoke of it with galazi saying that a means must be found to wake him then i took galazi fully into my mind and told him all that he did not know of umslopogaas and that was little also i told him of my plans to bring the slaughterer to the throne and of what i had done to that end and of what i proposed to do and this was to go in person on a journey to certain of the great chiefs and win them over  galazi listened and said that it was well or ill as the chance might be for his part he believed that the daughter would pull down faster than i the father could build up and he pointed to nada who walked past us following umslopogaas  yet i determined to go and that was on the day before zinita won leave to celebrate the feast of women so i sought umslopogaas and told him and he listened indifferently for he would be going after nada and wearied of my talk of policy i bade him farewell and left him to nada also i bade farewell she kissed me yet the name of her husband was mingled with her goodbye  now madness has come upon these two i said to myself well it will wear off they will be changed before i come again  i guessed little my father how changed they would be    chapter xxxii zinita comes to the king  dingaan the king sat upon a day in the kraal umgugundhlovu waiting till his impis should return from the income that is now named the blood river he had sent them thither to destroy the laager of the boers and thence as he thought they would presently return with victory idly he sat in the kraal watching the vultures wheel above the hill of slaughter and round him stood a regiment  my birds are hungry he said to a councillor  doubtless there shall soon be meat to feed them o king the councillor answered  as he spoke one came near saying that a woman sought leave to speak to the king upon some great matter  let her come he answered i am sick for tidings perhaps she can tell of the impi  presently the woman was led in she was tall and fair and she held two children by the hand  what is thine errand asked dingaan  justice o king she answered  ask for blood it shall be easier to find  i ask blood o king  the blood of whom  the blood of bulalio the slaughterer chief of the people of the axe the blood of nada the lily and of all those who cling to her  now dingaan sprang up and swore an oath by the head of the black one who was gone  what he cried does the lily then live as the soldier thought  she lives o king she is wife to the slaughterer and because of her witchcraft he has put me his first wife away against all law and honour therefore i ask vengeance on the witch and vengeance also on him who was my husband  thou art a good wife said the king may my watching spirit save me from such a one hearken i would gladly grant thy desire for i too hate this slaughterer and i too would crush this lily yet woman thou comest in a bad hour here i have but one regiment and i think that the slaughterer may take some killing wait till my impis return from wiping out the white amaboona and it shall be as thou dost desire whose are those children  they are my children and the children of bulalio who was my husband  the children of him whom thou wouldst cause to be slain  yea king  surely woman thou art as good a mother as wife said dingaan now i have spokenbegone  but the heart of zinita was hungry for vengeance vengeance swift and terrible on the lily who lay in her place and on her husband who had thrust her aside for the lilys sake she did not desire to waitno not even for an hour  hearken o king she cried the tale is not yet all told this man bulalio plots against thy throne with mopo son of makedama who was thy councillor  he plots against my throne woman the lizard plots against the cliff on which it suns itself then let him plot and as for mopo i will catch him yet  yes o king but that is not all the tale this man has another namehe is named umslopogaas son of mopo but he is no son of mopo he is son to the black one who is dead the mighty king who was thy brother by baleka sister to mopo yes i know it from the lips of mopo i know all the tale he is heir to thy throne by blood o king and thou sittest in his place  for a little while dingaan sat astounded then he commanded zinita to draw near and tell him that tale  now behind the stool on which he sat stood two councillors nobles whom dingaan loved and these alone had heard the last words of zinita he bade these nobles stand in front of him out of earshot and away from every other man then zinita drew near and told dingaan the tale of the birth of umslopogaas and all that followed and by many a token and many a deed of chakas which he remembered dingaan the king knew that it was a true story  when at length she had done he summoned the captain of the regiment that stood around he was a great man named faku and he also summoned certain men who do the kings bidding to the captain of the impi he spoke sharply saying  take three companies and guides and come by night to the town of the people of the axe that is by ghost mountain and burn it and slay all the wizards who sleep therein most of all slay the chief of the people who is named bulalio the slaughterer or umslopogaas kill him by torture if you may but kill him and bring his head to me take that wife of his who is known as nada the lily alive if ye can and bring her to me for i would cause her to be slain here bring the cattle also now go and go swiftly this hour if ye return having failed in one jot of my command ye die every one of youye die and slowly begone  the captain saluted and running to his regiment issued a command three full companies leapt forward at his word and ran after him through the gates of the kraal umgugundhlovu heading for the ghost mountain  then dingaan called to those who do the kings bidding and pointing to the two nobles his councillors who had heard the words of zinita commanded that they should be killed  the nobles heard and having saluted the king covered their faces knowing that they must die because they had learned too much so they were killed now it was one of these councillors who had said that doubtless meat would soon be found to feed the kings birds  then the king commanded those who do his bidding that they should take the children of zinita and make away with them  but when zinita heard this she cried aloud for she loved her children then dingaan mocked her  what he said art thou a fool as well as wicked thou sayest that thy husband whom thou hast given to death is born of one who is dead and is heir to my throne thou sayest also that these children are born of him therefore when he is dead they will be heirs to my throne am i then mad that i should suffer them to live woman thou hast fallen into thine own trap take them away  now zinita tasted of the cup which she had brewed for other lips and grew distraught in her misery and wrung her hands crying that she repented her of the evil and would warn umslopogaas and the lily of that which awaited them and she turned to run towards the gates but the king laughed and nodded and they brought her back and presently she was dead also  thus then my father prospered the wickedness of zinita the head wife of umslopogaas my fosterling  now these were the last slayings that were wrought at the kraal umgugundhlovu for just as dingaan had made an end of them and once more grew weary he lifted his eyes and saw the hillsides black with men who by their dress were of his own impimen whom he had sent out against the boers  and yet where was the proud array where the plumes and shields where the song of victory here indeed were soldiers but they walked in groups like women and hung their heads like chidden children  then he learned the truth the impi had been defeated by the banks of the income thousands had perished at the laager mowed down by the guns of the boers thousands more had been drowned in the income till the waters were red and the bodies of the slain pushed each other under and those who still lived walked upon them  dingaan heard and was seized with fear for it was said that the amaboona followed fast on the track of the conquered  that day he fled to the bush on the black umfolozi river and that night the sky was crimson with the burning of the kraal umgugundhlovu where the elephant should trumpet no more and the vultures were scared from the hill of slaughter by the roaring of the flames        galazi sat on the lap of the stone witch gazing towards the wide plains below that were yet white with the moon though the night grew towards the morning greysnout whined at his side and deathgrip thrust his muzzle into his hand but galazi took no heed for he was brooding on the fall of umslopogaas from the man that he had been to the level of a womans slave and on the breaking up of the people of the axe because of the coming of nada for all the women and the children were gone to this feast of women and would not return for long and it seemed to galazi that many of the men had slipped away also as though they smelt some danger from afar  ah deathgrip said galazi aloud to the wild brute at his side changed is the wolf king my brother all changed because of a womans kiss now he hunts no more no more shall groanmaker be aloft it is a womans kiss he craves not the touch of your rough tongue it is a womans hand he holds not the smooth haft of horn he who of all men was the fiercest and the first for this last shame has overtaken him surely chaka was a great king though an evil and he showed his greatness when he forbade marriage to the warriors marriage that makes the heart soft and turns blood to water  now galazi ceased and gazed idly towards the kraal of the people of the axe and as he looked his eyes caught a gleam of light that seemed to travel in and out of the edge of the shadow of ghost mountain as a womans needle travels through a skin now seen and now lost in the skin  he started and watched ah there the light came out from the shadow now by chakas head it was the light of spears  one moment more galazi watched it was a little impi perhaps they numbered two hundred men running silently but not to battle for they wore no plumes yet they went out to kill for they ran in companies and each man carried assegais and a shield  now galazi had heard tell of such impis that hunt by night and he knew well that these were the kings dogs and their game was men a big kraal of sleeping men otherwise there had been fewer dogs is a whole pack sent out to catch an antelope on its form galazi wondered whom they sought ah now they turned to the ford and he knew it was his brother umslopogaas and nada the lily and the people of the axe these were the kings dogs and zinita had let them slip for this reason she had called a feast of women and taken the children with her for this reason so many had been summoned from the kraal by one means or another it was that they might escape the slaughter  galazi bounded to his feet for one moment he thought might not these hunters be hunted could he not destroy them by the jaws of the wolves as once before they had destroyed a certain impi of the kings ay if he had seen them but one hour before then scarcely a man of them should have lived to reach the stream for he would have waylaid them with his wolves but now it might not be the soldiers neared the ford and galazi knew well that his grey people would not hunt on the further plain though for this he had heard one reason only that which was given him by the lips of the dead in a dream  what then might be done one thing alone warn umslopogaas yet how for him who could swim a rushing river there was indeed a swifter way to the place of the people of the axea way that was to the path of the impi as is the bowstring to the strung bow and yet they had travelled wellnigh half the length of the bow still he might do it he whose feet were the swiftest in the land except those of umslopogaas at the least he would try mayhap the impi would tarry to drink at the ford  so galazi thought in his heart and his thought was swift as the light then with a bound he was away down the mountain side from boulder to boulder he leapt like a buck he crashed through the brake like a bull he skimmed the level like a swallow the mountain was travelled now there in front of him lay the yellow river foaming in its flood so he had swum it before when he went to see the dead ah a good leap far out into the torrent it was strong but he breasted it he was through he stood upon the bank shaking the water from him like a dog and now he was away up the narrow gorge of stones to the long slope running low as his wolves ran  before him lay the townone side shone silver with the sinking moon one was grey with the breaking dawn ah they were there he saw them moving through the grass by the eastern gate he saw the long lines of slayers creep to the left and the right  how could he pass them before the circle of death was drawn six spearthrows to run and they had but such a little way the mealieplants were tall and at a spot they almost touched the fence up the path could umslopogaas his brother move more fast he wondered than the wolf who sped to save him he was there hidden by the mealie stalks and there along the fence to the right and to the left the slayers crept  wow what was that said one soldier of the king to another man as they joined their guard completing the death circle wow something great and black crashed through the fence before me  i heard it brother answered the other man i heard it but i saw nothing it must have been a dog no man could leap so high  more like a wolf said the first at the least let us pray that it was not an esedowan 1 who will put us into the hole in its back is your fire ready brother wow these wizards shall wake warm the signal should be soon   1 a fabulous animal reported by the zulus to carry off human beings     in a hole in its back  then arose the sound of a great voice crying awake ye sleepers the foe is at your gates    chapter xxxiii the end of the people black and grey  galazi rushed through the town crying aloud and behind him rose a stir of men all slept and no sentinels were set for umslopogaas was so lost in his love for the lily that he forgot his wisdom and thought no more of war or death or of the hate of dingaan presently the wolf came to the large new hut which umslopogaas had caused to be built for nada the lily and entered it for there he knew that he should find his brother bulalio on the far side of the hut the two lay sleeping and the head of umslopogaas rested on the lilys breast and by his side gleamed the great axe groanmaker  awake cried the wolf  now umslopogaas sprang to his feet grasping at his axe but nada threw her arms wide murmuring let me sleep on sweet is sleep  sound shall ye sleep anon gasped galazi swift brother bind on the wolfs hide take shield swift i sayfor the slayers of the king are at your gates  now nada sprang up also and they did his bidding like people in a dream and while they found their garments and a shield galazi took beer and drank it and got his breath again they stood without the hut now the heaven was grey and east and west and north and south tongues of flame shot up against the sky for the town had been fired by the slayers  umslopogaas looked and his sense came back to him he understood which way brother he said  through the fire and the impi to our grey people on the mountain said galazi there if we can win it we shall find succour  what of my people in the kraal asked umslopogaas  they are not many brother the women and the children are gone i have roused the menmost will escape hence ere we burn  now they ran towards the fence and as they went men joined them to the number of ten half awakened fearstricken armedsome with spears some with clubsand for the most part naked they sped on together towards the fence of the town that was now but a ring of fire umslopogaas and galazi in front each holding the lily by a hand they neared the fencefrom without came the shouts of the slayerslo it was afire nada shrank back in fear but umslopogaas and galazi dragged her on they rushed at the blazing fence smiting with axe and club it broke before them they were through but little harmed without were a knot of the slayers standing back a small space because of the heat of the flames the slayers saw them and crying this is bulalio kill the wizard sprang towards them with uplifted spears now the people of the axe made a ring round nada and in the front of it were umslopogaas and galazi then they rushed on and met those of the slayers who stood before them and the men of dingaan were swept away and scattered by groanmaker and the watcher as dust is swept of a wind as grass is swept by a sickle  they were through with only one man slain but the cry went up that the chief of the wizards and the lily his wife had fled then as it was these whom he was chiefly charged to kill the captain called off the impi from watching for the dwellers in the town and started in pursuit of umslopogaas now at this time nearly a hundred men of the people of the axe had been killed and of the slayers some fifty men for having been awakened by the crying of galazi the soldiers of the axe fought bravely though none saw where his brother stood and none knew whither their chief had fled except those ten who went with the brethren  meanwhile the wolfbrethren and those with them were well away and it had been easy for them to escape who were the swiftestfooted of any in the land but the pace of a regiment is the pace of its slowestfooted soldier and nada could not run with the wolfbrethren yet they made good speed and were halfway down the gorge that led to the river before the companies of dingaan poured into it now they came to the end of it and the foe was nearthis end of the gorge is narrow my father like the neck of a gourdthen galazi stopped and spoke  halt ye people of the axe he said and let us talk awhile with these who follow till we get our breath again but you my brother pass the river with the lily in your hand we will join you in the forest but if perchance we cannot find you you know what must be done set the lily in the cave then return and call up the grey impi wow my brother i must find you if i may for if these men of dingaan have a mind for sport there shall be such a hunting on the ghost mountain as the old witch has not seen go now my brother  it is not my way to turn and run while others stand and fight growled umslopogaas yet because of nada it seems that i must  oh heed me not my love said nada i have brought thee sorrowi am weary let me die kill me and save yourselves  for answer umslopogaas took her by the hand and fled towards the river but before he reached it he heard the sounds of the fray the warcry of the slayers as they poured upon the people of the axe the howl of his brother the wolf when the battle joineday and the crash of the watcher as the blow went home  well bitten wolf he said stopping that one shall need no more oh that i mightbut again he looked at nada and sped on  now they had leaped into the foaming river and here it was well that the lily could swim else both had been lost but they won through and passed forward to the mountains flank here they walked on among the trees till the forest was almost passed and at length umslopogaas heard the howling of a wolf  then he must set nada on his shoulders and carry her as once galazi had carried another for it was death for any except the wolfbrethren to walk on the ghost mountain when the wolves were awake  presently the wolves flocked around him and leaped upon him in joy glaring with fierce eyes at her who sat upon his shoulders nada saw them and almost fell from her seat fainting with fear for they were many and dreadful and when they howled her blood turned to ice  but umslopogaas cheered her telling her that these were his dogs with whom he went out hunting and with whom he should hunt presently at length they came to the knees of the old witch and the entrance to the cave it was empty except for a wolf or two for galazi abode here seldom now but when he was on the mountain would sleep in the forest which was nearer the kraal of his brother the slaughterer  here you must stay sweet said umslopogaas when he had driven out the wolves here you must rest till this little matter of the slayers is finished would that we had brought food but we had little time to seek it see now i will show you the secret of the stone thus far i will push it no farther now a touch only is needed to send it over the socket and home but then they must be two strong men who can pull it back again therefore push it no farther except in the utmost need lest it remain where it fall whether you will it or not have no fear you are safe here none know of this place except galazi myself and the wolves and none shall find it now i must be going to find galazi if he still lives if not to make what play i can against the slayers alone with the wolves  now nada wept saying that she feared to be left and that she should never see him more and her grief rung his heart nevertheless umslopogaas kissed her and went closing the stone after him in that fashion of which he had spoken when the stone was shut the cave was almost dark except for a ray of light that entered by a hole little larger than a mans hand that looked at from within was on the right of the stone nada sat herself so that this ray struck full on her for she loved light and without it she would pine as flowers do there she sat and thought in the darksome cave and was filled with fear and sorrow and while she brooded thus suddenly the ray went out and she heard a noise as of some beast that smells at prey she looked and in the gloom she saw the sharp nose and grinning fangs of a wolf that were thrust towards her through the little hole  nada cried aloud in fear and the fangs were snatched back but presently she heard a scratching without the cave and saw the stone shake then she thought in her foolishness that the wolf knew how to open the stone and that he would do this and devour her for she had heard the tale that all these wolves were the ghosts of evil men having the understanding of men so in her fear and folly she seized the rock and dragged on it as umslopogaas had shown her how to do it shook it slipped over the socket ledge and rolled home like a pebble down the mouth of a gourd  now i am safe from the wolves said nada see i cannot so much as stir the stone from within and she laughed a little then ceased from laughing and spoke again yet it would be ill if umslopogaas came back no more to roll away that rock for then i should be like one in a graveas one who is placed in a grave being yet strong and quick she shuddered as she thought of it but presently started up and set her ear to the hole to listen for from far down the mountain there rose a mighty howling and a din of men  when umslopogaas had shut the cave he moved swiftly down the mountain and with him went certain of the wolves not all for he had not summoned them his heart was heavy for he feared that galazi was no more also he was mad with rage and plotted in himself to destroy the slayers of the king every man of them but first he must learn what they would do presently as he wended he heard a long low howl far away in the forest then he rejoiced for he knew the callit was the call of galazi who had escaped the spears of the slayers  swiftly he ran calling in answer he won the place there seated on a stone resting himself was galazi and round him surged the numbers of the grey people umslopogaas came to him and looked at him for he seemed somewhat weary there were flesh wounds on his great breast and arms the little shield was wellnigh hewn to strips and the watcher showed signs of war  how went it brother asked umslopogaas  not so ill but all those who stood with me in the way are dead and with them a few of the foe i alone am fled like a coward they came on us thrice but we held them back till the lily was safe then all our men being down i ran umslopogaas and swam the torrent for i was minded to die here in my own place  now though he said little of it i must tell you my father that galazi had made a great slaughter there in the neck of the donga afterwards i counted the slain and they were many the nine men of the people of the axe were hidden in them  perhaps it shall be the slayers who die brother  perhaps at least there shall be death for some still it is in my mind slaughterer that our brotherhood draws to an end for the fate of him who bears the watcher and which my father foretold is upon me if so farewell while it lasted our friendship has been good and its ending shall be good moreover it would have endured for many a year to come had you not sought slaughterer to make good better and to complete our joy of fellowship and war with the love of women from that source flow these ills as a river from a spring but so it was fated if i fall in this fray may you yet live on to fight in many another and at the last to die gloriously with axe aloft and may you find a brisker man and a better watcher to serve you in your need should you fall and i live on i promise this i will avenge you to the last and guard the lily whom you love offering her comfort but no more now the foe draws on they have travelled round about by the ford for they dared not face the torrent and they cried to me that they are sworn to slay us or be slain as dingaan the king commanded so the fighting will be of the best if indeed they do not run before the fangs of the grey people now chief speak your word that i may obey it  thus galazi spoke in the circle of the wolves while umslopogaas leaned upon his axe groanmaker and listened to him ay and wept as he listened for after the lily and me mopo he loved galazi most dearly of all who lived then he answered  were it not for one in the cave above who is helpless and tender i would swear to you wolf that if you fall on your carcase i will die and i do swear that should you fall while i live groanmaker shall be busy from year to year till every man of yonder impi is as you are perchance i did ill galazi when first i hearkened to the words of zinita and suffered women to come between us may we one day find a land where there are no women and war only for in that land we shall grow great but now at the least we will make a good end to this fellowship and the grey people shall fight their fill and the old witch who sits aloft waiting for the world to die shall smile to see that fight if she never smiled before this is my word that we fall upon the men of dingaan twice once in the glade of the forest whither they will come presently and if we are beaten back then we must stand for the last time on the knees of the witch in front of the cave where nada is say wolf will the grey folk fight  to the last brother so long as one is left to lead them after that i do not know still they have only fangs to set against spears slaughterer your plan is good come i am rested  so they rose and numbered their flock and all were there though it was not as it had been years ago when first the wolfbrethren hunted on ghost mountain for many of the wolves had died by mens spears when they harried the kraals of men and no young were born to them then as once before the pack was halved and half the shewolves went with umslopogaas and half the dogwolves went with galazi  now they passed down the forest paths and hid in the tangle of the thickets at the head of the darksome glen one on each side of the glen here they waited till they heard the footfall of the impi of the kings slayers as it came slowly along seeking them in front of the impi went two soldiers watching for an ambush and these two men were the same who had talked together that dawn when galazi sprang between them now also they spoke as they peered this way and that then seeing nothing stood awhile in the mouth of the glen waiting the coming of their company and their words came to the ears of umslopogaas  an awful place this my brother said one a place full of ghosts and strange sounds of hands that seem to press us back and whinings as of invisible wolves it is named ghost mountain and well named would that the king had found other business for us than the slaying of these sorcerersfor they are sorcerers indeed and this is the home of their sorceries tell me brother what was that which leaped between us this morning in the dark i say it was a wizard wow they are all wizards could any who was but a man have done the deeds which he who is named the wolf wrought down by the river yonder and then have escaped had the axe but stayed with the club they would have eaten up our impi  the axe had a woman to watch laughed the other yes it is true this is a place of wizards and evil things methinks i see the red eyes of the esedowana glaring at us through the dark of the trees and smell their smell yet these wizards must be caught for know this my brother if we return to umgugundhlovu with the kings command undone then there are stakes hardening in the fire of which we shall taste the point if we are all killed in the catching and some it seems are missing already yet they must be caught say my brother shall we draw on the impi is nigh would that faku our captain yonder might find two others to take our place for in this thicket i had rather run last than first well here leads the spoora wondrous mass of wolfspoor mixed with the footprints of men perhaps they are sometimes the one and sometimes the otherwho knows my brother it is a land of ghosts and wizards let us on let us on  now all this while the wolfbrethren had much ado to keep their people quiet for their mouths watered and their eyes shone at the sight of the men and at length it could be done no more for with a howl a single shewolf rushed from her laid and leapt at the throat of the man who spoke nor did she miss her grip down went wolf and man rolling together on the ground and there they killed each other  the esedowana the esedowana are upon us cried the other scout and turning fled towards the impi but he never reached it for with fearful howlings the ghostwolves broke their cover and rushed on him from the right and the left and lo there was nothing of him left except his spear alone  now a low cry of fear rose from the impi and some turned to fly but faku the captain a great and brave man shouted to them stand firm children of the king stand firm these are no esedowana these are but the wolfbrethren and their pack what will ye run from dogs ye who have laughed at the spears of men ring round stand fast  the soldiers heard the voice of their captain and they obeyed his voice forming a double circle a ring within a ring they looked to the right there groanmaker aloft the wolf fangs on his brow the worn wolfhide streaming on the wind bulalio rushed upon them like a storm and with him came his redeyed company they looked to the leftah well they know that mighty watcher have they not heard his strokes down by the river and well they know the giant who wields it like a wand the wolf king with the strength of ten wow they are here see the people black and grey hear them howl their warchant look how they leap like waterleap in a foam of fangs against the hedge of spears the circle is broken groanmaker has broken it ha galazi also is through the double ring now must men stand back to back or perish  how long did it last who can say time flies fast when blows fall thick at length the brethren are beaten back they break out as they broke in and are gone with such of their wolffolk as were left alive yet that impi was somewhat the worse but onethird of those lived who looked on the sun without the forest the rest lay smitten torn mangled dead hidden under the heaps of bodies of wild beasts  now this is a battle of evil spirits that live in the shapes of wolves and as for the wolfbrethren they are sorcerers of the rarest said faku the captain and such sorcerers i love for they fight furiously yet i will slay them or be slain at the least if there be few of us left the most of the wolves are dead also and the arms of the wizards grow weary  so he moved forward up the mountain with those of the soldiers who remained and all the way the wolves harried them pulling down a man here and a man there but though they heard and saw them cheering on their pack the wolfbrethren attacked them no more for they saved their strength for the last fight of all  the road was long up the mountain and the soldiers knew little of the path and ever the ghostwolves harried on their flanks so it was evening before they came to the feet of the stone witch and began to climb to the platform of her knees there on her knees as it were they saw the wolfbrethren standing side by side such a pair as were not elsewhere in the world and they seemed afire for the sunset beat upon them and the wolves crept round their feet red with blood and fire  a glorious pair quoth great faku would that i fought with them rather than against them yet they must die then he began to climb to the knees of the witch  now umslopogaas glanced up at the stone face of her who sat aloft and it was alight with the sunset  said i not that the old witch should smile at this fray he cried lo she smiles up galazi let us spend the remnant of our people on the foe and fight this fight out man to man with no beast to spoil it ho blood and greysnout ho deathgrip ho wooddwellers grey and black at them my children  the wolves heard they were few and they were sorry to see with weariness and wounds but still they were fierce with a howl for the last time they leaped down upon the foe tearing harrying and killing till they themselves were dead by the spear every one of them except deathgrip who crept back sorely wounded to die with galazi  now i am a chief without a people cried galazi well it has been my lot in life so it was in the halakazi kraals so it is on ghost mountain at the last and so also shall it be even for the greatest kings when they come to their ends seeing that they too must die alone say slaughterer choose where you will stand to the left or to the right  now my father the track below separated because of a boulder and there were two little paths which led to the platform of the witchs knees with perhaps ten paces between them umslopogaas guarded the lefthand path and galazi took the right then they waited having spears in their hands presently the soldiers came round the rock and rushed up against them some on one path and some on the other  then the brethren hurled their spears at them and killed three men now the assegais were done and the foe was on them umslopogaas bends forward his long arm shoots out the axe gleams and a man who came on falls back  one cries umslopogaas  one my brother answers galazi as he draws back the watcher from his blow  a soldier rushes forward singing to and fro he moves in front of umslopogaas his spear poised to strike groanmaker swoops down but the man leaps back the blow misses and the slaughterers guard is down  a poor stroke sorcerer cries the man as he rushes in to stab him lo the axe wheels in the air it circles swiftly low down by the ground it smites upward before the spearsman can strike the horn of groanmaker has sped from chin to brain  but a good return fool says umslopogaas  two cries galazi from the right  two my brother answers umslopogaas  again two men come on one against each to find no better luck the cry of three passes from brother to brother and after it rises the cry of four  now faku bids the men who are left to hold their shields together and push the two from the mouths of the paths and this they do losing four more men at the hands of the brethren before it is done  now we are on the open ring them round and down with them cries faku  but who shall ring round groanmaker that shines on all sides at once groanmaker who falls heavily no more but pecks and pecks and pecks like a woodbird on a tree and never pecks in vain who shall ring round those feet swifter than the sassaby of the plains wow he is here he is there he is a sorcerer death is in his hand and death looks out of his eyes  galazi lives yet for still there comes the sound of the watcher as it thunders on the shields and the wolfs hoarse cry of the number of the slain he has a score of wounds yet he fights on his leg is almost hewn from him with an axe yet he fights on his back is pierced again and again yet he fights on but two are left alive before him one twists round and spears him from behind he heeds it not but smites down the foe in front then he turns and whirling the watcher on high brings him down for the last time and so mightily that the man before him is crushed like an egg  galazi brushes the blood from his eyes and glares round on the dead all slaughterer he cries  all save two my brother comes the answer sounding above the clash of steel and the sound of smitten shields  now the wolf would come to him but cannot for his life ebbs  fare you well my brother death is good thus indeed i would die for i have made me a mat of men to lie on he cried with a great voice  fare you well sleep softly wolf came the answer all save one  now galazi fell dying on the dead but he was not altogether gone for he still spoke all save one ha ha ill for that one then when groanmaker yet is up it is well to have lived so to die victory victory  and galazi the wolf struggled to his knees and for the last time shook the watcher about his head then fell again and died  umslopogaas the son of chaka and faku the captain of dingaan gazed on each other they alone were left standing upon the mountain for the rest were all down umslopogaas had many wounds faku was unhurt he was a strong man also armed with an axe  faku laughed aloud so it has come to this slaughterer he said that you and i must settle whether the kings word be done or no well i will say that however it should fall out i count it a great fortune to have seen this fight and the highest of honours to have had to do with two such warriors rest you a little slaughterer before we close that wolfbrother of yours died well and if it is given me to conquer in this bout i will tell the tale of his end from kraal to kraal throughout the land and it shall be a tale forever    chapter xxxiv the lilys farewell  umslopogaas listened but he made no answer to the words of faku the captain though he liked them well for he would not waste his breath in talking and the light grew low  i am ready man of dingaan he said and lifted his axe  now for awhile the two circled round and round each waiting for a chance to strike presently faku smote at the head of umslopogaas but the slaughterer lifted groanmaker to ward the blow faku crooked his arm and let the axe curl downwards so that its keen edge smote umslopogaas upon the head severing his mans ring and the scalp beneath  made mad with the pain the slaughterer awoke as it were he grasped groanmaker with both hands and struck thrice the first blow hewed away the plumes and shield of faku and drove him back a spears length the second missed its aim the third and mightiest twisted in his wet hands so that the axe smote sideways nevertheless it fell full on the breast of the captain faku shattering his bones and sweeping him from the ledge of rock on to the slope beneath where he lay still  it is finished with the daylight said umslopogaas smiling grimly now dingaan send more slayers to seek your slain and he turned to find nada in the cave  but faku the captain was not yet dead though he was hurt to death he sat up and with his last strength he hurled the axe in his hand at him whose might had prevailed against him the axe sped true and umslopogaas did not see it fly it sped true and its point struck him on the left temple driving in the bone and making a great hole then faku fell back dying and umslopogaas threw up his arms and dropped like an ox drops beneath the blow of the butcher and lay as one dead under the shadow of a stone  all day long nada crouched in the cave listening to the sounds of war that crept faintly up the mountain side howling of wolves shouting of men and the clamour of iron on iron all day long she sat and now evening came apace and the noise of battle drew near swelled and sank and died away she heard the voices of the wolfbrethren as they called to each other like bucks naming the number of the slain she heard galazis cry of victory and her heart leapt to it though she knew that there was death in the cry then for the last time she heard the faint ringing of iron on iron and the light went out and all grew still  all grew still as the night there came no more shouting of men and no more clash of arms no howlings of wolves no cries of pain or triumphall was quiet as death for death had taken all  for awhile nada the lily sat in the dark of the cave saying to herself presently he will come my husband he will surely come the slayers are slainhe does not but tarry to bind his wounds a scratch perchance here and there yes he will come and it is well for i am weary of my loneliness and this place is grim and evil  thus she spoke to herself in hope but nothing came except the silence then she spoke again and her voice echoed in the hollow cave now i will be bold i will fear nothing i will push aside the stone and go out to find him i know well he does but linger to tend some who are wounded perhaps galazi doubtless galazi is wounded i must go and nurse him though he never loved me and i do not love him overmuch who would stand between me and my husband this wild wolfman is a foe to women and most of all a foe to me yet i will be kind to him come i will go at once and she rose and pushed at the rock  why what was this it did not stir then she remembered that she had pulled it beyond the socket because of her fear of the wolf and that the rock had slipped a little way down the neck of the cave umslopogaas had told her that she must not do this and she had forgotten his words in her foolishness perhaps she could move the stone no not by the breadth of a grain of corn she was shut in without food or water and here she must bide till umslopogaas came and if he did not come then she must surely die  now she shrieked aloud in her fear calling on the name of umslopogaas the walls of the cave answered umslopogaas umslopogaas and that was all  afterwards madness fell upon nada my daughter and she lay in the cave for days and nights nor knew ever how long she lay and with her madness came visions for she dreamed that the dead one whom galazi had told her of sat once more aloft in his niche at the end of the cave and spoke to her saying  galazi is dead the fate of him who bears the watcher has fallen on him dead are the ghostwolves i also am dead of hunger in this cave and as i died so shall you die nada the lily nada star of death because of whose beauty and foolishness all this death has come about  this is seemed to nada in her madness that the shadow of him who had sat in the niche spoke to her from hour to hour  it seemed to nada in her madness that twice the light shone through the hole by the rock and that was day and twice it went out and that was night a third time the ray shone and died away and lo her madness left her and she awoke to know that she was dying and that a voice she loved spoke without the hole saying in hollow accents  nada do you still live nada  yea she answered hoarsely water give me water  next she heard a sound as of a great snake dragging itself along painfully a while passed then a trembling hand thrust a little gourd of water through the hole she drank and now she could speak though the water seemed to flow through her veins like fire  is it indeed you umslopogaas she said or are you dead and do i dream of you  it is i nada said the voice hearken have you drawn the rock home  alas yes she answered perhaps if the two of us strive at it it will move  ay if our strength were what it wasbut now still let us try  so they strove with a rock but the two of them together had not the strength of a girl and it would not stir  give over umslopogaas said nada we do but waste the time that is left to me let us talk  for awhile there was no answer for umslopogaas had fainted and nada beat her breast thinking that he was dead  presently he spoke however saying it may not be we must perish here one on each side of the stone not seeing the others face for my might is as water nor can i stand upon my feet to go and seek for food  are you wounded umslopogaas asked nada  ay nada i am pierced to the brain with the point of an axe no fair stroke the captain of dingaan hurled it at me when i thought him dead and i fell i do not know how long i have lain yonder under the shadow of the rock but it must be long for my limbs are wasted and those who fell in the fray are picked clean by the vultures all except galazi for the old wolf deathgrip lies on his breast dying but not dead licking my brothers wounds and scares the fowls away it was the beak of a vulture who had smelt me out at last that woke me from my sleep beneath the stone nada and i crept hither would that he had not awakened me would that i had died as i lay rather than lived a little while till you perish thus like a trapped fox nada and presently i follow you  it is hard to die so umslopogaas she answered i who am yet young and fair who love you and hoped to give you children but so it has come about and it may not be put away i am wellnigh sped husband horror and fear have conquered me my strength fails but i suffer little let us talk no more of death let us rather speak of our childhood when we wandered hand in hand let us talk also of our love and of the happy hours that we have spent since your great axe rang upon the rock in the halakazi caves and my fear told you the secret of my womanhood see i thrust my hand through the hole can you not kiss it umslopogaas  now umslopogaas stooped his shattered head and kissed the lilys little hand then he held it in his own and so they sat till the endhe without resting his back against the rock she within lying on her side her arm stretched through the little hole they spoke of their love and tried to forget their sorrow in it he told her also of the fray which had been and how it went  ah she said that was zinitas work zinita who hated me and justly doubtless she set dingaan on this path  a little while gone quoth umslopogaas and i hoped that your last breath and mine might pass together nada and that we might go together to seek great galazi my brother where he is now i hope that help will find me and that i may live a little while because of a certain vengeance which i would wreak  speak not of vengeance husband she answered i too am near to that land where the slayer and the slain the shedder of blood and the avenger of blood are lost in the same darkness i would die with love and love only in my heart and your name and yours only on my lips so that if anywhere we live again it shall be ready to spring forth to greet you yet husband it is in my heart that you will not go with me but that you shall live on to die the greatest of deaths far away from here and because of another woman it seems that as i lay in the dark of this cave i saw you umslopogaas a great man gaunt and grey stricken to the death and the axe groanmaker wavering aloft and many a man dead upon a white and shimmering way and about you the fair faces of white women and you had a hole in your forehead husband on the left side  that is like to be true if i live he answered for the bone of my temple is shattered  now nada ceased speaking and for a long while was silent umslopogaas was also silent and torn with pain and sorrow because he must lose the lily thus and she must die so wretchedly for one reason only that the cast of faku had robbed him of his strength alas he who had done many deeds might not save her now he could scarcely hold himself upright against the rock he thought of it and the tears flowed down his face and fell on to the hand of the lily she felt them fall and spoke  weep not my husband she said i have been all too ill a wife to you do not mourn for me yet remember that i loved you well and again she was silent for a long space  then she spoke and for the last time of all and her voice came in a gasping whisper through the hole in the rock  farewell umslopogaas my husband and my brother i thank you for your love umslopogaas ah i die  umslopogaas could make no answer only he watched the little hand he held twice it opened twice it closed upon his own then it opened for the third time turned grey quivered and was still forever  now it was at the hour of dawn that nada died    chapter xxxv the vengeance of mopo and his fosterling  it chanced that on this day of nadas death and at that same hour of dawn i mopo came from my mission back to the kraal of the people of the axe having succeeded in my end for that great chief whom i had gone out to visit had hearkened to my words as the light broke i reached the town and lo it was a blackness and a desolation  here is the footmark of dingaan i said to myself and walked to and fro groaning heavily presently i found a knot of men who were of the people that had escaped the slaughter hiding in the mealiefields lest the slayers should return and from them i drew the story i listened in silence for my father i was grown old in misfortune then i asked where were the slayers of the king they replied that they did not know the soldiers had gone up the ghost mountain after the wolfbrethren and nada the lily and from the forest had come a howling of beasts and sounds of war then there was silence and none had been seen to return from the mountain only all day long the vultures hung over it  let us go up the mountain i said  at first they feared because of the evil name of the place but in the end they came with me and we followed on the path of the impi of the slayers and guessed all that had befallen it at length we reached the knees of stone and saw the place of the great fight of the wolfbrethren all those who had taken part in that fight were now but bones because the vultures had picked them every one except galazi for on the breast of galazi lay the old wolf deathgrip that was yet alive i drew near the body and the great wolf struggled to his feet and ran at me with bristling hair and open jaws from which no sound came then being spent he rolled over dead  now i looked round seeking the axe groanmaker among the bones of the slain and did not find it and the hope came into my heart that umslopogaas had escaped the slaughter then we went on in silence to where i knew the cave must be and there by its mouth lay the body of a man i ran to itit was umslopogaas wasted with hunger and in his temple was a great wound and on his breast and limbs were many other wounds moreover in his hand he held another handa dead hand that was thrust through a hole in the rock i knew its shape wellit was the little hand of my child nada the lily  now i understood and bending down i felt the heart of umslopogaas and laid the down of an eagle upon his lips his heart still stirred and the down was lifted gently  i bade those with me drag the stone and they did so with toil now the light flowed into the cave and by it we saw the shape of nada my daughter she was somewhat wasted but still very beautiful in her death i felt her heart also it was still and her breast grew cold  then i spoke the dead to the dead let us tend the living  so we bore in umslopogaas and i caused broth to be made and poured it down his throat also i cleansed his great wound and bound healing herbs upon it plying all my skill well i knew the arts of healing my father i who was the first of the izinyanga of medicine and had it not been for my craft umslopogaas had never lived for he was very near his end still there where he had once been nursed by galazi the wolf i brought him back to life it was three days till he spoke and before his sense returned to him i caused a great hole to be dug in the floor of the cave and there in the hole i buried nada my daughter and we heaped lily blooms upon her to keep the earth from her and then closed in her grave for i was not minded that umslopogaas should look upon her dead lest he also should die from the sight and because of his desire to follow her also i buried galazi the wolf in the cave and set the watcher in his hand and there they both sleep who are friends at last the lily and the wolf together ah when shall there be such another man and such another maid  at length on the third day umslopogaas spoke asking for nada i pointed to the earth and he remembered and understood thereafter the strength of umslopogaas gathered on him slowly and the hole in his skull skinned over but now his hair was grizzled and he scarcely smiled again but grew even more grim and stern than he had been before  soon we learned all the truth about zinita for the women and children came back to the town of the people of the axe only zinita and the children of umslopogaas did not come back also a spy reached me from the mahlabatine and told me of the end of zinita and of the flight of dingaan before the boers  now when umslopogaas had recovered i asked him what he would do and whether or not i should pursue my plots to make him king of the land  but umslopogaas shook his head saying that he had no heart that way he would destroy a king indeed but now he no longer desired to be a king he sought revenge alone i said that it was well i also sought vengeance and seeking together we would find it  now my father there is much more to tell but shall i tell it the snow has melted your cattle have been found where i told you they should be and you wish to be gone and i also i would be gone upon a longer journey  listen my father i will be short this came into my mind to play off panda against dingaan it was for such an hour of need that i had saved panda alive after the battle of the blood river dingaan summoned panda to a hunt then it was that i journeyed to the kraal of panda on the lower tugela and with me umslopogaas i warned panda that he should not go to this hunt for he was the game himself but that he should rather fly into natal with all his people he did so and then i opened talk with the boers and more especially with that boer who was named ungalunkulu or great arm i showed the boer that dingaan was wicked and not to be believed but panda was faithful and good the end of it was that the boers and panda made war together on dingaan yes i made that war that we might be revenged on dingaan thus my father do little things lead to great  were we at the big fight the battle of magongo yes my father we were there when dingaans people drove us back and all seemed lost it was i who put into the mind of nongalaza the general to pretend to direct the boers where to attack for the amaboona stood out of that fight leaving it to us black people it was umslopogaas who cut his way with groanmaker through a wing of one of dingaans regiments till he came to the boer captain ungalunkulu and shouted to him to turn the flank of dingaan that finished it my father for they feared to stand against us both the white and the black together they fled and we followed and slew and dingaan ceased to be a king  he ceased to be a king but he still lived and while he lived our vengeance was hungry so we went to the boer captain and to panda and spoke to them nicely saying we have served you well we have fought for you and so ordered things that victory is yours now grant us this request that we may follow dingaan who has fled into hiding and kill him wherever we find him for he has worked us wrong and we would avenge it  then the white captain and panda smiled and said go children and prosper in your search no one thing shall please us more than to know that dingaan is dead and they gave us men to go with us  then we hunted that king week by week as men hunt a wounded buffalo we hunted him to the jungles of the umfalozi and through them but he fled ever for he knew that the avengers of blood were on his spoor after that for awhile we lost him then we heard that he had crossed the pongolo with some of the people who still clung to him we followed him to the place kwa myawo and there we lay hid in the bush watching at last our chance came dingaan walked in the bush and with him two men only we stabbed the men and seized him  dingaan looked at us and knew us and his knees trembled with fear then i spoke  what was that message which i sent thee o dingaan who art no more a kingthat thou didst evil to drive me away was it not because i set thee on thy throne and i alone could hold thee there  he made no answer and i went on  i mopo son of makedama set thee on thy throne o dingaan who wast a king and i mopo have pulled thee down from thy throne but my message did not end there it said that ill as thou hadst done to drive me away yet worse shouldst thou do to look upon my face again for that day should be thy day of doom  still he made no answer then umslopogaas spoke  i am that slaughterer o dingaan no more a king whom thou didst send slayers many and fierce to eat up at the kraal of the people of the axe where are thy slayers now o dingaan before all is done thou shalt look upon them  kill me and make an end it is your hour said dingaan  not yet awhile o son of senzangacona answered umslopogaas and not here there lived a certain woman and she was named nada the lily i was her husband o dingaan and mopo here he was her father but alas she died and sadlyshe lingered three days and nights before she died thou shalt see the spot and hear the tale o dingaan it will wring thy heart which was ever tender there lived certain children born of another woman named zinita little children sweet and loving i was their father o elephant in a pit and one dingaan slew them of them thou shalt hear also now away for the path is far  two days went by my father and dingaan sat bound and alone in the cave on ghost mountain we had dragged him slowly up the mountain for he was heavy as an ox three men pushing at him and three others pulling on a cord about his middle we dragged him up staying now and again to show him the bones of those whom he had sent out to kill us and telling him the tale of that fight  now at length we were in the cave and i sent away those who were with us for we wished to be alone with dingaan at the last he sat down on the floor of the cave and i told him that beneath the earth on which he sat lay the bones of that nada whom he had murdered and the bones of galazi the wolf  on the third day before the dawn we came again and looked upon him  slay me he said for the ghosts torment me  no longer art thou great o shadow of a king i said who now dost tremble before two ghosts out of all the thousands that thou hast made say then how shall it fare with thee presently when thou art of their number  now dingaan prayed for mercy  mercy thou hyena i answered thou prayest for mercy who showed none to any give me back my daughter give this man back his wife and children then we will talk of mercy come forth coward and die the death of cowards  so my father we dragged him out groaning to the cleft that is above in the breast of the old stone witch that same cleft where galazi had found the bones there we stood waiting for the moment of the dawn that hour when nada had died then we cried her name into his ears and the names of the children of umslopogaas and cast him into the cleft  this was the end of dingaan my fatherdingaan who had the fierce heart of chaka without its greatness    chapter xxxvi mopo ends his tale  that is the tale of nada the lily my father and of how we avenged her a sad taleyes a sad tale but all was sad in those days it was otherwise afterwards when panda reigned for panda was a man of peace  there is little more to tell i left the land where i could stay no longer who had brought about the deaths of two kings and came here to natal to live near where the kraal duguza once had stood  the bones of dingaan as they lay in the cleft were the last things my eyes beheld for after that i became blind and saw the sun no more nor any lightwhy i do not know perhaps from too much weeping my father so i changed my name lest a spear might reach the heart that had planned the death of two kings and a princechaka dingaan and umhlangana of the blood royal silently and by night umslopogaas my fosterling led me across the border and brought me here to stanger and here as an old witchdoctor i have lived for many many years i am rich umslopogaas craved back from panda the cattle of which dingaan had robbed me and drove them hither but none were here who had lived in the kraal duguza none knew in zweete the blind old witchdoctor that mopo who stabbed chaka the lion of the zulu none know it now you have heard the tale and you alone my father do not tell it again till i am dead  umslopogaas yes he went back to the people of the axe and ruled them but they were never so strong again as they had been before they smote the halakazi in their caves and dingaan ate them up panda let him be and liked him well for panda did not know that the slaughterer was son to chaka his brother and umslopogaas let that dog lie for when nada died he lost his desire to be great yet he became captain of the nkomabakosi regiment and fought in many battles doing mighty deeds and stood by umbulazi son of panda in the great fray on the tugela when cetywayo slew his brother umbulazi  after that also he plotted against cetywayo whom he hated and had it not been for a certain white man a hunter named macumazahn umslopogaas would have been killed but the white man saved him by his wit yes and at times he came to visit me for he still loved me as of old but now he has fled north and i shall hear his voice no more nay i do not know all the tale there was a woman in it women were ever the bane of umslopogaas my fostering i forget the story of that woman for i remember only these things that happened long ago before i grew very old  look on this right hand of mine my father i cannot see it now and yet i mopo son of makedama seem to see it as once i saw red with the blood of two kings look on  suddenly the old man ceased his head fell forward upon his withered breast when the white man to whom he told this story lifted it and looked at him he was dead
