ltd   adelphi terrace   the wanderings of oisin was published with the lyrics now collected under the title crossways in 1888 the countess cathleen with the lyrics now collected under the title the rose in 1892 and the land of hearts desire by itself in 1894 they were revised and reprinted in one volume in 1895 again revised and reprinted in 1899 and again reprinted in 1901 1904 1908 1912 1913 1919 and 1920  all rights reserved     preface   during the last year i have spent much time altering the countess cathleen and the land of hearts desire that they might be a part of the repertory of the abbey theatre i had written them before i had any practical experience and i knew from the performance of the one in dublin in 1899 and of the other in london in 1894 that they were full of defects but in their new shapeand each play has been twice played during the winterthey have given me some pleasure and are i think easier to play effectively than my later plays depending less upon the players and more upon the producer both having been imagined more for variety of stagepicture than variety of mood in the player it was indeed the first performance of the countess cathleen when our stagepictures were made out of poor conventional scenery and hired costumes that set me writing plays where all would depend upon the player the first two scenes are wholly new and though i have left the old end in the body of this book i have given in the notes an end less difficult to producer and audience and there are slight alterations elsewhere in the poem the land of hearts desire besides some mending in the details has been thrown back in time because the metrical speech would have sounded unreal if spoken in a country cottage now that we have so many dialect comedies the shades of mrs fallan and mrs dillane and of dan bourke and the tramp would have seemed too boisterous or too vivid for shades made cold and distant with the artifice of verse  i have not again retouched the lyric poems of my youth fearing some stupidity in my middle years but have changed two or three pages that i always knew to be wrong in the wanderings of usheen    wb yeats    june 1912     preface to the third edition   i have added some passages to the land of hearts desire and a new scene of some little length besides passages here and there to the countess cathleen the goddess has never come to me with her hands so full that i have not found many waste places after i had planted all that she had brought me the present version of the countess cathleen is not quite the version adopted by the irish literary theatre a couple of years ago for our stage and scenery were capable of little and it may differ more from any stage version i make in future for it seems that my people of the waters and my unhappy dead in the third act cannot keep their supernatural essence but must put on too much of our mortality in any ordinary theatre i am told that i must abandon a meaning or two and make my merchants carry away the treasure themselves the act was written long ago when i had seen so few plays that i took pleasure in stage effects indeed i am not yet certain that a wealthy theatre could not shape it to an impressive pageantry or that a theatre without any wealth could not lift it out of pageantry into the mind with a dim curtain and some dimly lighted players and the beautiful voices that should be as important in poetical as in musical drama the elizabethan stage was so little imprisoned in material circumstance that the elizabethan imagination was not strained by god or spirit nor even by echo herselfno not even when she answered as in the duchess of malfi in clear loud words which were not the words that had been spoken to her we have made a prisonhouse of paint and canvas where we have as little freedom as under our own roofs for there is no freedom in a house that has been made with hands all art moves in the cave of the chim√¶ra or in the garden of the hesperides or in the more silent house of the gods and neither cave nor garden nor house can show itself clearly but to the minds eye  besides rewriting a lyric or two i have much enlarged the note on the countess cathleen as there has been some discussion in ireland about the origin of the story but the other notes are as they have always been they are short enough but i do not think that anybody who knows modern poetry will find obscurities in this book in any case i must leave my myths and symbols to explain themselves as the years go by and one poems lights up another and the stories that friends and one friend in particular have gathered for me or that i have gathered myself in many cottages find their way into the light i would if i could add to that majestic heraldry of the poets that great and complicated inheritance of images which written literature has substituted for the greater and more complex inheritance of spoken tradition some new heraldic images gathered from the lips of the common people christianity and the old nature faith have lain down side by side in the cottages and i would proclaim that peace as loudly as i can among the kingdoms of poetry where there is no peace that is not joyous no battle that does not give life instead of death i may even try to persuade others in more sober prose that there can be no language more worthy of poetry and of the meditation of the soul than that which has been made or can be made out of a subtlety of desire an emotion of sacrifice a delight in order that are perhaps christian and myths and images that mirror the energies of woods and streams and of their wild creatures has any part of that majestic heraldry of the poets had a very different fountain is it not the ritual of the marriage of heaven and earth  these details may seem to many unnecessary but after all one writes poetry for a few careful readers and for a few friends who will not consider such details unnecessary when cimabue had the cry it was it seems worth thinking of those that run but today when they can write as well as read one can sit with ones companions under the hedgerow contentedly if one writes well and has the patience somebody will come from among the runners and read what one has written quickly and go away quickly and write out as much as he can remember in the language of the highway    wb yeats

because their blossoming dreams have never bent   under the fruit of evil and of good   and of the embattled flaming multitude   who rise wing above wing flame above flame   and like a storm cry the

in the same way      follows and sits at the other end this is done slowly and      deliberately when they are seated they take money out of      embroidered purses at their girdles and begin arranging it on the      carpet    teig    you speak to them    shemus                      no you    teig                              twas you that called them    shemus coming nearer    id make so

road   for we are merchants that must tramp the world   and now we look for supper and a fire   and a safe corner to count money in    shemus    i thought you were  but thats no matter now   there had been words between my wife and me   because i said i would be master here   and ask in what i pleased or who i pleased   and so but that is nothing to the point   because its certain that you are but merchants    first merchant    we travel for the master of all merchants    shemus    yet if you were that i had thought but now   id welcome you no less be what you please   and youll have supper at the market rate   that means that what was sold for but a penny   is now worth fifty  merchants begin putting money on carpet    first merchant                          our master bids us pay   so

in what unlucky shape you sat but now   outside this door    teig                          its this your honours   because of some wild words my father said   she thinks you are not of those who cast

i shatter you in fragments for the face   that brimmed you up with beauty is no more   and die dull heart for she whose mournful words   made you a living spirit has passed away   and left you but a ball of passionate dust   and you proud earth and plumy sea fade out   for you may hear no more her faltering feet   but are left lonely amid the clamorous war   of angels upon devils  he stands up almost every one is kneeling but it has grown so dark that only confused forms can be seen                             and i who weep   call curses on you time and fate and change   and have no excellent hope but the great hour   when you shall plunge headlong through bottomless space  a flash of lightning followed immediately by thunder    a peasant woman    pull him upon his knees before his curses   have plucked thunder and lightning on our heads    aleel    angels and devils clash in the middle air   and brazen swords clang upon brazen helms  a flash of lightning followed immediately by thunder    yonder a bright spear cast out of a sling   has torn through balors eye and the dark clans   fly screaming as they fled moytura of old  everything is lost in darkness    an old man    the almighty wrath at our great weakness and sin   has blotted out the world and we must die  the darkness is broken by a visionary light the peasants seem to be kneeling upon the rocky slope of a mountain and vapour full of storm and everchanging light is sweeping above them and behind them half in the light half in the shadow stand armed angels their armour is old and worn and their drawn swords dim and dinted they stand as if upon the air in formation of battle and look downward with stern faces the peasants cast themselves on the ground    aleel    look no more on the halfclosed gates of hell   but speak to me whose mind is smitten of god   that it may be no more with mortal things   and tell of her who lies there  he seizes one of the angels                                     till you speak   you shall not drift into eternity    the angel    the light beats down the gates of pearl are wide   and she is passing to the floor of peace   and mary of the seven times wounded heart   has kissed her lips and the long blessed hair   has fallen on her face the light of lights   looks always on the motive not the deed   the shadow of shadows on the deed alone  aleel releases the angel and kneels    oona    tell them who walk upon the floor of peace   that i would die and go to her i love   the years like great black oxen tread the world   and god the herdsman goads them on behind   and i am broken by their passing feet  a sound of faroff horns seems to come from the heart of the light the vision melts away and the forms of the kneeling peasants appear faintly in the darkness     the rose        sero te amavi pulchritudo tam antiqua et tam nova sero te      amavi    s augustine   to lionel johnson   to the rose upon the rood of time     red

shape   first as a raven on whose ancient wings   scarcely a feather lingered then you seemed   a weasel moving on from stone to stone   and now at last you wear a human shape   a thin gray man half lost in gathering night    druid    what would you king of the proud red branch kings    fergus    this would i say most wise of living souls   young subtle concobar sat close by me   when i gave judgment and his words were wise   and what to me was burden without end   to him seemed easy so i laid the crown   upon his head to cast away my care    druid    what would you king of the proud red branch kings    fergus    i feast amid my people on the hill   and pace the woods and drive my chariot wheels   in the white border of the murmuring sea   and still i feel the crown upon my head    druid    what would you    fergus                      i would be no more a king   but learn the dreaming wisdom that is yours    druid    look on my thin gray hair and hollow cheeks   and on these hands that may not lift the sword   this body trembling like a windblown reed   no woman loves me no man seeks my help   because i be not of the things i dream    fergus    a wild and foolish labourer is a king   to do and do and do and never dream    druid    take if you must this little bag of dreams   unloose the cord and they will wrap you round    fergus    i see my life go dripping like a stream   from change to change i have been many things   a green drop in the surge a gleam of light   upon a sword a firtree on a hill   an old slave grinding at a heavy quern   a king sitting upon a chair of gold   and all these things were wonderful and great   but now i have grown nothing being all   and the whole world weighs down upon my heart   ah druid druid how great webs of sorrow   lay hidden in the small slatecoloured bag   the death of cuchulain     a man came slowly from the setting sun   to forgails daughter emer in her dun   and found her dyeing cloth with subtle care   and said casting aside his draggled hair   i am aleel the swineherd whom you bid   go dwell upon the sea cliffs vapour hid   but now my years of watching are no more    then emer cast the web upon the floor   and stretching out her arms red with the dye   parted her lips with a loud sudden cry    looking on her aleel the swineherd said   not any god alive nor mortal dead   has slain so mighty armies so great kings   nor won the gold that now cuchulain brings    why do you tremble thus from feet to crown    aleel the swineherd wept and cast him down   upon the webheaped floor and thus his word   with him is one sweetthroated like a bird    who bade you tell these things and then she cried   to those about beat him with thongs of hide   and drive him from the door                                    and thus it was   and where her son finmole on the smooth grass   was driving cattle came she with swift feet   and called out to him son it is not meet   that you stay idling here with flocks and herds    i have long waited mother for those words   but wherefore now                            there is a man to die   you have the heaviest arm under the sky    my father dwells among the seaworn bands   and breaks the ridge of battle with his hands    nay you are taller than cuchulain son    he is the mightiest man in ship or dun    nay he is old and sad with many wars   and weary of the crash of battle cars    i only ask what way my journey lies   for god who made you bitter made you wise    the red branch kings a tireless banquet keep   where the sun falls into the western deep   go there and dwell on the green forest rim   but tell alone your name and house to him   whose blade compels and bid them send you one   who has a like vow from their triple dun    between the lavish shelter of a wood   and the gray tide the red branch multitude   feasted and with them old cuchulain dwelt   and his young dear one close beside him knelt   and gazed upon the wisdom of his eyes   more mournful than the depth of starry skies   and pondered on the wonder of his days   and all around the harpstring told his praise   and concobar the red branch king of kings   with his own fingers touched the brazen strings   at last cuchulain spake a young man strays   driving the deer along the woody ways   i often hear him singing to and fro   i often hear the sweet sound of his bow   seek out what man he is                                one went and came   he bade me let all know he gives his name   at the sword point and bade me bring him one   who had a like vow from our triple dun    i only of the red branch hosted now   cuchulain cried have made and keep that vow    after short fighting in the leafy shade   he spake to the young man is there no maid   who loves you no white arms to wrap you round   or do you long for the dim sleepy ground   that you come here to meet this ancient sword    the dooms of men are in gods hidden hoard    your head a while seemed like a womans head   that i loved once                          again the fighting sped   but now the war rage in cuchulain woke   and through the others shield his long blade broke   and pierced him                    speak before your breath is done   i am finmole mighty cuchulains son    i put you from your pain i can no more    while day its burden on to evening bore   with head bowed on his knees cuchulain stayed   then concobar sent that sweetthroated maid   and she to win him his gray hair caressed   in vain her arms in vain her soft white breast   then concobar the subtlest of all men   ranking his druids round him ten by ten   spake thus cuchulain will dwell there and brood   for three days more in dreadful quietude   and then arise and raving slay us all   go cast on him delusions magical   that he might fight the waves of the loud sea   and ten by ten under a quicken tree   the druids chaunted swaying in their hands   tall wands of alder and white quicken wands    in three days time cuchulain with a moan   stood up and came to the long sands alone   for four days warred he with the bitter tide   and the waves flowed above him and he died   the rose of the world     who dreamed that beauty passes like a dream   for these red lips with all their mournful pride   mournful that no new wonder may betide   troy passed away in one high funeral gleam   and usnas children

a pity beyond all telling   is hid in the heart of love   the folk who are buying and selling   the clouds on their journey above   the cold wet winds ever blowing   and the shadowy hazel grove   where mousegray waters are flowing   threaten the head that i love   the sorrow of love     the quarrel of the sparrows in the eaves   the full round moon and the starladen sky   and the loud song of the eversinging leaves   had hid away earths old and weary cry    and then you came with those red mournful lips   and with you came the whole of the worlds tears   and all the trouble of her labouring ships   and all the trouble of her myriad years    and now the sparrows warring in the eaves   the curdpale moon the white stars in the sky   and the loud chaunting of the unquiet leaves   are shaken with earths old and weary cry   when you are old     when you are old and gray and full of sleep   and nodding by the fire take down this book   and slowly read and dream of the soft look   your eyes had once and of their shadows deep    how many loved your moments of glad grace   and loved your beauty will love false or true   but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you   and loved the sorrows of your changing face    and bending down beside the glowing bars   murmur a little sadly how love fled   and paced upon the mountains overhead   and hid his face amid a crowd of stars   the white birds     i would that we were my beloved white birds on the foam of the sea   we tire of the flame of the meteor before it can fade and flee   and the flame of the blue star of twilight hung low     on the rim of the sky   has awaked in our hearts my beloved a sadness that may not die    a weariness comes from those dreamers dew dabbled the lily and rose   ah dream not of them my beloved the flame of the meteor that goes   or the flame of the blue star that lingers hung low     in the fall of the dew   for i would we were changed to white birds on the     wandering foam i and you    i am haunted by numberless islands and many a danaan shore   where time would surely forget us and sorrow come near us no more   soon far from the rose and the lily and fret of the flames would we be   were we only white birds my beloved buoyed out on the foam of the sea   a dream of death     i dreamed that one had died in a strange place   near no accustomed hand   and they had nailed the boards above her face   the peasants of that land   wondering to lay her in that solitude   and raised above her mound   a cross they had made out of two bits of wood   and planted cypress round   and left her to the indifferent stars above   until i carved these words   she was more beautiful than thy first love   but now lies under boards   a dream of a blessed spirit     all the heavy days are over   leave the bodys coloured pride   underneath the grass and clover   with the feet laid side by side    one with her are mirth and duty   bear the gold embroidered dress   for she needs not her sad beauty   to the scented oaken press    hers the kiss of mother mary   the long hair is on her face   still she goes with footsteps wary   full of earths old timid grace    with white feet of angels seven   her white feet go glimmering   and above the deep of heaven   flame on flame and wing on wing   who goes with fergus     who will go drive with fergus now   and pierce the deep woods woven shade   and dance upon the level shore   young man lift up your russet brow   and lift your tender eyelids maid   and brood on hopes and fears no more    and no more turn aside and brood   upon loves bitter mystery   for fergus rules the brazen cars   and rules the shadows of the wood   and the white breast of the dim sea   and all dishevelled wandering stars   the man who dreamed of faeryland     he stood among a crowd at drumahair   his heart hung all upon a silken dress   and he had known at last some tenderness   before earth made of him her sleepy care   but when a man poured fish into a pile   it seemed they raised their little silver heads   and sang how day a druid twilight sheds   upon a dim green wellbeloved isle   where people love beside starladen seas   how time may never mar their faery vows   under the woven roofs of quicken boughs   the singing shook him out of his new ease    he wandered by the sands of lisadill   his mind ran all on money cares and fears   and he had known at last some prudent years   before they heaped his grave under the hill   but while he passed before a plashy place   a lugworm with its gray and muddy mouth   sang how somewhere to north or west or south   there dwelt a gay exulting gentle race   and how beneath those three times blessed skies   a danaan fruitage makes a shower of moons   and as it falls awakens leafy tunes   and at that singing he was no more wise    he mused beside the well of scanavin   he mused upon his mockers without fail   his sudden vengeance were a country tale   now that deep earth has drunk his body in   but one small knotgrass growing by the pool   told where ah little allunneeded voice   old silence bids a lonely folk rejoice   and chaplet their calm brows with leafage cool   and how when fades the seastrewn rose of day   a gentle feeling wraps them like a fleece   and all their trouble dies into its peace   the tale drove his fine angry mood away    he slept under the hill of lugnagall   and might have known at last unhaunted sleep   under that cold and vapourturbaned steep   now that old earth had taken man and all   were not the worms that spired about his bones   atelling with their low and reedy cry   of how god leans his hands out of the sky   to bless that isle with honey in his tones   that none may feel the power of squall and wave   and no one any leafcrowned dancer miss   until he burn up nature with a kiss   the man has found no comfort in the grave   the dedication to a book of stories selected from the irish novelists     there was a green branch hung with many a bell   when her own people ruled in waveworn eire   and from its murmuring greenness calm of faery   a druid kindness on all hearers fell    it charmed away the merchant from his guile   and turned the farmers memory from his cattle   and hushed in sleep the roaring ranks of battle   for all who heard it dreamed a little while    ah exiles wandering over many seas   spinning at all times eires good tomorrow   ah worldwide nation always growing sorrow   i also bear a bell branch full of ease    i tore it from green boughs winds tossed and hurled   green boughs of tossing always weary weary   i tore it from the green boughs of old eire   the willow of the manysorrowed world    ah exiles wandering over many lands   my bell branch murmurs the gay bells bring laughter   leaping to shake a cobweb from the rafter   the sad bells bow the forehead on the hands    a honeyed ringing under the new skies   they bring you memories of old village faces   cabins gone now old wellsides old dear places   and men who loved the cause that never dies   the lamentation of the old pensioner     i had a chair at every hearth   when no one turned to see   with look at that old fellow there   and who may he be   and therefore do i wander now   and the fret lies on me    the roadside trees keep murmuring   ah wherefore murmur ye   as in the old days long gone by   green oak and poplar tree   the wellknown faces are all gone   and the fret lies on me   the ballad of father gilligan     the old priest peter gilligan   was weary night and day   for half his flock were in their beds   or under green sods lay    once while he nodded on a chair   at the mothhour of eve   another poor man sent for him   and he began to grieve    i have no rest nor joy nor peace   for people die and die   and after cried he god forgive   my body spake not i    he knelt and leaning on the chair   he prayed and fell asleep   and the mothhour went from the fields   and stars began to peep    they slowly into millions grew   and leaves shook in the wind   and god covered the world with shade   and whispered to mankind    upon the time of sparrow chirp   when the moths came once more   the old priest peter gilligan   stood upright on the floor    mavrone mavrone the man has died   while i slept on the chair   he roused his horse out of its sleep   and rode with little care    he rode now as he never rode   by rocky lane and fen   the sick mans wife opened the door   father you come again    and is the poor man dead he cried   he died an hour ago   the old priest peter gilligan   in grief swayed to and fro    when you were gone he turned and died   as merry as a bird   the old priest peter gilligan   he knelt him at that word    he who hath made the night of stars   for souls who tire and bleed   sent one of his great angels down   to help me in my need    he who is wrapped in purple robes   with planets in his care   had pity on the least of things   asleep upon a chair   the two trees     beloved gaze in thine own heart   the holy tree is growing there   from joy the holy branches start   and all the trembling flowers they bear   the changing colours of its fruit   have dowered the stars with merry light   the surety of its hidden root   has planted quiet in the night   the shaking of its leafy head   has given the waves their melody   and made my lips and music wed   murmuring a wizard song for thee   there through bewildered branches go   winged loves borne on in gentle strife   tossing and tossing to and fro   the flaming circle of our life   when looking on their shaken hair   and dreaming how they dance and dart   thine eyes grow full of tender care   beloved gaze in thine own heart    gaze no more in the bitter glass   the demons with their subtle guile   lift up before us when they pass   or only gaze a little while   for there a fatal image grows   with broken boughs and blackened leaves   and roots half hidden under snows   driven by a storm that ever grieves   for all things turn to barrenness   in the dim glass the demons hold   the glass of outer weariness   made when god slept in times of old   there through the broken branches go   the ravens of unresting thought   peering and flying to and fro   to see mens souls bartered and bought   when they are heard upon the wind   and when they shake their wings alas   thy tender eyes grow all unkind   gaze no more in the bitter glass   to ireland in the coming times     know that i would accounted be   true brother of that company   who sang to sweeten irelands wrong   ballad and story rann and song   nor be i any less of them   because the redrosebordered hem   of her whose history began   before god made the angelic clan   trails all about the written page   for in the worlds first blossoming age   the light fall of her flying feet   made irelands heart begin to beat   and still the starry candles flare   to help her light foot here and there   and still the thoughts of ireland brood   upon her holy quietude    nor may i less be counted one   with davis mangan ferguson   because to him who ponders well   my rhymes more than their rhyming tell   of the dim wisdoms old and deep   that god gives unto man in sleep   for the elemental beings go   about my table to and fro   in flood and fire and clay and wind   they huddle from mans pondering mind   yet he who treads in austere ways   may surely meet their ancient gaze   man ever journeys on with them   after the redrosebordered hem   ah faeries dancing under the moon   a druid land a druid tune    while still i may i write for you   the love i lived the dream i knew   from our birthday until we die   is but the winking of an eye   and we our singing and our love   the mariners of night above   and all the wizard things that go   about my table to and fro   are passing on to where may be   in truths consuming ecstasy   no place for love and dream at all   for god goes by with white footfall

away   while the faeries dance in a place apart   shaking their milkwhite feet in a ring   tossing their milkwhite arms in the air   for they hear the wind laugh and murmur and sing   of a land where even the old are fair   and even the wise are merry of tongue   but i heard a reed of coolaney say   when the wind has laughed and murmured and sung   the lonely of heart is withered away     crossways     the stars are threshed and the souls are threshed from their husks    william blake  to ae   the song of the happy shepherd     the woods of arcady are dead   and over is their antique

idle word is now their glory   by the stammering schoolboy said   reading some entangled story   the kings of the old time are fled   the wandering earth herself may be   only a sudden flaming word   in clanging space a moment heard   troubling the endless reverie    then nowise worship dusty deeds   nor seek for this is also sooth   to hunger fiercely after truth   lest all thy toiling only breeds   new dreams new dreams there is no truth   saving in thine own heart seek then   no learning from the starry men   who follow with the optic glass   the whirling ways of stars that pass   seek then for this is also sooth   no word of theirsthe cold starbane   has cloven and rent their hearts in twain   and dead is all their human truth   go gather by the hummingsea   some twisted echoharbouring shell   and to its lips thy story tell   and they thy comforters will be   rewarding in melodious guile   thy fretful words a little while   till they shall singing fade in ruth   and

buried under the sleepy ground   with mirthful songs before the dawn   his shouting days with mirth were crowned   and still i dream he treads the lawn   walking ghostly in the dew   pierced by my glad singing through   my songs of old earths dreamy youth   but ah she dreams not now dream thou   for fair are poppies on the brow   dream dream for this is also sooth   the sad shepherd     there was a man whom sorrow named his friend   and he of his high comrade sorrow dreaming   went walking with slow steps along the gleaming   and humming sands where windy surges wend   and he called loudly to the stars to bend   from their pale thrones and comfort him but they   among themselves laugh on and sing alway   and then the man whom sorrow named his friend   cried out dim sea hear my most piteous story   the sea swept on and cried her old cry still   rolling along in dreams from hill to hill   he fled the persecution of her glory   and in a faroff gentle valley stopping   cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening   but naught they heard for they are always listening   the dewdrops for the sound of their own dropping   and then the man whom sorrow named his friend   sought once again the shore and found a shell   and thought i will my heavy story tell   till my own words reechoing shall send   their sadness through a hollow pearly heart   and my own tale again for me shall sing   and my own whispering words be comforting   and lo my ancient burden may depart   then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim   but the sad dweller by the seaways lone   changed all he sang to inarticulate moan   among her wildering whirls forgetting him   the cloak the boat and the shoes     what do you make so fair and bright    i make the cloak of sorrow   o lovely to see in all mens sight   shall be the cloak of sorrow   in all mens sight    what do you build with sails for flight    i build a boat for sorrow   o swift on the seas all day and night   saileth the rover sorrow   all day and night    what do you weave with wool so white    i weave the shoes of sorrow   soundless shall be the footfall light   in all mens ears of sorrow   sudden and light   anashuya and vijaya

upon god     i passed along the waters edge below the humid trees   my spirit rocked in evening light the rushes round my knees   my spirit rocked in sleep and sighs and saw the moorfowl pace   all dripping on a grassy slope and saw them cease to chase   each other round in circles and heard the eldest speak   who holds the world between his bill and made us strong or weak   is an undying moorfowl and he lives beyond the sky   the rains are from his dripping wing the moonbeams from his eye   i passed a little further on and heard a lotus talk   who made the world and ruleth it he hangeth on a stalk   for i am in his image made and all this tinkling tide   is but a sliding drop of rain between his petals wide   a little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes   brimful of starlight and he said the stamper of the skies   he is a gentle roebuck for how else i pray could he   conceive a thing so sad and soft a gentle thing like me   i passed a little further on and heard a peacock say   who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers gay   he is a monstrous peacock and he waveth all the night   his languid tail above us lit with myriad spots of light   the indian to his love     the island dreams under the dawn   and great boughs drop tranquillity   the peahens dance on a smooth lawn   a parrot sways upon a tree   raging at his own image in the enamelled sea    here we will moor our lonely ship   and wander ever with woven hands   murmuring softly lip to lip   along the grass along the sands   murmuring how far away are the unquiet lands    how we alone of mortals are   hid under quiet bows apart   while our love grows an indian star   a meteor of the burning heart   one with the tide that gleams the wings that gleam and dart   the heavy boughs the burnished dove   that moans and sighs a hundred days   how when we die our shades will rove   when eve has hushed the feathered ways   with vapoury footsole among the waters drowsy blaze   the falling of the leaves     autumn is over the long leaves that love us   and over the mice in the barley sheaves   yellow the leaves of the rowan above us   and yellow the wet wildstrawberry leaves    the hour of the waning of love has beset us   and weary and worn are our sad souls now   let us part ere the season of passion forget us   with a kiss and a tear on thy drooping brow   ephemera     your eyes that once were never weary of mine   are bowed in sorrow under pendulous lids   because our love is waning                                  and then she   although our love is waning let us stand   by the lone border of the lake once more   together in that hour of gentleness   when the poor tired child passion falls asleep   how far away the stars seem and how far   is our first kiss and ah how old my heart    pensive they paced along the faded leaves   while slowly he whose hand held hers replied   passion has often worn our wandering hearts    the woods were round them and the yellow leaves   fell like faint meteors in the gloom and once   a rabbit old and lame limped down the path   autumn was over him and now they stood   on the lone border of the lake once more   turning he saw that she had thrust dead leaves   gathered in silence dewy as her eyes   in bosom and hair                       ah do not mourn he said   that we are tired for other loves await us   hate on and love through unrepining hours   before us lies eternity our souls   are love and a continual farewell   the madness of king goll     i sat on cushioned otter skin   my word was law from ith to emen   and shook at invar amargin   the hearts of the worldtroubling seamen   and drove tumult and war away   from girl and boy and man and beast   the fields grew fatter day by day   the wild fowl of the air increased   and every ancient ollave said   while he bent down his fading head   he drives away the northern cold   they will not hush the leaves aflutter round me     the beech leaves old    i sat and mused and drank sweet wine   a herdsman came from inland valleys   crying the pirates drove his swine   to fill their darkbeaked hollow galleys   i called my battlebreaking men   and my loud brazen battlecars   from rolling vale and rivery glen   and under the blinking of the stars   fell on the pirates by the deep   and hurled them in the gulph of sleep   these hands won many a torque of gold   they will not hush the leaves aflutter round me     the beech leaves old    but slowly as i shouting slew   and trampled in the bubbling mire   in my most secret spirit grew   a whirling and a wandering fire   i stood keen stars above me shone   around me shone keen eyes of men   i laughed aloud and hurried on   by rocky shore and rushy fen   i laughed because birds fluttered by   and starlight gleamed and clouds flew high   and rushes waved and waters rolled   they will not hush the leaves aflutter round me     the beech leaves old    and now i wander in the woods   when summer gluts the golden bees   or in autumnal solitudes   arise the leopardcoloured trees   or when along the wintry strands   the cormorants shiver on their rocks   i wander on and wave my hands   and sing and shake my heavy locks   the gray wolf knows me by one ear   i lead along the woodland deer   the hares run by me growing bold   they will not hush the leaves aflutter round me     the beech leaves old    i came upon a little town   that slumbered in the harvest moon   and passed atiptoe up and down   murmuring to a fitful tune   how i have followed night and day   a tramping of tremendous feet   and saw where this old tympan lay   deserted on a doorway seat   and bore it to the woods with me   of some unhuman misery   our married voiced wildly trolled   they will not hush the leaves aflutter round me     the beech leaves old    i sang how when days toil is done   orchil shakes out her long dark hair   that hides away the dying sun   and sheds faint odours through the air   when my hand passed from wire to wire   it quenched with sound like falling dew   the whirling and the wandering fire   but lift a mournful ulalu   for the kind wires are torn and still   and i must wander wood and hill   through summers heat and winters cold   they will not hush the leaves aflutter round me     the beech leaves old   the stolen child     where dips the rocky highland   of sleuth wood in the lake   there lies a leafy island   where flapping herons wake   the drowsy water rats   there weve hid our faery vats   full of berries   and of reddest stolen cherries   come away o human child   to the waters and the wild   with a faery hand in hand   for the worlds more full of weeping than you can understand    where the wave of moonlight glosses   the dim gray sands with light   far off by furthest rosses   we foot it all the night   weaving olden dances   mingling hands and mingling glances   till the moon has taken flight   to and fro we leap   and chase the frothy bubbles   while the world is full of troubles   and is anxious in its sleep   come away o human child   to the waters and the wild   with a faery hand in hand   for the worlds more full of weeping than you can understand

them unquiet dreams   leaning softly out   from ferns that drop their tears   over the young streams   come away o human child   to the waters and the wild   with a faery hand in hand   for the worlds

in the water   with her would i fly   down by the salley gardens     down by the salley gardens my love and i did meet   she passed the salley gardens with little snowwhite feet   she bid me take love easy as the leaves grow on the tree   but i being young and foolish with her would not agree    in a field by the river my love and i did stand   and on my leaning shoulder she laid her snowwhite hand

johns lands   sleiveens were all his race   and he gave them as dowers to his daughters   and they married beyond their place    but father john went up   and father john went down   and he wore small

of the air    the birds for he opened their cages   as he went up and down   and he said with a smile have peace now   and he went his way with a frown    but if when any one died   came keeners hoarser than rooks   he bade them give over their keening   for he was a man of books    and these were the works of john   when weeping score by score   people came into coloony   for hed died at

treads upon the lawn   and to the armchair goes   and now the old mans dreams are gone   he smooths the long brown nose    and now moves many a pleasant tongue   upon his wasted hands   for leading aged hounds and young   the huntsman near him stands    my huntsman rody blow the horn   and make the hills reply   the huntsman loosens on the morn   a gay and wandering cry    a fire is in the old

but weep and sigh    the servants round his cushioned place   are with new sorrow wrung   and hounds are gazing on his face   both aged hounds and young    one blind hound only lies apart   on the

innumerable spears   the horsemen with their floating hair   and bowls of barley honey and wine   and feet of maidens dancing in tune   and the white body that lay by mine   but the tale though words be lighter than air   must live to be old like the wandering moon    caolte and conan and finn were there   when we followed a deer with our baying hounds   with bran sgeolan and lomair   and passing the firbolgs burial mounds   came to the cairnheaped grassy hill   where passionate maive is stony still   and found on the dovegray edge of the sea   a pearlpale highborn lady who rode   on a horse with bridle of findrinny   and like a sunset were her lips   a stormy sunset on doomed ships   a citron colour gloomed in her hair   but down to her feet white vesture flowed   and with the glimmering crimson glowed   of many a figured embroidery   and it was bound with a pearlpale shell   that wavered like the summer streams   as her soft bosom rose and fell    s patric    you are still wrecked among heathen dreams    usheen    why do you wind no horn she said   and every hero droop his head   the hornless deer is not more sad   that many a peaceful moment had   more sleek than any granary

country far   beyond the tumbling of this tide    what dream came with you that you came   through bitter tide on foam wet feet   did your companion wander away   from where the birds of aengus wing    she said with laughter tender and sweet   i have not yet warweary king   been spoken of with any one   yet now i choose for these four feet   ran through the foam and ran to this   that i might have your son to kiss    were there no better than my son   that you through all that foam should run    i loved no man though kings besought   love till the danaan poets brought   rhyme that rhymed to usheens name   and now i am dizzy with the thought   of all that wisdom and the fame   of battles broken by his hands   of stories builded by his words   that are like coloured asian birds   at evening in their rainless lands    o patric by your brazen bell   there was no limb of mine but fell   into a desperate gulph of love   you only will i wed i cried   and i will make a thousand songs   and set your name all names above   and captives bound with leathern thongs   shall kneel and praise you one by one   at evening in my western dun    o usheen mount by me and ride   to shores by the wash of the tremulous tide   where men have heaped no burial mounds   and the days pass by like a wayward tune   where broken faith has never been known   and the blushes of first love never have flown   and there i will give you a hundred hounds   no mightier creatures bay at the moon   and a hundred robes of murmuring silk   and a hundred calves and a hundred sheep   whose long wool whiter than sea froth flows   and a hundred spears and a hundred bows   and oil and wine and honey and milk   and always neveranxious sleep   while a hundred youths mighty of limb   but knowing nor tumult nor hate nor strife   and a hundred maidens merry as birds   who when they dance to a fitful measure   have a speed like the speed of the salmon herds   shall follow your horn and obey your whim   and you shall know the danaan leisure   and niam be with you for a wife   then she sighed gently it grows late   music and love and sleep await   where i would be when the white moon climbs   the red sun falls and the world grows dim    and then i mounted and she bound me   with her triumphing arms around me   and whispering to herself enwound me   but when the horse had felt my weight   he shook himself and neighed three times   caolte conan and finn came near   and wept and raised their lamenting hands   and bid me stay with many a tear   but we rode out from the human lands    in what far kingdom do you go   ah fenians with the shield and bow   or are you phantoms white as snow   whose lips had lifes most prosperous glow   o you with whom in sloping valleys   or down the dewy forest alleys   i chased at morn the flying deer   with whom i hurled the hurrying spear   and heard the foemens bucklers rattle   and broke the heaving ranks of battle   and bran sgeolan and lomair   where are you with your long rough hair   you go not where the red deer feeds   nor tear the foemen from their steeds    s patric    boast not nor mourn with drooping head   companions long accurst and dead   and hounds for centuries dust and air    usheen    we galloped over the glossy sea   i know not if days passed or hours   and niam sang continually   danaan songs and their dewy showers   of pensive laughter unhuman sound   lulled weariness and softly round   my human sorrow her white arms wound    we galloped now a hornless deer   passed by us chased by a phantom hound   all pearly white save one red ear   and now a maiden rode like the wind   with an apple of gold in her tossing hand   and a beautiful young man followed behind   with quenchless gaze and fluttering hair    were these two born in the danaan land   or have they breathed the mortal air    vex them no longer niam said   and sighing bowed her gentle head   and sighing laid the pearly tip   of one long finger on my lip    but now the moon like a white rose shone   in the pale west and the suns rim sank   and clouds arrayed their rank on rank   about his fading crimson ball   the floor of emens hosting hall   was not more level than the sea   as full of loving phantasy   and with low murmurs we rode on   where many a trumpettwisted shell   that in immortal silence sleeps   dreaming of her own melting hues   her golds her ambers and her blues   pierced with soft light the shallowing deeps    but now a wandering land breeze came   and a far sound of feathery quires   it seemed to blow from the dying flame   they seemed to sing in the smouldering fires   the horse towards the music raced   neighing along the lifeless waste   like sooty fingers many a tree   rose ever out of the warm sea   and they were trembling ceaselessly   as though they all were beating time   upon the centre of the sun   to that low laughing woodland rhyme   and now our wandering hours were done   we cantered to the shore and knew   the reason of the trembling trees   round every branch the songbirds flew   or clung thereon like swarming bees   while round the shore a million stood   like drops of frozen rainbow light   and pondered in a soft vain mood   upon their shadows in the tide   and told the purple deeps their pride   and murmured snatches of delight   and on the shores were many boats   with bending sterns and bending bows    and carven figures on their prows   of bitterns and fisheating stoats   and swans with their exultant throats   and where the wood and waters meet   we tied the horse in a leafy clump   and niam blew three merry notes   out of a little silver trump   and then an answering whispering flew   over the bare and woody land   a whisper of impetuous feet   and ever nearer nearer grew   and from the woods rushed out a band   of men and maidens hand in hand   and singing singing altogether   their brows were white as fragrant milk   their cloaks made out of yellow silk   and trimmed with many a crimson feather   and when they saw the cloak i wore   was dim with mire of a mortal shore   they fingered it and gazed on me   and laughed like murmurs of the sea   but niam with a swift distress   bid them away and hold their peace   and when they heard her voice they ran   and knelt them every maid and man   and kissed as they would never cease   her pearlpale hand and the hem of her dress   she bade them bring us to the hall   where aengus dreams from sun to sun   a druid dream of the end of days   when the stars are to wane and the world be done    they led us by long and shadowy ways   where drops of dew in myriads fall   and tangled creepers every hour   blossom in some new crimson flower   and once a sudden laughter sprang   from all their lips and once they sang   together while the dark woods rang   and made in all their distant parts   with boom of bees in honey marts   a rumour of delighted hearts   and once a maiden by my side   gave me a harp and bid me sing   and touch the laughing silver string   but when i sang of human joy   a sorrow wrapped each merry face   and patric by your beard they wept   until one came a tearful boy   a sadder creature never stept   than this strange human bard he cried   and caught the silver harp away   and weeping over the white strings hurled   it down in a leafhid hollow place   that kept dim waters from the sky   and each one said with a long long sigh   o saddest harp in all the world   sleep there till the moon and the stars die    and now still sad we came to where   a beautiful young man dreamed within   a house of wattles clay and skin   one hand upheld his beardless chin   and one a sceptre flashing out   wild flames of red and gold and blue   like to a merry wandering rout   of dancers leaping in the air   and men and maidens knelt them there   and showed their eyes with teardrops dim   and with low murmurs prayed to him   and kissed the sceptre with red lips   and touched it with their fingertips    he held that flashing sceptre up   joy drowns the twilight in the dew   and fills with stars nights purple cup   and wakes the sluggard seeds of corn   and stirs the young kids budding horn   and makes the infant ferns unwrap   and for the peewit paints his cap   and rolls along the unwieldy sun   and makes the little planets run   and if joy were not on the earth   there were an end of change and birth   and earth and heaven and hell would die   and in some gloomy barrow lie   folded like a frozen fly   then mock at death and time with glances   and wavering arms and wandering dances    mens hearts of old were drops of flame   that from the saffron morning came   or drops of silver joy that fell   out of the moons pale twisted shell   but now hearts cry that hearts are slaves   and toss and turn in narrow caves   but here there is nor law nor rule   nor have hands held a weary tool   and here there is nor change nor death   but only kind and merry breath   for joy is god and god is joy   with one long glance on maid and boy   and the pale blossom of the moon   he fell into a druid swoon    and in a wild and sudden dance   we mocked at time and fate and chance   and swept out of the wattled hall   and came to where the dewdrops fall   among the foamdrops of the sea   and there we hushed the revelry   and gathering on our brows a frown   bent all our swaying bodies down   and to the waves that glimmer by   that sloping green de danaan sod   sang god is joy and joy is god   and things that have grown sad are wicked   and things that fear the dawn of the morrow   or the gray wandering osprey sorrow    we danced to where in the winding thicket   the damask roses bloom on bloom   like crimson meteors hang in the gloom   and bending over them softly said   bending over them in the dance   with a swift and friendly glance   from dewy eyes upon the dead   fall the leaves of other roses   on the dead dim earth encloses   but never never on our graves   heaped beside the glimmering waves   shall fall the leaves of damask roses   for neither death nor change comes near us   and all listless hours fear us   and we fear no dawning morrow   nor the gray wandering osprey sorrow    the dance wound through the windless woods   the eversummered solitudes   until the tossing arms grew still   upon the woody central hill   and gathered in a panting band   we flung on high each waving hand   and sang unto the starry broods   in our raised eyes there flashed a glow   of milky brightness to and fro   as thus our song arose you stars   across your wandering ruby cars   shake the loose reins you slaves of god   he rules you with an iron rod   he holds you with an iron bond   each one woven to the other   each one woven to his brother   like bubbles in a frozen pond   but we in a lonely land abide   unchainable as the dim tide   with hearts that know nor law nor rule   and hands that hold no wearisome tool   folded in love that fears no morrow   nor the gray wandering osprey sorrow    o patric for a hundred years   i chased upon that woody shore   the deer the badger and the boar   o patric for a hundred years   at evening on the glimmering sands   beside the piledup hunting spears   these now outworn and withered hands   wrestled among the island bands   o patric for a hundred years   we went afishing in long boats   with bending sterns and bending bows   and carven figures on their prows   of bitterns and fisheating stoats   o patric for a hundred years   the gentle niam was my wife   but now two things devour my life   the things that most of all i hate   fasting and prayers    s patric                        tell on    usheen                                  yes yes   for these were ancient usheens fate   loosed long ago from heavens gate   for his last days to lie in wait    when one day by the tide i stood   i found in that forgetfulness   of dreamy foam a staff of wood   from some dead warriors broken lance   i turned it in my hands the stains   of war were on it and i wept   remembering how the fenians stept   along the bloodbedabbled plains   equal to good or grievous chance   thereon young niam softly came   and caught my hands but spake no word   save only many times my name   in murmurs like a frighted bird   we passed by woods and lawns of clover   and found the horse and bridled him   for we knew well the old was over   i heard one say his eyes grow dim   with all the ancient sorrow of men   and wrapped in dreams rode out again   with hoofs of the pale findrinny   over the glimmering purple sea   under the golden evening light   the immortals moved among the fountains   by rivers and the woods old night   some danced like shadows on the mountains   some wandered ever hand in hand   or sat in dreams on the pale strand   each forehead like an obscure star   bent down above each hooked knee   and sang and with a dreamy gaze   watched where the sun in a saffron blaze   was slumbering half in the sea ways   and as they sang the painted birds   kept time with their bright wings and feet   like drops of honey came their words   but fainter than a young lambs bleat    an old man stirs the fire to a blaze   in the house of a child of a friend of a brother   he has overlingered his welcome the days   grown desolate whisper and sigh to each other   he hears the storm in the chimney above   and bends to the fire and shakes with the cold   while his heart still dreams of battle and love   and the cry of the hounds on the hills of old    but we are apart in the grassy places   where care cannot trouble the least of our days   or the softness of youth be gone from our faces   or loves first tenderness die in our gaze   the hare grows old as she plays in the sun   and gazes around her with eyes of brightness   before the swift things that she dreamed of were done   she limps along in an aged whiteness   a storm of birds in the asian trees   like tulips in the air awinging   and the gentle waves of the summer seas   that raise their heads and wander singing   must murmur at last unjust unjust   and my speed is a weariness falters the mouse   and the kingfisher turns to a ball of dust   and the roof falls in of his tunnelled house    but the lovedew dims our eyes till the day   when god shall come from the sea with a sigh   and bid the stars drop down from the sky   and the moon like a pale rose wither away   book ii     now man of croziers shadows called our names   and then away away like whirling flames   and now fled by mistcovered without sound   the youth and lady and the deer and hound   gaze no more on the phantoms niam said   and kissed my eyes and swaying her bright head   and her bright body sang of faery and man   before god was or my old line began   wars shadowy vast exultant faeries of old   who wedded men with rings of druid gold   and how those lovers never turn their eyes   upon the life that fades and flickers and dies   but love and kiss on dim shores far away   rolled round with music of the sighing spray   but sang no more as when like a brown bee   that has drunk full she crossed the misty sea   with me in her white arms a hundred years   before this day for now the fall of tears   troubled her song                          i do not know if days   or hours passed by yet hold the morning rays   shone many times among the glimmering flowers   woven into her hair before dark towers   rose in the darkness and the white surf gleamed   about them and the horse of faery screamed   and shivered knowing the isle of many fears   nor ceased until white niam stroked his ears   and named him by sweet names                                 a foaming tide   whitened afar with surge fanformed and wide   burst from a great door marred by many a blow   from mace and sword and poleaxe long ago   when gods and giants warred we rode between   the seaweedcovered pillars and the green   and surging phosphorus alone gave light   on our dark pathway till a countless flight   of moonlit steps glimmered and left and right   dark statues glimmered over the pale tide   upon dark thrones between the lids of one   the imaged meteors had flashed and run   and had disported in the stilly jet   and the fixed stars had dawned and shone and set   since god made time and death and sleep the other   stretched his long arm to where a misty smother   the stream churned churned and churnedhis lips apart   as though he told his never slumbering heart   of every foamdrop on its misty way   tying the horse to his vast foot that lay   half in the unvesselled sea we climbed the stairs   and climbed so long i thought the last steps were   hung from the morning star when these mild words   fanned the delighted air like wings of birds   my brothers spring out of their beds at morn   amurmur like young partridge with loud horn   they chase the noontide deer   and when the dewdrowned stars hang in the air   look to long fishinglines or point and pare   an ashwood hunting spear    o sigh o fluttering sigh be kind to me   flutter along the froth lips of the sea   and shores the froth lips wet   and stay a little while and bid them weep   ah touch their blueveined eyelids if they sleep   and shake their coverlet    when you have told how i weep endlessly   flutter along the froth lips of the sea   and home to me again   and in the shadow of my hair lie hid   and tell me how you came to one unbid   the saddest of all men    a maiden with soft eyes like funeral tapers   and face that seemed wrought out of moonlit vapours   and a sad mouth that fear made tremulous   as any ruddy moth looked down on us   and she with a waverusted chain was tied   to two old eagles full of ancient pride   that with dim eyeballs stood on either side   few feathers were on their dishevelled wings   for their dim minds were with the ancient things    i bring deliverance pearlpale niam said    neither the living nor the unlabouring dead   nor the high gods who never lived may fight   my enemy and hope demons for fright   jabber and scream about him in the night   for he is strong and crafty as the seas   that sprang under the seven hazel trees   and i must needs endure and hate and weep   until the gods and demons drop asleep   hearing aed touch the mournful strings of gold    is he so dreadful                        be not over bold   but flee while you may flee from him                                           then i   this demon shall be pierced and drop and die   and his loose bulk be thrown in the loud tide    flee from him pearlpale niam weeping cried   for all men flee the demons but moved not   my angry king remembering soul one jot   there was no mightier soul of hebers line   now it is old and mouselike for a sign   i burst the chain still earless nerveless blind   wrapped in the things of the unhuman mind   in some dim memory or ancient mood   still earless nerveless blind the eagles stood    and then we climbed the stair to a high door   a hundred horsemen on the basalt floor   beneath had paced content we held our way   and stood within clothed in a misty ray   i saw a foamwhite seagull drift and float   under the roof and with a straining throat   shouted and hailed him he hung there a star   for no mans cry shall ever mount so far   not even your god could have thrown down that hall   stabling his unloosed lightnings in their stall   he had sat down and sighed with cumbered heart   as though his hour were come                                  we sought the part   that was most distant from the door green slime   made the way slippery and time on time   showed prints of seaborn scales while down through it   the captives journeys to and fro were writ   like a small river and where feet touched came   a momentary gleam of phosphorus flame   under the deepest shadows of the hall   that maiden found a ring hung on the wall   and in the ring a torch and with its flare   making a world about her in the air   passed under a dim doorway out of sight   and came again holding a second light   burning between her fingers and in mine   laid it and sighed i held a sword whose shine   no centuries could dim and a word ran   thereon in ogham letters mananan   that sea gods name who in a deep content   sprang dripping and with captive demons sent   out of the sevenfold seas built the dark hall   rooted in foam and clouds and cried to all   the mightier masters of a mightier race   and at his cry there came no milkpale face   under a crown of thorns and dark with blood   but only exultant faces                            niam stood   with bowed head trembling when the white blade shone   but she whose hours of tenderness were gone   had neither hope nor fear i bade them hide   under the shadows till the tumults died   of the loud crashing and earth shaking fight   lest they should look upon some dreadful sight   and thrust the torch between the slimy flags   a dome made out of endless carven jags   where shadowy face flowed into shadowy face   looked down on me and in the selfsame place   i waited hour by hour and the high dome   windowless pillarless multitudinous home   of faces waited and the leisured gaze   was loaded with the memory of days   buried and mighty when through the great door   the dawn came in and glimmered on the floor   with a pale light i journeyed round the hall   and found a door deep sunken in the wall   the least of doors beyond on a dim plain   a little runnel made a bubbling strain   and on the runnels stony and bare edge   a husky demon dry as a withered sedge   swayed crooning to himself an unknown tongue   in a sad revelry he sang and swung   bacchant and mournful passing to and fro   his hand along the runnels side as though   the flowers still grew there far on the seas waste   shaking and waving vapour vapour chased   while high frail cloudlets fed with a green light   like drifts of leaves immovable and bright   hung in the passionate dawn he slowly turned   a demons leisure eyes first white now burned   like wings of kingfishers and he arose   barking we trampled up and down with blows   of sword and brazen battleaxe while day   gave to high noon and noon to night gave way   and when at withering of the sun he knew   the druid sword of mananan he grew   to many shapes i lunged at the smooth throat   of a great eel it changed and i but smote   a firtree roaring in its leafless top   i held a dripping corpse with livid chop   and sunken shape against my face and breast   when i tore down the tree but when the west   surged up in plumy fire i lunged and drave   through heart and spine and cast him in the wave   lest niam shudder                        full of hope and dread   those two came carrying wine and meat and bread   and healed my wounds with unguents out of flowers   that feed white moths by some de danaan shrine   then in that hall lit by the dim sea shine   we lay on skins of otters and drank wine   brewed by the seagods from huge cups that lay   upon the lips of seagods in their day   and then on heapedup skins of otters slept   but when the sun once more in saffron stept   rolling his flagrant wheel out of the deep   we sang the loves and angers without sleep   and all the exultant labours of the strong    but now the lying clerics murder song   with barren words and flatteries of the weak   in what land do the powerless turn the beak   of ravening sorrow or the hand of wrath   for all your croziers they have left the path   and wander in the storms and clinging snows   hopeless for ever ancient usheen knows   for he is weak and poor and blind and lies   on the anvil of the world    s patric                              be still the skies   are choked with thunder lightning and fierce wind   for god has heard and speaks his angry mind   go cast your body on the stones and pray   for he has wrought midnight and dawn and day    usheen    saint do you weep i hear amid the thunder   the fenian horses armour torn asunder   laughter and cries the armies clash and shock   all is done now i see the ravens flock   ah cease you mournful laughing fenian horn    we feasted for three days on the fourth morn   i found dropping sea foam on the wide stair   and hung with slime and whispering in his hair   that demon dull and unsubduable   and once more to a daylong battle fell   and at the sundown threw him in the surge   to lie until the fourth morn saw emerge   his new healed shape and for a hundred years   so warred so feasted with nor dreams nor fears   nor languor nor fatigue and endless feast   an endless war                    the hundred years had ceased   i stood upon the stair the surges bore   a beech bough to me and my heart grew sore   remembering how i had stood by whitehaired finn   under a beech at emen and heard the thin   outcry of bats                    and then young niam came   holding that horse and sadly called my name   i mounted and we passed over the lone   and drifting grayness while this monotone   surly and distant mixed inseparably   into the clangour of the wind and sea    i hear my soul drop down into decay   and mananans dark tower stone by stone   gather sea slime and fall the seaward way   and the moon goad the waters night and day   that all be overthrown    but till the moon has taken all i wage   war on the mightiest men under the skies   and they have fallen or fled age after age   light is mans love and lighter is mans rage   his purpose drifts and dies    and then lost niam murmured love we go   to the island of forgetfulness for lo   the islands of dancing and of victories   are empty of all power                            and which of these   is the island of content                              none know she said   and on my bosom laid her weeping head   book iii     fled foam underneath us and around us a wandering and milky smoke   high as the saddle girth covering away from our glances the tide   and those that fled and that followed from the     foampale distance broke   the immortal desire of immortals we saw in their faces and sighed    i mused on the chase with the fenians and bran sgeolan lomair   and never a song sang niam and over my fingertips   came now the sliding of tears and sweeping of mistcold hair   and now the warmth of sighs and after the quiver of lips    were we days long or hours long in riding when rolled in a grisly peace   an isle lay level before us with dripping hazel and oak   and we stood on a seas edge we saw not for whiter     than newwashed fleece   fled foam underneath us and round us a wandering and milky smoke    and we rode on the plains of the seas edge the seas edge     barren and gray   gray sand on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees   dripping and doubling landward as though they would hasten away   like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the seas    but the trees grew taller and closer immense in their wrinkling bark   dropping a murmurous dropping old silence and that one sound   for no live creatures lived there no weasels moved in the dark   long sighs arose in our spirits beneath us bubbled the ground    and the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow night   for as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams     of the world and the sun   ceased on our hands and our faces on hazel and oak leaf the light   and the stars were blotted above us and the whole of the world was one    till the horse gave a whinny for cumbrous with stems     of the hazel and oak   a valley flowed down from his hoofs and there in the long grass lay   under the starlight and shadow a monstrous slumbering folk   their naked and gleaming bodies poured out and heaped in the way    and by them were arrow and waraxe arrow and shield and blade   and dewblanched horns in whose hollow a child of three years old   could sleep on a couch of rushes and all inwrought and inlaid   and more comely than man can make them with bronze and silver and gold    and each of the huge white creatures was huger than fourscore men   the tops of their ears were feathered their hands were     the claws of birds   and shaking the plumes of the grasses and the leaves of the mural glen   the breathing came from those bodies longwarless     grown whiter than curds    the wood was so spacious above them that he who had stars for his flocks   could fondle the leaves with his fingers nor go from     his dewcumbered skies   so long were they sleeping the owls had builded their nests     in their locks   filling the fibrous dimness with long generations of eyes    and over the limbs and the valley the slow owls wandered and came   now in a place of starfire and now in a shadow place wide   and the chief of the huge white creatures his knees     in the soft starflame   lay loose in a place of shadow we drew the reins by his side    golden the nails of his birdclaws flung loosely along the dim ground   in one was a branch softshining with bells more many than sighs   in midst of an old mans bosom owls ruffling and pacing around   sidled their bodies against him filling the shade with their eyes    and my gaze was thronged with the sleepers no     not since the world began   in realms where the handsome were many nor in glamours by demons flung   have faces alive with such beauty been known to the salt eye of man   yet weary with passions that faded when the sevenfold seas were young    and i gazed on the bellbranch sleeps forebear     far sung by the sennachies   i saw how those slumberers grown weary there camping in grasses deep   of wars with the wide world and pacing the shores of the wandering seas   laid hands on the bellbranch and swayed it and fed of unhuman sleep    snatching the horn of niam i blew a lingering note   came sound from those monstrous sleepers a sound like     the stirring of flies   he shaking the fold of his lips and heaving the pillar of his throat   watched me with mournful wonder out of the wells of his eyes    i cried come out of the shadow king of the nails of gold   and tell of your goodly household and the goodly works of your hands   that we may muse in the starlight and talk of the battles of old   your questioner usheen is worthy he comes from the fenian lands    half open his eyes were and held me dull with     the smoke of their dreams   his lips moved slowly in answer no answer out of them came   then he swayed in his fingers the bellbranch slow dropping     a sound in faint streams   softer than snowflakes in april and piercing the marrow like flame    wrapt in the wave of that music with weariness more than of earth   the moil of my centuries filled me and gone like a seacovered stone   were the memories of the whole of my sorrow and the memories     of the whole of my mirth   and a softness came from the starlight and filled me full to the bone    in the roots of the grasses the sorrels i laid my body as low   and the pearlpale niam lay by me her brow on the midst of my breast   and the horse was gone in the distance and years after years gan flow   square leaves of the ivy moved over us binding us down to our rest    and man of the many white croziers a century there i forgot   how the fetlocks drip blood in the battle when     the fallen on fallen lie rolled   how the falconer follows the falcon in the weeds of the herons plot   and the names of the demons whose hammers made armour for conhor of old    and man of the many white croziers a century there i forgot   that the spearshaft is made out of ashwood the shield     out of ozier and hide   how the hammers spring on the anvil on the spearheads burning spot   how the slow blueeyed oxen of finn low sadly at evening tide    but in dreams mild man of the croziers driving the dust     with their throngs   moved round me of seamen or landsmen all who are winter tales   came by me the kings of the red branch with roaring     of laughter and songs   or moved as they moved once lovemaking or piercing     the tempest with sails    came blanid mac nessa tall fergus who feastward of old time slunk   cook barach the traitor and warward the spittle     on his beard never dry   dark balor as old as a forest car borne his mighty head sunk   helpless men lifting the lids of his weary and deathmaking eye    and by me in soft red raiment the fenians moved in loud streams   and grania walking and smiling sewed with her needle of bone   so lived i and lived not so wrought i and wrought not     with creatures of dreams   in a long iron sleep as a fish in the water goes dumb as a stone    at times our slumber was lightened when the sun was on silver or gold   when brushed with the wings of the owls in the dimness     they love going by   when a glowworm was green on a grass leaf lured from     his lair in the mould   half wakening we lifted our eyelids and gazed on the grass with a sigh    so watched i when man of the croziers at the heel of a century fell   weak in the midst of the meadow from his miles in the midst of the air   a starling like them that forgathered neath a moon waking     white as a shell   when the fenians made foray at morning with bran sgeolan lomair    i awoke the strange horse without summons out of the distance ran   thrusting his nose to my shoulder he knew in his bosom deep   that once more moved in my bosom the ancient sadness of man   and that i would leave the immortals their dimness     their dews dropping sleep    o had you seen beautiful niam grow white as the waters are white   lord of the croziers you even had lifted your hands and wept   but the bird in my fingers i mounted remembering alone that delight   of twilight and slumber were gone and that hoofs impatiently stept    i cried o niam o white one if only a twelvehoured day   i must gaze on the beard of finn and move where the old men and young   in the fenians dwellings of wattle lean on the chessboards and play   ah sweet to me now were even bald conans slanderous tongue    like me were some galley forsaken far off in meridian isle   remembering its longoared companions sails turning     to threadbare rags   no more to crawl on the seas with long oars mile after mile   but to be amid shooting of flies and flowering of rushes and flags    their motionless eyeballs of spirits grown mild with mysterious thought   watched her those seamless faces from the valleys glimmering girth   as she murmured o wandering usheen the strength of the     bellbranch is naught   for there moves alive in your fingers the fluttering sadness of earth    then go through the lands in the saddle and see what the mortals do   and softly come to your niam over the tops of the tide   but weep for your niam o usheen weep for if only your shoe   brush lightly as haymouse earths pebbles you will come     no more to my side    o flaming lion of the world o when will you turn to your rest   i saw from a distant saddle from the earth she made her moan   i would die like a small withered leaf in the autumn     for breast unto breast   we shall mingle no more nor our gazes empty their sweetness lone    in the isles of the farthest seas where only the spirits come   were the winds less soft than the breath of a pigeon     who sleeps on her nest   nor lost in the starfires and odours the sound of the seas vague drum   o flaming lion of the world o when will you turn to your rest    the wailing grew distant i rode by the woods of the wrinkling bark   where ever is murmurous dropping old silence and that one sound   for no live creatures live there no weasels move in the dark   in a reverie forgetful of all things over the bubbling ground    and i rode by the plains of the seas edge where all is barren and gray   gray sands on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees   dripping and doubling landward as though they would hasten away   like an army of old men lounging for rest from the moan of the seas    and the winds made the sands on the seas edge turning and turning go   as my mind made the names of the fenians far from the hazel and oak   i rode away on the surges where high as the saddle bow   fled foam underneath me and round me a wandering and milky smoke    long fled the foamflakes around me the winds fled out of the vast   snatching the bird in secret nor knew i embosomed apart   when they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast   for remembrance lifting her leanness keened in the gates of my heart    till fattening the winds of the morning an odour of newmown hay   came and my forehead fell low and my tears like berries fell down   later a sound came half lost in the sound of a shore far away   from the great grassbarnacle calling and later the shoreweeds brown    if i were as i once was the strong hoofs crushing     the sand and the shells   coming out of the sea as the dawn comes a chaunt of love on my lips   not coughing my head on my knees and praying and wroth with the bells   i would leave no saints head on his body from rachlin to bera of ships    making way from the kindling surges i rode on a bridlepath   much wondering to see upon all hands of wattles and woodwork made   your bellmounted churches and guardless the sacred cairn and the rath   and a small and a feeble populace stooping with mattock and spade    or weeding or ploughing with faces ashining with muchtoil wet   while in this place and that place with bodies unglorious     their chieftains stood   awaiting in patience the strawdeath croziered one caught in your net   went the laughter of scorn from my mouth like the roaring     of wind in a wood    and because i went by them so huge and so speedy with eyes so bright   came after the hard gaze of youth or an old man lifted his head   and i rode and i rode and i cried out the fenians hunt     wolves in the night   so sleep thee by daytime a voice cried the fenians     a long time are dead    a whitebeard stood hushed on the pathway the flesh     of his face as dried grass   and in folds round his eyes and his mouth he sad     as a child without milk   and the dreams of the islands were gone and i knew how     men sorrow and pass   and their hound and their horse and their love and their eyes     that glimmer like silk    and wrapping my face in my hair i murmured in old age they ceased   and my tears were larger than berries and i murmured     where white clouds lie spread   on crevroe or broad knockfefin with many of old they feast   on the floors of the gods he cried no the gods     a long time are dead    and lonely and longing for niam i shivered and turned me about   the heart in me longing to leap like a grasshopper into her heart   i turned and rode to the westward and followed the seas old shout   till i saw where maive lies sleeping till starlight and midnight part    and there at the foot of the mountain two carried a sack full of sand   they bore it with staggering and sweating but fell     with their burden at length   leaning down from the gemstudded saddle i flung it     five yards with my hand   with a sob for men waxing so weakly a sob for the fenians old strength    the rest you have heard of o croziered one how when divided the girth   i fell on the path and the horse went away like a summer fly   and my years three hundred fell on me and i rose     and walked on the earth   a creeping old man full of sleep with the spittle     on his beard never dry    how the men of the sandsack showed me a church with its belfry in air   sorry place where for swing of the waraxe in my dim eyes     the crozier gleams   what place have caolte and conan and bran sgeolan lomair   speak you too are old with your memories an old man surrounded     with dreams    s patric    where the flesh of the footsole clingeth on the burning stones     is their place   where the demons whip them with wires on the burning stones of wide hell   watching the blessed ones move far off and the smile on gods face   between them a gateway of brass and the howl of the angels who fell    usheen    put the staff in my hands for i go to the fenians o cleric to chaunt   the warsongs that roused them of old they will rise making clouds     with their breath   innumerable singing exultant the clay underneath them shall pant   and demons be broken in pieces and trampled beneath them in death    and demons afraid in their darkness deep horror of eyes and of wings   afraid their ears on the earth laid shall listen and rise up and weep   hearing the shaking of shields and the quiver of stretched bowstrings   hearing hell loud with a murmur as shouting and mocking we sweep    we will tear out the flaming stones and batter the gateway of brass   and enter and none sayeth no when there enters the strongly    armed guest   make clean as a broom cleans and march on as oxen move over young grass   then feast making converse of wars and of old wounds     and turn to our rest    s patric    on the flaming stones without refuge the limbs of the fenians are tost   none war on the masters of hell who could break up the world     in their rage   but kneel and wear out the flags and pray for your soul that is lost   through the demon love of its youth and its godless and passionate age    usheen    ah me to be shaken with coughing and broken with old age and pain   without laughter a show unto children alone with remembrance and fear   all emptied of purple hours as a beggars cloak in the rain   as a haycock out on the flood or a wolf sucked under a weir    it were sad to gaze on the blessed and no man i loved of old there   i throw down the chain of small stones when life in my body has ceased   i will go to caolte and conan and bran sgeolan lomair   and dwell in the house of the fenians be they in flames or at feast     glossary and notes   the pronunciation of the irish wordswhen i wrote the greater number of these poems i had hardly considered the question seriously i copied at times somebodys perhaps fanciful phonetic spelling and at times the ancient spelling as i found it in some literal translation pronouncing the words always as they were spelt i do not suppose i would have defended this system at any time but i do not yet know what system to adopt the modern pronunciation which is usually followed by those who spell the words phonetically is certainly unlike the pronunciation of the time when classical irish literature was written and so far as i know no irish scholar who writes in english or french has made that minute examination of the way the names come into the rhythms and measures of the old poems which can alone discover the old pronunciation a french celtic scholar gave me the pronunciation of a few names and told me that mr whitley stokes had written something about the subject in german but i am ignorant of german if i ever learn the old pronunciation i will revise all these poems but at present i can only affirm that i have not treated my irish names as badly as the medi√¶val writers of the stories of king arthur treated their welsh names  mythological gods and heroesi refer the reader for such names as balor and finn and usheen to lady gregorys cuchulain of muirthemne and to her gods and fighting men  the ballad of father gilligana tradition among the people of castleisland kerry  the ballad of father ohartthis ballad is founded on the story of a certain father ohart priest of coloony sligo in the last century as told by the present priest of coloony in his history of ballisodare and kilvarnet the robbery of the lands of father ohart was a kind of robbery which occurred but rarely during the penal laws catholics forbidden to own landed property evaded the law by giving a protestant nominal possession of their estates there are instances on record in which poor men were nominal owners of immense estates  the ballad of the foxhunterfounded on an incident probably itself a tipperary tradition in kickhams knockagow  bellbrancha legendary branch whose shaking casts all men into a sleep  the countess cathleeni found the story of the countess cathleen in what professed to be a collection of irish folklore in an irish newspaper some years ago i wrote to the compiler asking about its source but got no answer but have since heard that it was translated from les matin√©es de timoth√® trimm a good many years ago and has been drifting about the irish press ever since l√©o lesp√®s gives it as an irish story and though the editor of folklore has kindly advertised for information the only christian variant i know of is a donegal tale given by mr larminie in his west irish folk tales and romances of a woman who goes to hell for ten years to save her husband and stays there another ten having been granted permission to carry away as many souls as could cling to her skirt l√©o lesp√®s may have added a few details but i have no doubt of the essential antiquity of what seems to me the most impressive form of one of the supreme parables of the world the parable came to the greeks in the sacrifice of alcestis but her sacrifice was less overwhelming less apparently irremediable l√©o lesp√®s tells the story as follows       ce que je vais vous dire est un r√©cit du car√™me irlandais

paraissaient √™tre des      hommes de cinquante ans car leur barbe grisonnait un peu       or √† cette √©poque comme aujourdhui lirlande √©tait pauvre car      le soleil avait √©t√© rare et des r√©coltes presque nulles les      indigents ne savaient √† quel sainte se vouer et la mis√®re devenait      de plus en plus terrible       dans lh√¥tellerie o√π descendirent les marchands fastueux on chercha      √† p√©n√©trer leurs desseins mais ce fut en vain ils demeur√®rent      silencieux et discrets       et pendant quils demeur√®rent dans lh√¥tellerie ils ne cess√®rent      de compter et de recompter des sacs de pi√®ces dor dont la vive      clart√© sapercevait √† travers les vitres du logis       gentlemen leur dit lh√¥tesse un jour do√π vient que vous √™tes si      opulents et que

     le tr√©sor √©tait distribu√© aux pauvres au fur et √† mesure de leurs      besoins       ceci ne faisait pas le compte dit la tradition des      commisvoyageurs du malin esprit qui ne trouvaient plus d√¢mes √†      acheter       aid√©s par un valet inf√¢me ils p√©n√©tr√®rent dans la retraite de la      noble dame et lui d√©rob√®rent le reste de son tr√©sor  en vain      luttatelle de toutes ses forces pour sauver le contenu de son      coffre les larrons diaboliques furent les plus forts si ketty      avait eu les moyens de faire un signe de croix ajoute la l√©gende      irlandaise elle les e√ªt mis en fuite mais ses mains √©taient      captivesle larcin fut effectu√© alors les pauvres sollicit√®rent      en vain pr√®s de ketty d√©pouill√©e elle ne pouvait plus secourir      leur mis√®reelle les abandonnait √† la tentation pourtant il ny      avait plus que huit jours √† passer pour que les grains et lea      fourrages arrivassent en abondance des pays dorient mais huit      jours c√©tait un si√®cle huit jours n√©cessitaient une somme      immense pour subvenir aux exigences de la disette et les pauvres      allaient ou expirer dans les angousses de la faim ou reniant les      saintes maximes de levangile vendre √† vil prix leur √¢me le plus      beau pr√©sent de la munificence du seigneur toutpuissant       et ketty navait plus une obole car elle avait abandonn√© son      ch√¢teux aux malheureux       elle passa douze heures dans les larmes et le deuil arrachant ses      cheveux couleur de soleil et meurtrissant son sein couleur du lis      puis elle se leva r√©solue anim√©e par un vif sentiment de      d√©sespoir       elle se rendit chez les marchands d√¢mes       que voulezvous dirent ils       vous achetez des √¢mes       oui un peu malgr√© vous nest

une v√©ritable r√©cit de car√™me  the countess cathleen was acted in dublin in 1899 with mr marcus st john and mr trevor lowe as the first and second demon mr valentine grace as shemus rua master charles sefton as teig madame san carola as mary miss florence farr as aleel miss anna mather as oona mr charles holmes as the herdsman mr jack wilcox as the gardener mr walford as a peasant miss dorothy paget as a spirit miss m kelly as a peasant woman mr te wilkinson as a servant and miss may whitty as the countess kathleen they had to face a very vehement opposition stirred up by a politician and a newspaper the one accusing me in a pamphlet the other in long articles day after day of blasphemy because of the language of the demons or of shemus rua and because i made a woman sell her soul and yet escape damnation and of a lack of patriotism because i made irish men and women who it seems never did such a thing sell theirs the politician or the newspaper persuaded some forty catholic students to sign a protest against the play and a cardinal who avowed that he had not read it to make another and both politician and newspaper made such obvious appeals to the audience to break the peace that a score or so of police were sent to the theatre to see that they did not i had however no reason to regret the result for the stalls containing almost all that was distinguished in dublin and a gallery of artisans alike insisted on the freedom of literature  after the performance in 1899 i added the love scene between aleel and the countess and in this new form the play was revived in new york by miss wycherley as well as being played a good deal in england and america by amateurs now at last i have made a complete revision to make it suitable for performance at the abbey theatre the first two scenes are almost wholly new and throughout the play i have added or left out such passages as a stage experience of some years showed me encumbered the action the play in its first form having been written before i knew anything of the theatre i have left the old end however in the version printed in the body of this book because the change for dramatic purposes has been made for no better reason than that audienceseven at the abbey theatreare almost ignorant of irish mythologyor because a shallow stage made the elaborate vision of armed angels upon a mountainside impossible the new end is particularly suited to the abbey stage where the stage platform can be brought out in front of the proscenium and have a flight of steps at one side up which the angel comes crossing towards the back of the stage at the opposite side the principal lighting is from two arc lights in the balcony which throw their lights into the faces of the players making footlights unnecessary the room at shemus ruas house is suggested by a great grey curtaina colour which becomes full of rich tints under the stream of light from the arcs the two or more arches in the third scene permit the use of a gauze the short front scene before the last is just long enough when played with incidental music to allow the scene set behind it to be changed the play when played without interval in this way lasts a little over an hour  the play was performed at the abbey theatre for the first time on december 14 1911 miss maire oneill taking the part of the countess and the last scene from the going out of the merchants was as follows       merchants rush out aleel crawls into the middle of the room      the twilight has fallen and gradually darkens as the scene goes      on    aleel    theyre rising uptheyre rising through the earth   fat asmodel and giddy belial   and all the fiends now they leap in the air   but why does hells gate creak so round and round   hither and hither to and fro theyre running  he moves about as though the air was full of spirits oona enters    crouch down old heron out of the blind storm    oona    where is the countess cathleen all this day   her eyes were full of tears and when for a moment   her hand was laid upon my hand it trembled   and now i do not know where she is gone    aleel    cathleen has chosen other friends than us   and they are rising through the hollow world   demons are out old heron    oona                               god guard her soul    aleel    shes bartered it away this very hour   as though we two were never in the world  he kneels beside her but does not seem to hear her words the peasants return they carry the countess cathleen and lay her upon the ground before oona and aleel she lies there as if dead    oona    o that so many pitchers of rough clay   should prosper and the porcelain break in two  she kisses the hands of cathleen    a peasant    we were under the tree where the path turns   when she grew pale as death and fainted away    cathleen    o hold me and hold me tightly for the storm   is dragging me away  oona takes her in her arms a woman begins to wail    peasants                         hush    peasants                               hush    peasant women                                     hush    other peasant women                                           hush    cathleen half rising    lay all the bags of money in a heap   and when i am gone old oona share them out   to every man and woman judge and give   according to their needs    a peasant woman                              and will she give   enough to keep my children through the dearth    another peasant woman    o queen of heaven and all you blessed saints   let us and ours be lost so she be shriven    cathleen    bend down your faces oona and aleel   i gaze upon them as the swallow gazes   upon the nest under the eave before   she wander the loud waters do not weep   too great a while for there is many a candle   on the high altar though one fall aleel   who sang about the dancers of the woods   that know not the hard burden of the world   having but breath in their kind bodies farewell   and farewell oona you who played with me   and bore me in your arms about the house   when i was but a childand therefore happy   therefore happy even like those that dance   the storm is in my hair and i must go  she dies     oona    bring me the lookingglass  a woman brings it to her out of inner room oona holds glass over the lips of cathleen all is silent for a moment then she speaks in a halfscream                                o she is dead    a peasant    she was the great white lily of the world    a peasant    she was more beautiful than the pale stars    an old peasant woman    the little plant i loved is broken in two  aleel takes lookingglass from oona and flings it upon floor so that it is broken in many pieces    aleel    i shatter you in fragments for the face   that brimmed you up with beauty is no more   and die dull heart for you that were a mirror   are but a ball of passionate dust again   and level earth and plumy sea rise up   and haughty sky fall down    a peasant woman                                pull him upon his knees   his curses will pluck lightning on our heads    aleel    angels and devils clash in the middle air   and brazen swords clang upon brazen helms   look look a spear has gone through belials eye  a winged angel carrying a torch and a sword enters from the r with eyes fixed upon some distant thing the angel is about to pass out to the l when aleel speaks the angel stops a moment and turns    look no more on the halfclosed gates of hell   but speak to me whose mind is smitten of god   that it may be no more with mortal things   and tell of her who lies there  the angel turns again and is about to go but is seized by aleel                                    till you speak   you shall not drift into eternity    the angel    the light beats down the gates of pearl are wide   and she is passing to the floor of peace   and mary of the seven times wounded heart   has kissed her lips and the long blessed hair   has fallen on her face the light of lights   looks always on the motive not the deed   the shadow of shadows on the deed alone  aleel releases the angel and kneels    oona    tell them to walk upon the floor of peace   that i would die and go to her i love   the years like great black oxen tread the world   and god the herdsman goads them on behind   and i am broken by their passing

hellin the older irish books hell is always cold and it may be because the fomoroh or evil powers ruled over the north and the winter christianity adopted as far as possible the pagan symbolism in ireland as elsewhere and irish poets when they spoke of the cold flagstone of hell may have repeated pagan symbolism the folktales and keating in his description of hell make use however of the ordinary symbolism of fire  the lamentation of the pensionerthis poem is little more than a translation into verse of the very words of an old wicklow peasant fret means doom or destiny  the land of

lemoyne it has been played two or three times professionally since then in america and a great many times in england and america by amateurs till lately it was not part of the repertory of the abbey theatre for i had grown to dislike it without knowing what i disliked in it this winter however i have made many revisions and now it plays well enough to give me pleasure it is printed in this book in the new form which was acted for the first time on february 22 1912 at the abbey theatre dublin at the abbey theatre where the platform of the stage comes out in front of the curtain the curtain

favourite symbol with the irish poets and has given a name to several poems both gaelic and english and is used in love poems in addresses to ireland like mr aubrey de veres poem telling how the little black rose shall be red at last and in religious poems like the old gaelic one which speaks of the rose of friday meaning the rose of austerity  salleywillow  seven hazeltreesthere was once a well overshadowed by seven sacred hazeltrees in the midst of ireland a certain woman plucked their fruit and seven rivers arose out of the well and swept her away in my poems this well is the source of all the waters of this world which are therefore sevenfold  the wanderings of usheenthe poem is founded upon the middle irish dialogues of s patric and usheen and a certain gaelic poem of the last century the events it describes like the events in most of the poems in this volume are supposed to have taken place rather in the indefinite period made up of many periods described by the folktales than in any particular century it therefore like the later fenian stories themselves mixes much that is medi√¶val with much that is ancient the gaelic poems do not make usheen go to more than one island but a story in silva gadelica describes four paradises an island to the north an island to the west an island to the south and adams paradise in the east    printed in great britain by    unwin
