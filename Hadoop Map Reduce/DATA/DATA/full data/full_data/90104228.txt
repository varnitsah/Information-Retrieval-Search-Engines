 notes     introduction  the facts of lincolns early life are best stated in his own words communicated in 1859see appendix to mr j w fell of bloomington illinois  unlike many men who have risen from humble surroundings lincoln never boasted of his wonderful struggle with poverty  his nature had no room for the false pride of a mr bounderby even though the facts warranted the claim  indeed he seldom mentioned his early life at all  on one occasion he referred to it as the short and simple annals of the poor  lincoln himself did not in any way base his claims to public recognition upon the fact that he was born in a log cabin and that he had split rails in his youth although on the other hand he was not ashamed of the facts  more perhaps than any other man of his time he believed and by his actions realized the truth of burns saying the mans the goud for a that  the real lesson to be drawn from lincolns life is that under any conditions real success is to be won by intelligent unwavering effort the degree of success being determined by the ability and character of the individual  still less profitable is the attempt to contrast the success of lincoln with that of washington or jefferson or of any other american whose early circumstances were more favorable than lincolns  in each case success has been worthily won and we americans of the present generation should rejoice that our country has produced so many great men  true patriotism does not consist in the recognition of only one type of americanism but rather in the grateful acceptance of every service that advances the fortunes and raises the reputation of the republic  peculiar interest attaches to the character of lincolns early reading and especially to the small number of books that were accessible to him  in these days of cheap and plentiful literature it is hard for us to realize the conditions in pioneer kentucky and indiana where half a dozen volumes formed a family library and even newspapers were few and far between  there was no room for mental dissipation and the few precious volumes that could be obtained were read and reread until their contents were fully mastered  when sir henry irving was asked to prepare a list of the hundred best books he replied before a hundred books commend me to the reading of two the bible and shakespeare  fortunately these two classics came at an early age within the reach of lincoln and the frequency with which he quotes from both at all periods of his career both in his writings and in his conversation shows that he had made good use of them  the boy lincoln not only read books he made copious extracts from them often using a smooth shingle in the absence of paper and depending upon the uncertain light of the log fire in his fathers cabin  such use of books makes for intellectual growth and much of lincolns later success as a writer can be referred back to this careful method of reading  lincolns later reading shows considerable variety within certain limits  he himself once remarked that he liked little sad songs among his special favorites in this class of poetry were ben bolt the lament of the irish emigrant holmes the last leaf and charles mackays the enquiry  the poem from which he most frequently quoted and which seems to have impressed him most was oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud  his own marked tendency to melancholy which is reflected in his face seemed to respond to appeals of this sort  among his favorite poets besides shakespeare were burns longfellow hood and lowell  many of the poems in his personal anthology were picked from the poets corner of newspapers and it was in this way that he became acquainted with longfellow  lincoln was especially fond of humorous writings both in prose and verse a taste that is closely connected with his lifelong fondness for funny stories his favorite humorous writer during the presidential period was petroleum v nasby david p locke from whose letters he frequently read to more or less sympathetic listeners  it was eminently characteristic of lincoln that the presentation to the cabinet of the emancipation proclamation was prefaced by the reading of the latest nasby letter  lincolns statement in the autobiography that he had picked up the little advance he had made upon his early education or rather lack of education is altogether too modest  it is known that after his term in congress he studied and mastered geometry and like washington he early became a successful surveyor  his study of the law too was characteristically thorough and his skill in debate in which he had no superior was the result of careful preparation  during the presidential period lincoln gave evidence of critical ability that is little short of marvellous in a man whose schooling amounted to less than a year  in a letter to the actor hackett and in several conversations he analyzed passages from hamlet macbeth and other plays with an insight and sympathy that have rarely been surpassed even by eminent literary critics  at an early age lincolns interest was aroused in public speaking and he soon began to exercise himself in this direction and to attend meetings addressed by those skilled in the art of oratory  many stories are told of his local reputation as a speaker and storyteller even before he moved to illinois much of his success then as in later life being due to the singular charm of his personality  lincoln never overcame a certain awkwardness almost uncouthness of appearance and he never acquired the finer arts of oratory for which his rival douglas was so conspicuous  but in spite of these physical difficulties he was acknowledged by douglas to be the man whom he most feared in debate and lincoln was able to sway the critical unfamiliar audience assembled in cooper union as readily as the ruder crowds gathered about the illinois stump  on the subject of lincolns religious belief about which such varying opinions have been held it is sufficient to state that although he was not a member of any religious body he had a firm conviction of the protecting power of providence and the efficacy of special prayer this latter characteristic seems to have been especially developed during the presidential period  both in his proclamations and in many private interviews and communications he expresses himself clearly and emphatically upon this subject  it is probable too that lincoln read more deeply and more frequently in the bible during the storm and stress of the civil war than at any other period of his life  there seems to be no authority for the statement sometimes made that after the death of his son willie lincoln showed a tendency to believe in the doctrines of spiritualism  he was not free however from a belief in the significance of dreams as portending important events  he was also not a little of a fatalist as he himself once stated to his friend arnold  perhaps the most striking characteristic of lincolns personality apart from his honesty and sincerity was his perfect simplicity and naturalness  frederick a douglass the great leader of the colored race once remarked that president lincoln was the only white man that he had ever met who never suggested by his manner a sense of superiority  not that lincoln was lacking in personal dignity neither as a practising lawyer nor as president of the united states would he permit anyone to take what he regarded as liberties with him but on the other hand he did not allow his elevated position to change his personal relations  his old illinois friends found in the white house the same cordial welcome and simple manners to which they had been accustomed in the pleasant home at springfield  during the first few weeks of the administration it was believed by many persons including mr seward himself that president lincoln would be greatly influenced in his policy by the superior experience in public affairs of his secretary of state  mr seward even went so far as to draw up a plan of action which he submitted to his chief lincoln soon showed however that he was not a follower but a leader of men beneath whose good nature and kindly spirit was a power of initiative that has rarely been equalled among the statesmen of the world  even the dictatorial secretary of war found it necessary to yield to the president on all points that the latter regarded as being fundamental  few other presidents have been so bitterly attacked and so cruelly misrepresented as lincoln but nothing could turn him from his purpose when that was once formed  like the wise man that he was lincoln was always ready to listen to the suggestions of others but the conclusion finally reached by him was always his own  he applied to questions of state the same methods of careful impartial inquiry that had served him so well as a lawyer on the illinois circuit and if being human he did not always avoid committing errors he never acted from impulse or prejudice  lincoln was a strong leader but he was at the same time a wise leader   turning now from the man to his works we note first that the development of lincolns style was slow  one might almost be tempted to say that lincoln developed several different styles in succession this however is hardly true for in spite of the numerous marked changes and improvements in lincolns manner of writing certain fundamental qualities remained the real expression of his personality that is the real style of lincoln  from the beginning to the end we find an effort to say something and to say it in as clear a manner as possible an effort without which there can be no real success in writing  after a practice in public speaking of over thirty years lincoln as president could still say i believe i shall never be old enough to speak without embarrassment when i have nothing to talk about  the first specimen of lincolns writings that has been preserved is a communication to the voters of sangamon county in 1832 when lincoln was for the first time a candidate for the state legislature  it is significant of lincolns imperfect command of english at that time that some of the grammatical errors were corrected by a friend before the circular was issued  although this circumstance makes it impossible for us to judge exactly what his style was at this period we may be sure that the changes were comparatively slight and that the general form at least was lincolns  the question naturally arises whether there is anything in this first specimen of lincolns writing that suggests however remotely the gettysburg address and the second inaugural  a little study will discover suggestions at least of the later manner just as in the uncouth and awkward young candidate for the illinois state legislature we can note many traits intellectual and moral that distinguish the mature and wellpoised statesman of thirty years later  it is the same man but developed and strengthened it is the same style strengthened and refined  if nicolay and hay go too far when they say of the address this is almost precisely the style of his later years it would be quite as wrong to deny any likeness between the two  in the first place we have the same severely logical treatment of the subject matter from which lincoln a lawyer and public speaker never departed  lincolns grammar may not have been impeccable at this time but his thinking powers were already little short of masterly  this then is the first element in the makeup of lincolns style the ability to think straight and consequently to write straight  his legal training which was then very meagre cannot account for his logical thinking it is more correct to say that he later became a successful lawyer because of the logical bent of his mind  closely connected with this early development of the form of thinking was lincolns interest in words and his desire always to use words with a perfect understanding of their meaning  even in his boyhood he found pleasure in discovering the exact meaning of a new word and in later life he was constantly adding to his verbal stores  shortly before his inauguration lincoln remarked to a clergyman who had asked him how he had acquired his remarkable power of putting things i can say this that among my earliest recollections i remember how when a mere child i used to get irritated when anybody talked to me in a way i could not understand  i dont think i ever got angry at anything else in my life  but that always disturbed my temper and has ever since  i can remember going to my little bedroom after hearing the neighbors talk of an evening with my father and spending no small part of the night walking up and down trying to make out what was the exact meaning of their to me dark sayings  in this first address we find no loose use of words  the character of the address does not of course admit of ornament or figurative language but any subject however simple admits of digressions and mental excursions by the illogical and careless writer  of these there is not a trace  even in the most informal letters and telegrams written at post haste and at times under the most extreme pressure of business and anxiety lincoln shows a natural feeling for the appropriate expression that is found only in the masters of language  five years later in 1837 the interval being represented by only a few unimportant letters lincoln entered upon a period distinguished by qualities that are not usually associated with his name a tendency to fine writing that we should look for earlier than at the age of twentyeight  the subject of the address is the perpetuation of our political institutions and the complete text is given in this volume here for once lincoln speaks of an alexander a buonoparte a washington  the influence of webster is apparent in this first purely oratorical attempt of lincolns  it could hardly have been otherwise at a time when the great whig orator was making the whole country ring with his wonderful speeches  it is almost certain too that henry clay to whom lincoln later referred as beau ideal of an orator had a part in moulding this early manner though this is probably less apparent here than in the later soberer addresses  but it must not be supposed that this speech consists merely of what hamlet would call words words words  neither are all the figures inferior and commonplace  although it is more ornate than anything in the later period the following description of the passing away of the heroes of the revolution is a fine example of the websterian style they were a forest of giant oaks but the allresistless hurricane has swept over them and left only here and there a lonely trunk despoiled of its verdure shorn of its foliage unshading and unshaded to murmur in a few more ruder storms then to sink and be no more  the closing sentence of the address is almost wholly in the later style and might have served for the close of the first inaugural which in its original form did actually contain a biblical quotation  that the rhetorical manner had not gained entire possession of lincoln at that time but was simply used by him on what seemed to be appropriate occasions is sufficiently shown by a speech delivered in the legislature early in 1839 in which we find the strictly logical discussion of the first address  this speech is especially interesting because of the fact that it is the earliest encounter of lincoln and douglas that has been preserved  in a way therefore it may be regarded as the first lincolndouglas debate  one other rhetorical effort was made in 1842 and then we find no more specimens of this class of speaking until the socalled lost speech of 1856  this address of 1842 was delivered before the springfield washingtonian temperance society on washingtons birthday and it is even more inflated than the first specimen  combined with the rhetoric however there is a mass of sober argument that again suggests the later lincoln  the arguments too are characterized by a sound common sense that is no less characteristic of the speaker  the peroration deserves quotation as being one of the finest and at the same time one of the least familiar passages in lincolns writings this is the one hundredth and tenth anniversary of the birthday of washington  we are met to celebrate this day  washington is the mightiest name of earth long since mightiest in the cause of civil liberty still mightiest in moral reformation  on that name a eulogy is expected  it cannot be  to add brightness to the sun or glory to the name of washington is alike impossible  let none attempt it  in solemn awe pronounce the name and in its naked deathless splendor leave it shining on  this approaches very closely the beauty and strength of the presidential period  in 1844 lincoln wrote several poems which are not without merit  as a boy he was famous among his companions for his skill in writing humorous verses but these later specimens of his muse are serious even melancholy in their tone  we next come to the congressional period from 1847 to 1849  the bestknown speech from this period lincolns introduction to a national public is that of july 27 1848 on general taylor and the veto taylor being then the whig candidate for the presidency  this speech which was received with immense applause owes its special prominence to the fact that it is the only purely humorous speech by lincoln that has been preserved  the subject of the attack is general cass taylors democratic opponent whom lincoln treats in a manner that somewhat suggests douglas later treatment of lincoln on the stump  its peroration is of peculiar interest since it consists of a funny story  to anyone familiar with lincolns habit of storytelling the introduction of a story at the end of a speech may not seem strange but as a matter of fact this is the only case of the kind that has been noted and a careful reading of the speeches shows either that they were not fully reported or that as a rule he confined his storytelling to conversation  even in the debates with douglas when he was addressing illinois crowds from the stump at a time when stories were even more popular than they are now lincoln seldom used this device to rouse interest or to strengthen his argument  a partial explanation of this curious contrast between his conversation and his writing so far as the debates are concerned may be found in a remark made by lincoln to a friend who had urged him to treat the subject more popularly  lincoln said the occasion is too serious the issues are too grave  i do not seek applause or to amuse the people but to convince them  with lincoln the desire to prove his proposition whatever it might be was always uppermost  in the earliest speeches were noted the severe logic and the strict adherence to the subject in hand  to the end lincoln never changed this principle of his public speaking  although the stories then have but little direct bearing upon lincolns writings they are so characteristic a feature of the man that they cannot be wholly disregarded  in the two cases already noted the stories were illustrative and this appears to be true of all of lincolns anecdotes whether they occur in his conversation or in his writings  he apparently never dragged in stories for their own sake as so many conversational bores are in the habit of doing but the story was suggested by or served to illustrate some incident or principle  indeed in aptness of illustration lincoln has never been surpassed  emerson said of him i am sure if this man had ruled in a period of less facility of printing he would have become mythological in a very few years like aesop or pilpay or one of the seven wise masters by his fables and proverbs  many of the anecdotes attributed to lincoln are undoubtedly to be referred to other sources but the number of authentic stories noted especially during the presidency is very large  the question has often been raised whether lincoln originated the stories he told so well  fortunately we have his own words in this matter  to noah brooks he said i do generally remember a good story when i hear it but i never did invent anything original  i am only a retail dealer  slightly differing from this though probably not contradicting it is lincolns statement to mr chauncey m depew i have originated but two stories in my life but i tell tolerably well other peoples stories  during the civil war lincolns stories served a special purpose as a sort of safety valve  to a congressman who had remonstrated with him for his apparent frivolity in combining funny stories with serious discussion he said if it were not for these stories i should die the addresses of the presidential period however with the exception of a few responses to serenades are entirely without humorous anecdotes  although lincoln never hesitated to clear the discussion of the most momentous questions through the medium of a funny story his sense of official and literary propriety made him confine them to informal occasions  the eulogy of henry clay of 1852 is of interest as being the only address of this kind that lincoln ever delivered  it might perhaps better be called an appreciation and because of its sincerity and deep sympathy it may be regarded as a model of its kind  two years later lincoln engaged in his first real debate with douglas on the burning question of the day the repeal of the missouri compromise  from the purely literary point of view the peoria speech is superior to the betterknown debates of four years later  while it lacks the finish and poise of the two inaugurals it is far more imaginative than the debates  one of its most striking features is the comparatively large number of quotations both from the bible and from profane writings although as a rule lincoln quotes sparingly this one speech contains no fewer than twelve quotations seven of these being from the bible the only other speech that equals this one in the number of quotations is the socalled lost speech of 1856 the authenticity of which is doubtful  the very much shorter second inaugural however with its four bible quotations has a larger proportionate number  lincolns quotations seem to be suggested emotionally rather than intellectually this is indicated by the fact that the most emotional speeches contain the greatest number of quotations  the first inaugural for example which is in the main a sober statement of principles intended to quiet rather than to excite passion is four times as long as the emotional second inaugural but contains only one quotation to the four of the other  we may note in this connection that almost exactly onehalf of the total number of quotations occurring in lincolns writings are taken from the bible and that a large proportion of the profane quotations are from shakespeare  lincoln was also fond of using proverbial sayings a habit that emphasized his character as a popular or national writer  for most of his proverbs are local and many of them are intensely homely  quotations of this class occur at all periods of his life beginning with the first address and they are sometimes used in such unexpected places as official telegrams to officers in the field  strange to say the maxim that is most frequently associated with lincolns name cannot with any certainty be regarded as having been used by him either as a quotation or as an original saying you can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all the time but you cannot fool all the people all the time  at the first regular republican state convention in illinois held at bloomington may 29 1856 lincoln delivered an address on the public issues of the day that roused the enthusiasm of his hearers to such a degree that the reporters forgot to take notes and therefore failed to furnish the text to their respective newspapers  in the course of time it came to be known as the lost speech and such in the opinion of many who were present on the occasion it continued to be  mr w c whitney a young lawyer from the neighboring town of champaign later prepared a version based upon notes from which some general idea of the character of the speech can perhaps be gained  the lincolndouglas debates furnish perhaps the best example of this class of public speaking that is available  although they were extempore as far as the actual language is concerned they have been preserved in full  in spite of the informal style appropriate to the stump these discussions of the dred scott decision popular sovereignty and the other questions suggested by slavery are marked by a closeness of reasoning and a readiness of retort that show the great master in the difficult art of debate  these qualities are not confined to the one speaker for his opponent was no less adroit and ready  we may well say in this connection there were giants in those days  much of lincolns success in these historic debates was due to his intense conviction of the righteousness of the cause for which he was pleading  as lawyer and political speaker lincoln always felt the necessity of believing in his case  he frequently refused to appear in suits because he could not put his heart into them and he never defended a policy from mere party loyalty  much of lincolns success as a speaker was due to the fact that his hearers felt that they could trust him  this is simply a new application of the old principle that the chief qualification for success in oratory is character  in reading a mans books we may forget his character for the time but in listening to an orator we have the man himself constantly before us and he himself makes or mars his success  in 1859 lincoln delivered his second and last long occasional addressa discussion of agriculture at the wisconsin state fair at milwaukee  this is the only important nonpolitical speech by lincoln that has been preserved and it is interesting as showing his ability to treat a subject of general interest  here as in his discussions of political questions lincoln displayed true statesmanlike insight and foresight long before the time when experiment stations and farmers institutes began to teach the very principles that he so wisely and effectively expounded  in 1860 lincoln appeared for the first time before a new york audience and we have his own word for it that he suffered a severe attack of stage fright on that occasion  the event showed however that he had no reason to fear the judgment of one of the most critical audiences that ever assembled in the cooper union  the hon joseph h choate who was present writes of his appearance when he spoke he was transformed his eye kindled his voice rang his face shone and seemed to light up the whole assembly  for an hour and a half he held his audience in the hollow of his hand  this address may be regarded as a precursor and a worthy precursor of the first inaugural and by many competent critics it has been given the first place among the discussions of the political situation just before the war  after such a performance there could be no hesitation on the part of those that heard it in acknowledging abraham lincoln as one of the most powerful speakers of his day  before returning to illinois lincoln travelled through several of the new england states making speeches in a number of the larger towns  the speeches delivered by lincoln on the journey to washington in 1860 beginning with the exquisite farewell address at springfield include some of the best of his shorter addresses  the most interesting of these is the one delivered in independence hall  the first inaugural address was not received at the time of its first publication in the newspapers even at the north with the general enthusiasm that we should now be inclined to assume and in the south it was severely criticised for its alleged lack of force and definiteness  its effect however upon the immense audience gathered in front of the capitol seems to have been immediate  the document had been written with great care at springfield some changes being made after the arrival at washington  the most important of these were the substitution for the original closing paragraph of the beautiful peroration suggested by secretary seward  in beauty of language and elevation of thought this first public utterance by president lincoln may be compared to the great political utterances of burke  first among the little classics of the world stands the gettysburg address  at the time of its delivery it does not seem to have been generally accepted as a notable utterance  by many of the newspaper correspondents it was referred to as remarks by the president and some of the papers contained no comment upon it  by others it was dismissed with a few words of mild praise  even after the death of lincoln there was no general agreement as to its supreme merits as a part of our national literature  conflicting stories still pass current in books and articles on lincoln about its composition and original reception  an examination of the testimony shows that the following facts may be accepted as fairly proved  the greater part of the address was written in washington after very careful preparation and profound reflection  the address was read from ms but with some variations that apparently occurred to the speaker at the time of delivery  mr everett did not clasp the presidents hand while he expressed a willingness to exchange his hundred pages for the twenty lines just read  it is uncertain whether lincoln said at the time that the address did not scour but if he did use such an expression it was not because of a consciousness of having failed to make adequate preparation for the occasion  one of the best commentaries on the second inaugural address appeared in an article in the london spectator we cannot read it without a renewed conviction that it is the noblest political document known to history and should have for the nation and the statesmen he left behind him something of a sacred and almost prophetic character  carl schurz compared it to a sacred poem and all discriminating readers agree in placing it by the side of the gettysburg address as an almost perfect specimen of pure english prose  the other addresses of the presidential period are with the exception of the last speech on the reconstruction of louisiana of minor importance  they consist in the main of responses to serenades a form of address which lincoln cordially detested and in which as a rule he achieved only a moderate degree of success  the cares of his great office made such cruel demands upon his time and strength that he declined many requests to speak in public and whenever he did appear he confined his remarks within the smallest possible limits furthermore lincoln was not a reader speaker and rarely did himself justice without careful preparation  writers on lincoln have failed to note the severe criticisms upon lincolns impromptu remarks that appeared in the opposition press and in the english newspapers  even as late as 1863 newspaper writers not opposed to him did not hesitate to refer to the plainness of the presidents public speaking  the messages to congress are distinguished from most documents of that class by their frequent purple patches  to the enumeration of dry facts furnished by the various departments they add an elevation and breadth of thought of the first order  in a class by themselves are the various proclamations some of them of a purely formal character such as those announcing blockades others of a distinctly literary character like the announcements of fasts and feasts  midway between these two classes is the most important of all the emancipation proclamation of january 1 1863 which with the exception of the concluding sentence is entirely free from ornament perhaps lincoln felt here as with the debates that the occasion was too serious not only for jesting but even for attempting the mere graces of language  finally mention should be made of the letters and telegrams written by president lincoln  although many letters have been preserved from earlier times none make special claims to attention outside of the information that they furnish  but during the last four years of his life lincoln wrote some of the most beautiful letters that have ever been composed  one of these the letter to mrs bixby has been given a place on the walls of one of the oxford colleges as a model of noble english  the conkling letter and the letter to horace greeley are among the most important statements of lincolns policy and are really short political tracts  the first inaugural can be traced through the cooper union address and the lincolndouglas debates the peoria speech and the speeches of 1854 to the seed of 1832 the plain logical direct statement of principles of lincolns first address to the public  the development of the gettysburg address and the second inaugural those supreme expressions of lincolns feelings is not in the main to be traced through complete speeches but it must be sought for in isolated passages when he left logic for the moment and gave himself up to the passing emotion  the real seed of the majestic simplicity of those addresses is perhaps to be found in those rhetorical speeches of an early period so lacking apparently in the qualities that we love and admire  in writing as in so many other things we reap not what we sow but its fruition  the effect may seem very remotely related to the cause but he would be a fool who would deny the relation between them     bibliographical note  the complete works of abraham lincoln have been compiled and edited by his biographers john g nicolay

fellowcitizens having become a candidate for the honorable office of one of your representatives in the next general assembly of this state in accordance with an established custom and the principles of true republicanism it becomes my duty to make known to youthe people whom i propose to representmy sentiments with regard to local affairs  time and experience have verified to a demonstration the public utility of internal improvements  that the poorest and most thinly populated countries would be greatly benefited by the opening of good roads and in the clearing of navigable streams within their limits is what no person will deny  but yet it is folly to undertake works of this or any other kind without first knowing that we are able to finish themas half finished work generally proves to be labor lost there cannot justly be any objection to having railroads and canals any more than to other good things provided they cost nothing  the only objection is to paying for them and the objection to paying arises from the want of ability to pay  with respect to the county of sangamon some more easy means of communication than we now possess for the purpose of facilitating the task of exporting the surplus products of its fertile soil and importing necessary articles from abroad are indispensably necessary a meeting has been held of the citizens of jacksonville and the adjacent country for the purpose of deliberating and enquiring into the expediency of constructing a railroad from some eligible point on the illinois river through the town of jacksonville in morgan county to the town of springfield in sangamon county  this is indeed a very desirable object  no other improvement that reason will justify us in hoping for can equal in utility the railroad  it is a never failing source of communication between places of business remotely situated from each other  upon the railroad the regular progress of commercial intercourse is not interrupted by either high or low water or freezing weather which are the principal difficulties that render our future hopes of water communication precarious and uncertain  yet however desirable an object the construction of a railroad through our country may be however high our imaginations may be heated at thoughts of itthere is always a heart appalling shock accompanying the account of its cost which forces us to shrink from our pleasing anticipations the probable cost of this contemplated railroad is estimated at 290000the bare statement of which in my opinion is sufficient to justify the belief that the improvement of the sangamon river is an object much better suited to our infant resources  respecting this view i think i may say without the fear of being contradicted that its navigation may be rendered completely practicable as high as the mouth of the south fork or probably higher to vessels of from 25 to 30 tons burthen for at least one half of all common years and to vessels of much greater burthen a part of that time  from my peculiar circumstances it is probable that for the last twelve months i have given as particular attention to the stage of the water in this river as any other person in the country  in the month of march 1831 in company with others i commenced the building of a flatboat on the sangamon and finished and took her out in the course of the spring  since that time i have been concerned in the mill at new salem  these circumstances are sufficient evidence that i have not been very inattentive to the stages of the waterthe time at which we crossed the milldam being in the last days of april the water was lower than it had been since the breaking of winter in february or than it was for several weeks after  the principal difficulties we encountered in descending the river were from the drifted timber which obstructions all know is not difficult to be removed  knowing almost precisely the height of water at that time i believe i am safe in saying that it has as often been higher as lower since  from this view of the subject it appears that my calculations with regard to the navigation of the sangamon cannot be unfounded in reason but whatever may be its natural advantages certain it is that it never can be practically useful to any great extent without being greatly improved by art  the drifted timber as i have before mentioned is the most formidable barrier to this object  of all parts of this river none will require so much labor in proportion to make it navigable as the last thirty or thirtyfive miles and going with the meanderings of the channel when we are this distance above its mouth we are only between twelve and eighteen miles above beardstown in something near a straight direction and this route is upon such low ground as to retain water in many places during the season and in all parts such as to draw twothirds or threefourths of the river water at all stages  this route is up on prairieland the whole distanceso that it appears to me by removing the turf a sufficient width and damming up the old channel the whole river in a short time would wash its way through thereby curtailing the distance and increasing the velocity of the current very considerably while there would be no timber upon the banks to obstruct its navigation in future and being nearly straight the timber which might float in at the head would be apt to go clear through  there are also many places above this where the river in its zigzag course forms such complete peninsulas as to be easier cut through at the necks than to remove the obstructions from the bendswhich if done would also lessen the distance  what the cost of this work would be i am unable to say  it is probable however that it would not be greater than is common to streams of the same length  finally i believe the improvement of the sangamon river to be vastly important and highly desirable to the improvement of the county and if elected any measure in the legislature having this for its object which may appear judicious will meet my approbation and shall receive my support  it appears that the practice of loaning money at exorbitant rates of interest has already been opened as a field for discussion so i suppose i may enter upon it without claiming the honor or risking the danger which may await its first explorer  it seems as though we are never to have an end to this baneful and corroding system acting almost as prejudicial to the general interests of the community as a direct tax of several thousand dollars annually laid on each county for the benefit of a few individuals only unless there be a law made setting a limit to the rates of usury  a law for this purpose i am of opinion may be made without materially injuring any class of people in cases of extreme necessity there could always be means found to cheat the law while in all other cases it would have its intended effect  i would not favor the passage of a law upon this subject which might be very easily evaded  let it be such that the labor and difficulty of evading it could only be justified in cases of greatest necessity  upon the subject of education not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it i can only say that i view it as the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in  that every man may receive at least a moderate education and thereby be enabled to read the history of his own and other countries by which he may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions appears to be an object of vital importance even on this account alone to say nothing of the advantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read the scriptures and other works both of a religious and moral nature for themselves  for my part i desire to see the time when education and by its means morality sobriety enterprise and industry shall become much more general than at present and should be gratified to have it in my power to contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might have a tendency to accelerate the happy period  with regard to existing laws some alterations are thought to be necessary  many respectable men have suggested that our estray lawsthe law respecting the issuing of executions the road law and some others are deficient in their present form and require alterations  but considering the great probability that the framers of those laws were wiser than myself i should prefer not meddling with them unless they were first attacked by others in which case i should feel it both a privilege and a duty to take that stand which in my view might tend most to the advancement of justice  but fellowcitizens i shall concludeconsidering the great degree of modesty which should always attend youth it is probable i have already been more presuming than becomes me  however upon the subjects of which i have treated i have spoken as i thought  i may be wrong in regard to any or all of them but holding it a sound maxim that it is better to be only sometimes right than at all times wrong so soon as i discover my opinions to be erroneous i shall be ready to renounce them  every man is said to have his peculiar ambition  whether it be true or not i can say for one that i have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men by rendering myself worthy of their esteem  how far i shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be developed  i am young and unknown to many of you  i was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life  i have no wealthy or popular relations to recommend me  my case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of this county and if elected they will have conferred a favor upon me for which i shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate  but if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background i have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined    your friend and fellowcitizen             a lincoln    new salem march 9 1832     the perpetuation of our political institutions january 27 1837  in the great journal of things happening under the sun we the american people find our account running under date of the nineteenth century of the christian erawe find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth as regards extent of territory fertility of soil and salubrity of climate  we find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which the history of former times tells us  we when mounting the stage of existence found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings  we toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of themthey are a legacy bequeathed us by a once hardy brave and patriotic but now lamented and departed race of ancestors theirs was the task and nobly they performed it to possess themselves and through themselves us of this goodly land and to uprear upon its hills and its valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights tis ours only to transmit these the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader the latter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpationto the latest generation that fate shall permit the world to know  this task gratitude to our fathers justice to ourselves duty to posterity and love for our species in general all imperatively require us faithfully to perform  how then shall we perform itat what point shall we expect the approach of danger  by what means shall we fortify against it  shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow  neverall the armies of europe asia and africa combined with all the treasure of the earth our own excepted in their military chest with a buonaparte for a commander could not by force take a drink from the ohio or make a track on the blue ridge in a trial of a thousand years  at what point then is the approach of danger to be expected  i answer if it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us  it cannot come from abroad  if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher  as a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide  i hope i am over wary but if i am not there is even now something of ill omen amongst us  i mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice  this disposition is awfully fearful in any community and that it now exists in ours though grating to our feelings to admit it would be a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny  accounts of outrages committed by mobs form the everyday news of the times they have pervaded the country from new england to louisianathey are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former nor the burning suns of the latter they are not the creature of climate neither are they confined to the slaveholding or the nonslaveholding states alike they spring up among the pleasurehunting masters of southern slaves and the orderloving citizens of the land of steady habitswhatever then their cause may be it is common to the whole country  it would be tedious as well as useless to recount the horrors of all of them  those happening in the state of mississippi and at st louis are perhaps the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity in the mississippi case they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblersa set of men certainly not following for a livelihood a very useful or very honest occupation but one which so far from being forbidden by the laws was actually licensed by an act of the legislature passed but a single year before  next negroes suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection were caught up and hanged in all parts of the state then white men supposed to be leagued with the negroes and finally strangers from neighboring states going thither on business were in many instances subjected to the same fate  thus went on this process of hanging from gamblers to negroes from negroes to white citizens and from these to strangers till dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every roadside and in numbers almost sufficient to rival the native spanish moss of the country as a drapery of the forest  turn then to that horrorstriking scene at st louis  a single victim only was sacrificed there  this story is very short and is perhaps the most highly tragic of anything of its length that has ever been witnessed in real life  a mulatto man by the name of mcintosh was seized in the street dragged to the suburbs of the city chained to a tree and actually burned to death and all within a single hour from the time he had been a freeman attending to his own business and at peace with the world  such are the effects of mob law and such are the scenes becoming more and more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and order and the stories of which have even now grown too familiar to attract anything more than an idle remark  but you are perhaps ready to ask what has this to do with the perpetuation of our political institutions  i answer it has much to do with it  its direct consequences are comparatively speaking but a small evil and much of its danger consists in the proneness of our minds to regard its direct as its only consequences  abstractly considered the hanging of the gamblers at vicksburg was of but little consequence  they constitute a portion of population that is worse than useless in any community and their death if no pernicious example be set by it is never matter of reasonable regret with any one  if they were annually swept from the stage of existence by the plague or smallpox honest men would perhaps be much profited by the operationsimilar too is the correct reasoning in regard to the burning of the negro at st louis  he had forfeited his life by the perpetration of an outrageous murder upon one of the most worthy and respectable citizens of the city and had he not died as he did he must have died by the sentence of the law in a very short time afterwards  as to him alone it was as well the way it was as it could otherwise have been  but the example in either case was fearful  when men take it in their heads today to hang gamblers or burn murderers they should recollect that in the confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely to hang or burn some one who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one who is and that acting upon the example they set the mob of tomorrow may and probably will hang or burn some of them by the very same mistake  and not only so the innocent those who have ever set their faces against violations of law in every shape alike with the guilty fall victims to the ravages of mob law and thus it goes on step by step till all the walls erected for the defence of the persons and property of individuals are trodden down and disregarded  but all this even is not the full extent of the evil  by such examples by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished the lawless in spirit are encouraged to become lawless in practice and having been used to no restraint but dread of punishment they thus become absolutely unrestrained  having ever regarded government as their deadliest bane they make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations and pray for nothing so much as its total annihilation  while on the other hand good men men who love tranquillity who desire to abide by the laws and enjoy their benefits who would gladly spill their blood in the defence of their country seeing their property destroyed their families insulted and their lives endangered their persons injured and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better become tired of and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection and are not much averse to a change in which they imagine they have nothing to lose thus then by the operation of this mobocratic spirit which all must admit is now abroad in the land the strongest bulwark of any government and particularly of those constituted like ours may effectually be broken down and destroyedi mean the attachment of the people  whenever this effect shall be produced among us whenever the vicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands and burn churches ravage and rob provisionstores throw printingpresses into rivers shoot editors and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity depend on it this government cannot last  by such things the feelings of the best citizens will become more or less alienated from it and thus it will be left without friends or with too few and those few too weak to make their friendship effectual  at such a time and under such circumstances men of sufficient talent and ambition will not be wanting to seize the opportunity strike the blow and overturn that fair fabric which for the last half century as been the fondest hope of the lovers of freedom throughout the world  i know the american people are much attached to their government i know they would suffer much for its sake i know they would endure evils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for another  yet notwithstanding all this if the laws be continually despised and disregarded if their rights to be secure in their persons and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob the alienation of their affections from the government is the natural consequence and to that sooner or later it must come  here then is one point at which danger may be expected  the question recurs how shall we fortify against it  the answer is simple  let every american every lover of liberty every wellwisher to his posterity swear by the blood of the revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country and never to tolerate their violation by others  as the patriots of seventysix did to the support of the declaration of independence so to the support of the constitution and laws let every american pledge his life his property and his sacred honorlet every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father and to tear the charter of his own and his childrens liberty  let reverence for the laws be breathed by every american mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap let it be taught in schools in seminaries and in colleges let it be written in primers spelling books and in almanacs let it be preached from the pulpit proclaimed in legislative halls and enforced in courts of justice  and in short let it become the political religion of the nation and let the old and the young the rich and the poor the grave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars  while ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally or even very generally prevail throughout the nation vain will be every effort and fruitless every attempt to subvert our national freedom  when i so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws let me not be understood as saying there are no bad laws or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made  i mean to say no such thing  but i do mean to say that although bad laws if they exist should be repealed as soon as possible still they continue in force for the sake of example they should be religiously observed  so also in unprovided cases  if such arise let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay but till then let them if not too intolerable be borne with  there is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law  in any case that may arise as for instance the promulgation of abolitionism one of two positions is necessarily truethat is the thing is right within itself and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all good citizens or it is wrong and therefore proper to be prohibited by legal enactments and in neither case is the interposition of mob law either necessary justifiable or excusable  but it may be asked why suppose danger to our political institutions have we not preserved them for more than fifty years  and why may we not for fifty times as long  we hope there is no sufficient reason  we hope all dangers may be overcome but to conclude that no danger may ever arise would itself be extremely dangerous  there are now and will hereafter be many causes dangerous in their tendency which have not existed heretofore and which are not too insignificant to merit attention  that our government should have been maintained in its original form from its establishment until now is not much to be wondered at  it had many props to support it through that period which now are decayed and crumbled away  through that period it was felt by all to be an undecided experiment now it is understood to be a successful onethen all that sought celebrity and fame and distinction expected to find them in the success of that experiment  their all was staked upon it their destiny was inseparably linked with it  their ambition aspired to display before an admiring world a practical demonstration of the truth of a proposition which had hitherto been considered at best no better than problematicalnamely the capability of a people to govern themselves  if they succeeded they were to be immortalized their names were to be transferred to counties and cities and rivers and mountains and to be revered and sung toasted through all time  if they failed they were to be called knaves and fools and fanatics for a fleeting hour then to sink and be forgotten  they succeeded  the experiment is successful and thousands have won their deathless names in making it so  but the game is caught and i believe it is true that with the catching end the pleasures of the chase  this field of glory is harvested and the crop is already appropriated  but new reapers will arise and they too will seek a field  it is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true to suppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring up amongst us  and when they do they will as naturally seek the gratification of their ruling passion as others have done before them  the question then is can that gratification be found in supporting and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others  most certainly it cannot  many great and good men sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake may ever be found whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in congress a gubernatorial or a presidential chair but such belong not to the family of the lion or the tribe of the eagle  what think you these places would satisfy an alexander a caesar or a napoleon  never towering genius disdains a beaten path  it seeks regions hitherto unexplored  it sees no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others  it denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief  it scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor however illustrious  it thirsts and burns for distinction and if possible it will have it whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen  is it unreasonable then to expect that some man possessed of the loftiest genius coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch will at some time spring up among us  and when such a one does it will require the people to be united with each other attached to the government and laws and generally intelligent to successfully frustrate his designs  distinction will be his paramount object and although he would as willingly perhaps more so acquire it by doing good as harm yet that opportunity being past and nothing left to be done in the way of building up he would set boldly to the task of pulling down  here then is a probable case highly dangerous and such an one as could have well existed heretofore  another reason which once was but which to the same extent is now no more has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far i mean the powerful influence which the interesting scenes of the revolution had upon the passions of the people as distinguished from their judgment  by this influence the jealousy envy and avarice incident to our nature and so common to a state of peace prosperity and conscious strength were for the time in a great measure smothered and rendered inactive while the deeprooted principles of hate and the powerful motive of revenge instead of being turned against each other were directed exclusively against the british nation  and thus from the force of circumstances the basest principles of our nature were either made to lie dormant or to become the active agents in the advancement of the noblest of causesthat of establishing and maintaining civil and religious liberty  but this state of feeling must fade is fading has faded with the circumstances that produced it  i do not mean to say that the scenes of the revolution are now or ever will be entirely forgotten but that like everything else they must fade upon the memory of the world and grow more and more dim by the lapse of time  in history we hope they will be read of and recounted so long as the bible shall be read but even granting that they will their influence cannot be what it heretofore has been even then they cannot be so universally known nor so vividly felt as they were by the generation just gone to rest  at the close of that struggle nearly every adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes  the consequence was that of those scenes in the form of a husband a father a son or a brother a living history was to be found in every familya history bearing the indubitable testimonies of its own authenticity in the limbs mangled in the scars of wounds received in the midst of the very scenes relateda history too that could be read and understood alike by all the wise and the ignorant the learned and the unlearnedbut those histories are gone  they can be read no more forever  they were a fortress of strength but what invading foeman could never do the silent artillery of time has donethe levelling of its walls  they are gone  they were a forest of giant oaks but the allrestless hurricane has swept over them and left only here and there a lonely trunk despoiled of its verdure shorn of its foliage unshading and unshaded to murmur in a few more gentle breezes and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few more ruder storms then to sink and be no more  they were pillars of the temple of liberty and now that they have crumbled away that temple must fall unless we their descendants supply their places with other pillars hewn from the solid quarry of sober reason  passion has helped us but can do so no more  it will in future be our enemy  reasoncold calculating unimpassioned reasonmust furnish all the materials for our future support and defence  let those materials be moulded into general intelligence sound morality and in particular a reverence for the constitution and laws and that we improved to the last that we remained free to the last that we revered his name to the last that during his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass over or desecrate his restingplace shall be that which to learn the last trump shall awaken our washington  upon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest as the rock of its basis and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution the gates of hell shall not prevail against it     speech at springfield illinois june 16 1858  mr president and gentlemen of the convention if we could first know where we are and whither we are tending we could better judge what to do and how to do it  we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation  under the operation of that policy that agitation has not only not ceased but has constantly augmented  in my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed  a house divided against itself cannot stand  i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free  i do not expect the union to be dissolvedi do not expect the house to fallbut i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other  either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states old as well as newnorth as well as south  have we no tendency to the latter condition  let any one who doubts carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combinationpiece of machinery so to speakcompounded of the nebraska doctrine and the dred scott decision  let him consider not only what work the machinery is adapted to do and how well adapted but also let him study the history of its construction and trace if he can or rather fail if he can to trace the evidences of design and concert of action among its chief architects from the beginning  the new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the states by state constitutions and from most of the national territory by congressional prohibition  four days later commenced the struggle which ended in repealing that congressional prohibition  this opened all the national territory to slavery and was the first point gained  but so far congress only had acted and an indorsement by the people real or apparent was indispensable to save the point already gained and give chance for more  this necessity had not been overlooked but had been provided for as well as might be in the notable argument of squatter sovereignty otherwise called sacred right of selfgovernment which latter phrase though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this that if any one man choose to enslave another no third man shall be allowed to object  that argument was incorporated into the nebraska bill itself in the language which follows it being the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states then opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of squatter sovereignty and sacred right of selfgovernment  but said opposition members let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the territory may exclude slavery  not we said the friends of the measure and down they voted the amendment  while the nebraska bill was passing through congress a law case involving the question of a negros freedom by reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him first into a free state and then into a territory covered by the congressional prohibition and held him as a slave for a long time in each was passing through the united states circuit court for the district of missouri and both nebraska bill and lawsuit were brought to a decision in the same month of may 1854  the negros name was dred scott which name now designates the decision finally made in the case  before the then next presidential election the law case came to and was argued in the supreme court of the united states but the decision of it was deferred until after the election still before the election senator trumbull on the floor of the senate requested the leading advocate of the nebraska bill to state his opinion whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits and the latter answers that is a question for the supreme court  the election came  mr buchanan was elected and the indorsement such as it was secured  that was the second point gained  the indorsement however fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand votes and so perhaps was not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory  the outgoing president in his last annual message as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement  the supreme court met again did not announce their decision but ordered a reargument  the presidential inauguration came and still no decision of the court but the incoming president in his inaugural address fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forthcoming decision whatever it might be then in a few days came the decision  the reputed author of the nebraska bill finds an early occasion to make a speech at this capital indorseing the dred scott decision and vehemently denouncing all opposition to it  the new president too seizes the early occasion of the silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever been entertained  at length a squabble springs up between the president and the author of the nebraska bill on the mere question of fact whether the lecompton constitution was or was not in any just sense made by the people of kansas and in that quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote for the people and that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up  i do not understand his declaration that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up to be intended by him other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mindthe principle for which he declares he has suffered so much and is ready to suffer to the end  and well may he cling to that principle  if he has any parental feeling well may he cling to it  that principle is the only shred left of his original nebraska doctrine  under the dred scott decision squatter sovereignty squatted out of existence tumbled down like temporary scaffoldinglike the mould at the foundry served through one blast and fell back into loose sandhelped to carry an election and then was kicked to the winds  his late joint struggle with the republicans against the lecompton constitution involves nothing of the original nebraska doctrine  that struggle was made on a pointthe right of a people to make their own constitutionupon which he and the republicans have never differed  the several points of the dred scott decision in connection with senator douglass care not policy constitute the piece of machinery in its present state of advancement  this was the third point gained the working points of that machinery are  1 that no negro slave imported as such from africa and no descendant of such slave can ever be a citizen of any state in the sense of that term as used in the constitution of the united states this point is made in order to deprive the negro in every possible event of the benefit of that provision of the united states constitution which declares that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states  2 that subject to the constitution of the united states neither congress nor a territorial legislature can exclude slavery from any united states territory  this point is made in order that individual men may fill up the territories with slaves without danger of losing them as property and thus to enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the future  3 that whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free state makes him free as against the holder the united states courts will not decide but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave state the negro may be forced into by the master  this point is made not to be pressed immediately but if acquiesced in for a while and apparently indorsed by the people at an election then to sustain the logical conclusion that what dred scotts master might lawfully do with dred scott in the free state of illinois every other master may lawfully do with any other one or one thousand slaves in illinois or in any other free state  auxiliary to all this and working hand in hand with it the nebraska doctrine or what is left of it is to educate and mould public opinion at least northern public opinion not to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up  this shows exactly where we now are and partially also whither we are tending  it will throw additional light on the latter to go back and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated  several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were transpiring  the people were to be left perfectly free subject only to the constitution  what the constitution had to do with it outsiders could not then see  plainly enough now it was an exactly fitted niche for the dred scott decision to afterward come in and declare the perfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all  why was the amendment expressly declaring the right of the people voted down  plainly enough now the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the dred scott decision  why was the court decision held up  why even a senators individual opinion withheld till after the presidential election  plainly enough now the speaking out then would have damaged the perfectly free argument upon which the election was to be carried  why the outgoing presidents felicitation on the indorsement  why the delay of a reargument  why the incoming presidents advance exhortation in favor of the decision  these things look like the cautious patting and petting of a spirited horse preparatory to mounting him when it is dreaded that he may give the rider a fall  and why the hasty afterindorsement of the decision by the president and others  we cannot absolutely know that all these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert  but when we see a lot of framed timbers different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places and by different workmenstephen franklin roger and james for instanceand we see these timbers joined together and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places and not a piece too many or too few not omitting even scaffoldingor if a single piece be lacking we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece inin such a case we find it impossible not to believe that stephen and franklin and roger and james all understood one another from the beginning and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the first blow was struck  it should not be overlooked that by the nebraska bill the people of a state as well as territory were to be left perfectly free subject only to the constitution  why mention a state  they were legislating for territories and not for or about states  certainly the people of a state are and ought to be subject to the constitution of the united states but why is mention of this lugged into this merely territorial law  why are the people of a territory and the people of a state therein lumped together and their relation to the constitution therein treated as being precisely the same  while the opinion of the court by chief justice taney in the dred scott case and the separate opinions of all the concurring judges expressly declare that the constitution of the united states neither permits congress nor a territorial legislature to exclude slavery from any united states territory they all omit to declare whether or not the same constitution permits a state or the people of a state to exclude it possibly this is a mere omission but who can be quite sure if mclean or curtis had sought to get into the opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a state to exclude slavery from their limits just as chase and mace sought to get such declaration in behalf of the people of a territory into the nebraska billi ask who can be quite sure that it would not have been voted down in the one case as it had been in the other  the nearest approach to the point of declaring the power of a state over slavery is made by judge nelson  he approaches it more than once using the precise idea and almost the language too of the nebraska act  on one occasion his exact language is except in cases where the power is restrained by the constitution of the united states the law of the state is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction  in what cases the power of the states is so restrained by the united states constitution is left an open question precisely as the same question as to the restraint on the power of the territories was left open in the nebraska act  put this and that together and we have another nice little niche which we may ere long see filled with another supreme court decision declaring that the constitution of the united states does not permit a state to exclude slavery from its limits  and this may especially be expected if the doctrine of care not whether slavery be voted down or voted up shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintained when made  such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all the states  welcome or unwelcome such decision is probably coming and will soon be upon us unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be met and overthrown  we shall lie down pleasantly dreaming that the people of missouri are on the verge of making their state free and we shall awake to the reality instead that the supreme court has made illinois a slave state  to meet and overthrow the power of that dynasty is the work now before all those who would prevent that consummation  that is what we have to do  how can we best do it  there are those who denounce us openly to their own friends and yet whisper us softly that senator douglas is the aptest instrument there is with which to effect that object  they wish us to infer all from the fact that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point upon which he and we have never differed  they remind us that he is a great man and that the largest of us are very small ones  let this be granted  but a living dog is better than a dead lion  judge douglas if not a dead lion for this work is at least a caged and toothless one  how can he oppose the advances of slavery  he dont care anything about it  his avowed mission is impressing the public heart to care nothing about it  a leading douglas democratic newspaper thinks douglass superior talent will be needed to resist the revival of the african slavetrade  does douglas believe an effort to revive that trade is approaching  he has not said so  does he really think so  but if it is how can he resist it  for years he has labored to prove it a sacred right of white men to take negro slaves into the new territories  can he possibly show that it is less a sacred right to buy them where they can be bought cheapest  and unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in africa than in virginia he has done all in his power to reduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right of property and as such how can he oppose the foreign slavetradehow can he refuse that trade in that property shall be perfectly freeunless he does it as a protection to the home production  and as the home producers will probably not ask the protection he will be wholly without a ground of opposition  senator douglas holds we know that a man may rightfully be wiser today than he was yesterdaythat he may rightfully change when he finds himself wrong  but can we for that reason run ahead and infer that he will make any particular change of which he himself has given no intimation  can we safely base our action upon any such vague inference  now as ever i wish not to misrepresent judge douglass position question his motives or do aught that can be personally offensive to him  whenever if ever he and we can come together on principle so that our great cause may have assistance from his great ability i hope to have interposed no adventitious obstacle  but clearly he is not now with ushe does not pretend to behe does not promise ever to be  our cause then must be intrusted to and conducted by its own undoubted friendsthose whose hands are free whose hearts are in the work who do care for the result  two years ago the republicans of the nation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong  we did this under the single impulse of resistance to a common danger with every external circumstance against us  of strange discordant and even hostile elements we gathered from the four winds and formed and fought the battle through under the constant hot fire of a disciplined proud and pampered enemy  did we brave all then to falter nownow when that same enemy is wavering dissevered and belligerent  the result is not doubtful  we shall not failif we stand firm we shall not fail  wise counsels may accelerate or mistakes delay it but sooner or later the victory is sure to come     second joint debate at freeport august 27 1858  ladies and gentlemen on saturday last judge douglas and myself first met in public discussion  he spoke one hour i an hour and a half and he replied for half an hour  the order is now reversed  i am to speak an hour he an hour and a half and then i am to reply for half an hour  i propose to devote myself during the first hour to the scope of what was brought within the range of his halfhour speech at ottawa of course there was brought within the scope of that halfhours speech something of his own opening speech  in the course of that opening argument judge douglas proposed to me seven distinct interrogatories  in my speech of an hour and a half i attended to some other parts of his speech and incidentally as i thought answered one of the interrogatories then  i then distinctly intimated to him that i would answer the rest of his interrogatories on condition only that he should agree to answer as many for me  he made no intimation at the time of the proposition nor did he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine  i do him no injustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply in dealing with me as though i had refused to answer his interrogatories  i now propose that i will answer any of the interrogatories upon condition that he will answer questions from me not exceeding the same number  i give him an opportunity to respond  the judge remains silent  i now say that i will answer his interrogatories whether he answers mine or not and that after i have done so i shall propound mine to him  i have supposed myself since the organization of the republican party at bloomington in may 1856 bound as a party man by the platforms of the party then and since  if in any interrogatories which i shall answer i go beyond the scope of what is within these platforms it will be perceived that no one is responsible but myself  having said thus much i will take up the judges interrogatories as i find them printed in the chicago times and answer them seriatim in order that there may be no mistake about it i have copied the interrogatories in writing and also my answers to them  the first one of these interrogatories is in these words  question 1  i desire to know whether lincoln today stands as he did in 1854 in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave law  answer  i do not now nor ever did stand in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave law  q 2  i desire him to answer whether he stands pledged today as he did in 1854 against the admission of any more slave states into the union even if the people want them  a  i do not now nor ever did stand pledged against the admission of any more slave states into the union  q 3  i want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of a new state into the union with such a constitution as the people of that state may see fit to make  a  i do not stand pledged against the admission of a new state into the union with such a constitution as the people of that state may see fit to make  q 4  i want to know whether he stands today pledged to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia  a  i do not stand today pledged to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia  q 5  i desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the prohibition of the slavetrade between the different states  a  i do not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slavetrade between the different states  q 6  i desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in all the territories of the united states north as well as south of the missouri compromise line  a  i am impliedly if not expressly pledged to a belief in the right and duty of congress to prohibit slavery in all the united states territories  q 7  i desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein  a  i am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of territory and in any given case i would or would not oppose such acquisition accordingly as i might think such acquisition would or would not aggravate the slavery question among ourselves  now my friends it will be perceived upon an examination of these questions and answers that so far i have only answered that i was not pledged to this that or the other  the judge has not framed his interrogatories to ask me anything more than this and i have answered in strict accordance with the interrogatories and have answered truly that i am not pledged at all upon any of the points to which i have answered  but i am not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatory  i am really disposed to take up at least some of these questions and state what i really think upon them  as to the first one in regard to the fugitive slave law i have never hesitated to say and i do not now hesitate to say that i think under the constitution of the united states the people of the southern states are entitled to a congressional fugitive slave law  having said that i have had nothing to say in regard to the existing fugitive slave law further than that i think it should have been framed so as to be free from some of the objections that pertain to it without lessening its efficiency  and inasmuch as we are now not in an agitation in regard to an alteration or modification of that law i would not be the man to introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general question of slavery  in regard to the other question of whether i am pledged to the admission of any more slave states into the union i state to you very frankly that i would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to pass upon that question  i should be exceedingly glad to know that there would never be another slave state admitted into the union but i must add that if slavery shall be kept out of the territories during the territorial existence of any one given territory and then the people shall having a fair chance and a clear field when they come to adopt the constitution do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave constitution uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them i see no alternative if we own the country but to admit them into the union  the third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the second it being as i conceive the same as the second  the fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia  in relation to that i have my mind very distinctly made up  i should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the district of columbia  i believe that congress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it  yet as a member of congress i should not with my present views be in favor of endeavoring to abolish slavery in the district of columbia unless it would be upon these conditions first that the abolition should be gradual second that it should be on a vote of the majority of qualified voters in the district and third that compensation should be made to unwilling owners  with these three conditions i confess i would be exceedingly glad to see congress abolish slavery in the district of columbia and in the language of henry clay sweep from our capital that foul blot upon our nation  in regard to the fifth interrogatory i must say here that as to the question of the abolition of the slavetrade between the different states i can truly answer as i have that i am pledged to nothing about it  it is a subject to which i have not given that mature consideration that would make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely bound by it  in other words that question has never been prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really have the constitutional power to do it  i could investigate it if i had sufficient time to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject but i have not done so and i say so frankly to you here and to judge douglas  i must say however that if i should be of opinion that congress does possess the constitutional power to abolish the slavetrade among the different states i should still not be in favor of the exercise of that power unless upon some conservative principle as i conceive it akin to what i have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia  my answer as to whether i desire that slavery should be prohibited in all the territories of the united states is full and explicit within itself and cannot be made clearer by any comments of mine  so i suppose in regard to the question whether i am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein my answer is such that i could add nothing by way of illustration or making myself better understood than the answer which i have placed in writing  now in all this the judge has me and he has me on the record  i suppose he had flattered himself that i was really entertaining one set of opinions for one place and another set for another placethat i was afraid to say at one place what i uttered at another  what i am saying here i suppose i say to a vast audience as strongly tending to abolitionism as any audience in the state of illinois and i believe i am saying that which if it would be offensive to any persons and render them enemies to myself would be offensive to persons in this audience  i now proceed to propound to the judge the interrogatories so far as i have framed them  i will bring forward a new instalment when i get them ready  i will bring them forward now only reaching to number four  the first one is  question 1  if the people of kansas shall by means entirely unobjectionable in all other respects adopt a state constitution and ask admission into the union under it before they have the requisite number of inhabitants according to the english billsome ninetythree thousandwill you vote to admit them  q 2  can the people of a united states territory in any lawful way against the wish of any citizen of the united states exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution  q 3  if the supreme court of the united states shall decide that states cannot exclude slavery from their limits are you in favor of acquiescing in adopting and following such decision as a rule of political action  q 4  are you in favor of acquiring additional territory in disregard of how such acquisition may affect the nation on the slavery question  as introductory to these interrogatories which judge douglas propounded to me at ottawa he read a set of resolutions which he said judge trumbull and myself had participated in adopting in the first republican state convention held at springfield in october 1854  he insisted that i and judge trumbull and perhaps the entire republican party were responsible for the doctrines contained in the set of resolutions which he read and i understand that it was from that set of resolutions that he deduced the interrogatories which he propounded to me using these resolutions as a sort of authority for propounding those questions to me  now i say here today that i do not answer his interrogatories because of their springing at all from that set of resolutions which he read  i answered them because judge douglas thought fit to ask them  i do not now nor ever did recognize any responsibility upon myself in that set of resolutions  when i replied to him on that occasion i assured him that i never had anything to do with them  i repeat here today that i never in any possible form had anything to do with that set of resolutions  it turns out i believe that those resolutions were never passed at any convention held in springfield  it turns out that they were never passed at any convention or any public meeting that i had any part in  i believe it turns out in addition to all this that there was not in the fall of 1854 any convention holding a session in springfield calling itself a republican state convention yet it is true there was a convention or assemblage of men calling themselves a convention at springfield that did pass some resolutions  but so little did i really know of the proceedings of that convention or what set of resolutions they had passed though having a general knowledge that there had been such an assemblage of men there that when judge douglas read the resolutions i really did not know but that they had been the resolutions passed then and there  i did not question that they were the resolutions adopted  for i could not bring myself to suppose that judge douglas could say what he did upon this subject without knowing that it was true  i contented myself on that occasion with denying as i truly could all connection with them not denying or affirming whether they were passed at springfield  now it turns out that he had got hold of some resolutions passed at some convention or public meeting in kane county  i wish to say here that i dont conceive that in any fair and just mind this discovery relieves me at all  i had just as much to do with the convention in kane county as that at springfield  i am just as much responsible for the resolutions at kane county as those at springfield the amount of the responsibility being exactly nothing in either case no more than there would be in regard to a set of resolutions passed in the moon  i allude to this extraordinary matter in this canvass for some further purpose than anything yet advanced  judge douglas did not make his statement upon that occasion as matters that he believed to be true but he stated them roundly as being true in such form as to pledge his veracity for their truth  when the whole matter turns out as it does and when we consider who judge douglas isthat he is a distinguished senator of the united states that he has served nearly twelve years as such that his character is not at all limited as an ordinary senator of the united states but that his name has become of worldwide renownit is most extraordinary that he should so far forget all the suggestions of justice to an adversary or of prudence to himself as to venture upon the assertion of that which the slightest investigation would have shown him to be wholly false  i can only account for his having done so upon the supposition that that evil genius which has attended him through his life giving to him an apparent astonishing prosperity such as to lead very many good men to doubt there being any advantage in virtue over vicei say i can only account for it on the supposition that that evil genius has at last made up its mind to forsake him  and i may add that another extraordinary feature of the judges conduct in this canvassmade more extraordinary by this incidentis that he is in the habit in almost all the speeches he makes of charging falsehood upon his adversaries myself and others  i now ask whether he is able to find in anything that judge trumbull for instance has said or in anything that i have said a justification at all compared with what we have in this instance for that sort of vulgarity  i have been in the habit of charging as a matter of belief on my part that in the introduction of the nebraska bill into congress there was a conspiracy to make slavery perpetual and national  i have arranged from time to time the evidence which establishes and proves the truth of this charge  i recurred to this charge at ottawa  i shall not now have time to dwell upon it at very great length but inasmuch as judge douglas in his reply of half an hour made some points upon me in relation to it i propose noticing a few of them  the judge insists that in the first speech i made in which i very distinctly made that charge he thought for a good while i was in funthat i was playfulthat i was not sincere about itand that he only grew angry and somewhat excited when he found that i insisted upon it as a matter of earnestness  he says he characterized it as a falsehood as far as i implicated his moral character in that transaction  well i did not know till he presented that view that i had implicated his moral character  he is very much in the habit when he argues me up into a position i never thought of occupying of very cozily saying he has no doubt lincoln is conscientious in saying so he should remember that i did not know but what he was altogether conscientious in that matter  i can conceive it possible for men to conspire to do a good thing and i really find nothing in judge douglass course of arguments that is contrary to or inconsistent with his belief of a conspiracy to nationalize and spread slavery as being a good and blessed thing and so i hope he will understand that i do not at all question but that in all this matter he is entirely conscientious  but to draw your attention to one of the points i made in this case beginning at the beginning  when the nebraska bill was introduced or a short time afterward by an amendment i believe it was provided that it must be considered the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any state or territory or to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their own domestic institutions in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states  i have called his attention to the fact that when he and some others began arguing that they were giving an increased degree of liberty to the people in the territories over and above what they formerly had on the question of slavery a question was raised whether the law was enacted to give such unconditional liberty to the people and to test the sincerity of this mode of argument mr chase of ohio introduced an amendment in which he made the lawif the amendment were adoptedexpressly declare that the people of the territory should have the power to exclude slavery if they saw fit  i have asked attention also to the fact that judge douglas and those who acted with him voted that amendment down notwithstanding it expressed exactly the thing they said was the true intent and meaning of the law  i have called attention to the fact that in subsequent times a decision of the supreme court has been made in which it has been declared that a territorial legislature has no constitutional right to exclude slavery  and i have argued and said that for men who did intend that the people of the territory should have the right to exclude slavery absolutely and unconditionally the voting down of chases amendment is wholly inexplicable  it is a puzzlea riddle  but i have said that with men who did look forward to such a decision or who had it in contemplation that such a decision of the supreme court would or might be made the voting down of that amendment would be perfectly rational and intelligible  it would keep congress from coming in collision with the decision when it was made  anybody can conceive that if there was an intention or expectation that such a decision was to follow it would not be a very desirable party attitude to get into for the supreme courtall or nearly all its members belonging to the same partyto decide one way when the party in congress had decided the other way  hence it would be very rational for men expecting such a decision to keep the niche in that law clear for it  after pointing this out i tell judge douglas that it looks to me as though here was the reason why chases amendment was voted down  i tell him that as he did it and knows why he did it if it was done for a reason different from this he knows what that reason was and can tell us what it was  i tell him also it will be vastly more satisfactory to the country for him to give some other plausible intelligible reason why it was voted down than to stand upon his dignity and call people liars  well on saturday he did make his answer and what do you think it was  he says if i had only taken upon myself to tell the whole truth about that amendment of chases no explanation would have been necessary on his partor words to that effect  now i say here that i am quite unconscious of having suppressed anything material to the case and i am very frank to admit if there is any sound reason other than that which appeared to me material it is quite fair for him to present it  what reason does he propose  that when chase came forward with his amendment expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery from the limits of every territory general cass proposed to chase if he chase would add to his amendment that the people should have the power to introduce or exclude they would let it go  this is substantially all of his reply and because chase would not do that they voted his amendment down well it turns out i believe upon examination that general cass took some part in the little running debate upon that amendment and then ran away and did not vote on it at all  is not that the fact  so confident as i think was general cass that there was a snake somewhere about he chose to run away from the whole thing  this is an inference i draw from the fact that though he took part in the debate his name does not appear in the ayes and noes  but does judge douglass reply amount to a satisfactory answer  cries of yes yes and no no  there is some little difference of opinion here  but i ask attention to a few more views bearing on the question of whether it amounts to a satisfactory answer  the men who were determined that that amendment should not get into the bill and spoil the place where the dred scott decision was to come in sought an excuse to get rid of it somewhere  one of these waysone of these excuseswas to ask chase to add to his proposed amendment a provision that the people might introduce slavery if they wanted to  they very well knew chase would do no such thingthat mr chase was one of the men differing from them on the broad principle of his insisting that freedom was better than slaverya man who would not consent to enact a law penned with his own hand by which he was made to recognize slavery on the one hand and liberty on the other as precisely equal and when they insisted on his doing this they very well knew they insisted on that which he would not for a moment think of doing and that they were only bluffing him  i believei have not since he made his answer had a chance to examine the journals or congressional globe and therefore speak from memoryi believe the state of the bill at that time according to parliamentary rules was such that no member could propose an additional amendment to chases amendment  i rather think this the truththe judge shakes his head  very well  i would like to know then if they wanted chases amendment fixed over why somebody else could not have offered to do it  if they wanted it amended why did they not offer the amendment  why did they stand there taunting and quibbling at chase  why did they not put it in themselves  but to put it on the other ground suppose that there was such an amendment offered and chases was an amendment to an amendment until one is disposed of by parliamentary law you cannot pile another on  then all these gentlemen had to do was to vote chases on and then in the amended form in which the whole stood add their own amendment to it if they wanted to put it in that shape  this was all they were obliged to do and the ayes and noes show that there were thirtysix who voted it down against ten who voted in favor of it the thirtysix held entire sway and control  they could in some form or other have put that bill in the exact shape they wanted  if there was a rule preventing their amending it at the time they could pass that and then chases amendment being merged put it in the shape they wanted  they did not choose to do so but they went into a quibble with chase to get him to add what they knew he would not add and because he would not they stand upon that flimsy pretext for voting down what they argued was the meaning and intent of their own bill  they left room thereby for this dred scott decision which goes very far to make slavery national throughout the united states  i pass one or two points i have because my time will very soon expire but i must be allowed to say that judge douglas recurs again as he did upon one of two other occasions to the enormity of lincolnan insignificant individual like lincolnupon his ipse dixit charging a conspiracy upon a large number of members of congress the supreme court and two presidents to nationalize slavery  i want to say that in the first place i have made no charge of this sort upon my ipse dixit  i have only arrayed the evidence tending to prove it and presented it to the understanding of others saying what i think it proves but giving you the means of judging whether it proves it or not  this is precisely what i have done  i have not placed it upon my ipse dixit at all  on this occasion i wish to recall his attention to a piece of evidence which i brought forward at ottawa on saturday showing that he had made substantially the same charge against substantially the same persons excluding his dear self from the category  i ask him to give some attention to the evidence which i brought forward that he himself had discovered a fatal blow being struck against the right of the people to exclude slavery from their limits which fatal blow he assumed as in evidence in an article in the washington union published by authority  i ask by whose authority  he discovers a similar or identical provision in the lecompton constitution  made by whom  the framers of that constitution  advocated by whom  by all the members of the party in the nation who advocated the introduction of kansas into the union under the lecompton constitution  i have asked his attention to the evidence that he arrayed to prove that such a fatal blow was being struck and to the facts which he brought forward in support of that chargebeing identical with the one which he thinks so villainous in me  he pointed it not at a newspaper editor merely but at the president and his cabinet and the members of congress advocating the lecompton constitution and those framing that instrument  i must again be permitted to remind him that although my ipse dixit may not be as great as his yet it somewhat reduces the force of his calling my attention to the enormity of my making a like charge against him  go on judge douglas     the cooper institute address monday february 27 1860  mr president and fellowcitizens of new york the facts with which i shall deal this evening are mainly old and familiar nor is there anything new in the general use i shall make of them  if there shall be any novelty it will be in the mode of presenting the facts and the inferences and observations following that presentation  in his speech last autumn at columbus ohio as reported in the new york times senator douglas said   our fathers when they framed the government under which we live understood this question just as well and even better than we do now   i fully indorse this and i adopt it as a text for this discourse  i so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and agreed starting point for a discussion between republicans and that wing of the democracy headed by senator douglas  it simply leaves the inquiry  what was the understanding those fathers had of the question mentioned  what is the frame of government under which we live  the answer must be the constitution of the united states  that constitution consists of the original framed in 1787 and under which the present government first went into operation and twelve subsequently framed amendments the first ten of which were framed in 1789  who were our fathers that framed the constitution  i suppose the thirtynine who signed the original instrument may be fairly called our fathers who framed that part of the present government  it is almost exactly true to say they framed it and it is altogether true to say they fairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that time  their names being familiar to nearly all and accessible to quite all need not now be repeated  i take these thirtynine for the present as being our fathers who framed the government under which we live  what is the question which according to the text those fathers understood just as well and even better than we do now  it is this does the proper division of local from federal authority or anything in the constitution forbid our federal government to control as to slavery in our federal territories  upon this senator douglas holds the affirmative and republicans the negative  this affirmation and denial form an issue and this issuethis questionis precisely what the text declares our fathers understood better than we  let us now inquire whether the thirtynine or any of them ever acted upon this question and if they did how they acted upon ithow they expressed that better understanding  in 1784 three years before the constitution the united states then owning the northwestern territory and no other the congress of the confederation had before them the question of prohibiting slavery in that territory and four of the thirtynine who afterward framed the constitution were in that congress and voted on that question  of these roger sherman thomas mifflin and hugh williamson voted for the prohibition thus showing that in their understanding no line dividing local from federal authority nor anything else properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory  the other of the fourjames mchenryvoted against the prohibition showing that for some cause he thought it improper to vote for it  in 1787 still before the constitution but while the convention was in session framing it and while the northwestern territory still was the only territory owned by the united states the same question of prohibiting slavery in the territory again came before the congress of the confederation and three more of the thirtynine who afterward signed the constitution were in that congress and voted on the question  they were william blount william few and abraham baldwin and they all voted for the prohibitionthus showing that in their understanding no line dividing local from federal authority nor anything else properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory  this time the prohibition became a law being part of what is now well known as the ordinance of 87  the question of federal control of slavery in the territories seems not to have been directly before the convention which framed the original constitution and hence it is not recorded that the thirtynine or any of them while engaged on that instrument expressed any opinion on that precise question  in 1789 by the first congress which sat under the constitution an act was passed to enforce the ordinance of 87 including the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory  the bill for this act was reported by one of the thirtynine thomas fitzsimmons then a member of the house of representatives from pennsylvania  it went through all its stages without a word of opposition and finally passed both branches without ayes and nays which is equivalent to an unanimous passage  in this congress there were sixteen of the thirtynine fathers who framed the original constitution  they were john langdon nicholas gilman wm s johnson roger sherman robert morris thos fitzsimmons william few abraham baldwin rufus king william patterson george clymer richard bassett george read pierce butler daniel carroll and james madison  this shows that in their understanding no line dividing local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution properly forbade congress to prohibit slavery in the federal territory else both their fidelity to correct principle and their oath to support the constitution would have constrained them to oppose the prohibition  again george washington another of the thirtynine was then president of the united states and as such approved and signed the bill thus completing its validity as a law and thus showing that in his understanding no line dividing local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory  no great while after the adoption of the original constitution north carolina ceded to the federal government the country now constituting the state of tennessee and a few years later georgia ceded that which now constitutes the states of mississippi and alabama  in both deeds of cession it was made a condition by the ceding states that the federal government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country besides this slavery was then actually in the ceded country  under these circumstances congress on taking charge of these countries did not absolutely prohibit slavery within them  but they did interfere with ittake control of iteven there to a certain extent  in 1798 congress organized the territory of mississippi  in the act of organization they prohibited the bringing of slaves into the territory from any place without the united states by fine and giving freedom to slaves so brought  this act passed both branches of congress without yeas and nays  in that congress were three of the thirtynine who framed the original constitution  they were john langdon george read and abraham baldwin  they all probably voted for it  certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon record if in their understanding any line dividing local from federal authority or anything in the constitution properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory  in 1803 the federal government purchased the louisiana country  our former territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own states but this louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation  in 1804 congress gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitutes the state of louisiana  new orleans lying within that part was an old and comparatively large city  there were other considerable towns and settlements and slavery was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with the people  congress did not in the territorial act prohibit slavery but they did interfere with ittake control of itin a more marked and extensive way than they did in the case of mississippi  the substance of the provision therein made in relation to slaves was  first  that no slave should be imported into the territory from foreign parts  second  that no slave should be carried into it who had been imported into the united states since the first day of may 1798  third  that no slave should be carried into it except by the owner and for his own use as a settler the penalty in all the cases being a fine upon the violator of the law and freedom to the slave  this act also was passed without ayes and nays  in the congress which passed it there were two of the thirtynine  they were abraham baldwin and jonathan dayton  as stated in the case of mississippi it is probable they both voted for it  they would not have allowed it to pass without recording their opposition to it if in their understanding it violated either the line properly dividing local from federal authority or any provision of the constitution  in 181920 came and passed the missouri question  many votes were taken by yeas and nays in both branches of congress upon the various phases of the general question  two of the thirtyninerufus king and charles pinckneywere members of that congress  mr king steadily voted for slavery prohibition and against all compromises while mr pinckney as steadily voted against slavery prohibition and against all compromises  by this mr king showed that in his understanding no line dividing local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution was violated by congress prohibiting slavery in federal territory while mr pinckney by his votes showed that in his understanding there was some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case  the cases i have mentioned are the only acts of the thirtynine or of any of them upon the direct issue which i have been able to discover  to enumerate the persons who thus acted as being four in 1784 three in 1787 seventeen in 1789 three in 1798 two in 1804 and two in 181920 there would be thirty of them  but this would be counting john langdon roger sherman william few rufus king and george read each twice and abraham baldwin three times  the true number of those of the thirtynine whom i have shown to have acted upon the question which by the text they understood better than we is twentythree leaving sixteen not shown to have acted upon it in any way  here then we have twentythree out of our thirtynine fathers who framed the government under which we live who have upon their official responsibility and their corporal oaths acted upon the very question which the text affirms they understood just as well and even better than we do now and twentyone of thema clear majority of the whole thirtynineso acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety and wilful perjury if in their understanding any proper division between local and federal authority or anything in the constitution they had made themselves and sworn to support forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories  thus the twentyone acted and as actions speak louder than words so actions under such responsibility speak still louder  two of the twentythree voted against congressional prohibition of slavery in the federal territories in the instances in which they acted upon the question  but for what reasons they so voted is not known  they may have done so because they thought a proper division of local from federal authority or some provision or principle of the constitution stood in the way or they may without any such question have voted against the prohibition on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds of expediency  no one who has sworn to support the constitution can conscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional measure however expedient he may think it but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deems constitutional if at the same time he deems it inexpedient  it therefore would be unsafe to set down even the two who voted against the prohibition as having done so because in their understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or anything in the constitution forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory  the remaining sixteen of the thirtynine so far as i have discovered have left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of federal control of slavery in the federal territories  but there is much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appeared different from that of their twentythree compeers had it been manifested at all  for the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text i have purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any person however distinguished other than the thirtynine fathers who framed the original constitution and for the same reason i have also omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any of the thirtynine even on any other phase of the general question of slavery  if we should look into their acts and declarations on those other phases as the foreign slavetrade and the morality and policy of slavery generally it would appear to us that on the direct question of federal control of slavery in federal territories the sixteen if they had acted at all would probably have acted just as the twentythree did  among that sixteen were several of the most noted antislavery men of those timesas dr franklin alexander hamilton and gouverneur morriswhile there was not one now known to have been otherwise unless it may be john rutledge of south carolina  the sum of the whole is that of our thirtynine fathers who framed the original constitution twentyonea clear majority of the wholecertainly understood that no proper division of local from federal authority nor any part of the constitution forbade the federal government to control slavery in the federal territories while all the rest probably had the same understanding  such unquestionably was the understanding of our fathers who framed the original constitution and the text affirms that they understood the question better than we  but so far i have been considering the understanding of the question manifested by the framers of the original constitution  in and by the original instrument a mode was provided for amending it and as i have already stated the present frame of the government under which we live consists of that original and twelve amendatory articles framed and adopted since  those who now insist that federal control of slavery in federal territories violates the constitution point us to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates and i understand they all fix upon provisions in these amendatory articles and not in the original instrument  the supreme court in the dred scott case plant themselves upon the fifth amendment which provides that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law while senator douglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth amendment providing that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution are reserved to the states respectively or to the people  now it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first congress which sat under the constitutionthe identical congress which passed the act already mentioned enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory  not only was it the same congress but they were the identical same individual men who at the same session and at the same time within the session had under consideration and in progress toward maturity these constitutional amendments and this act prohibiting slavery in all the territory the nation then owned the constitutional amendments were introduced before and passed after the act enforcing the ordinance of 87 so that during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the ordinance the constitutional amendments were also pending  that congress consisting in all of seventysix members including sixteen of the framers of the original constitution as before stated were preeminently our fathers who framed that part of the government under which we live which is now claimed as forbidding the federal government to control slavery in the federal territories  is it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the two things which that congress deliberately framed and carried to maturity at the same time are absolutely inconsistent with each other and does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the other affirmation from the same mouth that those who did the two things alleged to be inconsistent understood whether they really were inconsistent better than webetter than he who affirms that they are inconsistent  it is surely safe to assume that the thirtynine framers of the original constitution and the seventysix members of the congress which framed the amendments thereto taken together do certainly include those who may be fairly called our fathers who framed the government under which we live  and so assuming i defy any man to show that any one of them ever in his whole life declared that in his understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories  i go a step further i defy any one to show that any living man in the whole world ever did prior to the beginning of the present century and i might almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century declare that in his understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories  to those who now so declare i give not only our fathers who framed the government under which we live but with them all other living men within the century in which it was framed among whom to search and they shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them  now and here let me guard a little against being misunderstood  i do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did  to do so would be to discard all the lights of current experienceto reject all progress all improvement  what i do say is that if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case we should do so upon evidence so conclusive and argument so clear that even their great authority fairly considered and weighed cannot stand and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question better than we  if any man at this day sincerely believes that a proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories he is right to say so and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can  but he has no right to mislead others who have less access to history and less leisure to study it into the false belief that our fathers who framed the government under which we live were of the same opinionthus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument  if any man at this day sincerely believes our fathers who framed the government under which we live used and applied principles in other cases which ought to have led them to understand that a proper division of local from federal authority or some part of the constitution forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories he is right to say so  but he should at the same time brave the responsibility of declaring that in his opinion he understands their principles better than they did themselves and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by asserting that they understood the question just as well and even better than we do now  but enough  let all who believe that our fathers who framed the government under which we live understood this question just as well and even better than we do now speak as they spoke and act as they acted upon it  this is all republicans askall republicans desirein relation to slavery  as those fathers marked it so let it be again marked as an evil not to be extended but to be tolerated and protected only because of and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity  let all the guaranties those fathers gave it be not grudgingly but fully and fairly maintained  for this republicans contend and with this so far as i know or believe they will be content  and now if they would listenas i suppose they will noti would address a few words to the southern people  i would say to them you consider yourselves a reasonable and a just people and i consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other people  still when you speak of us republicans you do so only to denounce us as reptiles or at the best as no better than outlaws  you will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers but nothing like it to black republicans  in all your contentions with one another each of you deems an unconditional condemnation of black republicanism as the first thing to be attended to  indeed such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisitelicense so to speakamong you to be admitted or permitted to speak at all  now can you or not be prevailed upon to pause and to consider whether this is quite just to us or even to yourselves  bring forward your charges and specifications and then be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify  you say we are sectional  we deny it  that makes an issue and the burden of proof is upon you  you produce your proof and what is it why that our party has no existence in your sectiongets no votes in your section  the fact is substantially true but does it prove the issue  if it does then in case we should without change of principle begin to get votes in your section we should thereby cease to be sectional  you cannot escape this conclusion and yet are you willing to abide by it  if you are you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional for we shall get votes in your section this very year  you will then begin to discover as the truth plainly is that your proof does not touch the issue  the fact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your making and not of ours  and if there be fault in that fact that fault is primarily yours and remains so until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice  if we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice the fault is ours but this brings you to where you ought to have startedto discussion of the right or wrong of our principle  if our principle put in practice would wrong your section for the benefit of ours or for any other object then our principle and we with it are sectional and are justly opposed and denounced as such  meet us then on the question of whether our principle put in practice would wrong your section and so meet us as if it were possible that something may be said on our side  do you accept the challenge  no then you really believe that the principle which our fathers who framed the government under which we live thought so clearly right as to adopt it and indorse it again and again upon their official oaths is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moments consideration  some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by washington in his farewell address  less than eight years before washington gave that warning he had as president of the united states approved and signed an act of congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory which act embodied the policy of the government upon that subject up to and at the very moment he penned that warning and about one year after he penned it he wrote lafayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure expressing in the same connection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free states  bearing this in mind and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject is that warning a weapon in your hands against us or in our hands against you  could washington himself speak would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us who sustain his policy or upon you who repudiate it  we respect that warning of washington and we commend it to you together with his example pointing to the right application of it  but you say you are conservativeeminently conservativewhile we are revolutionary destructive or something of the sort  what is conservatism  is it not adherence to the old and tried against the new and untried  we stick to contend for the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the government under which we live while you with one accord reject and scout and spit upon that old policy and insist upon substituting something new  true you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be  you are divided on new propositions and plans but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers  some of you are for reviving the foreign slavetrade some for a congressional slavecode for the territories some for congress forbidding the territories to prohibit slavery within their limits some for maintaining slavery in the territories through the judiciary some for the gurreat purrinciple that if one man would enslave another no third man should object fantastically called popular sovereignty but never a man among you is in favor of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territories according to the practice of our fathers who framed the government under which we live  not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our government originated consider then whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves and your charge of destructiveness against us are based on the most clear and stable foundations  again you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it formerly was  we deny it  we admit that it is more prominent but we deny that we made it so  it was not we but you who discarded the old policy of the fathers  we resisted and still resist your innovation and thence comes the greater prominence of the question  would you have that question reduced to its former proportions  go back to that old policy  what has been will be again under the same conditions if you would have the peace of the old times readopt the precepts and policy of the old times  you charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves  we deny it and what is your proof  harpers ferry  john brown  john brown was no republican and you have failed to implicate a single republican in his harpers ferry enterprise  if any member of our party is guilty in that matter you know it or you do not know it  if you do know it you are inexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact if you do not know it you are inexcusable to assert it and especially to persist in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof  you need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true is simply malicious slander  some of you admit that no republican designedly aided or encouraged the harpers ferry affair but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results  we do not believe it we know we hold no doctrine and make no declaration which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed the government under which we live  you never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair when it occurred some important state elections were near at hand and you were in evident glee with the belief that by charging the blame upon us you could get an advantage of us in those elections  the elections came and your expectations were not quite fulfilled  every republican man knew that as to himself at least your charge was a slander and he was not much inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor  republican doctrines and declarations are accompanied with a continual protest against any interference whatever with your slaves or with you about your slaves  surely this does not encourage them to revolt  true we do in common with our fathers who framed the government under which we live declare our belief that slavery is wrong but the slaves do not hear us declare even this  for anything we say or do the slaves would scarcely know there is a republican party  i believe they would not in fact generally know it but for your misrepresentations of us in their hearing  in your political contests among yourselves each faction charges the other with sympathy with black republicanism and then to give point to the charge defines black republicanism to simply be insurrection blood and thunder among the slaves  slave insurrections are no more common now than they were before the republican party was organized  what induced the southampton insurrection twentyeight years ago in which at least three times as many lives were lost as at harpers ferry  you can scarcely stretch your very elastic fancy to the conclusion that southampton was got up by black republicanism  in the present state of things in the united states i do not think a general or even a very extensive slave insurrection is possible  the indispensable concert of action cannot be obtained  the slaves have no means of rapid communication nor can incendiary freemen black or white supply it  the explosive materials are everywhere in parcels but there neither are nor can be supplied the indispensable connecting trains  much is said by southern people about the affection of slaves for their masters and mistresses and a part of it at least is true  a plot for an uprising could scarcely be devised and communicated to twenty individuals before some one of them to save the life of a favorite master or mistress would divulge it  this is the rule and the slave revolution in hayti was not an exception to it but a case occurring under peculiar circumstances  the gunpowder plot of british history though not connected with slaves was more in point  in that case only about twenty were admitted to the secret and yet one of them in his anxiety to save a friend betrayed the plot to that friend and by consequence averted the calamity  occasional poisonings from the kitchen and open or stealthy assassinations in the field and local revolts extending to a score or so will continue to occur as the natural results of slavery but no general insurrection of slaves as i think can happen in this country for a long time  whoever much fears or much hopes for such an event will be alike disappointed  in the language of mr jefferson uttered many years ago it is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably and in such slow degrees as that the evil will wear off insensibly and their places be pari passu filled up by free white laborers  if on the contrary it is left to force itself on human nature must shudder at the prospect held up  mr jefferson did not mean to say nor do i that the power of emancipation is in the federal government  he spoke of virginia and as to the power of emancipation i speak of the slaveholding states only  the federal government however as we insist has the power of restraining the extension of the institutionthe power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any american soil which is now free from slavery  john browns effort was peculiar  it was not a slave insurrection  it was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves in which the slaves refused to participate  in fact it was so absurd that the slaves with all their ignorance saw plainly enough it could not succeed  that affair in its philosophy corresponds with the many attempts related in history at the assassination of kings and emperors  an enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them  he ventures the attempt which ends in little else than in his own execution orsinis attempt on louis napoleon and john browns attempt at harpers ferry were in their philosophy precisely the same  the eagerness to cast blame on old england in the one case and on new england in the other does not disprove the sameness of the two things  and how much would it avail you if you could by the use of john brown helpers book and the like break up the republican organization  human action can be modified to some extent but human nature cannot be changed  there is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation which cast at least a million and a half of votes  you cannot destroy that judgment and feelingthat sentimentby breaking up the political organization which rallies around it  you can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire but if you could how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballotbox into some other channel  what would that other channel probably be  would the number of john browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation  but you will break up the union rather than submit to a denial of your constitutional rights  that has a somewhat reckless sound but it would be palliated if not fully justified were we proposing by the mere force of numbers to deprive you of some right plainly written down in the constitution but we are proposing no such thing  when you make these declarations you have a specific and well understood allusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into the federal territories and to hold them there as property  but no such right is specifically written in the constitution  that instrument is literally silent about any such right  we on the contrary deny that such a right has any existence in the constitution even by implication  your purpose then plainly stated is that you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and force the constitution as you please on all points in dispute between you and us  you will rule or ruin in all events  this plainly stated is your language  perhaps you will say the supreme court has decided the disputed constitutional question in your favor  not quite so  but waiving the lawyers distinction between dictum and decision the court has decided the question for you in a sort of way  the court has substantially said it is your constitutional right to take slaves into the federal territories and to hold them there as property  when i say the decision was made in a sort of way i mean it was made in a divided court by a bare majority of the judges and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of factthe statement in the opinion that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution  an inspection of the constitution will show that the right of property in a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in it  bear in mind the judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is impliedly affirmed in the constitution but they pledge their veracity that it is distinctly and expressly affirmed theredistinctly that is not mingled with anything elseexpressly that is in words meaning just that without the aid of any inference and susceptible of no other meaning  if they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is affirmed in the instrument by implication it would be open to others to show that neither the word slave nor slavery is to be found in the constitution nor the word property even in any connection with language alluding to the things slave or slavery and that wherever in that instrument the slave is alluded to he is called a person and wherever his masters legal right in relation to him is alluded to it is spoken of as service or labor which may be dueas a debt payable in service or labor  also it would be open to show by contemporaneous history that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery instead of speaking of them was employed on purpose to exclude from the constitution the idea that there could be property in man  to show all this is easy and certain  when this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement and reconsider the conclusion based upon it  and then it is to be remembered that our fathers who framed the government under which we livethe men who made the constitutiondecided this same constitutional question in our favor long ago decided it without a division among themselves when making the decision without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made and so far as any evidence is left without basing it upon any mistaken statement of facts  under all these circumstances do you really feel yourself justified to break up this government unless such a court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action  but you will not abide the election of a republican president  in that supposed event you say you will destroy the union and then you say the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us  that is cool  a highwayman holds a pistol to my ear and mutters through his teeth stand and deliver or i shall kill you and then you will be a murderer  to be sure what the robber demanded of memy moneywas my own and i had a clear right to keep it but it was no more my own than my vote is my own and the threat of death to me to extort my money and the threat of destruction to the union to extort my vote can scarcely be distinguished in principle  a few words now to republicans  it is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great confederacy shall be at peace and in harmony one with another  let us republicans do our part to have it so  even though much provoked let us do nothing through passion and ill temper even though the southern people will not so much as listen to us let us calmly consider their demands and yield to them if in our deliberate view of our duty we possibly can  judging by all they say and do and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us let us determine if we can what will satisfy them  will they be satisfied if the territories be unconditionally surrendered to them  we know they will not  in all their present complaints against us the territories are scarcely mentioned invasions and insurrections are the rage now  will it satisfy them if in the future we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections we know it will not  we so know because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation  the question recurs what will satisfy them  simply this we must not only let them alone but we must somehow convince them that we do let them alone  this we know by experience is no easy task  we have been so trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization but with no success  in all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone but this has had no tendency to convince them  alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them  these natural and apparently adequate means all failing what will convince them  this and this only cease to call slavery wrong and join them in calling it right  and this must be done thoroughlydone in acts as well as in words  silence will not be toleratedwe must place ourselves avowedly with them  senator douglass new sedition law must be enacted and enforced suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong whether made in politics in presses in pulpits or in private  we must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure  we must pull down our freestate constitutions  the whole atmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us  i am quite aware they do not state their case precisely in this way most of them would probably say to us let us alone do nothing to us and say what you please about slavery  but we do let them alonehave never disturbed themso that after all it is what we say which dissatisfies them  they will continue to accuse us of doing until we cease saying  i am also aware they have not as yet in terms demanded the overthrow of our freestate constitutions  yet those constitutions declare the wrong of slavery with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it and when all these other sayings shall have been silenced the overthrow of these constitutions will be demanded and nothing be left to resist the demand  it is nothing to the contrary that they do not demand the whole of this just now  demanding what they do and for the reason they do they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation  holding as they do that slavery is morally right and socially elevating they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition of it as a legal right and a social blessing  nor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction that slavery is wrong  if slavery is right all words acts laws and constitutions against it are themselves wrong and should be silenced and swept away  if it is right we cannot justly object to its nationalityits universality if it is wrong they cannot justly insist upon its extensionits enlargement  all they ask we could readily grant if we thought slavery right all we ask they could as readily grant if they thought it wrong  their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy  thinking it right as they do they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition as being right but thinking it wrong as we do can we yield to them  can we cast our votes with their view and against our own  in view of our moral social and political responsibilities can we do this  wrong as we think slavery is we can yet afford to let it alone where it is because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation but can we while our votes will prevent it allow it to spread into the national territories and to overrun us here in these free states  if our sense of duty forbids this then let us stand by our duty fearlessly and effectively  let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belaboredcontrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man such as a policy of dont care on a question about which all true men do care such as union appeals beseeching true union men to yield to disunionists reversing the divine rule and calling not the sinners but the righteous to repentance such as invocations to washington imploring men to unsay what washington said and undo what washington did  neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government nor of dungeons to ourselves  let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it    farewell address at springfield illinois february 12 1861  my friends no one not in my position can appreciate the sadness i feel at this parting  to this people i owe all that i am  here i have lived more than a quarter of a century here my children were born and here one of them lies buried  i know not how soon i shall see you again  a duty devolves upon me which is perhaps greater than that which has devolved upon any other man since the days of washington  he never could have succeeded except for the aid of divine providence upon which he at all times relied  i feel that i cannot succeed without the same divine aid which sustained him and in the same almighty being i place my reliance for support and i hope you my friends will all pray that i may receive that divine assistance without which i cannot succeed but with which success is certain again i bid you all an affectionate farewell     farewell address at springfield illinois february 11 1861  my friends no one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting  to this place and the kindness of these people i owe everything  here i have lived a quarter of a century and have passed from a young to an old man  here my children have been born and one is buried  i now leave not knowing when or whether ever i may return with a task before me greater than that which rested upon washington  without the assistance of that divine being who ever attended him i cannot succeed  with that assistance i cannot fail trusting in him who can go with me and remain with you and be everywhere for good let us confidently hope that all will yet be well to his care commending you as i hope in your prayers you will commend me i bid you an affectionate farewell     address in independence hall philadelphia february 22 1861  mr cutler i am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing in this place where were collected together the wisdom the patriotism the devotion to principle from which sprang the institutions under which we live  you have kindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of restoring peace to our distracted country  i can say in return sir that all the political sentiments i entertain have been drawn so far as i have been able to draw them from the sentiments which originated in and were given to the world from this hall  i have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the declaration of independence  i have often pondered over the dangers which were incurred by the men who assembled here and framed and adopted that declaration  i have pondered over the toils that were endured by the officers and soldiers of the army who achieved that independence  i have often inquired of myself what great principle or idea it was that kept this confederacy so long together it was not the mere matter of the separation of the colonies from the motherland but that sentiment in the declaration of independence which gave liberty not alone to the people of this country but hope to all the world for all future time  it was that which gave promise that in due time the weights would be lifted from the shoulders of all men and that all should have an equal chance  this is the sentiment embodied in the declaration of independence  now my friends can this country be saved on that basis  if it can i will consider myself one of the happiest men in the world if i can help to save it  if it cannot be saved upon that principle it will be truly awful  but if this country cannot be saved without giving up that principle i was about to say i would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it  now in my view of the present aspect of affairs there is no need of bloodshed and war  there is no necessity for it  i am not in favor of such a course and i may say in advance that there will be no bloodshed unless it is forced upon the government  the government will not use force unless force is used against it  my friends this is wholly an unprepared speech  i did not expect to be called on to say a word when i came here  i supposed i was merely to do something toward raising a flag  i may therefore have said something indiscreet  cries of no no  but i have said nothing but what i am willing to live by and if it be the pleasure of almighty god to die by     first inaugural address march 4 1861  fellow citizens of the united states in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself i appear before you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the constitution of the united states to be taken by the president before he enters on the execution of his office  i do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement  apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered  there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension  indeed the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection  it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you  i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists  i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so  those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that i had made this and many similar declarations and had never recanted them  and more than this they placed in the platform for my acceptance and as a law to themselves and to me the clear and emphatic resolution which i now read   resolved that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory no matter under what pretext as among the gravest of crimes   i now reiterate these sentiments and in doing so i only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible that the property peace and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration  i add too that all the protection which consistently with the constitution and the laws can be given will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded for whatever causeas cheerfully to one section as to another  there is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor  the clause i now read is as plainly written in the constitution as any other of its provisions   no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due   it is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves and the intention of the lawgiver is the law  all members of congress swear their support to the whole constitutionto this provision as much as to any other  to the proposition then that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered up their oaths are unanimous  now if they would make the effort in good temper could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath  there is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority but surely that difference is not a very material one  if the slave is to be surrendered it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done  and should any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept  again in any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced so that a free man be not in any case surrendered as a slave  and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantees that the citizen of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states  i take the official oath today with no mental reservations and with no purpose to construe the constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules  and while i do not choose now to specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced i do suggest that it will be much safer for all both in official and private stations to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any of them trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional  it is seventytwo years since the first inauguration of a president under our national constitution  during that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have in succession administered the executive branch of the government  they have conducted it through many perils and generally with great success  yet with all this scope of precedent i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty  a disruption of the federal union heretofore only menaced is now formidably attempted  i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments  it is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination continue to execute all the express provisions of our national constitution and the union will endure foreverit being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself  again if the united states be not a government proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it one party to a contract may violate itbreak it so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it  descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself  the union is much older than the constitution it was formed in fact by the articles of association in 1774  it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776  it was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual by the articles of confederation in 1778  and finally in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union  but if the destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible the union is less perfect than before the constitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity  it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances  i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states  doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters the american people shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary  i trust this will not be regarded as a menace but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself  in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority  the power confided to me will be used to hold occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere  where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices  the mails unless repelled will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union  so far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection  the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections  that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such i need address no word to them  to those however who really love the union may i not speak  before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric with all its benefits its memories and its hopes would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it  will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence  will you while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly fromwill you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake  all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained  is it true then that any right plainly written in the constitution has been denied  i think not  happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this  think if you can of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied  if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right it might in a moral point of view justify revolutioncertainly would if such a right were a vital one  but such is not our case  all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations guarantees and prohibitions in the constitution that controversies never arise concerning them  but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration  no foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions  shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by state authority  the constitution does not expressly say  may congress prohibit slavery in the territories the constitution does not expressly say  must congress protect slavery in the territories  the constitution does not expressly say  from questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities if the minority will not acquiesce the majority must or the government must cease  there is no other alternative for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other  if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority  for instance why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again precisely as portions of the present union now claim to secede from it all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this  is there such perfect identity of interests among the states to compose a new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession  plainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy  a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people  whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism unanimity is impossible the rule of a minority as a permanent arrangement is wholly inadmissible so that rejecting the majority principle anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left  i do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional questions are to be decided by the supreme court nor do i deny that such decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit as to the object of that suit while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government  and while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case still the evil effect following it being limited to that particular case with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice  at the same time the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal  nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges  it is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes  one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended  this is the only substantial dispute  the fugitiveslave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slavetrade are each as well enforced perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself  the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases and a few break over in each  this i think cannot be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before  the foreign slavetrade now imperfectly suppressed would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section while fugitive slaves now only partially surrendered would not be surrendered at all by the other  physically speaking we cannot separate  we cannot remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them  a husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different parts of our country cannot do this  they cannot but remain face to face and intercourse either amicable or hostile must continue between them  is it possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before  can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws  can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends  suppose you go to war you cannot fight always and when after much loss on both sides and no gain on either you cease fighting the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you  this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it  whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it  i cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirious of having the national constitution amended  while i make no recommendation of amendments i fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself and i should under existing circumstances favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it  i will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse  i understand a proposed amendment to the constitutionwhich amendment however i have not seenhas passed congress to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the states including that of persons held to service  to avoid misconstruction of what i have said i depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable  the chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states  the people themselves can do this also if they choose but the executive as such has nothing to do with it  his duty is to administer the present government as it came to his hands and to transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor  why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people  is there any better or equal hope in the world  in our present differences is either party without faith of being in the right  if the almighty ruler of nations with his eternal truth and justice be on your side of the north or on yours of the south that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the american people  by the frame of the government under which we live this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief and have with equal wisdom provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals  while the people retain their virtue and vigilance no administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years  my countrymen one and all think calmly and well upon this whole subject  nothing valuable can be lost by taking time  if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately that object will be frustrated by taking time but no good object can be frustrated by it  such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old constitution unimpaired and on the sensitive point the laws of your own framing under it while the new administration will have no immediate power if it would to change either  if it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute there still is no single good reason for precipitate action  intelligence patriotism christianity and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to adjust in the best way all your present difficulties  in your hands my dissatisfied fellowcountrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue of civil war  the government will not assail you you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors  you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve protect and defend it  i am loath to close  we are not enemies but friends  we must not be enemies  though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection  the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature     response to a serenade march 4 1861  fellow citizens i thank you for this visit  i thank you that you call upon me not in any sectional spirit but that you come without distinction of party to pay your respects to the president of the united states  i am informed that you are mostly citizens of new york cries of all all  you all appear to be very happy  may i hope that the public expression which i have this day given to my sentiments may have contributed in some degree to your happiness emphatic exclamations of assent  as far as i am concerned the loyal citizens of every state and of every section shall have no cause to feel any other sentiment  cries of good good  as towards the disaffected portions of our fellowcitizens i will say as every good man throughout the country must feel that there will be more rejoicing over one sheep that is lost and is found than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray  great cheering  and now my friends as i have risen from the dinnertable to see you you will excuse me for the brevity of my remarks and permit me again to thank you heartily and cordially for the pleasant visit as i rejoin those who await my return     letter to colonel ellsworths parents  washington dc may 25 1861  to the father and mother of colonel elmer e ellsworth  my dear sir and madam in the untimely loss of your noble son our affliction here is scarcely less than your own  so much of promised usefulness to ones country and of bright hopes for ones self and friends have rarely been so suddenly dashed as in his fall  in size in years and in youthful appearance a boy only his power to command men was surpassingly great  this power combined with a fine intellect an indomitable energy and a taste altogether military constituted in him as seemed to me the best natural talent in that department i ever knew  and yet he was singularly modest and deferential in social intercourse  my acquaintance with him began less than two years ago yet through the latter part of the intervening period it was as intimate as the disparity of our ages and my engrossing engagements would permit  to me he appeared to have no indulgences or pastimes and i never heard him utter a profane or an intemperate word  what was conclusive of his good heart he never forgot his parents  the honors he labored for so laudably and for which in the sad end he so gallantly gave his life he meant for them no less than for himself  in the hope that it may be no intrusion upon the sacredness of your sorrow i have ventured to address you this tribute to the memory of my young friend and your brave and early fallen child  may god give you that consolation which is beyond all earthly power  sincerely your friend in a common affliction  a lincoln     letter to horace greeley  executive mansion washington august 22 1862  hon horace greeley  dear sir  i have just read yours of the 19th addressed to myself through the n y tribune  if there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which i may know to be erroneous i do not now and here controvert them  if there be in it any inferences which i may believe to be falsely drawn i do not now and here argue against them if there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone i waive it in deference to an old friend whose heart i have always supposed to be right  as to the policy i seem to be pursuing as you say i have not meant to leave any one in doubt  i would save the union  i would save it in the shortest way under the constitution  the sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the union will be the union as it was  if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time save slavery i do not agree with them  if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery i do not agree with them  my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery  if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that  what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save this union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union  i shall do less whenever i shall believe that what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause  i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views as fast as they shall appear to be true views  i have here stated my purpose according to my views of official duty and i intend no modification of my oftexpressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free  yours  a lincoln      extract from the second annual message to congress december 1 1862  a nation may be said to consist of its territory its people and its laws  the territory is the only part which is of certain durability one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth forever  it is of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this everenduring part  that portion of the earths surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the united states is well adapted to be the home of one national family and it is not well adapted for two or more  its vast extent and its variety of climate and productions are of advantage in this age for one people whatever they might have been in former ages  steam telegraphs and intelligence have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people  in the inaugural address i briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two sections  i did so in language which i cannot improve and which therefore i beg to repeat   one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended  this is the only substantial dispute  the fugitiveslave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slavetrade are each as well enforced perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself  the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases and a few break over in each  this i think cannot be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before  the foreign slavetrade now imperfectly suppressed would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section while fugitive slaves now only partially surrendered would not be surrendered at all by the other  physically speaking we cannot separate  we cannot remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them  a husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different parts of our country cannot do this  they cannot but remain face to face and intercourse either amicable or hostile must continue between them is it possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before  can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws  can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends suppose you go to war you cannot fight always and when after much loss on both sides and no gain on either you cease fighting the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you   there is no line straight or crooked suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide  trace through from east to west upon the line between the free and slave country and we shall find a little more than onethird of its length are rivers easy to be crossed and populated or soon to be populated thickly upon both sides while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors lines over which people may walk and back forth without any consciousness of their presence  no part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary  the fact of separation if it comes gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitiveslave clause along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from while i should expect no treaty stipulation would be ever made to take its place  but there is another difficulty  the great interior region bounded east by the alleghanies north by the british dominions west by the rocky mountains and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets and which includes part of virginia part of tennessee all of kentucky ohio indiana michigan wisconsin illinois missouri kansas iowa minnesota and the territories of dakota nebraska and part of colorado already has above ten millions of people and will have fifty millions within fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake  it contains more than one third of the country owned by the united statescertainly more than one million of square miles  once half as populous as massachusetts already is it would have more than seventyfive millions of people  a glance at the map shows that territorially speaking it is the great body of the republic  the other parts are but marginal borders to it the magnificent region sloping west from the rocky mountains to the pacific being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resources  in the production of provisions grains grasses and all which proceed from them this great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world  ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented and yet this region has no seacoast touches no ocean anywhere  as part of one nation its people now find and may forever find their way to europe by new york to south america and africa by new orleans and to asia by san francisco  but separate our common country into two nations as designed by the present rebellion and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outletsnot perhaps by a physical barrier but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations  and this is true wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed place it between the now free and slave country or place it south of kentucky or north of ohio and still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any port or place north of it and none north of it can trade to any port or place south of it except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them  these outlets east west and south are indispensable to the wellbeing of the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast interior region  which of the three may be the best is no proper question  all are better than either and all of right belong to that people and to their successors forever  true to themselves they will not ask where a line of separation shall be but will vow rather that there shall be no such line  nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world  they too and each of them must have access to this egypt of the west without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary  our national strife springs not from our permanent part not from the land we inhabit not from our national homestead  there is no possible severing of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us in all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors separation  in fact it would ere long force reunion however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost  our strife pertains to ourselvesto the passing generations of men and it can without convulsion be hushed forever with the passing of one generation     i do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation nor do i forget that some of you are my seniors nor that many of you have more experience than i in the conduct of public affairs  yet i trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness i may seem to display  is it doubted then that the plan i propose if adopted would shorten the war and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood  is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely  is it doubted that we herecongress and executivecan secure its adoption  will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us  can we can they by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects  we can succeed only by concert  it is not can any of us imagine better but can we all do better  object whatsoever is possible still the question occurs can we do better  the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present  the occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion  as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew  we must disenthral ourselves and then we shall save our country  fellowcitizens we cannot escape history  we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves  no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation  we say we are for the union  the world will not forget that we say this  we know how to save the union the world knows we do know how to save it  weeven we herehold the power and bear the responsibility  in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the freehonorable alike in what we give and what we preserve  we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth  other means may succeed this could not fail  the way is plain peaceful generous justa way which if followed the world will forever applaud and god must forever bless  abraham lincoln  washington dec 1 1862     the emancipation proclamation january 1 1863  whereas on the twentysecond day of september in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtytwo a proclamation was issued by the president of the united states containing among other things the following to wit   that on the first day of january in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtythree all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and forever free and the executive government of the united states including the military and naval authority thereof will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons or any of them in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom  that the executive will on the first day of january aforesaid by proclamation designate the states and parts of states if any in which the people thereof respectively shall then be in rebellion against the united states and the fact that any state or the people thereof shall on that day be in good faith represented in the congress of the united states by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such state shall have participated shall in the absence of strong countervailing testimony be deemed conclusive evidence that such state and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the united states   now therefore i abraham lincoln president of the united states by virtue of the power in me vested as commanderinchief of the army and navy of the united states in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and government of the united states and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion do on this first day of january in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtythree and in accordance with my purpose so to do publicly proclaimed for the full period of 100 days from the day first above mentioned order and designate as the states and parts of states wherein the people thereof respectively are this day in rebellion against the united states the following to wit  arkansas texas louisiana except the parishes of st bernard plaquemines jefferson st john st charles st james ascension assumption terre bonne lafourche st mary st martin and orleans including the city of new orleans mississippi alabama florida georgia south carolina north carolina and virginia except the fortyeight counties designated as west virginia and also the counties of berkeley accomac northampton elizabeth city york princess ann and norfolk including the cities of norfolk and portsmouth and which excepted parts are for the present left precisely as if this proclamation were not issued  and by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid i do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated states and parts of states are and henceforward shall be free and that the executive government of the united states including the military and naval authorities thereof will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons  and i hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence unless in necessary selfdefence and i recommend to them that in all cases when allowed they labor faithfully for reasonable wages  and i further declare and make known that such persons of suitable condition will be received into the armed service of the united states to garrison forts positions stations and other places and to man vessels of all sorts in said service  and upon this act sincerely believed to be an act of justice warranted by the constitution upon military necessity i invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of almighty god     thanksgiving proclamation july 15 1863  it has pleased almighty god to hearken to the supplications and prayers of an afflicted people and to vouchsafe to the army and navy of the united states victories on land and on the sea so signal and so effective as to furnish reasonable grounds for augmented confidence that the union of these states will be maintained their constitution preserved and their peace and prosperity permanently restored  but these victories have been accorded not without sacrifices of life limb health and liberty incurred by brave loyal and patriotic citizens  domestic affliction in every part of the country follows in the train of these fearful bereavements  it is meet and right to recognize and confess the presence of the almighty father and the power of his hand equally in these triumphs and in these sorrows  now therefore be it known that i do set apart thursday the 6th day of august next to be observed as a day for national thanksgiving praise and prayer and i invite the people of the united states to assemble on that occasion in their customary places of worship and in the forms approved by their own consciences render the homage due to the divine majesty for the wonderful things he has done in the nations behalf and invoke the influence of his holy spirit to subdue the anger which has produced and so long sustained a needless and cruel rebellion to change the hearts of the insurgents to guide the counsels of the government with wisdom adequate to so great a national emergency and to visit with tender care and consolation throughout the length and breadth of our land all those who through the vicissitudes of marches voyages battles and sieges have been brought to suffer in mind body or estate and finally to lead the whole nation through the paths of repentance and submission to the divine will back to the perfect enjoyment of union and fraternal peace     letter to j c conkling  executive mansion  washington august 26 1863  hon james c conkling  my dear sir your letter inviting me to attend a massmeeting of unconditional union men to be held at the capital of illinois on the 3d day of september has been received  it would be very agreeable to me to thus meet my old friends at my own home but i cannot just now be absent from here so long as a visit there would require  the meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the union and i am sure my old political friends will thank me for tendering as i do the nations gratitude to those and other noble men whom no partizan malice or partizan hope can make false to the nations life  there are those who are dissatisfied with me  to such i would say you desire peace and you blame me that we do not have it  but how can we attain it  there are but three conceivable ways  first to suppress the rebellion by force of arms  this i am trying to do  are you for it  if you are so far we are agreed  if you are not for it a second way is to give up the union  i am against this  are you for it  if you are you should say so plainly  if you are not for force nor yet for dissolution there only remains some imaginable compromise  i do not believe that any compromise embracing the maintenance of the union is now possible  all i learn leads to a directly opposite belief  the strength of the rebellion is its military its army  that army dominates all the country and all the people within its range  any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range in opposition to that army is simply nothing for the present because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise if one were made with them  to illustrate suppose refugees from the south and peace men of the north get together in convention and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the union  in what way can that compromise be used to keep lees army out of pennsylvania  meades army can keep lees army out of pennsylvania and i think can ultimately drive it out of existence  but no paper compromise to which the controllers of lees army are not agreed can at all affect that army  in an effort at such compromise we should waste time which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage and that would be all  a compromise to be effective must be made either with those who control the rebel army or with the people first liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our own army  now allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that rebel army or from any of the men controlling it in relation to any peace compromise has ever come to my knowledge or belief  all charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless  and i promise you that if any such proposition shall hereafter come it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you  i freely acknowledge myself the servant of the people according to the bond of servicethe united states constitutionand that as such i am responsible to them  but to be plain  you are dissatisfied with me about the negro  quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject  i certainly wish that all men could be free while i suppose you do not  yet i have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your views provided you are for the union  i suggested compensated emancipation to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes  but i had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to save the union exclusively by other means  you dislike the emancipation proclamation and perhaps would have it retracted  you say it is unconstitutional  i think differently  i think the constitution invests its commanderinchief with the law of war in time of war  the most that can be saidif so muchis that slaves are property  is there has there ever been any question that by the law of war property both of enemies and friends may be taken when needed and is it not needed whenever taking it helps us or hurts the enemy  armies the world over destroy enemies property when they cannot use it and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel  among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and noncombatants male and female  but the proclamation as law either is valid or is not valid  if it is not valid it needs no retraction  if it is valid it cannot be retracted any more than the dead can be brought to life  some of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably for the union why better after the retraction than before the issue  there was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation issued the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance  the war has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the issue of the proclamation as before  i know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of the commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most important successes believe the emancipation policy and the use of colored troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion and that at least one of these important successes could not have been achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers  among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism or with republican party politics but who hold them purely as military opinions  i submit their opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections often urged that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures and were not adopted as such in good faith  you say you will not fight to free negroes  some of them seem willing to fight for you but no matter  fight you then exclusively to save the union  i issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the union  whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the union if i shall urge you to continue fighting it will be an apt time then for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes  i thought that in your struggle for the union to whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the enemy to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you  do you think differently  i thought that whatever negroes can be got to do as soldiers leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do in saving the union  does it appear otherwise to you  but negroes like other people act upon motives why should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them  if they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the strongest motive even the promise of freedom  and the promise being made must be kept  the signs look better  the father of waters again goes unvexed to the sea  thanks to the great northwest for it  nor yet wholly to them three hundred miles up they met new england empire keystone and jersey hewing their way right and left  the sunny south too in more colors than one also lent a hand  on the spot their part of the history was jotted down in black and white  the job was a great national one and let none be banned who bore an honorable part in it and while those who have cleared the great river may well be proud even that is not all  it is hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at antietam murfreesboro gettysburg and on many fields of lesser note  nor must uncle sams webfeet be forgotten  at all the watery margins they have been present  not only on the deep sea the broad bay and the rapid river but also up the narrow muddy bayou and wherever the ground was a little damp they have been and made their tracks  thanks to allfor the great republic for the principle it lives by and keeps alive for mans vast futurethanks to all  peace does not appear so distant as it did  i hope it will come soon and come to stay and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future time  it will then have been proved that among freemen there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose their case and pay the cost  and then there will be some black men who can remember that with silent tongue and clenched teeth and steady eye and wellpoised bayonet they have helped mankind on to this great consummation while i fear there will be some white ones unable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they strove to hinder it  still let us not be oversanguine of a speedy final triumph  let us be quite sober  let us diligently apply the means never doubting that a just god in his own good time will give us the rightful result  yours very truly  a lincoln     the gettysburg address nov 19 1863  fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal  now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure  we are met on a great battlefield of that war  we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final restingplace for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live  it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this  but in a larger sense we cannot dedicatewe cannot consecratewe cannot hallowthis ground  the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract  the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here  it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced  it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth     letter to mrs bixby  executive mansion  washington nov 21 1864  to mrs bixby boston mass  dear madam i have been shown in the files of the war department a statement of the adjutant general of massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle  i feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming  but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save  i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom  yours very sincerely and respectfully  a lincoln     second inaugural address march 4 1865  fellowcountrymen at this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first  then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper  now at the expiration of four years during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation little that is new could be presented  the progress of our arms upon which all else chiefly depends is as well known to the public as to myself and it is i trust reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all  with high hope for the future no prediction in regard to it is ventured  on the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war  all dreaded itall sought to avert it  while the inaugural address was being delivered from this place devoted altogether to saving the union without war insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without warseeking to dissolve the union and divide effects by negotiation both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish  and the war came  oneeighth of the whole population were colored slaves not distributed generally over the union but localized in the southern part of it these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest  all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war  to strengthen perpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union even by war while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it  neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained  neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease  each looked for an easier triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding  both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other  it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just gods assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other mens faces but let us judge not that we be not judged  the prayers of both could not be answeredthat of neither has been answered fully  the almighty has his own purposes  woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh  if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offences which in the providence of god must needs come but which having continued through his appointed time he now wills to remove and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offence came shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him  fondly do we hopefervently do we praythat this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away  yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondmans two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether  with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphanto do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations     last public address april 11 1865  we meet this evening not in sorrow but in gladness of heart  the evacuation of petersburg and richmond and the surrender of the principal insurgent army give hope of a righteous and speedy peace whose joyous expression cannot be restrained  in the midst of this however he from whom all blessings flow must not be forgotten  a call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared and will be duly promulgated  nor must those whose harder part give us the cause of rejoicing be overlooked  their honors must not be parcelled out with others  i myself was near the front and had the high pleasure of transmitting much of the good news to you but no part of the honor for plan or execution is mine  to general grant his skilful officers and brave men all belongs  the gallant navy stood ready but was not in reach to take active part  by these recent successes the reinauguration of the national authorityreconstructionwhich has had a large share of thought from the first is pressed much more closely upon our attention  it is fraught with great difficulty  unlike a case of war between independent nations there is no authorized organ for us to treat with no one man has authority to give up the rebellion for any other man we simply must begin with and mold from disorganized and discordant elements  nor is it a small additional embarrassment that we the loyal people differ among ourselves as to the mode manner and measure of reconstruction  as a general rule i abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon myself wishing not to be provoked by that to which i cannot properly offer an answer  in spite of this precaution however it comes to my knowledge that i am much censured for some supposed agency in setting up and seeking to sustain the new state government of louisiana  in this i have done just so much as and no more than the public knows in the annual message of december 1863 and in the accompanying proclamation i presented a plan of reconstruction as the phrase goes which i promised if adopted by any state should be acceptable to and sustained by the executive government of the nation  i distinctly stated that this was not the only plan which might possibly be acceptable and i also distinctly protested that the executive claimed no right to say when or whether members should be admitted to seats in congress from such states  this plan was in advance submitted to the then cabinet and distinctly approved by every member of it  one of them suggested that i should then and in that connection apply the emancipation proclamation to the theretofore excepted parts of virginia and louisiana that i should drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for freed people and that i should omit the protest against my own power in regard to the admission of members to congress  but even he approved every part and parcel of the plan which has since been employed or touched by the action of louisiana  the new constitution of louisiana declaring emancipation for the whole state practically applies the proclamation to the part previously excepted  it does not adopt apprenticeship for freed people and it is silent as it could not well be otherwise about the admission of members to congress  so that as it applies to louisiana every member of the cabinet fully approved the plan  the message went to congress and i received many commendations of the plan written and verbal and not a single objection to it from any professed emancipationist came to my knowledge until after the news reached washington that the people of louisiana had began to move in accordance with it  from about july 1862 i had corresponded with different persons supposed to be interested in seeking a reconstruction of a state government for louisiana  when the message of 1863 with the plan before mentioned reached new orleans general banks wrote me he was confident that the people with his military cooperation would reconstruct substantially on that plan  i wrote him and some of them to try it  they tried it and the result is known  such only has been my agency in getting up the louisiana government  as to sustaining it my promise is out as before stated  but as bad promises are better broken than kept i shall treat this as a bad promise and break it whenever i shall be convinced that keeping it is adverse to the public interest but i have not yet been so convinced  i have been shown a letter on this subject supposed to be an able one in which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be definitely fixed on the question whether the seceded states so called are in the union or out of it  it would perhaps add astonishment to his regret were he to learn that since i have found professed union men endeavoring to make that question i have purposely forborne any public expression upon it  as appears to me that question has not been nor yet is a practically material one and that any discussion of it while it thus remains practically immaterial could have no effect other than the mischievous one of dividing our friends  as yet whatever it may hereafter become that question is bad as the basis of a controversy and good for nothing at alla merely pernicious abstraction  we all agree that the seceded states so called are out of their proper practical relation with the union and that the sole object of the government civil and military in regard to those states is to again get them into that proper practical relation  i believe that it is not only possible but in fact easier to do this without deciding or even considering whether these states have ever been out of the union than with it  finding themselves safely at home it would be utterly immaterial whether they had ever been abroad  let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restoring the proper practical relations between these states and the union and each forever after innocently indulge his own opinion whether in doing the acts he brought the states from without into the union or only gave them proper assistance they never having been out of it  the amount of constituency so to speak on which the new louisiana government rests would be more satisfactory to all if it contained 50000 or 30000 or even 20000 instead of only about 12000 as it really does  it is also unsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the colored man  i would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very intelligent and on those who serve our cause as soldiers  still the question is not whether the louisiana government as it stands is quite all that is desirable the question is will it be wiser to take it as it is and help to improve it or to reject and disperse it  can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government  some twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave state of louisiana have sworn allegiance to the union assumed to be the rightful political power of the state held elections organized a state government adopted a freestate constitution giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and white and empowering the legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the colored man their legislature has already voted to ratify the constitutional amendment recently passed by congress abolishing slavery throughout the nation  these twelve thousand persons are thus fully committed to the union and to perpetual freedom in the statecommitted to the very things and nearly all the things the nation wantsand they ask the nations recognition and its assistance to make good their committal  now if we reject and spurn them we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them  we in effect say to the white man you are worthless or worse we will neither help you nor be helped by you  to the blacks we say this cup of liberty which these your old masters hold to your lips we will dash from you and leave you to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when where and how  if this course discouraging and paralyzing both white and black has any tendency to bring louisiana into proper practical relations with the union i have so far been unable to perceive it  if on the contrary we recognize and sustain the new government of louisiana the converse of all this is made true we encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of the twelve thousand to adhere to their work and argue for it and proselyte for it and fight for it and feed it and grow it and ripen it to a complete success the colored man too in seeing all united for him is inspired with vigilance and energy and daring to the same end  grant that he desires the elective franchise will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps toward it than by running backward over them  concede that the new government of louisiana is only to what it should be as the egg is to the fowl we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching the egg than by smashing it  again if we reject louisiana we also reject one vote in favor of the proposed amendment to the national constitution  to meet this proposition it has been argued that no more than threefourths of those states which have not attempted secession are necessary to validly ratify the amendment  i do not commit myself against this further than to say that such a ratification would be questionable and sure to be persistently questioned while a ratification by threefourths of all the states would be unquestioned and unquestionable  i repeat the question can louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new state government  what has been said of louisiana will apply generally to other states  and yet so great peculiarities pertain to each state and such important and sudden changes occur in the same state and withal so new and unprecedented is the whole case that no exclusive and inflexible plan can safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals such exclusive and inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement  important principles may and must be inflexible  in the present situation as the phrase goes it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people of the south  i am considering and shall not fail to act when satisfied that action will be proper     from a letter to j w fell december 20 1859  i was born february 12 1809 in hardin county kentucky  my parents were born in virginia of undistinguished familiessecond families perhaps i should say  my mother who died in my tenth year was of a family of the name of hanks some of whom now reside in adams and others in macon county illinois  my paternal grandfather abraham lincoln emigrated from rockingham county virginia to kentucky about 1781 or 1782 where a year or two later he was killed by the indians not in battle but by stealth when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest  his ancestors who were quakers went to virginia from berks county pennsylvania  an effort to identify them with the new england family of the same name ended in nothing more definite than a similarity of christian names in both families such as enoch levi mordecai solomon abraham and the like  my father at the death of his father was but six years of age and he grew up literally without education  he removed from kentucky to what is now spencer county indiana in my eighth year  we reached our new home about the time the state came into the union  it was a wild region with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods there i grew up  there were some schools so called but no qualification was ever required of a teacher beyond readin writin and cipherin to the rule of three  if a straggler supposed to understand latin happened to sojourn in the neighborhood he was looked upon as a wizard  there was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education  of course when i came of age i did not know much  still somehow i could read write and cipher to the rule of three but that was all  i have not been to school since  the little advance i now have upon this store of education i have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity  i was raised to farm work which i continued till i was twentytwo  at twentyone i came to illinois macon county  then i got to new salem at that time in sangamon now in menard county where i remained a year as a sort of clerk in a store  then came the black hawk war and i was elected a captain of volunteers a success which gave me more pleasure than any i have had since  i went the campaign was elated ran for the legislature the same year 1832 and was beatenthe only time i ever have been beaten by the people  the next and three succeeding biennial elections i was elected to the legislature  i was not a candidate afterward  during this legislative period i had studied law and removed to springfield to practise it  in 1846 i was once elected to the lower house of congress  was not a candidate for reelection  from 1849 to 1854 both inclusive practised law more assiduously than ever before always a whig in politics and generally on the whig electoral tickets making active canvasses  i was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the missouri compromise aroused me again  what i have done since then is pretty well known  if any personal description of me is thought desirable it may be said i am in height six feet four inches nearly lean in flesh weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds dark complexion with coarse black hair and gray eyes  no other marks or brands recollected     notes   communication to the people of sangamon county  this announcement of political principles appeared in the sangamon journal at that time the only newspaper published in springfield the present text which differs in some details from that found in the various editions of lincolns works follows the original except in changing the spelling of sangamo to sangamon    perpetuation of our political institutions  on the close of the address resolutions were passed requesting the author to furnish a copy to the press but for some unexplained reason it was not published until a year later  the present text is taken from the sangamon journal  lincoln was one of the organizers of the lyceum  all through his life lincoln showed a marked respect for the law and the present warning against the consequences of lawlessness so rhetorically sounded by the young orator of twentyeight was a perfectly sincere expression of a profound conviction  the gates of hell  matthew xvi 18  this quotation was repeated in a speech delivered at indianapolis twentyfour years later when civil war was threatening    the springfield speech  during the summer of 1858 lincoln delivered two important antislavery speeches at springfield  the first and more important of these was made june 16 at the close of the republican state convention at which lincoln was declared the party candidate for the united states senate  the second delivered a month later is in part a defence and explanation of the earlier speech which had been severely criticised by lincolns old opponent judge douglas  the first springfield speech was very carefully prepared and the ms was submitted to several of lincolns friends all of whom objected to the opening statement as being impolitic and sure to lose the speaker the position for which he was a candidate  lincoln refused to make any change however saying that he preferred to go down linked with truth if that was necessary  by herndon the date is given as june 17  a house divided against itself  suggested by matthew xii 25 and mark iii 25  this quotation had already been used in 1843 in a whig circular signed by lincoln and two others and in a letter written in 1863 lincoln speaks of the government as a house divided against itself  nebraska doctrine  the doctrine of squatter sovereignty was recognized in the bill introduced in the senate january 4 1854 by douglas to give territorial government to the district west of missouri and iowa known as nebraska  a similar bill had been introduced the year before by douglas  in its original form the bill contained no reference to the repeal of the missouri compromise but in the form in which it was passed it declared the missouri compromise to be null and void  under the terms of this compromise slavery had been restricted to the territory south of 36 degrees 30 minutes  dred scott decision  this decision was rendered march 6 1857  silliman letter  a statement on the situation in kansas by the electors of connecticut which received its name from professor silliman of yale college by whom it was in the main drawn up  lecompton constitution  in 1857 a convention was held at lecompton kan to draw up a state constitution  in this convention the advocates of slavery were in the majority and the instrument was so prepared as not to interfere with slavery wherever it already existed in the territory  the freesoil advocates refused to accept this constitution  when the question of admitting kansas under the lecompton constitution was presented before congress douglas in accordance with his principles of popular sovereignty broke with his party and opposed the effort  from our present point of view lincoln does not seem to do douglas justice  stephen franklin etc  the reference is to stephen a douglas president franklin pierce chief justice roger b taney and james buchanan  lincolns perfectly sincere belief in a deliberate conspiracy among these men to perpetuate slavery which was shared by many republicans of that time is not sustained by the impartial investigations of later historians  mclean or curtis  john mclean and benjamin r curtis were the only justices who were strongly opposed to the dred scott decision  curtis who was a whig from massachusetts and who resigned the same year wrote a minority decision  chase and mace  salmon p chase was at that time senator from ohio daniel mace was a democrat representative who was opposed to the nebraska bill  judge nelson  samuel nelson a justice of the supreme court  a living dog is better than a dead lion  ecclesiastes ix 4    the freeport debate  the lincolndouglas joint debates took place in seven towns in various parts of illinois between august 21 and october 15 1858  the proposal for these meetings was made by lincoln in a note addressed to douglas the length of each debate and the division of time between the speakers are stated in the opening sentence of the speech given in the text the speeches which were all extempore as far as the actual form is concerned were later collected from the newspaper reports and after some slight revision by the authors were published in 1860 in columbus ohio  this volume from which the present text is taken contained in addition a number of speeches delivered by lincoln and douglas earlier in 1858 and two speeches made by lincoln in ohio in 1859  lincolns statement at the close of a letter to the publishers accompanying the copy for the book is characteristic and interesting i wish the reprint to be precisely as the copies i send without any comment whatever  this columbus issue was used as a republican campaign document and large numbers were sold  the freeport debate the second in the series was held on the afternoon of august 27  with the exception of the galesburg debate it was the most largely attended of the seven meetings and in its effect upon the campaign it is now regarded as the most important  judge douglas and myself  in the informal speeches lincoln frequently committed errors of speech like this  even during the presidential period he shows a marked tendency to use the cleft infinitive  but in the carefully written addresses the language is almost always correct  fugitive slave law  this statute was passed in 1850 for the stricter regulation of the return of escaped slaves to their owners  in his answer to this question lincoln showed clearly that he was not an abolitionist as that term was then understood  question 2  douglas reply to this question was as follows i answer emphatically as mr lincoln has heard me answer a hundred times from every stump in illinois that in my opinion the people of a territory can by lawful means exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a state constitution  it is claimed that this question was put by lincoln in spite of the protests of several of his friends who believed that it would give douglas an advantage  but here as in the equally feared springfield speech lincoln proved his superior sagacity  douglas affirmative answer probably gained him the senatorship but it certainly lost him the presidency two years later  first republican state convention  the reference is to a meeting held in springfield which was addressed by owen lovejoy  lincoln was not present on this occasion  recent investigation seems to show that there was no foundation for the charge that this was exclusively a meeting of abolitionists but that it included many men who held the same political views as lincoln  douglas honestly believed that the resolutions read by him at the ottawa meeting were genuine and he was greatly chagrined at the mistake  by an amendment  this amendment was offered by douglas    the cooper institute address  this address lincolns first important direct message to the people of the east was very carefully prepared  the text in this volume is taken from the tribune tract issued as a campaign document  the northwestern territory  the district comprising the present states of ohio illinois indiana michigan and wisconsin had been ceded to the national government by the original states  black republicans  douglas constantly referred to his opponents under this title  in the ottawa debate he affirmed that in 1854 lincoln and trumbull had arranged to form an abolition party under the name and disguise of a republican party  popular sovereignty  this principle is defined by douglas as follows my principle is to recognize each state of the union as independent sovereign and equal in its sovereignty  harpers ferry john brown  john brown was a new englander who had taken an active part in the kansas disorders in 1856  during the summer of 1859 he engaged in an attempt to free the slaves of virginia after capturing the arsenal at harpers ferry he was overpowered by a body of marines and with the survivors of his army was hanged  by the extreme antislavery people he was regarded as a martyr the best expression of this spirit being given by mrs julia ward howes battle hymn of the republic  in a speech in congress of january 16 1860 senator douglas had stated his firm and deliberate conviction that the harpers ferry crime was the natural logical inevitable result of the doctrines and teachings of the republican party  the southampton insurrection  the reference is to a slave insurrection which occurred in 1831 in southampton va  helpers book  hinton p helper a north carolinian of the socalled poor white class was the author of a book on the effects of slavery entitled the impending crisis in the south  the special reference is to the recent agreement among sixtyfour republican representatives to publish a compendium of the book for circulation in doubtful states    the farewell speech  this beautiful little address was delivered from the platform of the car that bore the presidentelect away from his old home  it has been preserved in two slightly differing versions neither of which probably exactly reproduces the words used  the springfield papers which were followed by herndon gave an inaccurate report that robbed the speech of much of its rare beauty    the first inaugural address  the first inaugural was carefully written in springfield a month before its delivery  contrary to his usual practice in public speaking lincoln read from the ms  the address was enthusiastically received by an immense audience assembled front of the capitol and the general impression produced at the north was favorable  by the southern and the abolition press it was severely criticised both with regard to its form and its content  the mystic chords of memory  this passage was suggested by mr seward to whom the address had been submitted for criticism  the customary usury of genius was paid for the verbal loan    response to serenade  this speech was delivered before a delegation of new yorkers who called at the white house on the evening of march 4  two other similar responses have been preserved from the same day  the present address is reprinted here for the first time from the new york times    letter to horace greeley  greeleys letter of august 19 which was headed the prayer of twenty millions began as follows i do not intrude to tell youfor you must know alreadythat a great proportion of those who triumphed in your election and of all who desire the unqualified suppression of the rebellion now desolating our country are sorely disappointed and deeply pained by the policy you seem to be pursuing  that lincoln had good reason to complain of an impatient and dictatorial tone is sufficiently shown by the closing sentence i entreat you to render hearty and unequivocal obedience to the laws of the land  the following issue of the tribune contained a long editorial on the same subject  the influence of the tribune in the northern states was immense and lincoln realized the importance of making a clear statement of his policy to its readers    second annual message to congress  after a long statement about the conditions of the finances and of the different departments the president devoted the remainder of the space to the discussion of compensated emancipation on which he had already made a recommendation earlier in the year in a special message to congress  the concluding paragraph is in the elevated style of the inaugurals    the emancipation proclamation  the first draft of the proclamation was submitted to the cabinet in the preceding july with the remark that he had fully determined to issue it immediately  secretary seward suggested that its issue be postponed until it could be given to the country supported by some military success  the president saw the force of the suggestion and waited until after the battle of antietam  the preliminary proclamation was dated september 22 1862  in a reply to a serenade two days later the president said i can only trust in god i have made no mistake  upon military necessity  this phrase was inserted in the concluding sentence which had been suggested by secretary chase as furnishing the only authority by which the president felt that he could free the slaves of the enemy  the proclamation did not refer to those slaves held by persons who were not in rebellion    letter to j c conkling  mr conkling was a personal friend of the president and the formal letter was accompanied by the following note  my dear conkling  i cannot leave here now  herewith is a letter instead  you are one of the best public readers  i have but one requestread it very slowly and now god bless you and all good union men  in spite of precautions the letter was published in the new york evening post several days before the meeting  i know as fully as one can know  the portion of the paragraph from these words to the end was not in the original letter but was added by telegraph    the gettysburg address  the standard text of the address does not agree exactly either with the original written form or with the form in which it was delivered but it is a combination of these made by lincoln a few days later  in the contemporary newspaper reports it was variously referred to as an address a speech and remarks  government of the people  the thought contained in this sentence was not original with lincoln but it has been traced back through several centuries  it was probably suggested to lincoln by the following passage in an address by theodore parker which he is known to have read democracy is direct selfgovernment over all the people for all the people by all the people    the second inaugural address  this address is in marked contrast both in length and character to president lincolns first official communication  some of the main thoughts and two of the biblical quotations occur in a letter written may 30 1864  let us judge not that we be not judged  adapted from matthew vii 1  woe unto the world  matthew xviii 7  fondly do we hope  the accidental rhyme in this passage is the only blemish that has been objected to in the address and it is not serious  the judgments of the lord  psalms xix 9  the opening words of the last paragraph are the best expression ever given of the spirit of lincoln who on another occasion said i have never willingly planted a thorn in any mans bosom    the last speech  this address the longest of the presidential period with the exception of the first inaugural was delivered before a great crowd gathered in front of the white house four days before lincolns assassination the evening before on a similar occasion he had requested the people to wait until he could prepare his remarks adding that he wished to be careful as everything he said got into print  the newspaper reports of the following day state that it was received with great enthusiasm the address is of special interest as indicating the attitude of the president toward the difficult question of reconstruction  the evacuation of petersburg and richmond  april 2 and 3 respectively  general lee surrendered april 9  the new constitution of louisiana  the constitution was adopted september 5 1861  the proposed amendment  the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery throughout the united states was proposed in 1864 but failed to receive the necessary twothirds vote in the house of representatives it was passed in 1865 and after receiving the endorsement of the necessary number of states went into effect december 15 of the same year
