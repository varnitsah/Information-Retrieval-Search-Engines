17552647	the inca of perusalem an almost historical comedietta  by george bernard shaw    i must remind the reader that this playlet was written when its principal character far from being a fallen foe and virtually a prisoner in our victorious hands was still the caesar whose legions we were resisting with our hearts in our mouths many were so horribly afraid of him that they could not forgive me for not being afraid of him i seemed to be trifling heartlessly with a deadly peril i knew better and i have represented caesar as knowing better himself but it was one of the quaintnesses of popular feeling during the war that anyone who breathed the slightest doubt of the absolute perfection of german organization the machiavellian depth of german diplomacy the omniscience of german science the equipment of every german with a complete philosophy of history and the consequent hopelessness of overcoming so magnificently accomplished an enemy except by the sacrifice of every recreative activity to incessant and vehement war work including a heartbreaking mass of fussing and cadging and bluffing that did nothing but waste our energies and tire our resolution was called a progerman  now that this is all over and the upshot of the fighting has shown that we could quite well have afforded to laugh at the doomed inca i am in another difficulty i may be supposed to be hitting caesar when he is down that is why i preface the play with this reminder that when it was written he was not down to make quite sure i have gone through the proof sheets very carefully and deleted everything that could possibly be mistaken for a foul blow i have of course maintained the ancient privilege of comedy to chasten caesars foibles by laughing at them whilst introducing enough obvious and outrageous fiction to relieve both myself and my model from the obligations and responsibilities of sober history and biography but i should certainly put the play in the fire instead of publishing it if it contained a word against our defeated enemy that i would not have written in 1913  the inca of perusalem was performed for the first time in england by the pioneer players at the criterion theatre london on 16th december 1917 with gertrude kingston as ermyntrude helen morris as the princess nigel playfair as the waiter alfred drayton as the hotel manager c wordley hulse as the archdeacon and randle ayrton as the inca     prologue  the tableau curtains are closed an english archdeacon comes through them in a condition of extreme irritation he speaks through the curtains to someone behind them  the archdeacon once for all ermyntrude i cannot afford to maintain you in your present extravagance he goes to a flight of steps leading to the stalls and sits down disconsolately on the top step a fashionably dressed lady comes through the curtains and contemplates him with patient obstinacy he continues grumbling an english clergymans daughter should be able to live quite respectably and comfortably on an allowance of Â£150 a year wrung with great difficulty from the domestic budget  ermyntrude you are not a common clergyman you are an archdeacon  the archdeacon angrily that does not affect my emoluments to the extent of enabling me to support a daughter whose extravagance would disgrace a royal personage scrambling to his feet and scolding at her what do you mean by it miss  ermyntrude oh really father miss is that the way to talk to a widow  the archdeacon is that the way to talk to a father your marriage was a most disastrous imprudence it gave you habits that are absolutely beyond your meansi mean beyond my means you have no means why did you not marry matthews the best curate i ever had  ermyntrude i wanted to and you wouldnt let me you insisted on my marrying roosenhonkerspipstein  the archdeacon i had to do the best for you my child roosenhonkerspipstein was a millionaire  ermyntrude how did you know he was a millionaire  the archdeacon he came from america of course he was a millionaire besides he proved to my solicitors that he had fifteen million dollars when you married him  eryntrude his solicitors proved to me that he had sixteen millions when he died he was a millionaire to the last  the archdeacon o mammon mammon i am punished now for bowing the knee to him is there nothing left of your settlement fifty thousand dollars a year it secured to you as we all thought only half the securities could be called speculative the other half were giltedged what has become of it all  ermyntrude the speculative ones were not paid up and the giltedged ones just paid the calls on them until the whole show burst up  the archdeacon ermyntrude what expressions  ermyntrude oh bother if you had lost ten thousand a year what expressions would you use do you think the long and the short of it is that i cant live in the squalid way you are accustomed to  the archdeacon squalid  ermyntrude i have formed habits of comfort  the archdeacon comfort  ermyntrude well elegance if you like luxury if you insist call it what you please a house that costs less than a hundred thousand dollars a year to run is intolerable to me  the archdeacon then my dear you had better become ladys maid to a princess until you can find another millionaire to marry you  ermyntrude thats an idea i will she vanishes through the curtains  the archdeacon what come back come back this instant the lights are lowered oh very well i have nothing more to say he descends the steps into the auditorium and makes for the door grumbling all the time insane senseless extravagance barking worthlessness muttering i will not bear it any longer dresses hats furs gloves motor rides one bill after another money going like water no restraint no selfcontrol no decency shrieking i say no decency muttering again nice state of things we are coming to a pretty world but i simply will not bear it she can do as she likes i wash my hands of her i am not going to die in the workhouse for any goodfornothing undutiful spendthrift daughter and the sooner that is understood by everybody the better for all par he is by this time out of hearing in the corridor     the play  a hotel sitting room a table in the centre on it a telephone two chairs at it opposite one another behind it the door the fireplace has a mirror in the mantelpiece  a spinster princess hatted and gloved is ushered in by the hotel manager spruce and artifically bland by professional habit but treating his customer with a condescending affability which sails very close to the east wind of insolence  the manager i am sorry i am unable to accommodate your highness on the first floor  the princess very shy and nervous oh please dont mention it this is quite nice very nice thank you very much  the manager we could prepare a room in the annexe  the princess oh no this will do very well  she takes of her gloves and hat puts them on the table and sits down  the manager the rooms are quite as good up here there is less noise and there is the lift if your highness desires anything there is the telephone  the princess oh thank you i dont want anything the telephone is so difficult i am not accustomed to it  the manager can i take any order some tea  the princess oh thank you yes i should like some tea if i mightif it would not be too much trouble  he goes out the telephone rings the princess starts out of her chair terrified and recoils as far as possible from the instrument  the princess oh dear it rings again she looks scared it rings again she approaches it timidly it rings again she retreats hastily it rings repeatedly she runs to it in desperation and puts the receiver to her ear who is there what do i do i am not used to the telephone i dont know howwhat oh i can hear you speaking quite distinctly she sits down delighted and settles herself for a conversation how wonderful what a lady oh a person oh yes i know yes please send her up have my servants finished their lunch yet oh no please dont disturb them id rather not it doesnt matter thank you what oh yes its quite easy i had no ideaam i to hang it up just as it was thank you she hangs it up  ermyntrude enters presenting a plain and staid appearance in a long straight waterproof with a hood over her head gear she comes to the end of the table opposite to that at which the princess is seated  the princess excuse me i have been talking through the telephone and i heard quite well though i have never ventured before wont you sit down  ermyntrude no thank you your highness i am only a ladys maid i understood you wanted one  the princess oh no you mustnt think i want one its so unpatriotic to want anything now on account of the war you know i sent my maid away as a public duty and now she has married a soldier and is expecting a war baby but i dont know how to do without her ive tried my very best but somehow it doesnt answer everybody cheats me and in the end it isnt any saving so ive made up my mind to sell my piano and have a maid that will be a real saving because i really dont care a bit for music though of course one has to pretend to dont you think so  ermyntrude certainly i do your highness nothing could be more correct saving and selfdenial both at once and an act of kindness to me as i am out of place  the princess im so glad you see it in that way eryou wont mind my asking will youhow did you lose your place  ermyntrude the war your highness the war  the princess oh yes of course but how  ermyntrude taking out her handkerchief and showing signs of grief my poor mistress  the princess oh please say no more dont think about it so tactless of me to mention it  ermyntrude mastering her emotion and smiling through her tears your highness is too good  the princess do you think you could be happy with me i attach such importance to that  ermyntrude gushing oh i knowi shall  the princess you must not expect too much there is my uncle he is very severe and hasty and he is my guardian i once had a maid i liked very much but he sent her away the very first time  ermyntrude the first time of what your highness  the princess oh something she did i am sure she had never done it before and i know she would never have done it again she was so truly contrite and nice about it  ermyntrude about what your highness  the princess well she wore my jewels and one of my dresses at a rather improper ball with her young man and my uncle saw her  erymntrude then he was at the ball too your highness  the princess struck by the inference i suppose he must have been i wonder you know its very sharp of you to find that out i hope you are not too sharp  ermyntrude a ladys maid has to be your highness she produces some letters your highness wishes to see my testimonials no doubt i have one from an archdeacon she proffers the letters  the princess taking them do archdeacons have maids how curious  ermyntrude no your highness they have daughters i have firstrate testimonials from the archdeacon and from his daughter  the princess reading them the daughter says you are in every respect a treasure the archdeacon says he would have kept you if he could possibly have afforded it most satisfactory im sure  ermyntrude may i regard myself as engaged then your highness  the princess alarmed oh im sure i dont know if you like of course but do you think i ought to  ermyntrude naturally i think your highness ought to most decidedly  the princess oh well if you think that i daresay youre quite right youll excuse my mentioning it i hope but what wageser  ermyntrude the same as the maid who went to the ball your highness need not make any change  the princess myes of course she began with less but she had such a number of relatives to keep it was quite heartbreaking i had to raise her wages again and again  ermyntrude i shall be quite content with what she began on and i have no relatives dependent on me and i am willing to wear my own dresses at balls  the princess i am sure nothing could be fairer than that my uncle cant object to that can he  ermyntrude if he does your highness ask him to speak to me about it i shall regard it as part of my duties to speak to your uncle about matters of business  the princess would you you must be frightfully courageous  ermyntrude may i regard myself as engaged your highness i should like to set about my duties immediately  the princess oh yes i think so oh certainly i  a waiter comes in with the tea he places the tray on the table  the princess oh thank you  ermyntrude raising the cover from the tea cake and looking at it how long has that been standing at the top of the stairs  the princess terrified oh please it doesnt matter  the waiter it has not been waiting straight from the kitchen madam believe me  ermyntrude send the manager here  the waiter the manager what do you want with the manager  ermyntrude he will tell you when i have done with him how dare you treat her highness in this disgraceful manner what sort of pothouse is this where did you learn to speak to persons of quality take away your cold tea and cold cake instantly give them to the chambermaid you were flirting with whilst her highness was waiting order some fresh tea at once and do not presume to bring it yourself have it brought by a civil waiter who is accustomed to wait on ladies and not like you on commercial travellers  the waiter alas madam i am not accustomed to wait on anybody two years ago i was an eminent medical man my waitingroom was crowded with the flower of the aristocracy and the higher bourgeoisie from nine to six every day but the war came and my patients were ordered to give up their luxuries they gave up their doctors but kept their weekend hotels closing every career to me except the career of a waiter he puts his fingers on the teapot to test its temperature and automatically takes out his watch with the other hand as if to count the teapots pulse you are right the tea is cold it was made by the wife of a once fashionable architect the cake is only half toasted what can you expect from a ruined westend tailor whose attempt to establish a secondhand business failed last tuesday week have you the heart to complain to the manager have we not suffered enough are our miseries nev the manager enters oh lord here he is the waiter withdraws abjectly taking the tea tray with him  the manager pardon your highness but i have received an urgent inquiry for rooms from an english family of importance and i venture to ask you to let me know how long you intend to honor us with your presence  the princess rising anxiously oh am i in the way  ermyntrude sternly sit down madam the princess sits down forlornly ermyntrude turns imperiously to the manager her highness will require this room for twenty minutes  the manager twenty minutes  ermyntrude yes it will take fully that time to find a proper apartment in a respectable hotel  the manager i do not understand  ermyntrude you understand perfectly how dare you offer her highness a room on the second floor  the manager but i have explained the first floor is occupied at least  ermyntrude well at least  the manager it is occupied  ermyntrude dont you dare tell her highness a falsehood it is not occupied you are saving it up for the arrival of the fivefifteen express from which you hope to pick up some fat armaments contractor who will drink all the bad champagne in your cellar at 5 francs a bottle and pay twice over for everything because he is in the same hotel with her highness and can boast of having turned her out of the best rooms  the manager but her highness was so gracious i did not know that her highness was at all particular  ermyntrude and you take advantage of her highnesss graciousness you impose on her with your stories you give her a room not fit for a dog you send cold tea to her by a decayed professional person disguised as a waiter but dont think you can trifle with me i am a ladys maid and i know the ladies maids and valets of all the aristocracies of europe and all the millionaires of america when i expose your hotel as the secondrate little hole it is not a soul above the rank of a curate with a large family will be seen entering it i shake its dust off my feet order the luggage to be taken down at once  the manager appealing to the princess can your highness believe this of me have i had the misfortune to offend your highness  the princess oh no i am quite satisfied please  ermyntrude is your highness dissatisfied with me  the princess intimidated oh no please dont think that i only meant  ermyntrude to the manager you hear perhaps you think her highness is going to do the work of teaching you your place herself instead of leaving it to her maid  the manager oh please mademoiselle believe me our only wish is to make you perfectly comfortable but in consequence of the war all royal personages now practise a rigid economy and desire us to treat them like their poorest subjects  the princess oh yes you are quite right  ermyntrude interrupting there her highness forgives you but dont do it again now go downstairs my good man and get that suite on the first floor ready for us and send some proper tea and turn on the heating apparatus until the temperature in the rooms is comfortably warm and have hot water put in all the bedrooms  the manager there are basins with hot and cold taps  ermyntrude scornfully yes there would be suppose we must put up with that sinks in our rooms and pipes that rattle and bang and guggle all over the house whenever anyone washes his hands i know  the manager gallant you are hard to please mademoiselle  ermyntrude no harder than other people but when im not pleased im not too ladylike to say so thats all the difference there is nothing more thank you  the manager shrugs his shoulders resignedly makes a deep bow to the princess goes to the door wafts a kiss surreptitiously to ermyntrude and goes out  the princess its wonderful how have you the courage  ermyntrude in your highnesss service i know no fear your highness can leave all unpleasant people to me  the princess how i wish i could the most dreadful thing of all i have to go through myself  ermyntrude dare i ask what it is your highness  the princess im going to be married im to be met here and married to a man i never saw a boy a boy who never saw me one of the sons of the inca of perusalem  ermyntrude indeed which son  the princess i dont know they havent settled which its a dreadful thing to be a princess they just marry you to anyone they like the inca is to come and look at me and pick out whichever of his sons he thinks will suit and then i shall be an alien enemy everywhere except in perusalem because the inca has made war on everybody and i shall have to pretend that everybody has made war on him its too bad  ermyntrude still a husband is a husband i wish i had one  the princess oh how can you say that im afraid youre not a nice woman  ermyntrude your highness is provided for im not  the princess even if you could bear to let a man touch you you shouldnt say so  ermyntrude i shall not say so again your highness except perhaps to the man  the princess its too dreadful to think of i wonder you can be so coarse i really dont think youll suit i feel sure now that you know more about men than you should  ermyntrude i am a widow your highness  the princess overwhelmed oh i beg your pardon of course i ought to have known you would not have spoken like that if you were not married that makes it all right doesnt it im so sorry  the manager returns white scared hardly able to speak  the manager your highness an officer asks to see you on behalf of the inca of perusalem  the princess rising distractedly oh i cant really oh what shall i do  the manager on important business he says your highness captain duval  ermyntrude duval nonsense the usual thing it is the inca himself incognito  the princess oh send him away oh im so afraid of the inca im not properly dressed to receive him and he is so particular he would order me to stay in my room for a week tell him to call tomorrow say im ill in bed i cant i wont i darent you must get rid of him somehow  ermyntrude leave him to me your highness  the princess youd never dare  ermyntrude i am an englishwoman your highness and perfectly capable of tackling ten incas if necessary i will arrange the matter to the manager show her highness to her bedroom and then show captain duval in here  the princess oh thank you so much she goes to the door ermyntrude noticing that she has left her hat and gloves on the table runs after her with them oh thank you and oh please if i must have one of his sons i should like a fair one that doesnt shave with soft hair and a beard i couldnt bear being kissed by a bristly person she runs out the manager bowing as she passes he follows her  ermyntrude whips off her waterproof hides it and gets herself swiftly into perfect trim at the mirror before the manager with a large jewel case in his hand returns ushering in the inca  the manager captain duval  the inca in military uniform advances with a marked and imposing stage walk stops orders the trembling manager by a gesture to place the jewel case on the table dismisses him with a frown touches his helmet graciously to ermyntrude and takes off his cloak  the inca i beg you madam to be quite at your ease and to speak to me without ceremony  ermyntrude moving haughtily and carelessly to the table i hadnt the slightest intention of treating you with ceremony she sits down a liberty which gives him a perceptible shock i am quite at a loss to imagine why i should treat a perfect stranger named duval a captain almost a subaltern with the smallest ceremony  the inca that is true i had for the moment forgotten my position  ermyntrude it doesnt matter you may sit down  the inca frowning what  ermyntrude i said youmaysitdown  the inca oh his moustache droops he sits down  ermyntrude what is your business  the inca i come on behalf of the inca of perusalem  ermyntrude the allerhochst  the inca precisely  ermyntrude i wonder does he feel ridiculous when people call him the allerhochst  the inca surprised why should he he is the allerhochst  ermyntrude is he nice looking  the inca ier eri ier i am not a good judge  ermyntrude they say he takes himself very seriously  the inca why should he not madam providence has entrusted to his family the care of a mighty empire he is in a position of half divine half paternal responsibility towards sixty millions of people whose duty it is to die for him at the word of command to take himself otherwise than seriously would be blasphemous it is a punishable offenceseverely punishablein perusalem it is called incadisparagement  ermyntrude how cheerful can he laugh  the inca certainly madam he laughs harshly and mirthlessly ha ha ha ha ha  ermyntrude frigidly i asked could the inca laugh i did not ask could you laugh  the inca that is true madam chuckling devilish amusing that he laughs genially and sincerely and becomes a much more agreeable person pardon me i am now laughing because i cannot help it i am amused the other was merely an imitation a failure i admit  ermyntrude you intimated that you had some business  the inca producing a very large jewel case and relapsing into solemnity i am instructed by the allerhochst to take a careful note of your features and figure and if i consider them satisfactory to present you with this trifling token of his imperial majestys regard i do consider them satisfactory allow me he opens the jewel case and presents it  ermyntrude staring at the contents what awful taste he must have i cant wear that  the inca reddening take care madam this brooch was designed by the inca himself allow me to explain the design in the centre the shield of arminius the ten surrounding medallions represent the ten castles of his majesty the rim is a piece of the telephone cable laid by his majesty across the shipskeel canal the pin is a model in miniature of the sword of henry the birdcatcher  ermyntrude miniature it must be bigger than the original my good man you dont expect me to wear this round my neck its as big as a turtle he shuts the case with an angry snap how much did it cost  the inca for materials and manufacture alone half a million perusalem dollars madam the incas design constitutes it a work of art as such it is now worth probably ten million dollars  ermyntrude give it to me she snatches it ill pawn it and buy something nice with the money  the inca impossible madam a design by the inca must not be exhibited for sale in the shop window of a pawnbroker he flings himself into his chair fuming  ermyntrude so much the better the inca will have to redeem it to save himself from that disgrace and the poor pawnbroker will get his money back nobody would buy it you know  the inca may i ask why  ermyntrudl well look at it just look at it i ask you  the inca his moustache drooping ominously i am sorry to have to report to the inca that you have no soul for fine art he rises sulkily the position of daughterinlaw to the inca is not compatible with the tastes of a pig he attempts to take back the brooch  ermyntrude rising and retreating behind her chair with the brooch here you let that brooch alone you presented it to me on behalf of the inca it is mine you said my appearance was satisfactory  the inca your appearance is not satisfactory the inca would not allow his son to marry you if the boy were on a desert island and you were the only other human being on it he strides up the room  ermyntrude calmly sitting down and replacing the case on the table how could he there would be no clergyman to marry us it would have to be quite morganatic  the inca returning such an expression is out of place in the mouth of a princess aspiring to the highest destiny on earth you have the morals of a dragoon she receives this with a shriek of laughter he struggles with his sense of humor at the same time he sits down there is a certain coarse fun in the idea which compels me to smile he turns up his moustache and smiles  ermyntrude when i marry the incas son captain i shall make the inca order you to cut off that moustache it is too irresistible doesnt it fascinate everyone in perusalem  the inca leaning forward to her energetically by all the thunders of thor madam it fascinates the whole world  ermyntrude what i like about you captain duval is your modesty  the inca straightening up suddenly woman do not be a fool  ermyntrude indignant well  the inca you must look facts in the face this moustache is an exact copy of the incas moustache well does the world occupy itself with the incas moustache or does it not does it ever occupy itself with anything else if that is the truth does its recognition constitute the inca a coxcomb other potentates have moustaches even beards and moustaches does the world occupy itself with those beards and moustaches do the hawkers in the streets of every capital on the civilized globe sell ingenious cardboard representations of their faces on which at the pulling of a simple string the moustaches turn up and down sohe makes his moustache turn up and down several times no i say no the incas moustache is so watched and studied that it has made his face the political barometer of the whole continent when that moustache goes up culture rises with it not what you call culture but kultur a word so much more significant that i hardly understand it myself except when i am in specially good form when it goes down millions of men perish  ermyntrude you know if i had a moustache like that it would turn my head i should go mad are you quite sure the inca isnt mad  the inca how can he be mad madam what is sanity the condition of the incas mind what is madness the condition of the people who disagree with the inca  ermyntrude then i am a lunatic because i dont like that ridiculous brooch  the inca no madam you are only an idiot  ermyntrude thank you  the inca mark you it is not to be expected that you should see eye to eye with the inca that would be presumption it is for you to accept without question or demur the assurance of your inca that the brooch is a masterpiece  ermyntrude my inca oh come i like that he is not my inca yet  the inca he is everybodys inca madam his realm will yet extend to the confines of the habitable earth it is his divine right and let those who dispute it look to themselves properly speaking all those who are now trying to shake his world predominance are not at war with him but in rebellion against him  ermyntrude well he started it you know  the inca madam be just when the hunters surround the lion the lion will spring the inca had kept the peace of years those who attacked him were steeped in blood black blood white blood brown blood yellow blood blue blood the inca had never shed a drop  ermyntrude he had only talked  the inca only talked only talked what is more glorious than talk can anyone in the world talk like him madam when he signed the declaration of war he said to his foolish generals and admirals gentlemen you will all be sorry for this and they are they know now that they had better have relied on the sword of the spirit in other words on their incas talk than on their murderous cannons the world will one day do justice to the inca as the man who kept the peace with nothing but his tongue and his moustache while he talked talked just as i am talking now to you simply quietly sensibly but greatly there was peace there was prosperity perusalem went from success to success he has been silenced for a year by the roar of trinitrotoluene and the bluster of fools and the world is in ruins what a tragedy he is convulsed with grief  ermyntrude captain duval i dont want to be unsympathetic but suppose we get back to business  the inca business what business  ermyntrude well my business you want me to marry one of the incas sons i forget which  the inca as far as i can recollect the name it is his imperial highness prince eitel william frederick george franz josef alexander nicholas victor emmanuel albert theodore wilson  ermyntrude interrupting oh please please maynt i have one with a shorter name what is he called at home  the inca he is usually called sonny madam with great charm of manner but you will please understand that the inca has no desire to pin you to any particular son there is chips and spots and lulu and pongo and the corsair and the piffler and jack johnson the second all unmarried at least not seriously married nothing in short that cannot be arranged they are all at your service  ermyntrude are they all as clever and charming as their father  the inca lifts his eyebrows pityingly shrugs his shoulders then with indulgent paternal contempt excellent lads madam very honest affectionate creatures i have nothing against them pongo imitates farmyard soundscock crowing and that sort of thingextremely well lulu plays strausss sinfonia domestica on the mouth organ really screamingly chips keeps owls and rabbits spots motor bicycles the corsair commands canal barges and steers them himself the piffler writes plays and paints most abominably jack johnson trims ladies hats and boxes with professionals hired for that purpose he is invariably victorious yes they all have their different little talents and also of course their family resemblances for example they all smoke they all quarrel with one another and they none of them appreciate their father who by the way is no mean painter though the piffler pretends to ridicule his efforts  ermyntrude quite a large choice eh  the inca but very little to choose believe me i should not recommend pongo because he snores so frightfully that it has been necessary to build him a soundproof bedroom otherwise the royal family would get no sleep but any of the others would suit equally wellif you are really bent on marrying one of them  ermyntrude if what is this i never wanted to marry one of them i thought you wanted me to  the inca i did madam but confidentially flattering her you are not quite the sort of person i expected you to be and i doubt whether any of these young degenerates would make you happy i trust i am not showing any want of natural feeling when i say that from the point of view of a lively accomplished and beautiful woman ermyntrude bows they might pall after a time i suggest that you might prefer the inca himself  ermyntrude oh captain how could a humble person like myself be of any interest to a prince who is surrounded with the ablest and most farreaching intellects in the world  tae inca explosively what on earth are you talking about madam can you name a single man in the entourage of the inca who is not a born fool  ermyntrude oh how can you say that there is admiral von cockpits  the inca rising intolerantly and striding about the room von cockpits madam if von cockpits ever goes to heaven before three weeks are over the angel gabriel will be at war with the man in the moon  ermyntrude but general von schinkenburg  the inca schinkenburg i grant you schinkenburg has a genius for defending market gardens among market gardens he is invincible but what is the good of that the world does not consist of market gardens turn him loose in pasture and he is lost the inca has defeated all these generals again and again at manoeuvres and yet he has to give place to them in the field because he would be blamed for every disasteraccused of sacrificing the country to his vanity vanity why do they call him vain just because he is one of the few men who are not afraid to live why do they call themselves brave because they have not sense enough to be afraid to die within the last year the world has produced millions of heroes has it produced more than one inca he resumes his seat  ermyntrude fortunately not captain id rather marry chips  the inca making a wry face chips oh no i wouldnt marry chips  ermyntrude why  the inca whispering the secret chips talks too much about himself  ermyntrude well what about snooks  the inca snooks who is he have i a son named snooks there are so manywearily so manythat i often forget casually but i wouldnt marry him anyhow if i were you  ermyntrude but hasnt any of them inherited the family genius surely if providence has entrusted them with the care of perusalemif they are all descended from bedrock the great  the inca interrupting her impatiently madam if you ask me i consider bedrock a grossly overrated monarch  ermyntrude shocked oh captain take care incadisparagement  the inca i repeat grossly overrated strictly between ourselves i do not believe all this about providence entrusting the care of sixty million human beings to the abilities of chips and the piffler and jack johnson i believe in individual genius that is the incas secret it must be why hang it all madam if it were a mere family matter the incas uncle would have been as great a man as the inca andwell everybody knows what the incas uncle was  ermyntrude my experience is that the relatives of men of genius are always the greatest duffers imaginable  the inca precisely that is what proves that the inca is a man of genius his relatives are duffers  ermyntrude but bless my soul captain if all the incas generals are incapables and all his relatives duffers perusalem will be beaten in the war and then it will become a republic like france after 1871 and the inca will be sent to st helena  the inca triumphantly that is just what the inca is playing for madam it is why he consented to the war  ermyntrude what  the inca aha the fools talk of crushing the inca but they little know their man tell me this why did st helena extinguish napoleon  ermyntrude i give it up  the inca because madam with certain rather remarkable qualities which i should be the last to deny napoleon lacked versatility after all any fool can be a soldier we know that only too well in perusalem where every fool is a soldier but the inca has a thousand other resources he is an architect well st helena presents an unlimited field to the architect he is a painter need i remind you that st helena is still without a national gallery he is a composer napoleon left no symphonies in st helena send the inca to st helena madam and the world will crowd thither to see his works as they crowd now to athens to see the acropolis to madrid to see the pictures of velasquez to bayreuth to see the music dramas of that egotistical old rebel richard wagner who ought to have been shot before he was forty as indeed he very nearly was take this from me hereditary monarchs are played out the age for men of genius has come the career is open to the talents before ten years have elapsed every civilized country from the carpathians to the rocky mountains will be a republic  ermyntrude then goodbye to the inca  the inca on the contrary madam the inca will then have his first real chance he will be unanimously invited by those republics to return from his exile and act as superpresident of all the republics  ermyntrude but wont that be a comedown for him think of it after being inca to be a mere president  the inca well why not an inca can do nothing he is tied hand and foot a constitutional monarch is openly called an indiarubber stamp an emperor is a puppet the inca is not allowed to make a speech he is compelled to take up a screed of flatulent twaddle written by some noodle of a minister and read it aloud but look at the american president he is the allerhochst if you like no madam believe me there is nothing like democracy american democracy give the people voting papers good long voting papers american fashion and while the people are reading the voting papers the government does what it likes  ermyntrude what you too worship before the statue of liberty like the americans  the inca not at all madam the americans do not worship the statue of liberty they have erected it in the proper place for a statue of liberty on its tomb he turns down his moustaches  ermyntrude laughing oh youd better not let them hear you say that captain  the inca quite safe madam they would take it as a joke he rises and now prepare yourself for a surprise she rises a shock brace yourself steel yourself and do not be afraid  ermyntrude whatever on earth can you be going to tell me captain  the inca madam i am no captain i  ermyntrude you are the inca in disguise  the inca good heavens how do you know that who has betrayed me  ermyntrude how could i help divining it sir who is there in the world like you your magnetism  the inca true i had forgotten my magnetism but you know now that beneath the trappings of imperial majesty there is a man simple frank modest unaffected colloquial a sincere friend a natural human being a genial comrade one eminently calculated to make a woman happy you on the other hand are the most charming woman i have ever met your conversation is wonderful i have sat here almost in silence listening to your shrewd and penetrating account of my character my motives if i may say so my talents never has such justice been done me never have i experienced such perfect sympathy will youi hardly know how to put thiswill you be mine  ermyntrude oh sir you are married  the inca i am prepared to embrace the mahometan faith which allows a man four wives if you will consent it will please the turks but i had rather you did not mention it to the incaess if you dont mind  ermyntrude this is really charming of you but the time has come for me to make a revelation it is your imperial majestys turn now to brace yourself to steel yourself i am not the princess i am  the inca the daughter of my old friend archdeacon daffodil donkin whose sermons are read to me every evening after dinner i never forget a face  ermyntrude you knew all along  the inca bitterly throwing himself into his chair and you supposed that i who have been condemned to the society of princesses all my wretched life believed for a moment that any princess that ever walked could have your intelligence  ermyntrude how clever of you sir but you cannot afford to marry me  the inca springing up why not  ermyntrude you are too poor you have to eat war bread kings nowadays belong to the poorer classes the king of england does not even allow himself wine at dinner  the inca delighted haw ha ha haw haw he is convulsed with laughter and finally has to relieve his feelings by waltzing half round the room  ermyntrude you may laugh sir but i really could not live in that style i am the widow of a millionaire ruined by your little war  the inca a millionaire what are millionaires now with the world crumbling  ermyntrude excuse me mine was a hyphenated millionaire  the inca a highfalutin millionaire you mean chuckling haw ha ha really very nearly a pun that he sits down in her chair  ermyntrude revolted sinking into his chair i think it quite the worst pun i ever heard  the inca the best puns have all been made years ago nothing remained but to achieve the worst however madam he rises majestically and she is about to rise also no i prefer a seated audience she falls back into her seat at the imperious wave of his hand so he clicks his heels madam i recognize my presumption in having sought the honor of your hand as you say i cannot afford it victorious as i am i am hopelessly bankrupt and the worst of it is i am intelligent enough to know it and i shall be beaten in consequence because my most implacable enemy though only a few months further away from bankruptcy than myself has not a ray of intelligence and will go on fighting until civilization is destroyed unless i out of sheer pity for the world condescend to capitulate  ermyntrude the sooner the better sir many fine young men are dying while you wait  the inca flinching painfully why why do they do it  ermyntrude because you make them  the inca stuff how can i i am only one man and they are millions do you suppose they would really kill each other if they didnt want to merely for the sake of my beautiful eyes do not be deceived by newspaper claptrap madam i was swept away by a passion not my own which imposed itself on me by myself i am nothing i dare not walk down the principal street of my own capital in a coat two years old though the sweeper of that street can wear one ten years old you talk of death as an unpopular thing you are wrong for years i gave them art literature science prosperity that they might live more abundantly and they hated me ridiculed me caricatured me now that i give them death in its frightfullest forms they are devoted to me if you doubt me ask those who for years have begged our taxpayers in vain for a few paltry thousands to spend on life on the bodies and minds of the nations children on the beauty and healthfulness of its cities on the honor and comfort of its wornout workers they refused and because they refused death is let loose on them they grudged a few hundreds a year for their salvation they now pay millions a day for their own destruction and damnation and this they call my doing let them say it if they dare before the judgmentseat at which they and i shall answer at last for what we have left undone no less than for what we have done pulling himself together suddenly madam i have the honor to be your most obedient he clicks his heels and bows  ermyntrude sir she curtsies  the inca turning at the door oh by the way there is a princess isnt there somewhere on the premises  ermyntrude there is shall i fetch her  the inca dubious pretty awful i suppose eh  ermyntrude about the usual thing  the inca sighing ah well what can one expect i dont think i need trouble her personally will you explain to her about the boys  ermyntrude i am afraid the explanation will fall rather flat without your magnetism  the inca returning to her and speaking very humanly you are making fun of me why does everybody make fun of me is it fair  ermyntrude seriously yes it is fair what other defence have we poor common people against your shining armor your mailed fist your pomp and parade your terrible power over us are these things fair  the inca ah well perhaps perhaps he looks at his watch by the way there is time for a drive round the town and a cup of tea at the zoo quite a bearable band there it does not play any patriotic airs i am sorry you will not listen to any more permanent arrangement but if you would care to come  ermyntrude eagerly ratherrrrrr i shall be delighted  the inca cautiously in the strictest honor you understand  ermyntrude dont be afraid i promise to refuse any incorrect proposals  the inca enchanted oh charming woman how well you understand men  he offers her his arm they go out together
