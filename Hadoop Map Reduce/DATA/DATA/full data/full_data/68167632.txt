68167632	write it right  a little blacklist of literary faults  by ambrose bierce  1909     aims and the plan  the authors main purpose in this book is to teach precision in writing and of good writing which essentially is clear thinking made visible precision is the point of capital concern it is attained by choice of the word that accurately and adequately expresses what the writer has in mind and by exclusion of that which either denotes or connotes something else as quintilian puts it the writer should so write that his reader not only may but must understand  few words have more than one literal and serviceable meaning however many metaphorical derivative related or even unrelated meanings lexicographers may think it worth while to gather from all sorts and conditions of men with which to bloat their absurd and misleading dictionaries this actual and serviceable meaningnot always determined by derivation and seldom by popular usageis the one affirmed according to his light by the author of this little manual of solecisms narrow etymons of the mere scholar and loose locutions of the ignorant are alike denied a standing  the plan of the book is more illustrative than expository the aim being to use the terms of etymology and syntax as little as is compatible with clarity familiar example being more easily apprehended than technical precept when both are employed the precept is commonly given after the example has prepared the student to apply it not only to the matter in mind but to similar matters not mentioned everything in quotation marks is to be understood as disapproved  not all locutions blacklisted herein are always to be reprobated as universal outlaws excepting in the case of capital offendersexpressions ancestrally vulgar or irreclaimably degenerateabsolute proscription is possible as to serious composition only in other forms the writer must rely on his sense of values and the fitness of things while it is true that some colloquialisms and with less of license even some slang may be sparingly employed in light literature for point piquancy or any of the purposes of the skilled writer sensible to the necessity and charm of keeping at least one foot on the ground to others the virtue of restraint may be commended as distinctly superior to the joy of indulgence  precision is much but not all some words and phrases are disallowed on the ground of taste as there are neither standards nor arbiters of taste the book can do little more than reflect that of its author who is far indeed from professing impeccability in neither taste nor precision is any mans practice a court of last appeal for writers all both great and small are habitual sinners against the light and their accuser is cheerfully aware that his own work will supply as in making this book it has supplied many awful exampleshis later work less abundantly he hopes than his earlier he nevertheless believes that this does not disqualify him for showing by other instances than his own how not to write the infallible teacher is still in the forest primeval throwing seeds to the white blackbirds  ab     the blacklist  a for
